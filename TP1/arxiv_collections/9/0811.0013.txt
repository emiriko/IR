We study transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas, placed in a
classically strong perpendicular magnetic field and in constant and oscillating
in-plane electric fields. The analysis is based on a quantum Boltzmann equation
derived for a weakly disordered two-dimensional electron gas. We consider
disordered potential with both long and short range correlations. Electron
scattering off such disorder is not limited to small change in momentum
direction, but occurs on an arbitrary angle, including the backscattering. The
non-linearity of the transport in the considered system is a consequence of two
co-existing effects: formation of a non-equilibrium distribution function of
electrons and modification of the scattering rate off the disorder in the
presence of dc and ac electric fields. This work describes both effects in a
unified way. The calculated dissipative component of electric current
oscillates as a function of the electric field strength and frequency of
microwave radiation in a qualitative agreement with experiments.
