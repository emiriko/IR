We searched for the neutrino-less double beta decay(0nbb) of 48Ca by using
CaF2(Eu) scintillators. Analysis of their pulse shapes was effective to reduce
backgrounds. No events are observed in the Q-value region for the data of 3394
kg days. It gives a lower limit (90% confidence level) of T > 2.7 x 10^22 year
for the half life of 0nbb of 48Ca. Combined with our previous data for 1553 kg
days, we obtained more stringent limit of T > 5.8 x 10^22 year.
