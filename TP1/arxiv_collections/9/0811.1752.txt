Latest results from a study of baryon ground and resonant states within
relativistic constituent quark models are reported. After recalling some
typical spectral properties, the description of ground states, especially with
regard to the nucleon and hyperon electromagnetic structures, is addressed. In
the following, recent covariant predictions for pion, eta, and kaon partial
decay widths of light and strange baryon resonances below 2 GeV are summarized.
These results exhibit a characteristic pattern that is distinct from
nonrelativistic or relativized decay studies performed so far. Together with a
detailed analysis of the spin, flavor, and spatial structures of the wave
functions, it supports a new and extended classification scheme of baryon
ground and resonant states into SU(3) flavor multiplets.
