We derive solutions of the Kirchhoff equations for a knot tied on an
infinitely long elastic rod subjected to combined tension and twist. We
consider the case of simple (trefoil) and double (cinquefoil) knots; other knot
topologies can be investigated similarly. The rod model is based on Hookean
elasticity but is geometrically non-linear. The problem is formulated as a
non-linear self-contact problem with unknown contact regions. It is solved by
means of matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of a loose knot. Without
any a priori assumption, we derive the topology of the contact set, which
consists of an interval of contact flanked by two isolated points of contacts.
We study the influence of the applied twist on the equilibrium.
