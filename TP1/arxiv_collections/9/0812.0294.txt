Among other roles the LHC will play a role of the top "factory" and it will
give us unique possibility to study new physics signatures in different ways.
Many scenarios of new physics allow top quark FCNC decays. Using most general
model independent Lagrangian of new physics we investigate possible
experimental signals of new physics in t --> c(u) l+ l- FCNC top decays. We
find that measurement of two possible asymmetries might give very important and
interesting information of NP. It is particularly interesting to use them to
discriminate among variety on NP scenarios. We consider also contributions of
the interference between scalar and vector mediators of the FCNC decays.
