The Husain-Kuchar theory is a four-dimensional background-independent model
that has long been viewed as a useful model for addressing several conceptual
and technical problems appearing in the quantization of general relativity
mainly in the loop quantum gravity approach. The model was defined at
Lagrangian level in terms of a su(2)-valued connection one-form $A$ coupled
through its curvature to a su(2)-valued one-form field $e$. We address here the
problem of writing a Lagrangian formulation for the Husain-Kuchar model as a
constrained BF theory motivated by the fact that spin foam models for quantum
gravity are related to action principles of the BF type. The Lagrangian action
principle for the Husain-Kuchar model reported here differs from a previous one
found by Barbero et al in that this description involves a single constrained
BF theory rather than two interacting BF theories. It is, essentially, the
Plebanski action with the condition on the trace of the Lagrange multipliers
removed. Moreover, it can be stated that the relationship between our BF-like
action and the original one for the Husain-Kuchar model is the same
relationship that exists between the Plebanski action and the self-dual
Palatini action for complex general relativity, first because the solution to
the constraint on the two-forms $\Sigma^i$ coming from the BF-like action leads
to the Husain-Kuchar action, and second because the Hamiltonian analysis of the
Husain-Kuchar model is straightforward starting from the BF-like action
principle.
