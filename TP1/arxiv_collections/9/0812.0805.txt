The extraction of membrane tubes by molecular motors is known to play an
important role for the transport properties of eukaryotic cells. By studying a
generic class of models for the tube extraction, we discover a rich phase
diagram. In particular we show that the density of motors along the tube can
exhibit shocks, inverse shocks and plateaux, depending on parameters which
could in principle be probed experimentally. In addition the phase diagram
exhibits interesting reentrant behavior.
