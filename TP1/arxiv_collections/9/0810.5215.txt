Magnetic-glass is a recently identified phenomenon in various classes of
magnetic systems undergoing a first order magnetic phase transition. We shall
highlight here a few experimentally determined characteristics of
magnetic-glass and the relevant set of experiments, which will enable to
distinguish a magnetic-glass unequivocally from the well known phenomena of
spin-glass and reentrant spin-glass.
