In the one-way model of quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented
using only measurements on an entangled initial state. Much of the hard work is
done up-front when creating this universal resource, known as a cluster state,
on which the measurements are made. Here we detail a new proposal for a
scalable method of creating cluster states using only a single multimode
optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The method generates a continuous-variable
cluster state that is universal for quantum computation and encoded in the
quadratures of the optical frequency comb of the OPO. This work expands on the
presentation in Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130501 (2008).
