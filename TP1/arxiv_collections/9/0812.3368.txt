We use the $\rho\Delta$ interaction in the hidden gauge formalism to
dynamically generate $N^{\ast}$ and $\Delta^{\ast}$ resonances. We show,
through a comparison of the results from this analysis and from a quark model
study with data, that the $\Delta_{5/2^{-}}(1930),$ $\Delta_{3/2^{-}}(1940)$
and $\Delta_{1/2^{-}}(1900)$ resonances can be assigned to $\rho\Delta$ bound
states. More precisely the $\Delta_{5/2^{-}}(1930)$ can be interpreted as a
$\rho\Delta$ bound state whereas the $\Delta_{3/2^{-}}(1940)$ and
$\Delta_{1/2^{-}}(1900)$ may contain an important $\rho\Delta$ component. This
interpretation allows for a solution of a long-standing puzzle concerning the
description of these resonances in constituent quark models. In addition we
also obtain degenerate $J^{P}=1/2^{-},3/2^{-},5/2^{-}$ $N^{*}$ states but their
assignment to experimental resonances is more uncertain.
