We have noted that the electron spectrum of muon decay in the leading
logarithmic approximation calculated in two lowest orders of the perturbation
theory in the paper of Berman (1958), can be reproduced by the parton language.
This fact permits one to generalize the result to all orders of the
perturbation theory using the structure function method.
