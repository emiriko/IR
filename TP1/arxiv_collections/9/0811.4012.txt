This paper describes the experimental studies of the formation of
nano-diamonds during detonation of TNT/RDX 50/50 mixture with small-angle x-ray
scattering (SAXS) method at a synchrotron radiation beam on VEPP-3 accelerator.
  A new experimental method with introduction of nano-diamonds into the
explosive has been applied. Inclusion of the diamonds obtained after detonation
into the TNT and RDX explosives allows modelling of the case of instant
creation of nano-diamonds during detonation.
