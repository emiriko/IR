Multiple avalanches, initiated by simultaneously toppling neighbouring sites,
are studied in three different directed sandpile models. It is argued that,
while the single avalanche exponents are different for the three models, a
suitably defined two-avalanche distribution has identical exponents. The origin
of this universality is traced to particle conservation.
