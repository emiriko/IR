The spin-glass transition in external magnetic field is studied both in and
out of the limit of validity of mean-field theory on a diluted one dimensional
chain of Ising spins where exchange bonds occur with a probability decaying as
the inverse power of the distance. Varying the power in this long-range model
corresponds, in a one-to-one relationship, to change the dimension in
spin-glass short-range models. Evidence for a spin-glass transition in magnetic
field is found also for systems whose equivalent dimension is below the upper
critical dimension at zero magnetic field.
