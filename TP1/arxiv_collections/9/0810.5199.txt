The manifestly Lorentz covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics
disregards Coulomb instantaneous interaction and its consequence -
instantaneous bound states (IBS's). In this article we consider the way of
construction the IBS generating functional using the operator generalization of
the initial data in the Dirac Hamiltonian approach to QED.
