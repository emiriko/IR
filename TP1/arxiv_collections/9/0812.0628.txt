The $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ pseudoscalar mixing angle and the gluonium content
of the $\eta^\prime$ meson are deduced from an updated phenomenological
analysis of $V\to P\gamma$ and $J/\psi\to VP$ decays. In absence of gluonium,
the value of the mixing angle in the quark-flavour basis is found to be
$\phi_P=(41.5\pm 1.2)^\circ$ from $V\to P\gamma$ and $\phi_P=(40.5\pm
2.4)^\circ$ from $J/\psi\to VP$. In presence of gluonium, the values for the
mixing angle and the gluonic content of the $\eta^\prime$ wave function are
$\phi_P=(41.4\pm 1.3)^\circ$ and $Z^2_{\eta^\prime}=0.04\pm 0.09$ from $V\to
P\gamma$ and $\phi_P=(44.5\pm 4.3)^\circ$ and $Z^2_{\eta^\prime}=0.28\pm 0.21$
from $J/\psi\to VP$, respectively.
