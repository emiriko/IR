Using the example of Zn-doped La2CuO4, we demonstrate that a spinless
impurity doped into a non-frustrated antiferromagnet can induce substantial
frustrating interactions among the spins surrounding it. This counterintuitive
result is the key to resolving discrepancies between experimental data and
earlier theories. Analytic and quantum Monte Carlo studies of the
impurity-induced frustration are in a close accord with each other and
experiments. The mechanism proposed here should be common to other correlated
oxides as well.
