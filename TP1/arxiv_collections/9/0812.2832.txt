Heavy, as yet undiscovered particles, can affect measurements of CP violation
in the B system. Measuring CP violation in the Bs system provides an excellent
place to observe such effects since Standard Model sources are predicted to
produce very small effects. The angle -2beta_s, the "phase of Bs-\bar{B}s
mixing," thought to be best measured in Bs -> J/psi\phi decays is of order
-0.04, while the CP violating asymmetry in Bs -> \phi\phi is predicted to be
zero, due to the cancellation of the mixing phase with the decay phase. Recent
measurements of \beta_s in J/psi\phi, while not definitive, are much larger
than the Standard Model predictions. Measurements in the B^o and Ds+ systems of
analogous modes point toward a 5-10% contamination of S-wave K+K- under the
\phi peak. This S-wave was not taken into account in these recent analyses.
Furthermore this S-wave can also materialize as a f0(980) meson that decays to
\pi+\pi-, making the final state J/psi f0 useful for measuring \beta_s with the
added advantage of not requiring an angular analysis. Rate estimates, while not
precise, predict four to five times fewer such events than those in the
J/psi\phi mode. The error on \beta_s, however, may be similar. We also remark
on S-wave problems with the Bs -> \phi\phi mode, and possible systematic checks
using Bs -> \phi f0.
