In search for a dynamical description of Q7-branes, which were known as
solutions of supergravity equations and then conjectured to be dynamical
objects of type IIB string theory, we study the superembedding description of
7-branes in curved type IIB supergravity superspace. With quite minimal and
natural assumptions we have found that there is no place for Q7-branes as
dynamical branes in superembedding approach. Our study might give implications
for the old-standing problem of the covariant and supersymmetric description of
multiple Dp-brane systems.
