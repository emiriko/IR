The Automated Protein Structure Analysis (APSA) method is used for the
classification of supersecondary structures. Basis for the classification is
the encoding of three-dimensional (3D) residue conformations into a 16-letter
code (3D-1D projection). It is shown that the letter code of the protein makes
it possible to reconstruct its overall shape without ambiguity (1D-3D
translation). Accordingly, the letter code is used for the development of
classification rules that distinguish supersecondary structures by the
properties of their turns and the orientation of the flanking helix or strand
structures. The orientations of turn and flanking structures are collected in
an octant system that helps to specify 196 supersecondary groups for
(alpha,alpha)-, (alpha,beta)-, (beta,alpha)-, (beta,beta)-class. 391 protein
chains leading to 2499 super secondary structures were analyzed. Frequently
occurring super secondary structures are identified with the help of the octant
classification system and explained on the basis of their letter and
classification codes.
