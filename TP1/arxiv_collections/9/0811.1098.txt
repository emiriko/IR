Vanadium sesquioxide, V2O3, boasts a rich phase diagram whose description
necessitates the accounting for many-body Coulomb correlations. Spectral
properties of this compound have been successfully addressed within dynamical
mean field theory to an extent that results of recent angle resolved
photoemission experiments have been correctly predicted. While photoemission
spectroscopy probes the occupied part of the one-particle spectrum, optical
experiments measure transitions into empty states and thus provide
complementary information. In this work, we focus on the optical properties of
V2O3 in its paramagnetic phases by employing our recently developed
"generalized Peierls approach". Compared to experiments, we obtain results in
overall satisfactory agreement. Further, we rationalize that the experimentally
observed temperature dependence stems from the different coherence scales of
the involved charge carriers.
