We adress the maximization problem of expected utility from terminal wealth.
The special feature of this paper is that we consider a financial market where
the price process of risky assets can have a default time. Using dynamic
programming, we characterize the value function with a backward stochastic
differential equation and the optimal portfolio policies. We separately treat
the cases of exponential, power and logarithmic utility.
