From dedicated QCD studies to new physics background estimation, jets will be
everywhere at the LHC. In these proceedings, we discuss two important recent
series of improvements.
  In the first one, we introduce new algorithms and new implementations of
previously existing algorithms, in order to cure limitations of their
predecessors and to satisfy fundamental requirements.
  In the second part, we show that it is of prime importance to carefully
choose the jet definition (algorithm and parameters) to optimise kinematic
reconstructions at the LHC. Noticeably, we show that while at scales around 100
GeV, R~0.5 is an appropriate choice, clustering at the TeV scale requires R~1
for optimal efficiency. We finally show that our results are valid in the
presence of pileup, provided that a subtraction procedure is applied.
