The pressure components of "soft" disks in a two dimensional narrow channel
are analyzed in the dilute gas regime using the Mayer cluster expansion and
molecular dynamics. Channels with either periodic or reflecting boundaries are
considered. It is found that when the two-body potential, u(r), is singular at
some distance r_0, the dependence of the pressure components on the channel
width exhibits a singularity at one or more channel widths which are simply
related to r_0. In channels with periodic boundary conditions and for
potentials which are discontinuous at r_0, the transverse and longitudinal
pressure components exhibit a 1/2 and 3/2 singularity, respectively. Continuous
potentials with a power law singularity result in weaker singularities of the
pressure components. In channels with reflecting boundary conditions the
singularities are found to be weaker than those corresponding to periodic
boundaries.
