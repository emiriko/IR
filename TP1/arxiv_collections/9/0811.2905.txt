The main idea in the original Grover search (Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 325 (1997))
is to single out a target state containing the solution to a search problem by
amplifying the amplitude of the state, following the Oracle's job, i.e., a
black box giving us information about the target state. We design quantum
circuits to accomplish a complete Grover search involving both the Oracle's job
and the amplification of the target state, which are employed to solve
Satisfiability (SAT) problems. We explore how to carry out the quantum circuits
by currently available ion-trap quantum computing technology.
