We describe the late-time acceleration of the Universe within the paradigm of
the brane-world scenario. More precisely, we show how a phantom-like behaviour
or a crossing of the cosmological constant line can be achieved safely in a
dilatonic brane-world model with an induced gravity term on the brane. The
brane tension plays the role of dark energy which is coupled to the dilaton
bulk scalar field. The phantom mimicry as well as the crossing of the
cosmological constant line are achieved without invoking any phantom matter
either on the brane or in the bulk.
