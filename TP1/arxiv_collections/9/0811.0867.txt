In a variety of biological situations, swimming cells have to move through
complex fluids. Similarly, mucociliary clearance involves the transport of
polymeric fluids by beating cilia. Here, we consider the extent to which
complex fluids could be exploited for force generation on small scales. We
consider a prototypical reciprocal motion (i.e. identical under time-reversal
symmetry): The periodic flapping of a tethered semi-infinite plane. In the
Newtonian limit, such motion cannot be used for force generation according to
Purcell's scallop theorem. In a polymeric fluid (Oldroyd-B, and its
generalization), we show that this is not the case and calculate explicitly the
forces on the flapper for small-amplitude sinusoidal motion. Three setups are
considered: a flapper near a wall, a flapper in a wedge, and a two-dimensional
scallop-like flapper. In all cases, we show that at quadratic order in the
oscillation amplitude, the tethered flapping motion induces net forces but no
average flow. Our results demonstrate therefore that the scallop theorem is not
valid in polymeric fluids. The reciprocal component of the movement of
biological appendages such as cilia can thus generate nontrivial forces in
polymeric fluid such as mucus, and normal-stress differences can be exploited
as a pure viscoelastic force generation and propulsion method.
