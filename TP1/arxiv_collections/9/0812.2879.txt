End users of recent biomedical information systems are often unaware of the
storage structure and access mechanisms of the underlying data sources and can
require simplified mechanisms for writing domain specific complex queries. This
research aims to assist users and their applications in formulating queries
without requiring complete knowledge of the information structure of underlying
data sources. To achieve this, query reformulation techniques and algorithms
have been developed that can interpret ontology-based search criteria and
associated domain knowledge in order to reformulate a relational query. These
query reformulation algorithms exploit the semantic relationships and assertion
capabilities of OWL-DL based domain ontologies for query reformulation. In this
paper, this approach is applied to the integrated database schema of the EU
funded Health-e-Child (HeC) project with the aim of providing ontology assisted
query reformulation techniques to simplify the global access that is needed to
millions of medical records across the UK and Europe.
