A dissipation rate, which grows faster than any power of the wave number in
Fourier space, may be scaled to lead a hydrodynamic system {\it actually} or
{\it potentially} converge to its Galerkin truncation. Actual convergence we
name for the asymptotic truncation at a finite wavenumber $k_G$ above which
modes have no dynamics; and, we define potential convergence for the truncation
at $k_G$ which, however, grows without bound. Both types of convergence can be
obtained with the dissipation rate $\mu[cosh(k/k_c)-1]$ who behaves as $k^2$
(newtonian) and $\exp\{k/k_c\}$ for small and large $k/k_c$ respectively.
Competition physics of cascade, thermalization and dissipation are discussed
with numerical Navier-Stokes turbulence, emphasizing on the intermittency
growth.
