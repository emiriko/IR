Conformal self-dual fields in flat space-time of even dimension greater than
or equal to four are studied. Ordinary-derivative formulation of such fields is
developed. Gauge invariant Lagrangian with conventional kinetic terms and
corresponding gauge transformations are obtained. Gauge symmetries are realized
by involving the Stueckelberg fields. Realization of global conformal
symmetries is obtained. Light-cone gauge Lagrangian is found. Also, we
demonstrate use of the light-cone gauge for counting of on-shell degrees of
freedom of the conformal self-dual fields.
