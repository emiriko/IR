An optical measurement of the 2S hyperfine interval in atomic hydrogen using
two-photon spectroscopy of the 1S-2S transition gives a value of 177 556
834.3(6.7) Hz. The uncertainty is
  2.4 times smaller than achieved by our group in 2003 and more than 4 times
smaller than for any independent radio-frequency measurement. The specific
combination of the 2S and 1S hyperfine intervals predicted by QED theory
$D_{21}=8 f_{\rm HFS}({2S}) - f_{\rm HFS}({1S})=48 953(3)$ Hz is in good
agreement with the value of 48 923(54) Hz obtained from this experiment.
