In the present paper, we work out the eigenfunctions of spinless particles
bound in a one-dimensional linear finite range, attractive potential well,
treating it as a time-like component of a four-vector. We show that the
one-dimensional stationary Klein-Gordon equation is reduced to a standard
differential equation, whose solutions, consistent with the boundary
conditions, are the parabolic cylinder functions, which further reduce to the
well-known confluent hypergeometric functions.
