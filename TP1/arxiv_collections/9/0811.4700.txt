This paper deals with public-key steganography in the presence of a passive
warden. The aim is to hide secret messages within cover-documents without
making the warden suspicious, and without any preliminar secret key sharing.
Whereas a practical attempt has been already done to provide a solution to this
problem, it suffers of poor flexibility (since embedding and decoding steps
highly depend on cover-signals statistics) and of little capacity compared to
recent data hiding techniques. Using the same framework, this paper explores
the use of trellis-coded quantization techniques (TCQ and turbo TCQ) to design
a more efficient public-key scheme. Experiments on audio signals show great
improvements considering Cachin's security criterion.
