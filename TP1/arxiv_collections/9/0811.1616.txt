We have developed a numerical procedure to clarify the critical behavior near
a quantum phase transition by analyzing a multi-point correlation function
characterizing the ground state. This work presents a successful application of
this procedure to the string order parameter of the S = 1 XXZ chain with
uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. The finite-size string correlation function is
estimated by the density matrix renormalization group method. We focus on the
gradient of the inversedsystem- size dependence of the correlation function on
a logarithmic plot. This quantity shows that the finite-size scaling
sensitively changes at the critical point. The behavior of the gradient with
increasing system size is divergent, stable at a finite value, or rapidly
decreases to zero when the system is in the disordered phase, at the critical
point, or in the ordered phase, respectively. The analysis of the finite-size
string correlation functions allows precise determination of the boundary of
the Haldane phase and estimation of the critical exponent of the correlation
length. Our estimates of the transition point and the critical exponents, which
are determined only by the ground-state quantities, are consistent with results
obtained from the analysis of the energy-level structure. Our analysis requires
only the correlation functions of several finite sizes under the same condition
as a candidate for the long-range order. The quantity is treated in the same
manner irrespective of the kind of elements which destroy the order concerned.
This work will assist in the development of a method to directly observe
quantum phase transitions.
