Nonlinear Schrodinger / Gross-Pitaevskii equations play a central role in the
understanding of nonlinear optical and macroscopic quantum systems. The large
time dynamics of such systems is governed by interactions of the nonlinear
ground state manifold, discrete neutral modes (``excited states'') and
dispersive radiation. Systems with symmetry, in spatial dimensions larger than
one, typically have degenerate neutral modes. Thus, we study the large time
dynamics of systems with degenerate neutral modes. This requires a new normal
form (nonlinear matrix Fermi Golden Rule) governing the system's large time
asymptotic relaxation to the ground state (soliton) manifold.
