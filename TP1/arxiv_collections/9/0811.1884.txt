We consider quantum decay and photofragmentation processes in open chaotic
systems in the semiclassical limit. We devise a semiclassical approach which
allows us to consistently calculate quantum corrections to the classical decay
to high order in an expansion in the inverse Heisenberg time. We present
results for systems with and without time reversal symmetry and also for the
symplectic case, as well as extending recent results to non-localized initial
states. We further analyze related photodissociation and photoionization
phenomena and semiclassically compute cross-section correlations, including
their Ehrenfest time dependence.
