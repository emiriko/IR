Approaches to scientific journal publishing that provide free access to all
readers are challenging the standard subscription-based model. But in domains
that have a well-functioning system of publicly accessible preprint
repositories like arXiv, Open Access is already effectively available. In
physics, such repositories have long coexisted constructively with refereed,
subscription based journals. Trying to replace this by a system based on
journals whose revenue is derived primarily from fees charged to authors is
unlikely to provide a better guarantee of Open Access, and may be in conflict
with the maintenance of high quality standards.
