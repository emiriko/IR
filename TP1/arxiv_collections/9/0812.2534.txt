A local Hawking temperature was recently derived for any future outer
trapping horizon in spherical symmetry, using a Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling
method, and is given by a dynamical surface gravity as defined geometrically.
Descriptions are given of the operational meaning of the temperature, in terms
of what observers measure, and its relation to the usual Hawking temperature
for static black holes. Implications for the final fate of an evaporating black
hole are discussed.
