The purpose of this paper is to extend the Green-Naghdi-Rivlin balance of
energy method to continua with microstructure. The key idea is to replace the
group of Galilean transformations with the group of diffeomorphisms of the
ambient space. A key advantage is that one obtains in a natural way all the
needed balance laws on both the macro and micro levels along with two
Doyle-Erickson formulas.
