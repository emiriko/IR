We report the results of a search for $Z(4430)^-$ decay to $J/\psi\pi^-$ or
$\psi(2S)\pi^-$ in $B^{-,0}\to \jpsi\pi^- K^{0,+}$ and $B^{-,0}\to \psitwos
\pi^- K^{0,+}$ decays. The data were collected with the BABAR detector at the
SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider operating at center of mass
energy 10.58 \gev, and the sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
413 fb$^{-1}$. Each $K\pi$ mass distribution exhibits clear $K^{\ast}(892)$ and
$K^{\ast}_2(1430)$ signals, and the efficiency-corrected spectrum is
well-described by a superposition of the associated Breit-Wigner intensity
distributions, together with an $S$-wave contribution obtained from the LASS
$I=1/2$ $K\pi$ scattering amplitude measurements. Each $K\pi$ angular
distribution varies significantly in structure with $K\pi$ mass, and is
represented in terms of low-order Legendre polynomial moments. We find that
each $J/\psi\pi$ or $\psi(2S)\pi$ mass distribution is well-described by the
reflection of the measured $K\pi$ mass and angular distribution structures. We
see no significant evidence for a $Z(4430)^-$ signal for any of the processes
investigated, neither in the total $J/\psi\pi$ or $\psi(2S)\pi$ mass
distribution, nor in the corresponding distributions for the regions of $K\pi$
mass for which observation of the $Z(4430)^-$ signal was reported. We obtain
branching fraction upper limits ${\cal{B}}(B^-\to Z^-\bar{K^0}, Z^-\to
J/\psi\pi^-)<1.5\times 10^{-5}$, ${\cal{B}}(B^0\to Z^-K^+, Z^-\to
J/\psi\pi^-)<0.4\times 10^{-5}$, ${\cal{B}}(B^-\to Z^-\bar{K^0}, Z^-\to
\psi(2S)\pi^-)<4.7\times 10^{-5}$, and ${\cal{B}}(B^0\to Z^-K^+, Z^-\to
\psi(2S)\pi^-)<3.1\times 10^{-5}$ at 95% confidence level, where the
$Z(4430)^-$ mass and width have been fixed to the reported central values.
