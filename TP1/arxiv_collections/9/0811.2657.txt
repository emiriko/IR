We provide a new model of higher dimensional wormholes supported by phantom
energy derived from a scalar field with negative kinetic term. We have shown
that the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC) violating phantom energy can be
reduced as desired. We have also noticed that dimension of the spacetime plays
a crucial role for measuring the ANEC violating matter needed.
