Acoustic wave generation by turbulence in the stratified, moist atmosphere is
studied. It is shown that in the saturated moist air turbulence in addition to
the Lighthill's quadrupole and the dipole sources of sound related to
stratification and temperature fluctuations, there exist monopole sources
related to heat and mass production during the condensation of moisture. We
determine acoustic power of these monopole sources. Performed analysis shows
that the monopole radiation is dominant for typical parameters of strong
convective storms. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with the
main observed characteristics of infrasound radiation by strong convective
storms such as total acoustic power and characteristic frequency.
