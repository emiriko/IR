Cosmological solutions for homogeneous isotropic models in the framework of
the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity based on gravitational Lagrangian
adopted in the paper by Kun-Feng Shie, James M. Nester and Hwei-Jang Yo (Phys.
Rev. D \textbf{78}, 023522 (2008)) are discussed. Cosmological solutions for
accelerating Universe obtained in referred paper are compared with
corresponding solutions of standard $\Lambda CDM$-model and also with
cosmological solution obtained by authors of this Comment.
