We explore electron transport properties in molecular wires made of
heterocyclic molecules (pyrrole, furan and thiophene) by using the Green's
function technique. Parametric calculations are given based on the
tight-binding model to describe the electron transport in these wires. It is
observed that the transport properties are significantly influenced by (a) the
heteroatoms in the heterocyclic molecules and (b) the molecule-to-electrodes
coupling strength. Conductance ($g$) shows sharp resonance peaks associated
with the molecular energy levels in the limit of weak molecular coupling, while
they get broadened in the strong molecular coupling limit. These resonances get
shifted with the change of the heteroatoms in these heterocyclic molecules. All
the essential features of the electron transfer through these molecular wires
become much more clearly visible from the study of our current-voltage
($I$-$V$) characteristics, and they provide several key informations in the
study of molecular transport.
