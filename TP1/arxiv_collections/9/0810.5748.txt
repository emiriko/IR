To provide physical insight into the recently observed photoluminescence
saturation behaviors in single-walled carbon nanotubes implying the existence
of an upper limit of exciton densities, we have performed a time-dependent
theoretical study of diffusion-limited exciton-exciton annihilation in the
general context of reaction-diffusion processes, for which exact treatments
exist. By including the radiative recombination decay as a Poissonian process
in the exactly-solvable problem of one-dimensional diffusion-driven
two-particle annihilation, we were able to correctly model the dynamics of
excitons as a function of time with different initial densities, which in turn
allowed us to reproduce the experimentally observed photoluminescence
saturation behavior at high exciton densities. We also performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the purely stochastic, Brownian diffusive motion of
one-dimensional excitons, which validated our analytical results. Finally, we
consider the temperature-dependence of this diffusion-limited exciton-exciton
annihilation and point out that high excitonic densities in SWNTs could be
achieved at low temperature in an external magnetic field.
