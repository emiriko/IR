Given an item and a list of values of size $N$. It is required to decide if
such item exists in the list. Classical computer can search for the item in
O(N). The best known quantum algorithm can do the job in $O(\sqrt{N})$. In this
paper, a quantum algorithm will be proposed that can search an unstructured
list in O(1) to get the YES/NO answer with certainty.
