We present a surface trap which allows for studying the coherent interaction
of ultracold atoms with evanescent waves. The trap combines a magnetic Joffe
trap with a repulsive evanescent dipole potential. The position of the magnetic
trap can be controlled with high precision which makes it possible to move
ultracold atoms to the surface of a glass prism in a controlled way. The
optical potential of the evanescent wave compensates for the strong attractive
van der Waals forces and generates a potential barrier at only a few hundred
nanometers from the surface. The trap is tested with Rb Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC), which are stably positioned at distances from the surfaces
below one micrometer.
