It is shown that the usual choice of units obtained by taking G = c = Planck
constant = 1, giving the Planck units of mass, length and time, introduces an
artificial contradiction between cosmology and particle physics: the lambda
problem that we associate with Planck constant. We note that the choice of
Planck constant = 1 does not correspond to the scale of quantum physics. For
this scale we prove that the correct value is Planck constant \hbar; 1/10^122,
while the choice of Planck constant = 1 corresponds to the cosmological scale.
This is due to the scale factor of 10^61 that converts the Planck scale to the
cosmological scale. By choosing the ratio G/c^3 = constant = 1, which includes
the choice G = c = 1, and the momentum conservation mc = constant, we preserve
the derivation of the Einstein field equations from the action principle. Then
the product Gm/c^2 = rg, the gravitational radius of m, is constant. For a
quantum black hole we prove that Planck constant \hbar; rg^2 \hbar; (mc)^2. We
also prove that the product lambda x Planck constant is a general constant of
order one, for any scale. The cosmological scale implies lambda \hbar; Planck
constant \hbar; 1, while the Planck scale gives lambda \hbar; 1/Planck constant
\hbar; 10^122. This explains the lambda problem. We get two scales: the
cosmological quantum black hole (QBH), size \Lambda; 10^28 cm, and the quantum
black hole (qbh) that includes the fundamental particles scale, size \Lambda;
10^-13 cm, as well as the Planck scale, size \Lambda; 10^-33 cm.
