Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of nonamphiphilic
2-(4-Biphenylyl)-5 phenyl-1,3,4- oxadiazole (abbreviated as PBD) mixed with
stearic acid (SA) as well as also with the inert polymer matrix poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) have been studied. Surface pressure versus area per
molecule (-A) isotherms studies suggest that PBD molecules very likely stand
vertically on the air-water interface and this arrangement allows the PBD
molecules to form stacks and remain sandwiched between SA/PMMA molecules. At
lower surface pressure phase separation between PBD and matrix molecules occur
resulting due to repulsive interaction. However at higher surface pressure PBD
molecules form aggregates. The UV-Vis absorption and Steady state fluorescence
spectroscopic studies of the mixed LB films of PBD reveal the nature of the
aggregates. H-type aggregates predominates in the mixed LB films whereas I-type
aggregates predominates in the PBD-PMMA spin coated films. The degree of
deformation produced in the electronic levels are largely affected by the film
thickness and the surface pressure of lifting.
