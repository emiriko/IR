The relationship between the harmonic mean and special relativity is
concisely elucidated. The arguments in favor and against SRT are explored. It
is shown that the ratio of the speed of light to the harmonic mean of the
onward and return speeds of light in a moving frame under Newtonian mechanics,
when equitably distributed between space and time as a correction, leads to the
Lorentz transformation. This correction implies an apparent contraction of
objects and time dilation. However, the symmetry of the onward and inverse
transformations give a different meaning to the gamma factor
