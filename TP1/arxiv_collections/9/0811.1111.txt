The SLIM experiment was an array of 427 m^2 of nuclear track detectors,
exposed at a high altitude laboratory (Chacaltaya, Bolivia, 5230 m a.s.l.), for
~4.22 years. SLIM was sensitive to downgoing intermediate mass magnetic
monopoles with masses in the range 10^5 to 10^12 GeV. The analysis of the full
detector gives a flux upper limit of 1.3x10^{-15} 1/(cm^2*s*sr) (90% C.L.) for
downgoing fast intermediate magnetic monopoles.
