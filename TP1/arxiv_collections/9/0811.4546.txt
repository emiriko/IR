Gluino pair production in an EGRET motivated supersymmetry scenario has been
studied. The analysis shows, that this special scenario could be proven with
the first LHC data, and assuming a higher integrated luminosity the analysis
would be able to cover a large region of the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA)
parameter space.
