The recently proposed Partition Theory (PT) [J.Phys.Chem.A 111, 2229 (2007)]
is illustrated on a simple one-dimensional model of a heteronuclear diatomic
molecule. It is shown that a sharp definition for the charge of molecular
fragments emerges from PT, and that the ensuing population analysis can be used
to study how charge redistributes during dissociation and the implications of
that redistribution for the dipole moment. Interpreting small differences
between the isolated parts' ionization potentials as due to environmental
inhomogeneities, we gain insight into how electron localization takes place in
H2+ as the molecule dissociates. Furthermore, by studying the preservation of
the shapes of the parts as different parameters of the model are varied, we
address the issue of transferability of the parts. We find good transferability
within the chemically meaningful parameter regime, raising hopes that PT will
prove useful in chemical applications.
