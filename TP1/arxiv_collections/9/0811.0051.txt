This expository paper describes the various methods that have yielded partial
results on the conjecture that if n > 2, then no lattice in SL(n,R) has a
faithful action on the circle (by homeomorphisms). Topics include amenability,
Kazhdan's property (T), bounded cohomology, bounded generation, and the
Reeb-Thurston Stability Theorem.
