Importance sampling and Metropolis-Hastings sampling (of which Gibbs sampling
is a special case) are two methods commonly used to sample multi-variate
probability distributions (that is, Bayesian networks). Heretofore, the
sampling of Bayesian networks has been done on a conventional "classical
computer". In this paper, we propose methods for doing importance sampling and
Metropolis-Hastings sampling of a classical Bayesian network on a quantum
computer.
