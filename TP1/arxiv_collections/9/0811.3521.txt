Craig interpolation has become a versatile algorithmic tool for improving
software verification. Interpolants can, for instance, accelerate the
convergence of fixpoint computations for infinite-state systems. They also help
improve the refinement of iteratively computed lazy abstractions. Efficient
interpolation procedures have been presented only for a few theories. In this
paper, we introduce a complete interpolation method for the full range of
quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic formulas. We propose a novel convex
variable projection for integer inequalities and a technique to combine them
with equalities. The derivation of the interpolant has complexity low-degree
polynomial in the size of the refutation proof and is typically fast in
practice.
