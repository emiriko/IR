We first discuss the use of dimensional arguments (and of the quadrupolar
emission hypothesis) in the derivation of the gravitational power radiated on a
circular orbit. Then, we show how to simply obtain the instantaneous power
radiated on a general Keplerian orbit by approximating it locally by a circle.
This allows recovering with a good precision, in the case of an ellipse, the
highly non trivial dependence on the eccentricity of the average power given by
general relativity. The whole approach is understandable by undergraduate
students.
