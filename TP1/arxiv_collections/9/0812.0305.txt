We simulate magnetic reconnection in electron-positron (pair) plasma using a
collisionless two-fluid model with isotropic pressure. In this model the
resistive, Hall, and electrokinetic pressure terms are absent from the curl of
Ohm's law, leaving the inertial term alone to provide for magnetic
reconnection. Our simulations suggest that for pair plasma simulated with
isotropic pressure fast reconnection does not occur without the aid of
sufficient (numerical) diffusion. We contrast this result with simulations and
published results showing fast reconnection for collisionless two-fluid plasma
with isotropic pressures and non-canceling mass-to-charge ratios, where Hall
effects are present and numerical diffusion is small, and with published PIC
studies of pair plasma which observe fast reconnection and attribute it to
nonisotropic pressure.
