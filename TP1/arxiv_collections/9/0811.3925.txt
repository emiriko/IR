We report the realization of superconductivity by an isovalent doping with
phosphorus in LaFeAsO. X-ray diffraction shows that, with the partial
substitution of P for As, the Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers are squeezed while the
La$_2$O$_2$ layers are stretched along the c-axis. Electrical resistance and
magnetization measurements show emergence of bulk superconductivity at $\sim$10
K for the optimally-doped LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O ($x=0.25\sim0.3$). The upper
critical fields at zero temperature is estimated to be 27 T, much higher than
that of the LaFePO superconductor. The occurrence of superconductivity is
discussed in terms of chemical pressures and bond covalency.
