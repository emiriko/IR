Using a time of flight technique, the maximal values of kinetic energy as a
function of primary mass of fragments from low energy fission of U 234 and U
236 were measured by Signarbieux et al. From calculations of scission
configurations, one can conclude that, for those two fissioning systems, the
maximal value of total kinetic energy corresponding to fragmentations (Mo 104,
Sn 130)) and (Mo 106, Sn 130), respectively, are equal to the available
energies, and their scission configurations are composed by a spherical heavy
fragment and a prolate light fragment both in their ground state.
