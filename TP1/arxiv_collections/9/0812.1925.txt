We study the kinetics of photoinduced ordering in the azo-dye SD1
photoaligning layers and present the results of modeling performed using two
different phenomenological approaches. A phenomenological two state model is
deduced from the master equation for an ensemble of two-level molecular
systems. Using an alternative approach, we formulate the two-dimensional (2D)
diffusion model as the free energy Fokker-Planck equation simplified for the
limiting regime of purely in-plane reorientation. The models are employed to
interpret the irradiation time dependence of the absorption order parameters
extracted from the available experimental data by using the exact solution to
the light transmission problem for a biaxially anisotropic absorbing layer. The
transient photoinduced structures are found to be biaxially anisotropic whereas
the photosteady and the initial states are uniaxial.
