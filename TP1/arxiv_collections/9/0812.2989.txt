Resource-constrained embedded and mobile devices are becoming increasingly
common. Since few years, some mobile and ubiquitous devices such as wireless
sensor, able to be aware of their physical environment, appeared. Such devices
enable proposing applications which adapt to user's need according the context
evolution. It implies the collaboration of sensors and software components
which differ on their nature and their communication mechanisms. This paper
proposes a unified component model in order to easily design applications based
on software components and sensors without taking care of their nature. Then it
presents a state of the art of communication problems linked to heterogeneous
components and proposes an interaction mechanism which ensures information
exchanges between wireless sensors and software components.
