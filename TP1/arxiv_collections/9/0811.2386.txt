We study the time dynamics of a single boson coupled to a bath of two-level
systems (spins 1/2) with different excitation energies, described by an
inhomogeneous Dicke model. Analyzing the time-dependent Schrodinger equation
exactly we find that at resonance the boson decays in time to an oscillatory
state with a finite amplitude characterized by a single Rabi frequency if the
inhomogeneity is below a certain threshold. In the limit of small
inhomogeneity, the decay is suppressed and exhibits a complex (mainly
Gaussian-like) behavior, whereas the decay is complete and of exponential form
in the opposite limit. For intermediate inhomogeneity, the boson decay is
partial and governed by a combination of exponential and power laws.
