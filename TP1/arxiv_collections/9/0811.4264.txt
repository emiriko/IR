We compute the two-loop renormalization functions, in the RI' scheme, of
local bilinear quark operators $\bar{\psi}\Gamma\psi$, where $\Gamma$
corresponds to the Vector, Axial-Vector and Tensor Dirac operators, in the
lattice formulation of QCD. We consider both the flavor nonsinglet and singlet
operators.
  We use the clover action for fermions and the Wilson action for gluons. Our
results are given as a polynomial in $c_{SW}$, in terms of both the
renormalized and bare coupling constant, in the renormalized Feynman gauge.
  Finally, we present our results in the MSbar scheme, for easier comparison
with calculations in the continuum. The corresponding results, for fermions in
an arbitrary representation, together with some special features of
superficially divergent integrals, are included in the Appendices.
