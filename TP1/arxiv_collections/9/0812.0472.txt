Motivated by the experimental finding of Ferromagnetism (FM) near non-FL
quantum phase transitions (QPT), I investigate FM in an Extended Periodic
Anderson Model (EPAM). Using the Frobenius-Perron theorem, a FM {\it metallic}
phase near the selective Mott localization is rigorously found. Interesting
connections with Tasaki's flat-band ferromagnetism, as well as with the
well-known double exchange (DE) mechanism are elucidated. This finding is a
higher dimensional generalization of numerical work on the D=1 PAM, and
constitutes a robust way to FM metallic behavior in $D>1$. Finally, we discuss
a concrete manifestation of our results to $UGe_{2}$.
