The concept of preferential concentration in the transport of inertial
particles by random velocity fields is extended to account for the possibility
of zero correlation time and compressibility of the velocity field. It is shown
that, in the case of an uncorrelated in time random velocity field,
preferential concentration takes the form of a condition on the field history
leading to the current particle positions. This generalized form of
preferential concentration appears to be a necessary condition for clustering
in the uncorrelated in time case. The standard interpretation of preferential
concentration is recovered considering local time averages of the velocity
field. In the compressible case, preferential concentration occurs in regions
of negative divergence of the field. In the incompressible case, it occurs in
regions of simultaneously high strain and negative field skewness.
