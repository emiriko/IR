An extension of the theory of General Relativity is proposed, based on
pseudo-complex space-time coordinates. The new theory corresponds to the
introduction of two, in general different, metrics which are connected through
specific conditions. A pseudo-complex Schwarzschild solution is constructed,
which does not suffer any more by a singularity. The solution indicates a
minimal radius for a heavy mass object. Consequences for the redshift and
possible signatures for its observation are discussed.
