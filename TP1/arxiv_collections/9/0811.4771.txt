Temperature variations of the heat capacity (C) are studied in a low
temperature regime for 2D-, and 3D-systems with N~100-10000 treated as a
canonical ensemble of N-noninteracting fermions. The analysis of C is performed
by introducing function q, the spectral distribution of C, that gives the
contribution of each single-particle state to C. This function has two peaks
divided by the energy interval ~(2-5)T. If at some temperature Tres there takes
place a resonance i.e. the positions of these peaks coincide with energies of
two levels nearest to Fermi enrgy then C vs T can show a local maximum at Tres.
This gives possibility to assess the single-particle level spacings near the
Fermi level.
