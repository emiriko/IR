Investigations on the internal one-particle density matrix in the case of
Bose-Einstein condensates with a finite number ($N$) of particles in a harmonic
potential are performed. We solve the eigenvalue problem of the
Pethick-Pitaevskii-type internal density matrix and find a fragmented
condensate. On the contrary the condensate Jacobi-type internal density matrix
gives complete condensation into a single state. The internal one-particle
density matrix is, therefore, shown to be different in general for different
choices of the internal coordinate system. We propose two physically motivated
criteria for the choice of the adequate coordinate systems which give us a
unique answer for the internal one-particle density matrix. One criterion is
that in the infinite particle number limit ($N=\infty$) the internal
one-particle density matrix should have the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
as those of the corresponding ideal Bose-Einstein condensate in the laboratory
frame. The other criterion is that the coordinate of the internal one-particle
density matrix should be orthogonal to the remaining $(N - 2)$ internal
coordinates. This second criterion is shown to imply the first criterion. It is
shown that the internal Jacobi coordinate system satisfies these two criteria
while the internal coordinate system adopted by Pethick and Pitaevskii for the
construction of the internal one-particle density matrix does not. It is
demonstrated that these two criteria uniquely determine the internal
one-particle density matrix which is identical to that calculated with the
Jacobi coordinates. The relevance of this work concerning $\alpha$-particle
condensates in nuclei, as well as bosonic atoms in traps, is pointed out.
