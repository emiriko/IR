The planar rigidity problem asks, given a set of m pairwise distances among a
set P of n unknown points, whether it is possible to reconstruct P, up to a
finite set of possibilities (modulo rigid motions of the plane). The celebrated
Maxwell-Laman Theorem from Rigidity Theory says that, generically, the rigidity
problem has a combinatorial answer: the underlying combinatorial structure must
contain a spanning minimally-rigid graph (Laman graph). In the case where the
system is not rigid, its inclusion-wise maximal rigid substructures (rigid
components) are also combinatorially characterized via the Maxwell-Laman
theorem, and may be found efficiently.
  Physicists have used planar combinatorial rigidity has been used to study the
phase transition between liquid and solid in network glasses. The approach has
been to generate a graph via a stochastic process and then experimentally
analyze its rigidity properties. Of particular interest is the size of the
largest rigid components.
  In this paper, we study the emergence of rigid components in an Erdos-Renyi
random graph G(n,p), using the parameterization p=c/n for a fixed constant c>0.
Our first result is that for all c>0, almost surely all rigid components have
size 2, 3 or Omega(n). We also show that for c>4, almost surely the largest
rigid components have size at least n/10.
  While the G(n,p) model is simpler than those appearing in the physics
literature, these results are the first of this type where the distribution is
over all graphs on n vertices and the expected number of edges is O(n).
