This paper studies Galois extensions over real quadratic number fields or
cyclotomic number fields ramified only at one prime. In both cases, the ray
class groups are computed, and they give restrictions on the finite groups that
can occur as such Galois groups. Also the explicit structure of ray class
groups of regular cyclotomic number field is given.
