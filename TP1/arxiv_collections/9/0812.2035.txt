Dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking (DEWSB) has been a viable option for
the completion of the standard model for over thirty years. Precision
electroweak studies indicate that the new strong interactions that break EW
symmetry cannot be a scaled-up copy of QCD. Building viable models of DEWSB is
difficult without a detailed understanding of such non-QCD gauge theories which
still confine and break chiral symmetry. We review past difficulties of
studying these theories using lattice methods and describe recent progress,
focusing on the role of approximate infrared conformal symmetry.
