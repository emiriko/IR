The paper presents a new steganographic method called LACK (Lost Audio
PaCKets Steganography) which is intended mainly for VoIP. The method is
presented in a broader context of network steganography and of VoIP
steganography in particular. The analytical results presented in the paper
concern the influence of LACK's hidden data insertion procedure on the method's
impact on quality of voice transmission and its resistance to steganalysis.
