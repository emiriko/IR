Employing the perturbative QCD inspired parton cascade, we investigate
kinetic and chemical equilibration of the partonic matter created in central
heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Two types of initial conditions
are chosen. One is generated by the model of wounded nucleons using the PYTHIA
event generator and Glauber geometry. Another is considered as a color glass
condensate. We show that kinetic equilibration is almost independent on the
chosen initial conditions, whereas there is a sensitive dependence for chemical
equilibration. The time scale of thermalization lies between 1 and 1.5 fm/c.
The final parton transverse energy obtained from BAMPS calculations is compared
with the RHIC data and is estimated for the LHC energy.
