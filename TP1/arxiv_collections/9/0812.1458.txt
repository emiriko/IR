The discovery potential of Standard Model Higgs searches at the LHC at 14 TeV
center-of-mass energy is reviewed. Decay channels such as $H\to\gamma\gamma$,
$H\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4\ell$, $H\to WW^{\star}$ and $H\to \tau\tau$ are
considered. Results are based on the most recent full GEANT-based simulations
performed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
