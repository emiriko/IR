We study the statistics of the fluctuating electron temperature in a metallic
island coupled to reservoirs via resistive contacts and driven out of
equilibrium by either a temperature or voltage difference between the
reservoirs. The fluctuations of temperature are well-defined provided that the
energy relaxation rate inside the island exceeds the rate of energy exchange
with the reservoirs. We quantify these fluctuations in the regime beyond the
Gaussian approximation and elucidate their dependence on the nature of the
electronic contacts.
