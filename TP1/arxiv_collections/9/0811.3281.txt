A theory of self-propelled particles is developed in two dimensions assuming
that the particles can be deformed from a circular shape when the propagating
velocity is increased. A coupled set of equations in terms of the velocity and
a tensor variable to represent the deformation is introduced to show that there
is a bifurcation from a straight motion to a circular motion of a single
particle. Dynamics of assembly of the particles is studied numerically where
there is a global interaction such that the particles tend to cause an
orientational order.
