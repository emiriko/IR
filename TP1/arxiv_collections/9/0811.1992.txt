Using Beck and Cohen's superstatistics, we introduce in a systematic way a
family of generalised Wishart-Laguerre ensembles of random matrices with Dyson
index $\beta$ = 1,2, and 4. The entries of the data matrix are Gaussian random
variables whose variances $\eta$ fluctuate from one sample to another according
to a certain probability density $f(\eta)$ and a single deformation parameter
$\gamma$. Three superstatistical classes for $f(\eta)$ are usually considered:
$\chi^2$-, inverse $\chi^2$- and log-normal-distributions. While the first
class, already considered by two of the authors, leads to a power-law decay of
the spectral density, we here introduce and solve exactly a superposition of
Wishart-Laguerre ensembles with inverse $\chi^2$-distribution. The
corresponding macroscopic spectral density is given by a $\gamma$-deformation
of the semi-circle and Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur laws, on a non-compact support with
exponential tails. After discussing in detail the validity of Wigner's surmise
in the Wishart-Laguerre class, we introduce a generalised $\gamma$-dependent
surmise with stretched-exponential tails, which well approximates the
individual level spacing distribution in the bulk. The analytical results are
in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. To illustrate our findings
we compare the $\chi^2$- and inverse $\chi^2$-class to empirical data from
financial covariance matrices.
