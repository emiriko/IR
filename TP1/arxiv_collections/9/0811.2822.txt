The anomaly cancelation method proposed by Wilczek et al. is applied to the
general charged rotating black holes in five-dimensional minimal gauged
supergravity. Thus Hawking temperature and fluxes are found. The Hawking
temperature obtained agrees with the surface gravity formula. The black holes
have charge and two unequal angular momenta and these give rise to appropriate
terms in the effective U(1) gauge field of the reduced (1+1)-dimensional
theory. In particular, it is found that the terms in this U(1) gauge field
correspond exactly to the correct electrostatic potential and the two angular
velocities on the horizon of the black holes, and so the results for the
Hawking fluxes derived here from the anomaly cancelation method are in complete
agreement with the ones obtained from integrating the Planck distribution.
