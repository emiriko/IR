A self-consistent Quasiparticle-Random-Phase-Approximation (QRPA) model which
employs the canonical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) basis and an energy-density
functional with a Skyrme mean field part and a density-dependent pairing, is
used to study the monopole collective excitations of spherical even-even
nuclei. The influence of the spurious state on the strength function of the
isoscalar monopole excitations is clearly assessed. We compare the effect of
different kinds of pairing forces (volume pairing, surface pairing and mixed
pairing) on the monopole excitation strength function. The energy of the
Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR), which is related to the nuclear
incompressibility $K_{\infty}$, is calculated for tin isotopes and the results
are discussed.
