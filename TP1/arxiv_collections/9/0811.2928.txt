Light scattering techniques are widely used in many fields of condensed and
sof t matter physics. Usually these methods are based on the study of the
scattered light in the far field. Recently, a new family of near field
detection schemes has been developed, mainly for the study of small angle light
scattering. These techniques are based on the detection of the light intensity
near to the sample, where light scattered at different directions overlaps but
can be distinguished by Fourier transform analysis. Here we report for the
first time data obtained with a dynamic near field scattering instrument,
measuring both polarized and depolarized scattered light. Advantages of this
procedure over the traditional far field detection include the immunity to
stray light problems and the possibility to obtain a large number of
statistical samples for many different wave vectors in a single instantaneous
measurement. By using the proposed technique we have measured the translational
and rotational diffusion coefficients of rod-like colloidal particles. The
obtained data are in very good agreement with the data acquired with a
traditional light scattering apparatus.
