Group theoretical arguments seem to indicate the discrete symmetry S4 as the
minimal flavour symmetry compatible with tribimaximal neutrino mixing. We prove
in a model independent way that indeed S4 can realize exact tribimaximal mixing
through different symmetry breaking patterns. We present two models in which
lepton tribimaximal mixing is realized in different ways and for each one we
discuss the superpotential that leads to the correct breaking of the flavor
symmetry.
