We study the force vs extension behaviour of a helical spring made of a thin
torsionally-stiff anisotropic elastic rod. Our focus is on springs of very low
helical pitch. For certain parameters of the problem such a spring is found not
to unwind when pulled but rather to form hockles that pop-out one by one and
lead to a highly non-monotonic force-extension curve. Between abrupt loop
pop-outs this curve is well described by the planar elastica whose relevant
solutions are classified. Our results may be relevant for tightly coiled
nanosprings in future micro- and nano(electro)mechanical devices.
