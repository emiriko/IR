Several authors have studied stego-systems based on Costa scheme, but just a
few ones gave both theoretical and experimental justifications of these schemes
performance in an active warden context. We provide in this paper a
steganographic and comparative study of three informed stego-systems in active
warden context: scalar Costa scheme, trellis-coded quantization and spread
transform scalar Costa scheme. By leading on analytical formulations and on
experimental evaluations, we show the advantages and limits of each scheme in
term of statistical undetectability and capacity in the case of active warden.
Such as the undetectability is given by the distance between the stego-signal
and the cover distance. It is measured by the Kullback-Leibler distance.
