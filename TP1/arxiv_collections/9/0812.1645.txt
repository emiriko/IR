We review results on the spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat
Einstein-Vlasov system. We focus on a recent result where we found explicit
conditions on the initial data which guarantee the formation of a black hole in
the evolution. Among these data there are data such that the corresponding
solutions exist globally in Schwarzschild coordinates. We put these results
into a more general context, and we include arguments which show that the
spacetimes we obtain satisfy the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and contain
a black hole in the sense of suitable mathematical definitions of these
concepts which are available in the literature.
