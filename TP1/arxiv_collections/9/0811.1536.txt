Transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) encode
information about the intrinsic motion of quarks inside the nucleon. They are
important non-perturbative ingredients in our understanding of, e.g., azimuthal
asymmetries and other qualitative features in semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering experiments. We present first calculations on the lattice, based on
MILC gauge configurations and propagators from LHPC. They yield polarized and
unpolarized transverse momentum dependent quark densities and enable us to test
the assumption of factorization in x and transverse momentum. The operators we
employ are non-local and contain a Wilson line, whose renormalization requires
the removal of a divergence linear in the cutoff 1/a.
