We discuss the reaction rate of the muon-catalysed $t$-$t$ fusion. The
reaction rate is determined as a function of the temperature using the model of
"in flight" fusion. We especially take into account the effect of the
fluctuation of the cross section due to the existence of the muon. The obtained
reaction rate 5.0$\times10^{-3} \mu$s$^{-1}$ is a factor of 10$^{-3}$ smaller
than the experimental muonic cycling rate in the solid tritium target.
