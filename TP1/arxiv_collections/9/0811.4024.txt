In the context of the finite elasticity theory, we consider a model for
compressible solids called 'compressible neo-Hookean material'. We show how
finite-amplitude inhomogeneous plane wave solutions and finite-amplitude
unattenuated solutions can combine to form a finite-amplitude Love wave. We
take a layer of finite thickness overlying a solid half-space, both made of
different prestressed compressible neo-Hookean materials. We derive an exact
solution of the equations of motion and boundary conditions and also obtain
results for the energy density and the energy flux of the waves. Finally, we
investigate the special case when the interface between the layer and the
substrate is in a principal plane of the prestrain. A numerical example is
given.
