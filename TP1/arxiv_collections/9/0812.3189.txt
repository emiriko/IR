Coherent Synchrotron Radiation has been studied effectively using a
1-dimensional model for the charge distribution in the realm of small angle
approximations and high energies. Here we use Jefimenko's form of Maxwell's
equations, without such approximations, to calculate the exact wake-fields due
to this effect in multiple bends and drifts. It has been shown before that the
influence of a drift can propagate well into a subsequent bend. We show, for
reasonable parameters, that the influence of a previous bend can also propagate
well into a subsequent bend, and that this is especially important at the
beginning of a bend. Shielding by conducting parallel plates is simulated using
the image charge method. We extend the formalism to situations with compressing
and decompressing distributions, and conclude that simpler approximations to
bunch compression usually overestimates the effect. Additionally, an exact
formula for the coherent power radiated by a Gaussian bunch is derived by
considering the coherent synchrotron radiation spectrum, and is used to check
the accuracy of wake-field calculations.
