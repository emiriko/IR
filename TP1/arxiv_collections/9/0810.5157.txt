In this chapter we consider a cell phone network as a set of automatically
deployed sensors that records movement and interaction patterns of the
population. We discuss methods for detecting anomalies in the streaming data
produced by the cell phone network. We motivate this discussion by describing
the Wireless Phone Based Emergency Response (WIPER) system, a proof-of-concept
decision support system for emergency response managers. We also discuss some
of the scientific work enabled by this type of sensor data and the related
privacy issues. We describe scientific studies that use the cell phone data set
and steps we have taken to ensure the security of the data. We describe the
overall decision support system and discuss three methods of anomaly detection
that we have applied to the data.
