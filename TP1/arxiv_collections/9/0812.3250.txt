Recent measurements for F_2(x,Q^2) have been analyzed in terms of the
`dynamical' and `standard' parton model approach at NLO and NNLO of
perturbative QCD. Having fixed the relevant NLO and NNLO parton distributions,
the implications and predictions for the longitudinal structure function
F_L(x,Q^2) are presented. It is shown that the previously noted extreme
perturbative NNLO/NLO instability of F_L(x,Q^2) is an artifact of the commonly
utilized `standard' gluon distributions. In particular it is demonstrated that
using the appropriate -- dynamically generated -- parton distributions at NLO
and NNLO, F_L(x,Q^2) turns out to be perturbatively rather stable already for
Q^2 \geq O(2-3 GeV^2).
