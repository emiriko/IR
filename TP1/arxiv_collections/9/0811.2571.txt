We utilize a superconducting stripline resonator containing a dc-SQUID as a
strong intermodulation amplifier exhibiting a signal gain of 25 dB and a phase
modulation of 30 dB. Studying the system response in the time domain near the
intermodulation amplification threshold reveals a unique noise-induced spikes
behavior. We account for this response qualitatively via solving numerically
the equations of motion for the integrated system. Furthermore, employing this
device as a parametric amplifier yields a gain of 38 dB in the generated
side-band signal.
