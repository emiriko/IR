Let $n$ be a positive even integer, and let $a_1,...,a_n$ and $w_1, ..., w_n$
be integers satisfying $\sum_{k=1}^n a_k\equiv\sum_{k=1}^n w_k =0 (mod n)$. A
conjecture of Bialostocki states that there is a permutation $\sigma$ on
{1,...,n} such that $\sum_{k=1}^n w_k a_{\sigma(k)}=0 (mod n)$. In this paper
we confirm the conjecture when $w_1,...,w_n$ form an arithmetic progression
with even common difference.
