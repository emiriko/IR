We give a general and nontechnical review of some aspects of noncommutative
geometry as a tool to understand the structure of spacetime. We discuss the
motivations for the constructions of a noncommutative geometry, and the passage
from commutative to noncommutative spaces. We then give a brief description of
Connes approach to the standard model, of the noncommutative geometry of
strings and of field theory on noncommutative spaces. We also discuss the role
of symmetries and some possible consequences for cosmology.
