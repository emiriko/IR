In this article we reconsider the old mysterious relation, advocated by Dirac
and Weinberg, between the mass of the pion, the fundamental physical constants,
and the Hubble parameter. By introducing the cosmological density parameters,
we show how the corresponding equation may be written in a form that is
invariant with respect to the expansion of the Universe and without invoking a
varying gravitational "constant", as was originaly proposed by Dirac. It is
suggest that, through this relation, Nature gives a hint that virtual pions
dominante the "content" of the quantum vacuum.
