Point-contact Andreev-reflection measurements were performed in
SmFeAsO_{0.8}F_{0.2} polycrystals with T_c \simeq 53 K. The experimental
conductance curves reproducibly exhibit peaks around \pm 6 mV and shoulders at
V \sim 16-20 mV, indicating the presence of two nodeless superconducting gaps.
While the single-band Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk fit can only reproduce a small
central portion of the conductance curve, the two-gap one accounts remarkably
well for the shape of the whole experimental dI/dV. The fits of the normalized
curves give Delta_1(0) = 6.15 \pm 0.45 meV and Delta_2(0) = 18 \pm 3 meV. Both
gaps close at the same temperature and follow a BCS-like behavior.
