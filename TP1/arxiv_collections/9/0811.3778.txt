The study of the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking is one of the
main goals of the Large Hadron Collider and of its general-purpose experiments,
ATLAS and CMS. This paper reviews some of the ongoing studies by these
collaborations and, when possible, highlights the differences between
equivalent channels in both experiments.
