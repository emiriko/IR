Environmental and genetic mutations can transform the cells in a co-operating
healthy tissue into an ecosystem of individualistic tumour cells that compete
for space and resources. Various selection forces are responsible for driving
the evolution of cells in a tumour towards more malignant and aggressive
phenotypes that tend to have a fitness advantage over the older populations.
Although the evolutionary nature of cancer has been recognised for more than
three decades (ever since the seminal work of Nowell) it has been only recently
that tools traditionally used by ecological and evolutionary researchers have
been adopted to study the evolution of cancer phenotypes in populations of
individuals capable of co-operation and competition. In this chapter we will
describe game theory as an important tool to study the emergence of cell
phenotypes in a tumour and will critically review some of its applications in
cancer research. These applications demonstrate that game theory can be used to
understand the dynamics of somatic cancer evolution and suggest new therapies
in which this knowledge could be applied to gain some control over the
evolution of the tumour.
