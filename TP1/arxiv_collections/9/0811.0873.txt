There have been great advances in charm physics at the B-factories in recent
years, including the observation of D0-D0bar mixing and the discovery of many
new hidden-charm states, some of them presumably exotic in structure. This talk
reviews some of the recent Belle results, with emphasis on the hidden-charm
sector. Evidence for two new charged states is presented for the first time at
this conference.
