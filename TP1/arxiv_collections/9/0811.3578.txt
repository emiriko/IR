The 3-body recombination rate at threshold for distinguishable atoms with
large negative pair scattering lengths is calculated in the zero-range
approximation. The only parameters in this limit are the 3 scattering lengths
and the Efimov parameter, which can be complex valued. We provide semi-analytic
expressions for the cases of 2 or 3 equal scattering lengths and we obtain
numerical results for the general case of 3 different scattering lengths. Our
general result is applied to the three lowest hyperfine states of Lithium-6
atoms. Comparisons with recent experiments provide indications of loss features
associated with Efimov trimers near the 3-atom threshold.
