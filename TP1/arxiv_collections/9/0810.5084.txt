Thermodynamics of itinerant magnets is studied using a classical model with
one parameter characterizing the degree of itinerancy. Monte Carlo simulations
for bcc and fcc lattices are compared with the mean-field approximation and
with the Onsager cavity field approximation extended to itinerant systems. The
qualitative features of thermodynamics are similar to the known results of the
functional integral method. It is found that magnetic short-range order is weak
and almost independent on the degree of itinerancy, and the mean-field
approximation describes the thermodynamics reasonably well. Ambiguity of the
phase space measure for classical models is emphasized. The Onsager cavity
field method is extended to itinerant systems, which involves the
renormalization of both the Weiss field and the on-site exchange interaction.
The predictions of this approximation are in excellent agreement with Monte
Carlo results.
