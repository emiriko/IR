A comprehensive quantitative rescattering (QRS) theory for describing the
production of high-energy photoelectrons generated by intense laser pulses is
presented. According to the QRS, the momentum distributions of these electrons
can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet with the
elastic differential cross sections (DCS) between free electrons with the
target ion. We show that the returning electron wave packets are determined
mostly by the lasers only, and can be obtained from the strong field
approximation. The validity of the QRS model is carefully examined by checking
against accurate results from the solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation for atomic targets within the single active electron approximation. We
further show that experimental photoelectron spectra for a wide range of laser
intensity and wavelength can be explained by the QRS theory, and that the DCS
between electrons and target ions can be extracted from experimental
photoelectron spectra. By generalizing the QRS theory to molecular targets, we
discuss how few-cycle infrared lasers offer a promising tool for dynamic
chemical imaging with temporal resolution of a few femtoseconds.
