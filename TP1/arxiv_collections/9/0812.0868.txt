Left-Right symmetry including supersymmetry presents an important class of
gauge models which may possess natural solutions to many issues of
phenomenology. Cosmology of such models indicates a phase transition
accompanied by domain walls. Such walls must be unstable in order to not
conflict with standard cosmology, and can further be shown to assist with open
issues of cosmology such as dilution of unwanted relic densities and
leptogenesis. In this paper we construct a model of gauge mediated
supersymmetry breaking in which parity breaking is also signalled along with
supersymmetry breaking and so as to be consistent with cosmological
requirements. It is shown that addressing all the stated cosmological issues
requires an extent of fine tuning, while in the absence of fine tuning,
leptogenesis accompanying successful completion of the phase transition is
still viable.
