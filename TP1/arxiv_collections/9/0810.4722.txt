An electrical circuit consisting of two capacitively coupled inductive loops,
each interrupted by a Josephson junction, is analyzed through the classical
RSCJ model. The same circuit has recently been studied experimentally and the
results were used to demonstrate quantum mechanical entanglement in the system
by observing the correlated states of the two inductive loops after initial
microwave perturbations. Our classical analysis shows that the observed
phenomenon exists entirely within the classical RSCJ model, and we provide a
detailed intuitive description of the transient dynamics responsible for the
observations.
