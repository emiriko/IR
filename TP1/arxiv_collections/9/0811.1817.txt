We propose a new method to effect heat removal from an object by using a
laser beam. The proposed method is based on inelastic scattering of a laser
beam from the object and in particular by making the anti-Stokes emission more
efficient than the Stokes emission. In that manner more energy is removed from
the body per unit time than deposited. Various ways are outlined in order to
achieve this result ranging from careful selection of the laser frequency with
respect to the resonant frequencies of the medium, use of the frequency
dependence of the density of electromagnetic modes in a three-dimensional
system, use of photonic crystals and the polarization dependence of
electromagnetic modes in cavities. The proposed methods could find use for
example in the cooling of devices of nanoscale dimensions.
