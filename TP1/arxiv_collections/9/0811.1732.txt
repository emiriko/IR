We study nonanalytic paramagnetic response of an interacting Fermi system
both away and in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic quantum phase transition
(QCP). Previous studies found that (i) the spin susceptibility scales linearly
with either the temperature $T$ or magnetic field H in the weak-coupling
regime; (ii) the interaction in the Cooper channel affects this scaling via
logarithmic renormalization of prefactors of the $T$, |H| terms, and may even
reverse the signs of these terms at low enough energies. We show that Cooper
renormalization becomes effective only at very low energies, which get even
smaller near a QCP. However,even in the absence of such renormalization,
generic (non-Cooper) higher-order processes may also inverse the sign of T,|H|
scaling. We derive the thermodynamic potential as a function of magnetization
and show that it contains, in addition to regular terms, a non-analytic |M|^3
term, which becomes M^4/T at finite $T$. We show that regular (M^2, M^4, ...)
terms originate from fermions with energies of order of the bandwidth, while
the non-analytic term comes from low-energy fermions. We consider the vicinity
of a ferromagnetic QCP by generalizing the Eliashberg treatment of the
spin-fermion model to finite magnetic field, and show that the |M|^3 term
crosses over to a non-Fermi-liquid form |M|^{7/2} near a QCP. The prefactor of
the |M|^{7/2} term is negative, which indicates that the system undergoes a
first-order rather than a continuous transition to ferromagnetism. We compare
two scenarios of the breakdown of a continuous QCP: a first-order instability
and a spiral phase. In a model with a long-range interaction in the spin
channel, we show that the first-order transition occurs before the spiral
instability.
