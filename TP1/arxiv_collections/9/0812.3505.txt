Epidemic models are always simplifications of real world epidemics. Which
real world features to include, and which simplifications to make, depend both
on the disease of interest and on the purpose of the modelling. In the present
paper we discuss some such purposes for which a \emph{stochastic} model is
preferable to a \emph{deterministic} counterpart. The two main examples
illustrate the importance of allowing the infectious and latent periods to be
random when focus lies on the \emph{probability} of a large epidemic outbreak
and/or on the initial \emph{speed}, or growth rate, of the epidemic. A
consequence of the latter is that estimation of the basic reproduction number
$R_0$ is sensitive to assumptions about the distributions of the infectious and
latent periods when using the data from the early stages of an outbreak, which
we illustrate with data from the SARS outbreak. Some further examples are also
discussed as are some practical consequences related to these stochastic
aspects.
