Within a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model we analyze the conditions under
which a bosonic heat bath can entangle two microscopic quantum systems at a
distance $r$. We find that the attainable entanglement is extremely
distance-sensitive. Significant entanglement can only be achieved if the
systems are within a {\em microscopic} distance that is of order of the cut-off
wavelength $\lambda$ of the system-bath interaction. At larger distances the
maximal entanglement is exponentially suppressed with a decay length of order
$\lambda$. We conclude that entanglement generation via a heat bath is not
suitable for entangling remote objects.
