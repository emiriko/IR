In this paper we develop techniques that eliminate the need of the
Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) from various (almost all) known results
about deterministic polynomial factoring over finite fields. Our main result
shows that given a polynomial f(x) of degree n over a finite field k, we can
find in deterministic poly(n^{\log n},\log |k|) time "either" a nontrivial
factor of f(x) "or" a nontrivial automorphism of k[x]/(f(x)) of order n. This
main tool leads to various new GRH-free results, most striking of which are:
  (1) Given a noncommutative algebra over a finite field, we can find a zero
divisor in deterministic subexponential time.
  (2) Given a positive integer r such that either 8|r or r has at least two
distinct odd prime factors. There is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm
to find a nontrivial factor of the r-th cyclotomic polynomial over a finite
field.
  In this paper, following the seminal work of Lenstra (1991) on constructing
isomorphisms between finite fields, we further generalize classical Galois
theory constructs like cyclotomic extensions, Kummer extensions, Teichmuller
subgroups, to the case of commutative semisimple algebras with automorphisms.
These generalized constructs help eliminate the dependence on GRH.
