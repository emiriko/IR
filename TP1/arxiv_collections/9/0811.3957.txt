We investigate the predictions of a simple extension of the Standard Model
where the Higgs sector is composed of one $SU(2)_L$ doublet and one real
triplet. We discuss the general features of the model, including its vacuum
structure, theoretical and phenomenological constraints, and expectations for
Higgs collider studies. The model predicts the existence of a pair of light
charged scalars and, for vanishing triplet vacuum expectation value, contains a
cold dark matter candidate. When the latter possibility occurs, the charged
scalars are long-lived, leading to a prediction of distinctive single charged
track with missing transverse energy or double charged track events at the LHC.
The model predicts a significant excess of two-photon events compared to SM
expectations due to the presence of a light charged scalar.
