The macroscopic behavior of dissipative stochastic partial differential
equations usually can be described by a finite dimensional system. This article
proves that a macroscopic reduced model may be constructed for stochastic
reaction-diffusion equations with cubic nonlinearity by artificial separating
the system into two distinct slow-fast time parts. An averaging method and a
deviation estimate show that the macroscopic reduced model should be a
stochastic ordinary equation which includes the random effect transmitted from
the microscopic timescale due to the nonlinear interaction. Numerical
simulations of an example stochastic heat equation confirms the predictions of
this stochastic modelling theory. This theory empowers us to better model the
long time dynamics of complex stochastic systems.
