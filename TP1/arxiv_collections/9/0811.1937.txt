Quantum-confined semiconductor structures are the cornerstone of modern-day
electronics. Spatial confinement in these structures leads to formation of
discrete low-dimensional subbands. At room temperature, carriers transfer among
different states due to efficient scattering with phonons, charged impurities,
surface roughness and other electrons, so transport is scattering-limited
(diffusive) and well described by the Boltzmann transport equation. In this
review, we present the theoretical framework used for the description and
simulation of diffusive electron transport in quasi-two-dimensional and
quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor structures. Transport in silicon MOSFETs
and nanowires is presented in detail.
