For $\alpha\in [1,2)$ we consider operators of the form $$L f(x)=\int_{R^d}
[f(x+h)-f(x)-1_{(|h|\leq 1)} \nabla f(x)\cdot h]
\frac{A(x,h)}{|h|^{d+\alpha}}$$ and for $\alpha\in (0,1)$ we consider the same
operator but where the $\nabla f$ term is omitted. We prove, under appropriate
conditions on $A(x,h)$, that the solution $u$ to $L u=f$ will be in
$C^{\alpha+\beta}$ if $f\in C^\beta$.
