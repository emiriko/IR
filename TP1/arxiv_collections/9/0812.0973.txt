We use Raman-detuned laser pulses to achieve spatially-varying control of the
amplitude and phase of the spinor order parameter of a Bose-Einstein
condensate. We present experimental results confirming precise radial and
azimuthal control of amplitude and phase during the creation of
vortex-antivortex superposition states.
