The subject of this paper is a fragmentation equation with nonconservative
solutions, some mass being lost to a dust of zero-mass particles as a
consequence of an intensive splitting. Under some assumptions of regular
variation on the fragmentation rate, we describe the large time behavior of
solutions. Our approach is based on probabilistic tools: the solutions to the
fragmentation equation are constructed via nonincreasing self-similar Markov
processes that continuously reach 0 in finite time. Our main probabilistic
result describes the asymptotic behavior of these processes conditioned on
nonextinction and is then used for the solutions to the fragmentation equation.
We note that two parameters significantly influence these large time behaviors:
the rate of formation of "nearly-1 relative masses" (this rate is related to
the behavior near 0 of the L\'evy measure associated with the corresponding
self-similar Markov process) and the distribution of large initial particles.
Correctly rescaled, the solutions then converge to a nontrivial limit which is
related to the quasi-stationary solutions of the equation. Besides, these
quasi-stationary solutions, or, equivalently, the quasi-stationary
distributions of the self-similar Markov processes, are fully described.
