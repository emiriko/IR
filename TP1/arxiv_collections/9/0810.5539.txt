To enable the study of criticality in multicomponent fluids, the standard
spherical model is generalized to describe an $\ns$-species hard core lattice
gas. On introducing $\ns$ spherical constraints, the free energy may be
expressed generally in terms of an $\ns\times\ns$ matrix describing the species
interactions. For binary systems, thermodynamic properties have simple
expressions, while all the pair correlation functions are combinations of just
two eigenmodes. When only hard-core and short-range overall attractive
interactions are present, a choice of variables relates the behavior to that of
one-component systems. Criticality occurs on a locus terminating a coexistence
surface; however, except at some special points, an unexpected
``demagnetization effect'' suppresses the normal divergence of susceptibilities
at criticality and distorts two-phase coexistence. This effect, unphysical for
fluids, arises from a general lack of symmetry and from the vectorial and
multicomponent character of the spherical model. Its origin can be understood
via a mean-field treatment of an XY spin system below criticality.
