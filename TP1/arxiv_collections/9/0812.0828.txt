The present paper is based on the assumption that heavy quarks bound states
exist in the Standard Model (SM). Considering New Bound States (NBS) of
top-anti-top quarks (named T-balls) we have shown that: 1) there exists the
scalar 1S--bound state of $6t+6\bar t$; 2) the forces which bind the top-quarks
are very strong and almost completely compensate the mass of the twelve
top-anti-top-quarks in the scalar NBS; 3) such strong forces are produced by
the Higgs-top-quarks interaction with a large value of the top-quark Yukawa
coupling constant $g_t\simeq 1$. Theory also predicts the existence of the NBS
$6t + 5\bar t$, which is a color triplet and a fermion similar to the
$t'$-quark of the fourth generation. We have also considered the
"b-quark-replaced" NBS, estimated the masses of the lightest fermionic NBS:
$M_{NBS}\gtrsim 300$ GeV, and discussed the larger masses of T-balls. We have
developed a theory of the scalar T-ball's condensate and predicted the
existence of three SM phases. Searching for heavy quark bound states at the
Tevatron and LHC is discussed. We have constructed the possible form-factors of
T-balls, and estimated the charge multiplicity coming from the T-ball's decays.
