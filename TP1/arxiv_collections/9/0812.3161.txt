We provide a short summary of three-flavour neutrino oscillation parameters
as determined from a global fit to 2008 data, and we comment on possible hints
in favour of a non-zero value of the mixing angle theta_{13} found in
arXiv:0806.2649. We do confirm a hint from solar + KamLAND data at about 1.5
sigma, which can be understood from the recent SNO CC/NC measurment. However,
we show that a claimed hint from atmospheric data is much less robust. It
depends on details of event rate calculations and treatment of theoretical
uncertainties. We could identify two data points showing an 'excess' (at the 1
sigma level) in the SK-I multi-GeV e-like data, which seem to be the origin of
the slight preference for theta_{13} > 0. We point out that once SK-I and SK-II
data are combined this 'excess' disappears, and irrespective of the details of
the analysis, no 'hint' from atmospheric data is obtained for the SK-I and
SK-II combined data set. As a result the global fit of all data leads to a best
fit value of theta_{13} consistent with zero within less than 1 sigma.
