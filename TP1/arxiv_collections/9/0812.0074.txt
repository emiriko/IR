We calculate the relative entropy of entanglement for rotationally invariant
states of spin-1/2 and arbitrary spin-$j$ particles or of spin-1 particle and
spin-$j$ particle with integer $j$. A lower bound of relative entropy of
entanglement and an upper bound of distillable entanglement are presented for
rotationally invariant states of spin-1 particle and spin-$j$ particle with
half-integer $j$.
