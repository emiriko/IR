We report transport and thermodynamic properties of stoichiometric single
crystals of the hexagonal iron-pnictide FeCrAs. The in-plane resistivity shows
an unusual "non-metallic" dependence on temperature T, rising continuously with
decreasing T from ~ 800 K to below 100 mK. The c-axis resistivity is similar,
except for a sharp drop upon entry into an antiferromagnetic state at T_N 125
K. Below 10 K the resistivity follows a non-Fermi-liquid power law, rho(T) =
rho_0 - AT^x with x<1, while the specific heat shows Fermi liquid behaviour
with a large Sommerfeld coefficient, gamma ~ 30 mJ/mol K^2. The high
temperature properties are reminiscent of those of the parent compounds of the
new layered iron-pnictide superconductors, however the T -> 0 properties
suggest a new class of non-Fermi liquid.
