Ultracold atoms are increasingly used for high precision experiments that can
be utilized to extract accurate scattering properties. This calls for a
stronger need to improve on the accuracy of interatomic potentials, and in
particular the usually rather inaccurate inner-range potentials. A boundary
condition for this inner range can be conveniently given via the accumulated
phase method. However, in this approach one should satisfy two conditions,
which are in principle conflicting, and the validity of these approximations
comes under stress when higher precision is required. We show that a better
compromise between the two is possible by allowing for an adiabatic change of
the hyperfine mixing of singlet and triplet states for interatomic distances
smaller than the separation radius. A mass scaling approach to relate
accumulated phase parameters in a combined analysis of isotopically related
atom pairs is described in detail and its accuracy is estimated, taking into
account both Born-Oppenheimer and WKB breakdown. We demonstrate how numbers of
singlet and triplet bound states follow from the mass scaling.
