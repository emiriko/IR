We investigate the structure of an alternative finite dimensional
$\Q$-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ subject to the condition that for a $\Z$-order
$\Gamma \subset \mathfrak{A}$, and thus for every $\Z$-order of $\mathfrak{A}$,
the loop of units of $\U (\Gamma)$ does not contain a free abelian subgroup of
rank two. In particular, we prove that the radical of such an algebra
associates with the whole algebra. We also classify $RA$-loops $L$ for which
$\mathbb{Z}L$ has this property. The classification for group rings is still an
open problem.
