The properties of cold and dense quark matter have been the subject of
extensive investigation, especially in the last decade. Unfortunately, we still
lack of a complete understanding of the properties of matter in these
conditions. One possibility is that quark matter is in a color superconducting
phase which is characterized by the formation of a diquark condensate. We
review some of the basic concepts of color superconductivity and some of the
aspects of this phase of matter which are relevant for compact stars. Since
quarks have color, flavor as well as spin degrees of freedom many different
color superconducting phases can be realized. At asymptotic densities QCD
predicts that the color flavor locked phase is favored. At lower densities
where the QCD coupling constant is large, perturbative methods cannot be
applied and one has to rely on some effective model, eventually trying to
constrain such a model with experimental observations. The picture is
complicated by the requirement that matter in the interior of compact stars is
in weak equilibrium and neutral. These conditions and the (possible) large
value of the strange quark mass conspire to separate the Fermi momenta of
quarks with different flavors, rendering homogenous superconducting phases
unstable. One of the aims of this presentation is to introduce non-experts in
the field to some of the basic ideas of color superconductivity and to some of
its open problems.
