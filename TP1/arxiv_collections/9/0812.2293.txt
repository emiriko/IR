Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are quasi-one-dimensional systems
with poor Coulomb screening and enhanced electron-phonon interaction, and are
good candidates for excitons and exciton-phonon couplings in metallic state.
Here we report back scattering reflection experiments on individual metallic
SWCNTs. An exciton-phonon sideband separated by 0.19 eV from the first optical
transition peak is observed in a metallic SWCNT of chiral index (13,10), which
provides clear evidences of excitons in metallic SWCNTs. A static dielectric
constant of 10 is estimated from the reflectance spectrum.
