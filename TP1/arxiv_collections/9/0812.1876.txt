A motivation for the study of symmetric pair plasma dynamics lies in the
insight they provide into the dynamics of more general plasmas. In the
symmetric pair plasma, when temperature both species is the same, acoustic wave
are absent. However in presence other species (impurities) in fullerene pair
plasmas. for example two-temperature electrons, acoustic waves are possible.
