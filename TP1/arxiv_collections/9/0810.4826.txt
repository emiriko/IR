We describe the construction which takes as input a profinite group, which
when applied the the absolute Galois group of a geometric field F agrees in
some cases with the algebraic K-theory of F. We prove that it agrees in the
case of a topologically finitely generated abelian absolute Galois group, and
conjecture that it agrees for all geometric fields. We also discuss properties
of the construction, including relationships with the representation theory of
infinite discrete groups.
