We report analytical calculations for the propagation of electromagnetic
radiation through an inhomogeneous layer whose refractive index varies in one
dimension situated between bulk right- and left-handed media. Significant field
localization is generated in the layer that is caused by the coherent
superposition of evanescent waves. The strength of the field localization and
the transmission properties of the layer are investigated as a function of the
layer width, losses and defects in the refractive index; the former two being
modelled by continuous changes, and the latter by discontinuous changes, in the
index profile.
