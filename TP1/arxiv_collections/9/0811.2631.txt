Recent controversy on the quantum dots dephasing mechanisms (between pure and
inelastic) is re-examined by isolating the quantum dots from their substrate by
using the appropriate limits of the ionization energy theory and the quantum
adiabatic theorem. When the phonons in the quantum dots are isolated
adiabatically from the phonons in the substrate, the elastic or pure dephasing
becomes the dominant mechanism. On the other hand, for the case where the
phonons from the substrate are non-adiabatically coupled to the quantum dots,
the inelastic dephasing process takes over. This switch-over is due to
different elemental composition in quantum dots as compared to its substrate.
We also provide unambiguous analyses as to understand why GaAs/AlGaAs quantum
dots may only have pure dephasing while InAs/GaAs quantum dots give rise to the
inelastic dephasing as the dominant mechanism. Our study accentuates the
importance of the elemental composition (of both quantum dots and substrate) in
evaluating the dephasing mechanisms of quantum dots.
