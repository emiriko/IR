Here a new condition for the geometry of Banach spaces is introduced and the
operator--valued Fourier multiplier theorems in weighted Besov spaces are
obtained. Particularly, connections between the geometry of Banach spaces and
Hormander-Mikhlin conditions are established. As an application of main results
the regularity properties of degenerate elliptic differential operator
equations are investigated.
