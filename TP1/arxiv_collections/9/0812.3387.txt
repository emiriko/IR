We show that non-abelian quantum Hall states can be identified by
experimental measurements of the temperature-dependence of either the
electrochemical potential or the orbital magnetization. The predicted signals
of non-abelian statistics are within experimental resolution, and can be
clearly distinguished from other contributions under realistic circumstances.
The proposed measurement technique also has the potential to resolve
spin-ordering transitions in low density electronic systems in the Wigner
crystal and strongly-interacting Luttinger liquid regimes.
