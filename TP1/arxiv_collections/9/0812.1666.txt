We explore the possibilities of constructing bulk spacetimes in five
dimensions for warped braneworld models with a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) line element on the 3-brane and with a
time-dependent extra dimension. Our first step in this direction involves
looking at the status of energy conditions when such a bulk line element is
assumed. We check these conditions by analysing the relevant inequalities, for
specific functional forms (chosen to satisfy certain desirable features) of the
warp factor, the cosmological scale factor and the extra-dimensional scale
factor. Subsequently, we aim at obtaining solutions with different types of
bulk matter sources. We begin with a general analysis of the solution space of
non-singular Randall-Sundrum type bulk models with an exponential warp factor
and a chosen equation of state. Thereafter, we focus on three specific bulk
sources -- the ordinary scalar field, the Brans-Dicke scalar and the dilaton.
In each case, we are able to solve the field equations and obtain desirable
solutions for which, we once again check the viability of the energy
conditions. We also show how one can place branes in the bulk using the
junction conditions. The issue of resolution of the bulk singularities which
appear in our solutions, using standard methods, is also presented briefly. In
summary, we are able to demonstrate, that it is indeed possible to construct
viable bulk spacetimes for warped cosmological braneworlds with a time-varying
extra dimension and with bulk matter satisfying the energy conditions.
