In this paper we investigate "Warm Electron Injection" as a mechanism for NOR
programming of double-gate SONOS memories through 2D full band Monte Carlo
simulations. Warm electron injection is characterized by an applied VDS smaller
than 3.15 V, so that electrons cannot easily accumulate a kinetic energy larger
than the height of the Si/SiO2 barrier. We perform a time-dependent simulation
of the program operation where the local gate current density is computed with
a continuum-based method and is adiabatically separated from the 2D full Monte
Carlo simulation used for obtaining the electron distribution in the phase
space. In this way we are able to compute the time evolution of the charge
stored in the nitride and of the threshold voltages corresponding to forward
and reverse bias. We show that warm electron injection is a viable option for
NOR programming in order to reduce power supply, preserve reliability and CMOS
logic level compatibility. In addition, it provides a well localized charge,
offering interesting perspectives for multi-level and dual bit operation, even
in devices with negligible short channel effects.
