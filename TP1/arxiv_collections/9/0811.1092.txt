We investigate experiments of continuous-variable quantum information
processing based on the teleportation scheme. Quantum teleportation, which is
realized by a two-mode squeezed vacuum state and measurement-and-feedforward,
is considered as an elementary quantum circuit as well as quantum
communication. By modifying ancilla states or measurement-and-feedforwards, we
can realize various quantum circuits which suffice for universal quantum
computation. In order to realize the teleportation-based computation we improve
the level of squeezing, and fidelity of teleportation. With a high-fidelity
teleporter we demonstrate some advanced teleportation experiments, i.e.,
teleportation of a squeezed state and sequential teleportation of a coherent
state. Moreover, as an example of the teleportation-based computation, we build
a QND interaction gate which is a continuous-variable analog of a CNOT gate. A
QND interaction gate is constructed only with ancillary squeezed vacuum states
and measurement-and-feedforwards. We also create continuous-variable four mode
cluster type entanglement for further application, namely, one-way quantum
computation.
