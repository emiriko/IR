We have performed a first-principles study on the deformation effect of the
electronic structures of graphite nanoribbon arrays with zigzag edges on both
sides, and the edge atoms are terminated with hydrogen atoms. A uniaxial strain
is considered to have deformation effect on the graphite nanoribbons. We found
that the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spin polarizing edges of graphite
nanoribbon is still more favorable than that with the ferromagnetic arrangement
under deformation. We also learned that a tensile strain increases the
magnetization of the graphite ribbon while a compressive strain decreases it. A
positive pressure derivative of the band gap of antiferromagnetic state is
observed for the graphite nanoribbon under uniaxial strains. The strain changes
the shape of band structure and the band gap; in here, the edge atoms play a
crucial role. The deformations are also found to influence the contribution of
the edge atoms to the bands near the Fermi level. The deformation effect for
the graphite nanoribbon under transverse electric field is also studied.
