The electron-electron correlations in a many-electron (Ne = 1, 2,..., 5)
quantum dot confined by a parabolic potential is investigated in the presence
of a single magnetic ion and a perpendicular magnetic field. We obtained the
energy spectrum and calculated the addition energy which exhibits cusps as
function of the magnetic field. The vortex properties of the many-particle wave
function of the ground state are studied and for large magnetic fields are
related to composite fermions. The position of the impurity influences strongly
the spin pair correlation function when the external field is large. In small
applied magnetic field, the spin exchange energy together with the Zeeman terms
leads to a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic(FM-AFM) transition. When the
magnetic ion is shifted away from the center of the quantum dot a remarkable
re-entrant AFM-FM-AFM transition is found as function of the strength of the
Coulomb interaction. Thermodynamic quantities as the heat capacity, the
magnetization, and the susceptibility are also studied. Cusps in the energy
levels show up as peaks in the heat capacity and the susceptibility.
