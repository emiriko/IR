The purpose of this paper is to study the generalized Fong--Vasicek
two-factor interest rate model with stochastic volatility. In this model the
dispersion of the stochastic short rate (square of volatility) is assumed to be
stochastic as well and it follows a non-negative process with volatility
proportional to the square root of dispersion. The drift of the stochastic
process for the dispersion is assumed to be in a rather general form including,
in particular, linear function having one root (yielding the original
Fong--Vasicek model or a cubic like function having three roots (yielding a
generalized Fong--Vasicek model for description of the volatility clustering).
We consider averaged bond prices with respect to the limiting distribution of
stochastic dispersion. The averaged bond prices depend on time and current
level of the short rate like it is the case in many popular one-factor interest
rate model including in particular the Vasicek and Cox--Ingersoll-Ross model.
However, as a main result of this paper we show that there is no such
one-factor model yielding the same bond prices as the averaged values described
above.
