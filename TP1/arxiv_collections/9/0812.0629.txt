We propose and analyze a dynamic implementation of the property-rights model
of cognitive radio. A primary link has the possibility to lease the owned
spectrum to a MAC network of secondary nodes, in exchange for cooperation in
the form of distributed space-time coding (DSTC). The cooperation and
competition between the primary and secondary network are cast in the framework
of sequential game. On one hand, the primary link attempts to maximize its
quality of service in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR);
on the other hand, nodes in the secondary network compete for transmission
within the leased time-slot following a power control mechanism. We consider
both a baseline model with complete information and a more practical version
with incomplete information, using the backward induction approach for the
former and providing approximate algorithm for the latter. Analysis and
numerical results show that our models and algorithms provide a promising
framework for fair and effective spectrum sharing, both between primary and
secondary networks and among secondary nodes.
