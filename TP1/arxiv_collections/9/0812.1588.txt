We describe the calculation of the two--loop massive operator matrix elements
for massive external fermions. These matrix elements are needed for the
calculation of the $O(\alpha^2)$ initial state radiative corrections to
$e^+e^-$ annihilation into a neutral virtual gauge boson, based on the
renormalization group technique.
