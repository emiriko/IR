The recent observation of the mass difference in $B_s$ system seems to be not
in complete agreement with the corresponding standard model value. We consider
the model with an extra vector like down quark to explain this discrepancy and
obtain the constraints on the new physics parameters. Thereafter, we show that
with these new constraints this model can successfully explain other observed
deviations associated with $b \to s$ transitions, namely, $B_s \to \psi \phi$,
$B\to K \pi$ and $B\to \phi K_s$.
