A unified summary is given of the existence theory of Stein manifolds in all
dimensions, based on published and pending literature. Eliashberg's
characterization of manifolds admitting Stein structures requires an extra
delicate hypothesis in complex dimension 2, which can be eliminated by passing
to the topological setting and invoking Freedman theory. The situation is quite
similar if one asks which open subsets of a fixed complex manifold can be made
Stein by an isotopy. As an application of these theorems, one can construct
uncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic R^4's realized as Stein open
subsets of C^2 (i.e. domains of holomorphy). More generally, every domain of
holomorphy in C^2 is topologically isotopic to other such domains realizing
uncountably many diffeomorphism types. Any tame n-complex in a complex
n-manifold can be isotoped to become a nested intersection of Stein open
subsets, provided the isotopy is topological when n=2. In the latter case, the
Stein neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but frequently realize uncountably many
diffeomorphism types. It is also proved that every exhausting Morse function
can be subdivided to yield a locally finite handlebody of the same maximal
index, both in the context of smooth n-manifolds and for Stein surfaces.
