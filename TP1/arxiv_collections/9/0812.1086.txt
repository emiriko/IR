Thalamic relay cells fire action potentials that transmit information from
retina to cortex. The amount of information that spike trains encode is usually
estimated from the precision of spike timing with respect to the stimulus.
Sensory input, however, is only one factor that influences neural activity. For
example, intrinsic dynamics, such as oscillations of networks of neurons, also
modulate firing pattern. Here, we asked if retinal oscillations might help to
convey information to neurons downstream. Specifically, we made whole-cell
recordings from relay cells to reveal retinal inputs (EPSPs) and thalamic
outputs (spikes) and analyzed these events with information theory. Our results
show that thalamic spike trains operate as two multiplexed channels. One
channel, which occupies a low frequency band (<30 Hz), is encoded by average
firing rate with respect to the stimulus and carries information about local
changes in the image over time. The other operates in the gamma frequency band
(40-80 Hz) and is encoded by spike time relative to the retinal oscillations.
Because these oscillations involve extensive areas of the retina, it is likely
that the second channel transmits information about global features of the
visual scene. At times, the second channel conveyed even more information than
the first.
