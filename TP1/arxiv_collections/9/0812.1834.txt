Relativistic Faddeev equations for three-body scattering are solved at
arbitrary energies in terms of momentum vectors without employing a partial
wave decomposition. Relativistic invariance is incorporated withing the
framework of Poincar\'e invariant quantum mechanics. Based on a Malfliet-Tjon
interaction, observables for elastic and breakup scattering are calculated and
compared to non-relativistic ones.
