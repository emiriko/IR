In supersymmetric quantum mechanics, exact-solvability of one-dimensional
quantum systems can be classified only with an additional assumption of
integrability, the so-called shape invariance condition. In this paper we show
that in the prepotential approach we proposed previously, shape invariance is
automatically satisfied and needs not be assumed.
