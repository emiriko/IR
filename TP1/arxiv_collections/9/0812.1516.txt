We extend entangled coincidence (ghost) imaging to fluorescent samples. Given
the entangled photon correlation, one photon of the pair carries information on
where the other photon has been absorbed and has produced fluorescence in a
sample. Fluorescent molecules serve as ''detectors breaking'' the entanglement.
