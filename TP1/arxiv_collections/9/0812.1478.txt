We calculate transverse momentum distribution of direct photons from various
sources by taking into account the initial state momentum anisotropy of {\em
Quark-Gluon-Plasma} (QGP) and late stage transverse flow effects. The total
photon yield, calculated for various combinations of initial conditions,
transition temperatures, is then compared with the recent measurement of photon
transverse momentum distribution by the PHENIX collaboration. It is shown that
the presence of such an anisotropy can describe the PHENIX photon data better
than the isotropic case. We show that the isotropization time thus extracted
remains of the order of 1 fm/c and is almost insensitive to the initial
conditions used.
