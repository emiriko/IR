In [arXiv:0804.3035] we studied an interacting particle system which can be
also interpreted as a stochastic growth model. This model belongs to the
anisotropic KPZ class in 2+1 dimensions. In this paper we present the results
that are relevant from the perspective of stochastic growth models, in
particular: (a) the surface fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian on a
sqrt(ln(t)) scale and (b) the correlation structure of the surface is
asymptotically given by the massless field.
