We present two classical conjectures concerning the characterization of
manifolds: the Bing Borsuk Conjecture asserts that every $n$-dimensional
homogeneous ANR is a topological $n$-manifold, whereas the Busemann Conjecture
asserts that every $n$-dimensional $G$-space is a topological $n$-manifold. The
key object in both cases are so-called {\it generalized manifolds}, i.e. ENR
homology manifolds. We look at the history, from the early beginnings to the
present day. We also list several open problems and related conjectures.
