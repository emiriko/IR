The prospects for central exclusive diffractive (CED) production of MSSM
Higgs bosons at the LHC are reviewed. These processes can provide important
information on the $\cp$-even Higgs bosons, allowing to probe interesting
regions of the $\MA$--$\tb$ parameter plane. The sensitivity of the searches in
the forward proton mode for the Higgs bosons in the so-called CDM-benchmark
scenarios and the effects of fourth-generation models on the CED Higgs
production are briefly discussed.
