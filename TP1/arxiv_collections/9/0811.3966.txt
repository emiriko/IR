We consider the initial value problem for the spherically symmetric, focusing
cubic wave equation in three spatial dimensions. We give numerical and
analytical evidence for the existence of a universal attractor which
encompasses both global and blowup solutions. As a byproduct we get an explicit
description of the critical behavior at the threshold of blowup.
