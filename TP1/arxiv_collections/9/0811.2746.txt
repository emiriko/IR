The purpose of this paper is to develop the theory of holomorphic gerbes on
complex tori in a manner analogous to the classical theory for line bundles. In
contrast to past studies on this subject, we do not restrict to the case where
these gerbes are torsion or topologically trivial. We give an Appell-Humbert
type description of all holomorphic gerbes on complex tori. This gives an
explicit, simple, cocycle representative (and hence gerbe) for each equivalence
class of holomorphic gerbes. We also prove that a gerbe on the fiber product of
four spaces over a common base is trivial as long as it is trivial upon
restriction to any three out of the four spaces. A fine moduli stack for gerbes
on complex tori is constructed. This involves the construction of a
'Poincar\'e' gerbe which plays a role analogous to the role of the Poincar\'e
bundle in the case of line bundles.
