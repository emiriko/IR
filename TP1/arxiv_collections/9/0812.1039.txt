In this paper we describe progress made toward the construction of the
Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory of knot invariants from the geometric point of
view. This is done in the perspective of a joint result of the author with A.
Uribe which relates the quantum group and the Weyl quantizations of the moduli
space of flat SU(2)-connections on the tours. Two results are emphasized: the
reconstruction from Weyl quantization of the restriction to the torus of the
modular functor, and a description of a basis of the space of quantum
observables on the torus in terms of colored curves, which answers a question
related to quantum computing.
