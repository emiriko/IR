We have used Galois lattices for mining hydrobiological data. These data are
about macrophytes, that are macroscopic plants living in water bodies. These
plants are characterized by several biological traits, that own several
modalities. Our aim is to cluster the plants according to their common traits
and modalities and to find out the relations between traits. Galois lattices
are efficient methods for such an aim, but apply on binary data. In this
article, we detail a few approaches we used to transform complex
hydrobiological data into binary data and compare the first results obtained
thanks to Galois lattices.
