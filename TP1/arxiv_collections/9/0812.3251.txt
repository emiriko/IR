Dielectric response as a function of frequency for high-permittivity
dielectric and ferroelectric materials is discussed emphasizing the dynamic
behaviour in the microwave and infrared range. After introducing the usual
modelling of the polar phonon response and anharmonic hopping in locally
dynamically disordered solids, including discussion of displacive and
order-disorder ferroelectric phase transitions, we summarised the experimental
data for selected ferroelectric, incipient ferroelectric and antiferroelectric
perovskite ceramics (STO, BTO, BST, PZO), discussing the dielectric grain size
effect due to a low-permittivity (dead) grain-boundary layer. Other important
structural types of ferroelectrics (Aurivillius compounds SBT, pyrochlores CNO,
PMN) are mentioned, as well. Attention is then paid to relaxor ferroelectrics
(PLZT, PMN, PMT, PST, NBT of perovskite structure and SBN and a novel BLNTN
solid solution system and SLTN of tungsten-bronze structure) and their
extremely broad and complex dielectric dispersion. Then some new results on
magnetoelectric multiferroics (BiFeO3, BiFe_(1/2)Cr_(1/2)O3, EuTiO3) are
summarised and finally our results on microwave ceramics (used for microwave
applications) are noted, discussing mainly the problem of extrapolating the
microwave dielectric properties from the infrared and THz range. A glossary is
added, briefly explaining the meaning of several concepts which might not be
quite familiar for the reader.
