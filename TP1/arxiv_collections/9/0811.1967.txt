We propose a scheme leading to a non-perturbative definition of lattice field
theories which are scale-invariant on the quantum level. A key idea of the
construction is the replacement of the lattice spacing by a propagating
dynamical field -- the dilaton. We describe how to select non-perturbatively
the phenomenologically viable theories where the scale invariance is broken
spontaneously. Relation to gravity is also discussed.
