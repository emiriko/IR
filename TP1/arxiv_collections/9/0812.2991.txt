Health Practice Guideliens are supposed to unify practices and propose
recommendations to physicians. This paper describes GemFrame, a system capable
of semi-automatically filling an XML template from free texts in the clinical
domain. The XML template includes semantic information not explicitly encoded
in the text (pairs of conditions and ac-tions/recommendations). Therefore,
there is a need to compute the exact scope of condi-tions over text sequences
expressing the re-quired actions. We present a system developped for this task.
We show that it yields good performance when applied to the analysis of French
practice guidelines. We conclude with a precise evaluation of the tool.
