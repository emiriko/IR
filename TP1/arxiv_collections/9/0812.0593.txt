We show exactly that the only charged excitations that exist in the
strong-coupling limit of the half-filled Hubbard model are gapped composite
excitations generated by the dynamics of the charge $2e$ boson that appears
upon explicit integration of the high-energy scale. At every momentum, such
excitations have non-zero spectral weight at two distinct energy scales
separated by the on-site repulsion $U$. The result is a gap in the spectrum for
the composite excitations accompanied by a discontinuous vanishing of the
density of states at the chemical potential when $U$ exceeds the bandwidth.
Consequently, we resolve the long-standing problem of the cause of the charge
gap in a half-filled band in the absence of symmetry breaking.
