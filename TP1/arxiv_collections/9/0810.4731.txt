We present an analytical and computational study of resonances and transient
responses in a classical Josephson junction system. A theoretical basis for
resonances in a superconducting loop with three junctions is presented,
outlining both the direct relationship between the dynamics of single- and
multi-junction systems, and the direct relationships between observations of
the classical counterparts to Rabi oscillations, Ramsey fringes, and spin echo
oscillations in this class of systems. We show simulations data along with
analytical analyses of the classical model, and the results are related to
previously reported experiments conducted on three junction loops. We further
investigate the effect of off-resonant microwave perturbations to, e.g., the
Rabi-type response of the Josephson system, and we relate this response back to
the nonlinear and multi-valued resonance behavior previously reported for a
single Josephson junction. The close relationships between single and
multi-junction behavior demonstrates the underlying dynamical mechanism for a
whole class of classical counterparts to expected quantum mechanical
observations in a variety of systems; namely the resonant and transient
behavior of a particle in an anharmonic potential well with subsequent escape.
