M\"{o}bius strips with one, two, three, and four, half-twists are shown to be
generic features of three-dimensional (nonparaxial) elliptically polarized
light. The geometry and topology of these unusual singularities is described
and the multitude of winding numbers that characterize their structures is
enumerated; probabilities for the appearance of different configurations are
presented.
