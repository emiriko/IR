Since the end of the XIXth century, we know that each birational map of the
complex projective plane is the product of a finite number of quadratic
birational maps of the projective plane; this motivates our work which
essentially deals with these quadratic maps. We establish algebraic properties
such as the classification of one parameter groups of quadratic birational maps
or the smoothness of the set of quadratic birational maps in the set of
rational maps. We prove that a finite number of generic quadratic birational
maps generates a free group. We show that if f is a quadratic birational map or
an automorphism of the projective plane, the normal subgroup generated by f is
the full group of birational maps of the projective plane, which implies that
this group is perfect. We study some dynamical properties: following an idea of
Guillot, we translate some invariants for foliations in our context, in
particular we obtain that if two generic quadratic birational maps are
birationally conjugated, then they are conjugated by an automorphism of the
projective plane. We are also interested in the presence of "invariant
objects": curves, foliations, fibrations. Then follows a more experimental
part: we draw orbits of quadratic birational maps with real coefficients and
sets analogous to Julia sets for polynomials of one variable. We study
birational maps of degree 3 and, by considering the different possible
configurations of the exceptional curves, we give the "classification" of these
maps. We can deduce from this that the set of the birational maps of degree 3
exactly is irreducible, in fact rationally connected.
