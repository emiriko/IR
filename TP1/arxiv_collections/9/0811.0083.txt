Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is extensively used for real parameter
optimization in diverse fields of study. This paper describes an application of
PSO to the problem of designing a fractional-order
proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller whose parameters comprise
proportionality constant, integral constant, derivative constant, integral
order (lambda) and derivative order (delta). The presence of five optimizable
parameters makes the task of designing a FOPID controller more challenging than
conventional PID controller design. Our design method focuses on minimizing the
Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) criterion. The digital realization of the
deigned system utilizes the Tustin operator-based continued fraction expansion
scheme. We carry out a simulation that illustrates the effectiveness of the
proposed approach especially for realizing fractional-order plants. This paper
also attempts to study the behavior of fractional PID controller vis-a-vis that
of its integer order counterpart and demonstrates the superiority of the former
to the latter.
