The countably infinite number of Virasoro representations of the logarithmic
minimal model LM(p,p') can be reorganized into a finite number of
W-representations with respect to the extended Virasoro algebra symmetry W.
Using a lattice implementation of fusion, we recently determined the fusion
algebra of these representations and found that it closes, albeit without an
identity for p>1. Here, we provide a fusion-matrix realization of this fusion
algebra and identify a fusion ring isomorphic to it. We also consider various
extensions of it and quotients thereof, and introduce and analyze commutative
diagrams with morphisms between the involved fusion algebras and the
corresponding quotient polynomial fusion rings. One particular extension is
reminiscent of the fundamental fusion algebra of LM(p,p') and offers a natural
way of introducing the missing identity for p>1. Working out explicit fusion
matrices is facilitated by a further enlargement based on a pair of mutual
Moore-Penrose inverses intertwining between the W-fundamental and enlarged
fusion algebras.
