We study light scalar mesons in the AdS/QCD soft-wall model with a background
dilaton field, to investigate the features of this approach in describing QCD
properties in the strong coupling regime. We find that the masses and decay
constants are compatible with experiment and QCD determinations if $a_0(980)$
and $f_0(980)$ are identified as the lightest scalar mesons; moreover, the
states are organized in linear Regge trajectories with the same slope of vector
mesons. Strong couplings of scalar states to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons
turn out to be small, at odds with experiment and QCD estimates: this
discrepancy is related to the description of chiral symmetry breaking in this
holographic model.
