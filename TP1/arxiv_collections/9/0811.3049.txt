We present a protocol to prepare decoherence free cluster states using
ultracold atoms loaded in a two dimensional superlattice. The superlattice
geometry leads to an array of 2*2 plaquettes, each of them holding four
spin-1/2 particles that can be used for encoding a single logical qubit in the
two-fold singlet subspace, insensitive to uniform magnetic field fluctuations
in any direction. Dynamical manipulation of the supperlattice yields distinct
inter and intra plaquette interactions and permits to realize one qubit and two
qubit gates with high fidelity, leading to the generation of universal cluster
states for measurement based quantum computation. Our proposal based on inter
and intra plaquette interactions also opens the path to study polymerized
Hamiltonians which support ground states describing arbitrary quantum circuits.
