Existence of the magnetic monopole is compatible with the fundamental laws of
nature, however, this illusive particle has yet to be detected experimentally.
In this work, we show that an electric charge near the topological surface
state induces an image magnetic monopole charge due to the topological
magneto-electric effect. The magnetic field generated by the image magnetic
monopole can be experimentally measured, and the inverse square law of the
field dependence can be determined quantitatively. We propose that this effect
can be used to experimentally realize a gas of quantum particles carrying
fractional statistics, consisting of the bound states of the electric charge
and the image magnetic monopole charge.
