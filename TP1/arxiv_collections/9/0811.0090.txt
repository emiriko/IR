We consider a switching rate of a meta-stable reaction scheme, which includes
reactions with arbitrary steps, e.g. $kA\to(k+r)A$. Employing WKB
approximation, controlled by a large system size, we evaluate both the exponent
and the pre-exponential factor for the rate. The results are illustrated on a
number of examples.
