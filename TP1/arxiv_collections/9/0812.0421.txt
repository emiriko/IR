We test for the existence of a spin-glass phase transition, the de
Almeida-Thouless line, in an externally-applied (random) magnetic field by
performing Monte Carlo simulations on a power-law diluted one-dimensional Ising
spin glass for very large system sizes. We find that an Almeida-Thouless line
only occurs in the mean field regime, which corresponds, for a short-range spin
glass, to dimension d larger than 6.
