In this proceeding the emergence of a composite, adjoint-scalar field as an
average over (trivial holonomy) calorons and anti-calorons is reviewed. This
composite field acts as a background field to the dynamics of perturbative
gluons, to which is coupled via an effective, gauge invariant Lagrangian valid
for temperatures above the deconfinement phase transition. Moreover, also an
Higgs mechanism is induced by the composite field: two gluons acquire a
quasi-particle thermal mass. On the phenomenological side the composite field
acts as a bag pressure which shows a linear dependence on the temperature. As a
result the linear rise with temperature of the trace anomaly is obtained and is
compared to recent lattice studies.
