Corrections to the superallowed beta decay matrix elements are evaluated in
perturbation theory using the notion of the isovector monopole resonance. The
calculation avoids the separation into different contributions and thus
presents a consistent, systematic and more transparent approach. Explicit
expressions for the Coulomb correction as a function of mass number A, are
given.
