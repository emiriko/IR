Around a metal-to-insulator transition driven by repulsive interaction (Mott
transition) the single particle excitations and the collective excitations are
equally important. Here we present results for the generic susceptibilities at
zero temperature in the half-filled Hubbard model in infinite dimensions.
Profiting from the high resolution of dynamic density-matrix renormalization at
all energies, results for the charge, spin and Cooper-pair susceptibilities in
the metallic and the insulating phase are computed. In the insulating phase, an
almost saturated local magnetic moment appears. In the metallic phase a
pronounced low-energy peak is found in the spin response.
