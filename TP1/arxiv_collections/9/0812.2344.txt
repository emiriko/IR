We investigate ultraviolet fixed points in the real-time evolution of
non-Abelian gauge fields. Classical-statistical lattice simulations reveal
equal-time correlation functions with a spectral index 3/2. Analytical
understanding of this result is achieved by employing a 2PI- loop expansion for
the quantum theory.
