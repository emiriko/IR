We study $\phi$-meson production in nuclei to investigate the in-medium
modification of the $\phi$-meson spectral function at finite density. We
consider (${\bar p},\phi$), ($\gamma,p$) and ($\pi^-,n$) reactions to produce a
$\phi$-meson inside the nucleus and evaluate the effects of the medium
modifications to reaction cross sections. The structures of the bound states,
$\phi$-mesic nuclei, are also studied. For strong absorptive interaction cases,
we need to know the spectrum shape in a wide energy region to deduce the
properties of $\phi$.
