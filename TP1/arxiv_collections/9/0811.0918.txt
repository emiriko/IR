The strong decays of the $\pi_2(1880)$ as the $2 ^1D_2$ quark-antiquark state
are investigated in the $^3P_0$ model and the flux-tube model, respectively.
The results are similar in the two models. It is found that the decay patterns
of the conventional $2 ^1D_2$ meson and the $2^{-+}$ light hybrid are very
different, and the experimental evidence for the $\pi_2(1880)$ is consistent
with it being the conventional $2 ^1D_2$ meson rather than the $2^{-+}$ light
hybrid. The possibility of the $\pi_2(1880)$ being a mixture of the
conventional $q\bar{q}$ and the hybrid is discussed.
