We present a search for high-mass neutral resonances using dimuon data
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ collected in {$p\bar
p$} collisions at {$\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 TeV} by the CDF II detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron. No significant excess above the standard model expectation
is observed in the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum. We set 95% confidence level
upper limits on $\sigma \cdot BR (p \bar{p} \to X \to \mu \bar{\mu})$, where
$X$ is a boson with spin 0, 1, or 2. Using these cross section limits, we
determine lower mass limits on sneutrinos in R-parity-violating supersymmetric
models, $Z'$ bosons, and Kaluza-Klein gravitons in the Randall-Sundrum model.
