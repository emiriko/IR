We introduce a new technique to probe the properties of an interacting cold
atomic gas that can be viewed as a dynamical compressibility measurement. We
apply this technique to the study of the superfluid to Mott insulator quantum
phase transition in one and three dimensions for a bosonic gas trapped in an
optical lattice. Excitations of the system are detected by time-of-flight
measurements. The experimental data for the one-dimensional case are in good
agreement with the results of a time-dependent density matrix renormalization
group calculation.
