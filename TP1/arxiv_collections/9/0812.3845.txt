Lattice simulations of hadronic structure are now reaching a level where they
are able to not only complement, but also provide guidance to current and
forthcoming experimental programmes at, e.g. Jefferson Lab, COMPASS/CERN and
FAIR/GSI. In this talk I review the progress that has been made in this
exciting area in the past year and discuss the advances that we can expect to
see in the coming year.Topics to be covered include form factors (including
transition form factors), moments of ordinary parton and generalised parton
distribution functions, moments of distribution amplitudes, and magnetic and
electric polarisabilities. I will also highlight the progress being made in
determining disconnected contributions to hadronic properties. Of particular
interest here is the size of the contribution to various nucleonic properties
coming from strange quarks.
