We report the phase diagram of interpenetrating Hertzian spheres. The Hertz
potential is purely repulsive, bounded at zero separation, and decreases
monotonically as a power law with exponent 5/2, vanishing at the overlapping
threshold. This simple functional describes the elastic interaction of weakly
deformable bodies and, therefore, it is a reliable physical model of soft
macromolecules, like star polymers and globular micelles. Using thermodynamic
integration and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we computed accurate free
energies of the fluid phase and a large number of crystal structures. For this,
we defined a general primitive unit cell that allows for the simulation of any
lattice. We found multiple re-entrant melting and first-order transitions
between crystals with cubic, trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal symmetries.
