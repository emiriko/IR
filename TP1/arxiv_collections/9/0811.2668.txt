We show that the classification of simple finite group schemes over an
algebraically closed field reduces to the classification of abstract simple
finite groups and of simple restricted Lie algebras in positive characteristic.
Both these two simple objects have been classified. We review this
classification. Finally, we address the problem of determining the
infinitesimal deformations of simple finite group schemes.
