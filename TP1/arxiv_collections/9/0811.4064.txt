We establish a one-to-one correspondence between structure groups of
non-degenerate, involutive and braided "set-theoretical" solutions of the
quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Garside groups with a certain presentation.
Moreover, we show that the solution is indecomposable if and only if its
structure group is a $\Delta-$pure Garside group.
