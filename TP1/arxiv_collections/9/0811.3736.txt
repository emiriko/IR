The impact of coherence on the nonlinear optical response and stationary
transport is studied in quantum cascade laser structures. Nonequilibrium
effects such as pump-probe signals, the spatio-temporally resolved electron
density evolution, and the subband population dynamics (Rabi flopping) as well
as the stationary current characteristics are investigated within a microscopic
density-matrix approach. Focusing on the stationary current and the recently
observed gain oscillations, it is found that the inclusion of coherence leads
to observable coherent effects in opposite parameter regimes regarding the
relation between the level broadening and the tunnel coupling across the main
injection barrier. This shows that coherence plays a complementary role in
stationary transport and nonlinear optical dynamics in the sense that it leads
to measurable effects in opposite regimes. For this reason, a fully coherent
consideration of such nonequilibrium structures is necessary to describe the
combined optical and transport properties
