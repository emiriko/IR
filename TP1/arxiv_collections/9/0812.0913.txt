We investigate triangular arbitrage within the spot foreign exchange market
using high-frequency executable prices. We show that triangular arbitrage
opportunities do exist, but that most have short durations and small
magnitudes. We find intra-day variations in the number and length of arbitrage
opportunities, with larger numbers of opportunities with shorter mean durations
occurring during more liquid hours. We demonstrate further that the number of
arbitrage opportunities has decreased in recent years, implying a corresponding
increase in pricing efficiency. Using trading simulations, we show that a
trader would need to beat other market participants to an unfeasibly large
proportion of arbitrage prices to profit from triangular arbitrage over a
prolonged period of time. Our results suggest that the foreign exchange market
is internally self-consistent and provide a limited verification of market
efficiency.
