It has been proposed that adaptation in complex systems is optimized at the
critical boundary between ordered and disordered dynamical regimes. Here, we
review models of evolving dynamical networks that lead to self-organization of
network topology based on a local coupling between a dynamical order parameter
and rewiring of network connectivity, with convergence towards criticality in
the limit of large network size $N$. In particular, two adaptive schemes are
discussed and compared in the context of Boolean Networks and Threshold
Networks: 1) Active nodes loose links, frozen nodes aquire new links, 2) Nodes
with correlated activity connect, de-correlated nodes disconnect. These simple
local adaptive rules lead to co-evolution of network topology and -dynamics.
Adaptive networks are strikingly different from random networks: They evolve
inhomogeneous topologies and broad plateaus of homeostatic regulation,
dynamical activity exhibits $1/f$ noise and attractor periods obey a scale-free
distribution. The proposed co-evolutionary mechanism of topological
self-organization is robust against noise and does not depend on the details of
dynamical transition rules. Using finite-size scaling, it is shown that
networks converge to a self-organized critical state in the thermodynamic
limit. Finally, we discuss open questions and directions for future research,
and outline possible applications of these models to adaptive systems in
diverse areas.
