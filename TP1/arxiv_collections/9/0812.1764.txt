We describe the two-dimensional Mott transition in a Hubbard-like model with
nearest neighbors interactions based on a recent solution to the Zamolodchikov
tetrahedron equation, which extends the notion of integrability to
two-dimensional lattice systems. At the Mott transition, we find that the
system is in a d-density wave or staggered flux phase that can be described by
a double Chern Simons effective theory with symmetry \su2 \otimes \su2. The
Mott transition is of topological nature, characterized by the emergence of
vortices in antiferromagnetic arrays interacting strongly with the electric
charges and an electric-magnetic duality. We also consider the effect of small
doping on this theory and show that it leads to a quantum gas-liquid
coexistence phase, which belongs to the Ising universality class and which is
consistent with several experimental observations.
