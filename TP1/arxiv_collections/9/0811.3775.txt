We present a supersymmetric SU(5) GUT model with a discrete non-Abelian
flavor symmetry that is broken by Wilson lines. The model is formulated in 4+3
dimensions compactified on a manifold S^3/Z_n. Symmetry breaking by Wilson
lines is topological and allows to realize the necessary flavor symmetry
breaking without a vacuum alignment mechanism. The model predicts the
hierarchical pattern of charged fermion masses and quark mixing angles. Small
normal hierarchical neutrino masses are generated by the type-I seesaw
mechanism. The non-Abelian flavor symmetry predicts to leading order exact
maximal atmospheric mixing while the solar angle emerges from a variant of
quark-lepton complementarity. As a consequence, the resulting leptonic mixing
matrix is in excellent agreement with current data and could be tested in
future neutrino oscillation experiments.
