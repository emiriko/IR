The use of qubits as sensitive magnetometers has been studied theoretically
and recent demonstrated experimentally. In this paper we propose a
generalisation of this concept, where a scanning two-state quantum system is
used to probe the subtle effects of decoherence (as well as its surrounding
electromagnetic environment). Mapping both the Hamiltonian and decoherence
properties of a qubit simultaneously, provides a unique image of the magnetic
(or electric) field properties at the nanoscale. The resulting images are
sensitive to the temporal as well as spatial variation in the fields created by
the sample. As an example we theoretically study two applications of this
technology; one from condensed matter physics, the other biophysics. The
individual components required to realise the simplest version of this device
(characterisation and measurement of qubits, nanoscale positioning) have
already been demonstrated experimentally.
