Using the factorization approach and considering the contributions of the
current-current, QCD penguin and electroweak penguin operators at the leading
approximation, the decay amplitudes and decay widths of $B_q\to D_q(D_q^*) P$
and $B_q\to D_q(D_q^*) V$ transitions, where $q=u,d,s$ and P and V are
pseudoscalar and vector mesons, are calculated in terms of the transition form
factors of the $B_q\to D_{q}$ and $B_q\to D^{*}_{q}$. Having computed those
form factors in three-point QCD sum rules, the branching fraction for these
decays are also evaluated. A comparison of our results with the predictions of
the perturbative QCD as well as the existing experimental data is presented.
