At the time of writing, data have been reported on several hundred different
cuprates materials, of which a substantial fraction show superconductivity at
temperatures as high as 130 K. The existence of several competing phases with
comparable energy shows up in different ways in different materials, therefore
it has not been possible to converge toward a universal theory for high Tc
superconductivity. With the aim to find a unified description the
Aeppli-Bianconi 3D phase diagram of cuprates has been proposed where the
superlattice misfit strain (eta) is the third variable beyond doping (delta)
and temperature T. The 3D phase diagrams for the magnetic order, and for the
superconducting order extended to all cuprates families are described. We
propose a formula able to describe the Tc (delta,eta) surface, this permits to
identify the stripe quantum critical point at (delta)c=1/8 and (eta)c =7percent
which is associated with the incommensurate to commensurate stripe phase
transition, controlled by the misfit strain.
