The propagation of pulses through waveguides with subwavelength features,
inhomogeneous transverse structure, and high index contrast cannot be described
accurately using existing models in the presence of nonlinear effects. Here we
report the development of a generalised full vectorial model of nonlinear pulse
propagation and demonstrate that, unlike the standard pulse propagation
formulation, the z-component of guided modes plays a key role for these new
structures, and results in generalised definitions of the nonlinear coefficient
$\gamma,$ $A_{eff}$, and mode orthognality. While new definitions reduce to
standard definitions in some limits, significant differences are predicted,
including a factor of $\sim2$ higher value for $\gamma$, for emerging
waveguides and microstructured fibers.
