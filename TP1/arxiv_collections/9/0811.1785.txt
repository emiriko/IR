Helmholtz's equations provide the motion of a system of N vortices which
describes a planar incompressible fluid with zero viscosity. A relative
equilibrium is a particular solution of these equations for which the distances
between the vortices are invariant during the motion. In this article, we are
interested in relative equilibria formed of concentric regular polygons of
vortices. We show that in the case of one regular polygon (and a possible
vortex at the center) with more than three vertices (two if there is a vortex
at the center), a relative equilibrium requires equal vorticities (on the
polygon). We also determine all the relative equilibria with two concentric
regular n-gons and the same vorticity on each n-gon. This result completes the
classical studies for two regular n-gons when all the vortices have the same
vorticity or when the total vorticity vanishes.
