Reduced equations that describe low-frequency plasma dynamics play an
important role in our understanding of plasma behavior over long time scales.
One of the oldest paradigms for reduced plasma dynamics involves the
ponderomotive Hamiltonian formulation of the oscillation-center dynamics of
charged particles (over slow space-time scales) in a weakly-nonuniform
background plasma perturbed by an electromagnetic field with fast space-time
scales. These reduced plasma equations are derived here by Lie-transform and
variational methods for the case of a weakly-magnetized background plasma. In
particular, both methods are used to derive explicit expressions for the
ponderomotive polarization and magnetization, which appear in the
oscillation-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations.
