Actin networks in certain single-celled organisms exhibit a complex
pattern-forming dynamics that starts with the appearance of static spots of
actin on the cell cortex. Spots soon become mobile, executing persistent random
walks, and eventually give rise to traveling waves of actin. Here we describe a
possible physical mechanism for this distinctive set of dynamic
transformations, by equipping an excitable reaction-diffusion model with a
field describing the spatial orientation of its chief constituent (which we
consider to be actin). The interplay of anisotropic actin growth and spatial
inhibition drives a transformation at fixed parameter values from static spots
to moving spots to waves.
