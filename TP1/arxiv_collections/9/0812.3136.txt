Traditional methods of reporting changes in student responses have focused on
class-wide averages. Such models hide information about the switches in
responses by individual students over the course of a semester. We extend
unpublished work by Steven Kanim on "escalator diagrams" which show changes in
student responses from correct to incorrect (and vice versa) while representing
pre- and post-instruction results on questions. Our extension consists of
"consistency plots" in which we represent three forms of data: method of
solution and correctness of solution both before and after instruction. Our
data are from an intermediate mechanics class, and come from (nearly) identical
midterm and final examination questions.
