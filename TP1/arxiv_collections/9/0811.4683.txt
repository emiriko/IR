We present the lepton flavor model with $\Delta (54)$, which appears
typically in heterotic string models on the $T^2/Z_3$ orbifold. Our model
reproduces the tri-bimaximal mixing in the parameter region around degenerate
neutrino masses or two massless neutrinos. We predict the deviation from the
tri-bimaximal mixing by putting the experimental data of neutrino masses in the
normal hierarchy of neutrino masses. The upper bound of $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ is
0.01. There is the strong correlation between $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{13}$.
Unless $\theta_{23}$ is deviated from the maximal mixing considerably,
$\theta_{13}$ remains to be tiny.
