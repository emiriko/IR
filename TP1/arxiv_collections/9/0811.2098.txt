Several applications require spatial distributions of the incident electric
field that maximize the electric field at a focal point for a given input
power. The field distributions are derived for various optical systems in a
direct way based on fundamental physical properties. The results may prove
useful for a wide range of applications, e.g., microscopy, scattering
experiments or excitation of single atoms. For commonly used distributions -
fundamental Gaussian modes and doughnut modes - we give the upper bounds of the
achievable field amplitudes.
