Forward (di)jet measurements are a useful tool to constrain the Parton
Distribution Functions (PDFs) at low values of parton momentum fraction x, and
to study the possible onset of BFKL or gluon saturation QCD evolutions in the
proton. We present studies of jet reconstruction capabilities in the CMS Hadron
Forward (HF) calorimeter (3<|eta|<5). The expected sensitivity of the inclusive
forward jet p_T spectrum to the proton PDF, as well as the azimuthal
decorrelation of Mueller-Navelet jets with a large rapidity separation are
presented for p-p collisions at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV.
