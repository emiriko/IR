The production cross-section of h_c, the 1P_1 charmonium state, can be
predicted in Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) using heavy-quark symmetry. We show
that at the Large Hadron Collider a large cross-section for this resonance is
predicted and it should be possible to look for the h_c through it decay into
J/psi +pi even with the statistics that will be achieved within a few months of
run-time at the LHC.
