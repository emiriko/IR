Systematic ensemble photoluminescence studies have been performed on type-I
InP-quantum dots in Al0.20Ga0.80InP barriers, emitting at approximately 1.85 eV
at 5 K. The influence of different barrier configurations as well as the
incorporation of additional tunnel barriers on the optical properties has been
investigated. The confinement energy between the dot barrier and the
surrounding barrier layers, which is the sum of the band discontinuities for
the valence and the conduction bands, was chosen to be approximately 190 meV by
using Al0.50Ga0.50InP. In combination with 2 nm thick AlInP tunnel barriers,
the internal quantum efficiency of these barrier configurations can be
increased by up to a factor of 20 at elevated temperatures with respect to
quantum dots without such layers.
