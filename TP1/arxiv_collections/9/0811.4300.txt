We study the gluon and ghost propagators of lattice Landau gauge in the
strong-coupling limit beta=0 in pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory to find
evidence of the conformal infrared behavior of these propagators as predicted
by a variety of functional continuum methods for asymptotically small momenta
$q^2 \ll \Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}^2$. In the strong-coupling limit, this same
behavior is obtained for the larger values of a^2q^2 (in units of the lattice
spacing a), where it is otherwise swamped by the gauge field dynamics.
Deviations for a^2q^2 < 1 are well parameterized by a transverse gluon mass
$\propto 1/a$. Perhaps unexpectedly, these deviations are thus no finite-volume
effect but persist in the infinite-volume limit. They furthermore depend on the
definition of gauge fields on the lattice, while the asymptotic conformal
behavior does not. We also comment on a misinterpretation of our results by
Cucchieri and Mendes in Phys. Rev. D81 (2010) 016005.
