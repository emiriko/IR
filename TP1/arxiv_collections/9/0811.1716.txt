The neutron elastic magnetic form factor GMn has been extracted from
quasielastic electron scattering data on deuterium with the CEBAF Large
Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab. The kinematic coverage of the
measurement is continuous from Q2=1 GeV2 to 4.8 GeV2. High precision was
achieved by employing a ratio technique in which many uncertainties cancel, and
by a simultaneous in-situ calibration of the neutron detection efficiency, the
largest correction to the data. Neutrons were detected using the CLAS
electromagnetic calorimeters and the time-of-flight scintillators. Data were
taken at two different electron beam energies, allowing up to four
semi-independent measurements of GMn to be made at each value of Q2. The dipole
parameterization is found to provide a good description of the data over the
measured Q2 range.
