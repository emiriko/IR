The Kondo effect underpins a large body of recent developments in the physics
of $d$- and $f$-band compounds. Although its {\it charge} analog is a rarity in
solids, the recent observations of the charge Kondo effect and the consequent
rise in superconducting T$_c$ encourage a search for other accessible systems.
Motivated by the possibility of wilfully tuning the {\it sign} of the
inter-electronic interaction in optical lattices, we study conditions for the
elusive {\it charge Kondo liquid} (CKL) state to manifest. We propose that a
combination of Feshbach resonances and sequentially controlled laser pulses may
produce the CKL. We show that the CKL is {\it never} a stable ground state,
appearing only when the ordered ground states are destabilized. Finally, we
discuss interesting analogies with nuclear matter.
