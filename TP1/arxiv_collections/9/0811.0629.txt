A Penrose diagram is constructed for a spatially coherent black hole that
accretes at stepwise steady rates as measured by a distant observer from an
initial state described by a metric of Minkowski form. Coordinate lines are
computationally derived, and radial light-like trajectories verify the
viability of the diagram. Coordinate dependencies of significant features, such
as the horizon and radial mass scale, are clearly demonstrated on the diagram.
The onset of a singularity at the origin is shown to open a new region in
space-time that contains the interior of the black hole.
