Rotational analogs to magnetic fluxons in conventional Josephson junctions
are predicted to emerge in the ground state of rotating tunnel-coupled annular
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Such topological condensate-phase structures
can be manipulated by external potentials. We determine conditions for
observing macroscopic quantum tunneling of a fluxon. Rotational fluxons in
double-ring BECs can be created, manipulated, and controlled by external
potential in different ways than possible in the solid state system, thus
rendering them a promising new candidate system for studying and utilizing
quantum properties of collective many-particle degrees of freedom.
