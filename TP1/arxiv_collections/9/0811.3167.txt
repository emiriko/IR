Single phase, c-axis oriented, e-doped, Sr1-xLaxCuO2 thin films were
epitaxially grown on KTaO3 and DyScO3 substrates by reactive rf sputtering.
As-grown films being insulating due to oxygen excess, oxygen reduction is
necessary to observe superconductivity. Two different procedures were employed
to reach superconductivity. On one hand an in-situ reduction process was
conducted on a series of films deposited on both types of substrates. On the
other hand, an ex-situ reduction procedure was performed sequentially on a
single film deposited on DyScO3. The study of the influence of oxygen reduction
on the structural and electronic properties of the thin films is presented and
discussed.
