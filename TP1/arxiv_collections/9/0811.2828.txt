In this paper we discuss the dynamics and transport properties of a massive
particle, in a time dependent periodic potential of the ratchet type, with a
dissipative environment. The directional currents and characteristics of the
motion are studied as the specific frictional coefficient varies, finding that
the stationary regime is strongly dependent on this parameter. The maximal
Lyapunov exponent and the current show large fluctuations and inversions,
therefore for some range of the control parameter, this inertial ratchet could
originate a mass separation device. Also an exploration of the effect of a
random force on the system is performed.
