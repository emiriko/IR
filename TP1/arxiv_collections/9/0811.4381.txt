Within the framework of an exact analytical solution of Maxwell equations in
a space domain, it is shown that optical scheme based on a slab with negative
refractive index ($n=-1$) (Veselago lens or Pendry lens) does not possess
focusing properties in the usual sense . In fact, the energy in such systems
does not go from object to its "image", but from object and its "image" to an
intersection point inside a metamaterial layer, or vice versa. A possibility of
applying this phenomenon to a creation of entangled states of two atoms is
discussed.
