We demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of free space quantum key
distribution with continuous variables under real atmospheric conditions. More
specifically, we transmit coherent polarization states over a 100m free space
channel on the roof of our institute's building. In our scheme, signal and
local oscillator are combined in a single spatial mode which auto-compensates
atmospheric fluctuations and results in an excellent interference. Furthermore,
the local oscillator acts as spatial and spectral filter thus allowing
unrestrained daylight operation.
