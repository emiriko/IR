Of all current detection techniques with nanometer resolution, only X-ray
microscopy allows imaging nanoparticles in suspension. Can it also be used to
investigate structural dynamics? When studying response to mechanical stimuli,
the challenge lies in applying them with precision comparable to spatial
resolution. In the first shear experiments performed in an X-ray microscope, we
accomplished this by inserting a piezo actuator driven shear cell into the
focal plane of a scanning transmission X-ray microscope (STXM). Thus
shear-induced reorganization of magnetite nanoparticle aggregates could be
demonstrated in suspension. As X-ray microscopy proves suitable for studying
structural change, new prospects open up in physics at small length scales.
