We prove that the Navier-Stokes, the Euler and the Stokes equations admit a
Lagrangian structure using the stochastic embedding of Lagrangian systems.
These equations coincide with extremals of an explicit stochastic Lagrangian
functional, i.e. they are stochastic Lagrangian systems in the sense of
