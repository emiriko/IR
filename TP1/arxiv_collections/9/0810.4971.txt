We have synthesized a large amount of boron-doped multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (MWNTs) by hot-filament chemical vapor deposition. The synthesis was
carried out in a flask using a methanol solution of boric acid as a source
material. The scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
and micro-Raman spectroscopy were performed to evaluate the structural
properties of the obtained MWNTs. In order to evaluate the electrical
properties, temperature dependence of resistivity was measured in an individual
MWNTs with four metal electrodes. The Ramman shifts suggest carrier injection
into the boron-doped MWNTs, but the resistivity of the MWNTs was high and
increased strongly with decreasing temperature. Defects induced by the plasma
may cause this enhanced resistivity.
