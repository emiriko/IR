Recently, the interest in local lattice actions for chiral fermions has
revived, with the proposition of new local actions in which only the minimal
number of doublers appear. The trigger role of graphene having a minimally
doubled, chirally invariant, Dirac-like excitation spectrum can not be
neglected. The challenge is to construct an action which preserves enough
symmetries to be useful in lattice gauge calculations. We present a new
approach to obtain local lattice actions for fermions using a reinterpretation
of the staggered lattice approach of Kogut and Susskind. This interpretation is
based on the similarity with the staggered lattice approach in FDTD simulations
of acoustics and electromagnetism. It allows us to construct a local action for
chiral fermions which has all discrete symmetries and the minimal number of
fermion flavors, but which is non-Hermitian in real space. However, we argue
that this will not pose a threat to the usability of the theory.
