We report the creation and characterization of a near quantum-degenerate gas
of polar $^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb molecules in their absolute rovibrational ground
state. Starting from weakly bound heteronuclear KRb Feshbach molecules, we
implement precise control of the molecular electronic, vibrational, and
rotational degrees of freedom with phase-coherent laser fields. In particular,
we coherently transfer these weakly bound molecules across a 125 THz frequency
gap in a single step into the absolute rovibrational ground state of the
electronic ground potential. Phase coherence between lasers involved in the
transfer process is ensured by referencing the lasers to two single components
of a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb. Using these methods, we prepare a
dense gas of $4\cdot10^4$ polar molecules at a temperature below 400 nK. This
fermionic molecular ensemble is close to quantum degeneracy and can be
characterized by a degeneracy parameter of $T/T_F=3$. We have measured the
molecular polarizability in an optical dipole trap where the trap lifetime
gives clues to interesting ultracold chemical processes. Given the large
measured dipole moment of the KRb molecules of 0.5 Debye, the study of quantum
degenerate molecular gases interacting via strong dipolar interactions is now
within experimental reach.
