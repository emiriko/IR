Parametric downconversion (PDC) is a technique of ubiquitous experimental
significance in the production of non-classical, photon-number correlated twin
beams. Standard theory of PDC as a two-mode squeezing process predicts and
homodyne measurements observe a thermal photon number distribution per beam.
Recent experiments have obtained conflicting distributions. In this paper, we
explain the observation by an a-priori theoretical model solely based on
directly accessible physical quantities. We compare our predictions with
experimental data and find excellent agreement.
