Within a chiral constituent quark model approach, $\eta$-meson production on
the proton {\it via} electromagnetic and hadron probes are studied. With few
parameters, differential cross-section and polarized beam asymmetry for \gamma
p \to \eta p$ and differential cross section for $\pi^- p\to \eta n$ processes
are calculated and successfully compared with the data in the center-of-mass
energy range from threshold up to 2 GeV. The five known resonances
$S_{11}(1535)$, $S_{11}(1650)$, $P_{13}(1720)$, $D_{13}(1520)$, and
$F_{15}(1680)$ are found to be dominant in the reaction mechanisms in both
channels. Possible roles plaied by new resonances are also investigated and in
the photoproduction channel, significant contribution from $S_{11}$- and
$D_{15}$-resonances, with masses around 1715 MeV and 2090 MeV, respectively,
are deduced. For the so-called missing resonances, no evidence is found within
the investigated reactions. The helicity amplitudes and decay widths of $N^*
\to \pi N, \eta N$ are also presented, and found consistent with the PDG
values.
