Bosons and fermions are described by using canonical generators of Cuntz
algebras on any permutative representation. We show a fermionization of bosons
which universally holds on any permutative representation of the Cuntz algebra
${\cal O}_{2}$. As examples, we show fermionizations on the Fock space and the
infinite wedge.
