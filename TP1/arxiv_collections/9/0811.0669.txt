We construct colloidal ``sticky'' rods from the semi-flexible filamentous fd
virus and temperature-sensitive polymers poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).
The phase diagram of fd-PNIPAM system becomes independent of ionic strength at
high salt concentration and low temperature, i.e. the rods are sterically
stabilized by the polymer. However, the network of sticky rods undergoes a
sol-gel transition as the temperature is raised. The viscoelastic moduli of fd
and fd-PNIPAM suspensions are compared as a function of temperature, and the
effect of ionic strength on the gelling behavior of fd-PNIPAM solution is
measured. For all fluidlike and solidlike samples, the frequency-dependant
linear viscoelastic moduli can be scaled onto universal master curves.
