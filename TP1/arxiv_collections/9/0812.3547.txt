The Kohn variational principle and the hyperspherical harmonics technique are
applied to study n-3H elastic scattering at low energies. In this contribution
the first results obtained using a non-local realistic interaction derived from
the chiral perturbation theory are reported. They are found to be in good
agreement with those obtained solving the Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations. The
calculated total and differential cross sections are compared with the
available experimental data. The effect of including a three-nucleon
interaction is also discussed.
