Recent work has shown how information theory extends conventional
full-rationality game theory to allow bounded rational agents. The associated
mathematical framework can be used to solve constrained optimization problems.
This is done by translating the problem into an iterated game, where each agent
controls a different variable of the problem, so that the joint probability
distribution across the agents' moves gives an expected value of the objective
function. The dynamics of the agents is designed to minimize a Lagrangian
function of that joint distribution. Here we illustrate how the updating of the
Lagrange parameters in the Lagrangian is a form of automated annealing, which
focuses the joint distribution more and more tightly about the joint moves that
optimize the objective function. We then investigate the use of
``semicoordinate'' variable transformations. These separate the joint state of
the agents from the variables of the optimization problem, with the two
connected by an onto mapping. We present experiments illustrating the ability
of such transformations to facilitate optimization. We focus on the special
kind of transformation in which the statistically independent states of the
agents induces a mixture distribution over the optimization variables. Computer
experiment illustrate this for $k$-sat constraint satisfaction problems and for
unconstrained minimization of $NK$ functions.
