The physics of symmetry breaking in theories with strongly interacting quanta
obeying infinite (quantum Boltzmann) statistics known as quons is discussed.
The picture of Bose/Fermi particles as low energy excitations over nontrivial
quon condensate is advocated. Using induced gravity arguments it is
demonstrated that the Planck mass in such low energy effective theory can be
factorially (in number of degrees of freedom) larger than its true ultraviolet
cutoff. Thus, the assumption that statistics of relevant high energy
excitations is neither Bose nor Fermi but infinite can remove the hierarchy
problem without necessity to introduce any artificially large numbers. Quantum
mechanical model illustrating this scenario is presented.
