All first-generation large-scale gravitational wave detectors are operated at
the dark fringe and use a heterodyne readout employing radio frequency (RF)
modulation-demodulation techniques. However, the experience in the currently
running interferometers reveals several problems connected with a heterodyne
readout, of which phase noise of the RF modulation is the most serious one. A
homodyne detection scheme (DC-readout), using the highly stabilized and
filtered carrier light as local oscillator for the readout, is considered to be
a favourable alternative. Recently a DC-readout scheme was implemented on the
GEO 600 detector. We describe the results of first measurements and give a
comparison of the performance achieved with homodyne and heterodyne readout.
The implications of the combined use of DC-readout and signal-recycling are
considered.
