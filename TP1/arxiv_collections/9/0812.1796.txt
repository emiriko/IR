The completeness problem of the bond market model with the random factors
determined by a Wiener process and Poisson random measure is studied. Hedging
portfolios use bonds with maturities in a countable, dense subset of a finite
time interval. It is shown that under natural assumptions the market is not
complete unless the support of the L\'evy measure consists of a finite number
of points. Explicit constructions of contingent claims which can not be
replicated are provided.
