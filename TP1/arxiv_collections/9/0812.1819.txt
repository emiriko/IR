Hamiltonian light-front quantum field theory constitutes a framework for the
non-perturbative solution of invariant masses and correlated parton amplitudes
of self-bound systems. By choosing light-front gauge and adopting a basis
function representation, we obtain a large, sparse, Hamiltonian matrix for mass
eigenstates of gauge theories that is solvable by adapting the ab initio
no-core methods of nuclear many-body theory. Full covariance is recovered in
the continuum limit, the infinite matrix limit. We outline our approach and
discuss the computational challenges.
