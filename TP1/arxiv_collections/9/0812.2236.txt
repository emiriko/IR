Relating the effective Lorentz violation coefficients for composite particles
to the coefficients for their constituent fields is a challenging problem. We
calculate the Lorentz violation coefficients relevant to the dynamics of an
alpha-particle in terms of proton and neutron coefficients. The alpha-particle
coefficients would lead to anisotropies in the alpha-decays of nuclei, and
because the decay process involves quantum tunneling, the effects of any
Lorentz violations could be exponentially enhanced.
