Molecular docking is an essential tool for drug design. It helps the
scientist to rapidly know if two molecules, respectively called ligand and
receptor, can be combined together to obtain a stable complex. We propose a new
multi-objective model combining an energy term and a surface term to gain such
complexes. The aim of our model is to provide complexes with a low energy and
low surface. This model has been validated with two multi-objective genetic
algorithms on instances from the literature dedicated to the docking
benchmarking.
