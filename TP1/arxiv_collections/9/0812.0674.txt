The BCS-BEC crossover and phase diagram for asymmetric nuclear superfluid
with pairings in isospin I = 0 and I = 1 channels are investigated at mean
field level, by using a density dependent nucleon-nucleon potential. Induced by
the in-medium nucleon mass and density dependent coupling constants,
neutron-proton Cooper pairs could be in BEC state at sufficiently low density,
but there is no chance for the BEC formation of neutron-neutron and
proton-proton pairs at any density and asymmetry. We calculate the phase
diagram in asymmetry-temperature plane for weakly interacting nuclear
superfluid, and find that including the I = 1 channel changes significantly the
phase structure at low temperature. There appears a new phase with both I = 0
and I = 1 pairings at low temperature and low asymmetry, and the gapless state
in any phase with I = 1 pairing is washed out and all excited nucleons are
fully gapped.
