We study a model of two interacting Hamiltonian particles subject to a common
potential in contact with two Langevin heat reservoirs: one at finite and one
at infinite temperature. This is a toy model for 'extreme' non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics. We provide a full picture of the long-time behaviour of
such a system, including the existence / non-existence of a non-equilibrium
steady state, the precise tail behaviour of the energy in such a state, as well
as the speed of convergence toward the steady state.
  Despite its apparent simplicity, this model exhibits a surprisingly rich
variety of long time behaviours, depending on the parameter regime: if the
surrounding potential is 'too stiff', then no stationary state can exist. In
the softer regimes, the tails of the energy in the stationary state can be
either algebraic, fractional exponential, or exponential. Correspondingly, the
speed of convergence to the stationary state can be either algebraic, stretched
exponential, or exponential. Regarding both types of claims, we obtain matching
upper and lower bounds.
