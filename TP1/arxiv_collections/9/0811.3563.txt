We study the melting of charge order in the half doped manganites using a
model that incorporates double exchange, antiferromagnetic superexchange, and
Jahn-Teller coupling between electrons and phonons. We primarily use a real
space Monte Carlo technique to study the phase diagram in terms of applied
field $(h)$ and temperature $(T)$, exploring the melting of charge order with
increasing $h$ and its recovery on decreasing $h$. We observe hysteresis in
this response, and discover that the `field melted' high conductance state can
be spatially inhomogeneous even without extrinsic disorder. The hysteretic
response plays out in the background of field driven equilibrium phase
separation. Our results, exploring $h$, $T$, and the electronic parameter
space, are backed up by analysis of simpler limiting cases and a Landau
framework for the field response. This paper focuses on our results in the
`clean' systems, a companion paper studies the effect of cation disorder on the
melting phenomena.
