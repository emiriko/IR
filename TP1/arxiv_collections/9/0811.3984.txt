We explicitly prove the equivalence and construct a dictionary between two
different supersymmetric formalisms for five-dimensional theories commonly used
in the literature. One is the real formalism, which consists in doubling the
number of degrees of freedom and then imposing reality constraints and the
other is the usual superfield formalism.
