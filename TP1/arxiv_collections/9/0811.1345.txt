We consider the implications of the most general two-body quark-quark
interaction Hamiltonian for the spin-flavor structure of the negative parity
L=1 excited baryons. Assuming the most general two-body quark interaction
Hamiltonian, we derive two correlations among the masses and mixing angles of
these states, which constrain the mixing angles, and can be used to test for
the presence of three-body quark interactions. We find that the pure
gluon-exchange model is disfavored by data, independently of any assumptions
about the hadronic wave functions.
