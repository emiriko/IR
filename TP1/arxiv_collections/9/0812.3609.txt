Spin-Hall effect in ballistic 2D electron gas with Rashba-type spin-orbit
coupling and smooth edge confinement is studied. We predict that the interplay
of semiclassical electron motion and quantum dynamics of spins leads to several
distinct features in spin density along the edge that originate from
accumulation of turning points from many classical trajectories. Strong peak is
found near a point of the vanishing of electron Fermi velocity in the lower
spin-split subband. It is followed by a strip of negative spin density that
extends until the crossing of the local Fermi energy with the degeneracy point
where the two spin subbands intersect. Beyond this crossing there is a wide
region of a smooth positive spin density. The total amount of spin accumulated
in each of these features exceeds greatly the net spin across the entire edge.
The features become more pronounced for shallower boundary potentials,
controlled by gating in typical experimental setups.
