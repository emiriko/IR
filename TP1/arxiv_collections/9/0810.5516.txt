We introduce the class of rational Kripke models and study symbolic model
checking of the basic tense logic Kt and some extensions of it in models from
that class. Rational Kripke models are based on (generally infinite) rational
graphs, with vertices labeled by the words in some regular language and
transitions recognized by asynchronous two-head finite automata, also known as
rational transducers. Every atomic proposition in a rational Kripke model is
evaluated in a regular set of states. We show that every formula of Kt has an
effectively computable regular extension in every rational Kripke model, and
therefore local model checking and global model checking of Kt in rational
Kripke models are decidable. These results are lifted to a number of extensions
of Kt. We study and partly determine the complexity of the model checking
procedures.
