A system of two coupled CdTe quantum dots, one of them containing a single Mn
ion, was studied in continuous wave and modulated photoluminescence,
photoluminescence excitation, and photon correlation experiments. Optical
writing of information in the spin state of the Mn ion has been demonstrated,
using orientation of the Mn spin by spin-polarized carriers transferred from
the neighbor quantum dot. Mn spin orientation time values from 20 ns to 100 ns
were measured, depending on the excitation power. Storage time of the
information in the Mn spin was found to be enhanced by application of a static
magnetic field of 1 T, reaching hundreds of microseconds in the dark. Simple
rate equation models were found to describe correctly static and dynamical
properties of the system.
