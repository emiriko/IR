An alternative to the Parkes' approach [SIGMA 4 (2008) 053, arXiv:0806.3155]
is suggested for the solutions categorization to the extended reduced Ostrovsky
equation (the exROE in Parkes' terminology). The approach is based on the
application of the qualitative theory of differential equations which includes
a mechanical analogy with the point particle motion in a potential field, the
phase plane method, analysis of homoclinic trajectories and the like. Such an
approach is seemed more vivid and free of some restrictions contained in the
above mentioned Parkes' paper.
