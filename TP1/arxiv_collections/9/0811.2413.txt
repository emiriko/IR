The mass shifts of the $P$-wave $D_s$ and $B_s$ mesons due to coupling to
$DK$ and $BK$ channels are calculated in the coupling channel model without
fitting parameters. The strong mass shifts down for $0^+$ and ${1^+}'$ states
have been obtained, while ${1^+}"$ and $2^+$ states remain almost in situ. The
masses of $0^+$ and ${1^+}'$ states of $B_s$ mesons have been predicted.
