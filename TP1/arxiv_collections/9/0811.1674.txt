We develop and study a Lefschetz theory in a combinatorial category
associated to a root system and derive an upper bound on the exceptional
characteristics for Lusztig's formula for the simple rational characters of a
reductive algebraic group. Our bound is huge compared to the Coxeter number. It
is, however, given by an explicit formula.
