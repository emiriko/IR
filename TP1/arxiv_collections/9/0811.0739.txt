We present a fully relativistic and gauge invariant framework for calculating
the cross sections of dilepton production in nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) collisions
which is based on the meson-exchange approximation for the $NN$ scattering
amplitudes. Predictions of our model are compared with those of other covariant
models that have been used earlier to describe this reaction. Our results are
also compared with those of the semiclassical models which are employed to get
the input elementary cross sections in the transport model calculations of the
dilepton production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is found that cross
sections obtained within the semiclassical and quantum mechanical models differ
noticeably from each other.
