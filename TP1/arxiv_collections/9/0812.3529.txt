The least action principle, through its variational formulation, possesses a
finalist aspect. It explicitly appears in the fractional calculus framework,
where Euler-Lagrange equations obtained so far violate the causality principle.
In order to clarify the relation between those two principles, we firstly
remark that the derivatives used to described causal physical phenomena are in
fact left ones. This leads to a formal approach of irreversible dynamics, where
forward and backward temporal evolutions are decoupled. This formalism is then
integrated to the Lagrangian systems, through a particular embedding procedure.
In this set-up, the application of the least action principle leads to
distinguishing trajectories and variations dynamical status. More precisely,
when trajectories and variations time arrows are opposed, we prove that the
least action principle provides causal Euler-Lagrange equations, even in the
fractional case. Furthermore, the embedding developped is coherent.
