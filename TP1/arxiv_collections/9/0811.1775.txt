We construct a theory for low-energy quantum transport in
normal$\mid$superconductor junctions involving the recently discovered
iron-based high-$T_c$ superconductors. We properly take into account both
Andreev bound surface states and the complex Fermi surface topology in our
approach, and investigate the signatures of the possible order parameter
symmetries for the FeAs-lattice. Our results could be helpful in determining
the symmetry of the superconducting state in the iron-pnicitide
superconductors.
