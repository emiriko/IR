Any bipartite quantum state has quasi-probability representations in terms of
separable states. For entangled states these quasi-probabilities necessarily
exhibit negativities. Based on the general structure of composite quantum
states, one may reconstruct such quasi-propabilities from experimental data.
Because of ambiguity, the quasi-probabilities obtained by the bare
reconstruction are insufficient to identify entanglement. An optimization
procedure is introduced to derive quasi-probabilities with a minimal amount of
negativity. Negativities of optimized quasi-probabilities unambiguously prove
entanglement, their positivity proves separability.
