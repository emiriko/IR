We apply the theorems from the theory of Toeplitz determinants to calculate
the asymptotics of various correlators including the exponential ones in the
inpenetrable one-dimensional Bose gas system. The known correlators in the
free-fermion system are also used to test the generalized Fisher-Hartwig
conjecture.
