Statistical pattern recognition methods based on the Coherence Length Diagram
(CLD) have been proposed for medical image analyses, such as quantitative
characterisation of human skin textures, and for polarized light microscopy of
liquid crystal textures. Further investigations are made on image maps
originated from such diagram and some examples related to irregularity of
microstructures are shown.
