This article aims to contribute to the study of algebras with triangular
decomposition over a Hopf algebra, as well as the BGG Category O. We study
functorial properties of O across various setups. The first setup is over a
skew group ring, involving a finite group $\Gamma$ acting on a regular
triangular algebra $A$. We develop Clifford theory for $A \rtimes \Gamma$, and
obtain results on block decomposition, complete reducibility, and enough
projectives. O is shown to be a highest weight category when $A$ satisfies one
of the "Conditions (S)"; the BGG Reciprocity formula is slightly different
because the duality functor need not preserve each simple module.
  Next, we turn to tensor products of such skew group rings; such a product is
also a skew group ring. We are thus able to relate four different types of
Categories O; more precisely, we list several conditions, each of which is
equivalent in any one setup, to any other setup - and which yield information
about O.
