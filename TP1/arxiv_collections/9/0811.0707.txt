I briefly review the current status of neutrino oscillation parameters and
discuss the role of neutrinos as cosmological probes, that could possibly
induce the baryon asymmetry as well as the dark matter in the Universe. I
comment on the origin of neutrino masses in seesaw-type and low-scale models
and mention some of their laboratory signals.
