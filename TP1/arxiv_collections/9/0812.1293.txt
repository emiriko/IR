In this work we study the symmetry properties of electrons and phonons in
graphene systems as function of the number of layers. We derive the selection
rules for the electron-radiation and for the electron-phonon interactions at
all points in the Brillouin zone. By considering these selection rules, we
address the double resonance Raman scattering process. The monolayer and
bilayer graphene in the presence of an applied electric field are also
discussed.
