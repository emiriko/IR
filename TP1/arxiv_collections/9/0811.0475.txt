We study the complexity of securely evaluating arithmetic circuits over
finite rings. This question is motivated by natural secure computation tasks.
Focusing mainly on the case of two-party protocols with security against
malicious parties, our main goals are to: (1) only make black-box calls to the
ring operations and standard cryptographic primitives, and (2) minimize the
number of such black-box calls as well as the communication overhead.
  We present several solutions which differ in their efficiency, generality,
and underlying intractability assumptions. These include:
  1. An unconditionally secure protocol in the OT-hybrid model which makes a
black-box use of an arbitrary ring $R$, but where the number of ring operations
grows linearly with (an upper bound on) $\log|R|$.
  2. Computationally secure protocols in the OT-hybrid model which make a
black-box use of an underlying ring, and in which the number of ring operations
does not grow with the ring size. These results extend a previous approach of
Naor and Pinkas for secure polynomial evaluation (SIAM J. Comput., 35(5),
2006).
  3. A protocol for the rings $\mathbb{Z}_m=\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ which only
makes a black-box use of a homomorphic encryption scheme. When $m$ is prime,
the (amortized) number of calls to the encryption scheme for each gate of the
circuit is constant.
  All of our protocols are in fact UC-secure in the OT-hybrid model and can be
generalized to multiparty computation with an arbitrary number of malicious
parties.
