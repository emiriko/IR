We present the program EvolFMC v.2 that solves the evolution equations in QCD
for the parton momentum distributions by means of the Monte Carlo technique
based on the Markovian process. The program solves the DGLAP-type evolution as
well as modified-DGLAP ones. In both cases the evolution can be performed in
the LO or NLO approximation. The quarks are treated as massless. The overall
technical precision of the code has been established at 0.05% precision level.
This way, for the first time ever, we demonstrate that with the Monte Carlo
method one can solve the evolution equations with precision comparable to the
other numerical methods.
