This paper offers a conceptually straightforward method for the calculation
of stresses in polarisable media based on the notion of a drive form and its
property of being closed in spacetimes with symmetry. After an outline of the
notation required to exploit the powerful exterior calculus of differential
forms, a discussion of the relation between Killing isometries and conservation
laws for smooth and distributional drive forms is given. Instantaneous forces
on isolated spacetime domains and regions with interfaces are defined, based on
manifestly covariant equations of motion. The remaining sections apply these
notions to media that sustain electromagnetic stresses, with emphasis on
homogeneous magnetoelectric material. An explicit calculation of the average
pressure exerted by a monochromatic wave normally incident on a homogeneous,
magnetoelectric slab in vacuo is presented and the concluding section
summarizes how this pressure depends on the parameters in the magnetoelectric
tensors for the medium.
