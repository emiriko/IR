In contrast to previous work in the field, we construct the Loop Quantum
Cosmology (LQC) of the flat isotropic model with a massless scalar field in the
absence of higher order curvature corrections to the gravitational part of the
Hamiltonian constraint. The matter part of the constraint contains the inverse
triad operator which can be quantized with or without the use of a Thiemann-
like procedure. With the latter choice, we show that the LQC quantization is
identical to that of the standard Wheeler DeWitt theory (WDW) wherein there is
no singularity resolution. We argue that the former choice leads to singularity
resolution in the sense of a well defined, regular (backward) evolution through
and beyond the epoch where the size of the universe vanishes.
  Our work along with that of the seminal work of Ashtekar, Pawlowski and Singh
(APS) clarifies the role, in singularity resolution, of the three `exotic'
structures in this LQC model, namely: curvature corrections, inverse triad
definitions and the `polymer' nature of the kinematic representation. We also
critically examine certain technical assumptions made by APS in their analysis
of WDW semiclassical states and point out some problems stemming from the
infrared behaviour of their wave functions
