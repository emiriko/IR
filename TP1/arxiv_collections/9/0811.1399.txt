In this paper, we use partial differential equations to find the
decomposition of the polynomial algebra over the basic irreducible module of E6
into a sum of irreducible submodules. It turns out that the cubic polynomial
invariant corresponding to the Dicksons' invariant trilinear form is the unique
fundamental invariant. Moreover, we obtain a combinatorial identity saying that
the dimensions of certain irreducible modules of E6 are correlated by the
binomial coefficients of twenty-six. Furthermore, we find all the polynomial
solutions for the invariant differential operator corresponding to the Dickson
trilinear form in terms of the irreducible submodules.
