The interaction of a fermion with the dense axion medium is investigated for
the purpose of finding an axion medium effect on the fermion dispersion. It is
shown that axion medium influence on the fermion dispersion under astrophysical
conditions is negligible small if the correct Lagrangian of the axion-fermion
interaction is used.
