The last decade has seen numerous efforts to achieve imaging resolution
beyond that of the Abbe-Rayleigh diffraction limit. The main direction of
research aiming to break this limit seeks to exploit the evanescent components
containing fine detail of the electromagnetic field distribution at the
immediate proximity of the object. Here we propose a solution that removes the
need for evanescent fields. The object being imaged or stimulated with
sub-wavelength accuracy does not need to be in the immediate proximity of the
superlens or field concentrator: an optical mask can be designed that creates
constructive interference of waves known as superoscillation, leading to a
sub-wavelength focus of prescribed size and shape in a `field of view' beyond
the evanescent fields, when illuminated by a monochromatic wave. Moreover, we
demonstrate that such a mask may be used not only as a focusing device, but
also as a super-resolution imaging device.
