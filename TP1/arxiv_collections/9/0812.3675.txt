Traditional algorithms for simulating quantum computers on classical ones
require an exponentially large amount of memory, and so typically cannot
simulate general quantum circuits with more than about 30 or so qubits on a
typical PC-scale platform with only a few gigabytes of main memory. However,
more memory-efficient simulations are possible, requiring only polynomial or
even linear space in the size of the quantum circuit being simulated. In this
paper, we describe one such technique, which was recently implemented at FSU in
the form of a C++ program called SEQCSim, which we releasing publicly. We also
discuss the potential benefits of this simulation in quantum computing research
and education, and outline some possible directions for further progress.
