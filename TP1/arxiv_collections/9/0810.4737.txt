We present an efficient parallel algorithm for statistical Molecular Dynamics
simulations of ion tracks in solids. The method is based on the Rare Event
Enhanced Domain following Molecular Dynamics (REED-MD) algorithm, which has
been successfully applied to studies of, e.g., ion implantation into
crystalline semiconductor wafers. We discuss the strategies for parallelizing
the method, and we settle on a host-client type polling scheme in which a
multiple of asynchronous processors are continuously fed to the host, which, in
turn, distributes the resulting feed-back information to the clients. This
real-time feed-back consists of, e.g., cumulative damage information or
statistics updates necessary for the cloning in the rare event algorithm. We
finally demonstrate the algorithm for radiation effects in a nuclear oxide
fuel, and we show the balanced parallel approach with high parallel efficiency
in multiple processor configurations.
