The reaction of alkali (Na, Cs) clusters with water clusters embedded in
helium nanodroplets is studied using femtosecond photo-ionization as well as
electron impact ionization. Unlike Na clusters, Cs clusters are found to
completely react with water in spite of the ultracold helium droplet
environment. Mass spectra of the Cs$_n$+(H$_2$O)$_m$ reaction products are
interpreted in terms of stability with respect to fragmentation using
high-level molecular structure calculations.
