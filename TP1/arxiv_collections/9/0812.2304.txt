The magnetoresistance oscillations in GaAs/Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As
heterostructures induced by millimeterwave radiation recently observed by Zudov
et al. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 64}, 201311 (2001)] is theoretically reproduced by
introducing a model based on the finite temperature Fermi liquid theory of dc
conductivity and the electron reservoir hypothesis. The obtained oscillation
patterns show excellent agreement with the experimental result by Zudov et al.
and are independent of the polarization of the radiation field in accordance
with the experimental observation by Smet et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95},
116804 (2005)].
