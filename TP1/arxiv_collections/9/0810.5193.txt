In the previous paper, the authors constructed a complete holomorphic
immersion of the unit disk D into C^2 whose image is bounded. In this paper, we
shall prove existence of complete holomorphic null immersions of Riemann
surfaces with arbitrary genus and finite topology, whose image is bounded in
C^2. To construct such immersions, we apply the method used by F. J. Lopez to
perturb the genus zero example changing its genus.
  As an analogue the above construction, we also give a new method to construct
complete bounded minimal immersions (resp. weakly complete maximal surface)
with arbitrary genus and finite topology in Euclidean 3-space (resp.
Lorentz-Minkowski 3-spacetime).
