We review various key issues in connection with the warped braneworld models
which provide us with new insights and explanations of physical phenomena
through interesting geometrical features of such extra dimensional theories.
Starting from the original Randall-Sundrum two brane models, we have discussed
the stability, hierarchy and other important issues in connection with such
braneworld. The role of higher derivative terms in the bulk for modulus
stabilization has been explained. Implications of the existence of various bulk
fields have been discussed and it has been shown how a warped braneworld model
can explain the invisibility of all antisymmetric bulk tensor fields on our
brane. We have also generalised the model for more than one warped dimensions
in the form of a multiply warped spacetime. It is shown that such model can
offer an explanation to the mass hierarchy among the standard model fermions
and the localization of fermions on the standard model brane with a definite
chirality.
