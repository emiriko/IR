A mechanism of point defect migration triggered by local depolarization
fields is shown to explain some still inexplicable features of aging in
acceptor doped ferroelectrics. A drift-diffusion model of the coupled charged
defect transport and electrostatic field relaxation within a two-dimensional
domain configuration is treated numerically and analytically. Numerical results
are given for the emerging internal bias field of about 1 kV/mm which levels
off at dopant concentrations well below 1 mol%; the fact, long ago known
experimentally but still not explained. For higher defect concentrations a
closed solution of the model equations in the drift approximation as well as an
explicit formula for the internal bias field is derived revealing the plausible
time, temperature and concentration dependencies of aging. The results are
compared to those due to the mechanism of orientational reordering of defect
dipoles.
