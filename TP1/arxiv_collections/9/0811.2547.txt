We argue that the string theory dual to a certain sector of the
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory at large-N is the A-model wrapping
N-Lagrangian D-branes on the twistor space of the complex two-dimensional
projective space, with certain fluxes and Wilson loops, by finding that the
target-space beta function of this A-model coincides with the large-N beta
function of the Yang-Mills theory
