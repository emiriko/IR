After presenting the broad context of authority sharing, we outline how
introducing more natural interaction in the design of the ground operator
interface of UV systems should help in allowing a single operator to manage the
complexity of his/her task. Introducing new modalities is one one of the means
in the realization of our vision of next- generation GOI. A more fundamental
aspect resides in the interaction manager which should help balance the
workload of the operator between mission and interaction, notably by applying a
multi-strategy approach to generation and interpretation. We intend to apply
these principles to the context of the Smaart prototype, and in this
perspective, we illustrate how to characterize the workload associated with a
particular operational situation.
