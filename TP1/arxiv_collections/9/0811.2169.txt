As a first step to understand anomalous kinetic roughening with
multifractality in recent experiments of the vapor deposition polymerization
(VDP) growth, we study a simple toy model of the VDP growth in a
(1+1)-dimensional lattice, along with monomer diffusion, polymer nucleation,
limited active end bonding, and shadowing effects. Using extensive numerical
simulations, we observe that the global roughness exponent is different from
the local one. It is argued that such anomalies in VDP growth are attributed to
the instability induced by the nonlocal shadowing effects on active ends of
polymers. As varying the ratio of diffusion coefficient to the deposition rate
by cosine flux, we also discuss the role of diffusion in kinetic roughening of
the polymer thin film growth, which is quite different from that of the metal
or semiconductor film growth. Finally, we suggest its (2+1)-dimensional
version, which can be directly compared with experimental results.
