We present measurements of the velocity distribution of calcium atoms in an
atomic beam generated using a dual-stage laser back-ablation apparatus.
Distributions are measured using a velocity selective Doppler time-of-flight
technique. They are Boltzmann-like with rms velocities corresponding to
temperatures above the melting point for calcium. Contrary to a recent report
in the literature, this method does not generate a sub-thermal atomic beam.
