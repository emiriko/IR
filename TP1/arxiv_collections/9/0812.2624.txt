Using Dunkl operators, we introduce a continuous family of canonical
invariants of finite reflection groups. We verify that the elementary canonical
invariants of the symmetric group are deformations of the elementary symmetric
polynomials. We also compute the canonical invariants for all dihedral groups
as certain hypergeometric functions.
