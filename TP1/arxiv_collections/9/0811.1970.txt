The Mathieu functions are used to solve analytically some problems in
elliptical cylinder coordinates. A computational toolbox was implemented in
Matlab. Since the notation and normalization for Mathieu functions vary in the
literature, we have included sufficient material to make this presentation self
contained. Thus, all formulas required to get the Mathieu functions are given
explicitly. Following the outlines in this presentation, the Mathieu functions
could be readily implemented in other computer programs and used in different
domains. Tables of numerical values are provided.
