In this paper, we present a theoretical study of a Bose-Einstein condensate
of interacting bosons in a quartic trap in one, two, and three dimensions.
Using Thomas-Fermi approximation, suitably complemented by numerical solutions
of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we study the ground sate condensate density
profiles, the chemical potential, the effects of cross-terms in the quartic
potential, temporal evolution of various energy components of the condensate,
and width oscillations of the condensate. Results obtained are compared with
corresponding results for a bose condensate in a harmonic confinement.
