Local time-dependent theory of Einstein - de Haas effect is developed. We
begin with microscopicinteractions and derive dynamical equations that couple
elastic deformations with internal twists due to spins. The theory is applied
to the description of the motion of a magnetic cantilever caused by the
oscillation of the domain wall. Theoretical results are compared with a recent
experiment on Einstein - de Haas effect in a microcantilever.
