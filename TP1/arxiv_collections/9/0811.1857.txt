We investigated the generic phase diagram of the electron doped
superconductor, Nd2-xCexCuO4, using films prepared by metal organic
decomposition. After careful oxygen reduction treatment to remove interstitial
Oap atoms, we found that the Tc increases monotonically from 24 K to 29 K with
decreasing x from 0.15 to 0.00, demonstrating a quite different phase diagram
from the previous bulk one. The implication of our results is discussed on the
basis of tremendous influence of Oap "impurities" on superconductivity and also
magnetism in T' cuprates. Then we conclude that our result represents the
generic phase diagram for oxygen-stoichiometric Nd2-xCexCuO4.
