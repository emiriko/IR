This essay suggests that a proper assessment of the presently unfolding
financial crisis, and its cure, requires going back at least to the late 1990s,
accounting for the cumulative effect of the ITC, real-estate and financial
derivative bubbles. We focus on the deep loss of trust, not only in Wall
Street, but more importantly in Main Street, and how to recover it on the short
and long terms. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to deal with the
nonlinear complex systems of the present world, in order to develop a culture
of fairness, and of upside opportunities associated with a risky world.
