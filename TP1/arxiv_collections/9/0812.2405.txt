Recently, great attention was intended toward overcomplete dictionaries and
the sparse representations they can provide. In a wide variety of signal
processing problems, sparsity serves a crucial property leading to high
performance. Inpainting, the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated
parts of images or videos, is an interesting application which can be handled
by suitably decomposition of an image through combination of overcomplete
dictionaries. This paper addresses a novel technique of such a decomposition
and investigate that through inpainting of images. Simulations are presented to
demonstrate the validation of our approach.
