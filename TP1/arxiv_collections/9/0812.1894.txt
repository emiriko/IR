The present paper discusses the use of modified Lotka-Volterra equations in
order to stochastically simulate the behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes and
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) during the fermentation period (168 h) of a typical
Sicilian salami. For this purpose, the differential equation system is set
considering T, pH and aw as stochastic variables. Each of them is governed by
dynamics that involve a deterministic linear decrease as a function of the time
t and an "additive noise" term which instantaneously mimics the fluctuations of
T, pH and aw. The choice of a suitable parameter accounting for the interaction
of LAB on L. monocytogenes as well as the introduction of appropriate noise
levels allows to match the observed data, both for the mean growth curves and
for the probability distribution of L. monocytogenes concentration at 168 h.
