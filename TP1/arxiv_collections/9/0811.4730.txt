A two-dimension self-similar solution is proposed for a plasma expansion with
anisotropic pressure. With the solution, it depends on the relationship between
the ratio of the longitudinal and the transverse temperature of the plasma,
$\kappa^2$ and the electron-ion mass ratio, $\mu$, that the plasma front is
composed by a part of hyperbolic (or a plane) and a small pointed projection at
the center or a part of an ellipse. Zhang and coworkers's experiments (PRL, 99,
167602 (2007))support our results for $\kappa^2\in(\tau,1]$. For
$\kappa^2\leq\tau$, there is an anomalous high-energy plasma emission at the
angle of near $90^{\text{o}}$ due to longitudinal Coulomb explosion.
