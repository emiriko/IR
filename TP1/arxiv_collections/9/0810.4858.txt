Recently it was noticed that among many scenarios of new physics leptoquarks
might compensate for the disagreement between the lattice and experimental
results for the charmed strange meson decay constant. The leptoquarks might
modify also the flavor changing neutral current charm decays. In this study we
investigate impact of the scalar leptoquark with electric charge -1/3 on the
dilepton invariant mass distribution in the D^+ --> pi^+ mu^+ mu^- decay and on
the branching ratios of the D^0 --> mu^+ mu^- using the existing experimental
results.
