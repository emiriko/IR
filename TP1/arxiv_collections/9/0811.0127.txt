A numerical study of QED radiative corrections for the SMC experiment at SPS
is been performed. The semi-analytical program POLRAD is been used to get the
size of the radiative corrections for the proton to get the size of the
radiative corrections for the measurements of the proton spin dependent
structure functions $g_1^p(x)$ and $g_2^p(x)$. A brief description of the
program POLRAD is given.
