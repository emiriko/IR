Density of states (DOS) of graphene under a high uniform magnetic field and
white-noise random potential is numerically calculated. The disorder broadened
zero-energy Landau band has a Gaussian shape whose width is proportional to the
random potential variance and the square root of magnetic field. Wegner-type
calculation is used to justify the results.
