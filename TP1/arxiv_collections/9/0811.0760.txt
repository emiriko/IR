In this paper we develop further a method for detecting unstable periodic
orbits (UPOs) by stabilising transformations, where the strategy is to
transform the system of interest in such a way that the orbits become stable.
The main difficulty of using this method is that the number of transformations,
which were used in the past, becomes overwhelming as we move to higher
dimensions (Davidchack and Lai 1999; Schmelcher et al. 1997, 1998). We have
recently proposed a set of stabilising transformations which is constructed
from a small set of already found UPOs (Crofts and Davidchack 2006). The main
benefit of using the proposed set is that its cardinality depends on the
dimension of the unstable manifold at the UPO rather than the dimension of the
system. In a typical situation the dimension of the unstable manifold is much
smaller than the dimension of the system so the number of transformations is
much smaller. Here we extend this approach to high-dimensional systems of ODEs
and apply it to the model example of a chaotic spatially extended system -- the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. A comparison is made between the performance of
this new method against the competing methods of Newton-Armijo (NA) and
Levernberg-Marquardt (LM). In the latter case, we take advantage of the fact
that the LM algorithm is able to solve under-determined systems of equations,
thus eliminating the need for any additional constraints.
