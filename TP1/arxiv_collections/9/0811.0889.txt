Growth rate of real GDP per capita is represented as a sum of two components
-- a monotonically decreasing economic trend and fluctuations related to a
specific age population change. The economic trend is modeled by an inverse
function of real GDP per capita with a numerator potentially constant for the
largest developed economies. Statistical analysis of 19 selected OECD countries
for the period between 1950 and 2004 shows a very weak linear trend in the
annual GDP per capita increment for the largest economies: the USA, Japan,
France, Italy, and Spain. The UK, Australia, and Canada show a larger positive
linear trend. The fluctuations around the trend values are characterized by a
quasi-normal distribution with potentially Levy distribution for far tails.
Developing countries demonstrate the increment values far below the mean
increment for the most developed economies. This indicates an underperformance
in spite of large relative growth rates.
