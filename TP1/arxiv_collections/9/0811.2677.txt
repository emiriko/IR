We show that, in the gapless Kondo Regime, a single local quench at one end
of a Kondo spin chain induces a fast and long lived oscillatory dynamics. This
quickly establishes a high quality entanglement between the spins at the
opposite ends of the chain. This entanglement is mediated by the Kondo Cloud,
attains a constant high value independent of the length for large chains, and
shows thermal robustness. In contrast, when the Kondo cloud is absent, e.g. in
the gapped dimer regime, only finite size end to end effects can create some
entanglement on a much longer time-scale for rather short chains. By decoupling
one end of the chain during the dynamics one can distinguish between this
end-end effect which vanishes, and the global Kondo cloud mediated
entanglement, which persists. This quench approach paves the way to detect the
elusive Kondo cloud through the entanglement between two individual spins. Our
results show that non-perturbative cooperative phenomena from condensed matter
may be exploited for quantum information.
