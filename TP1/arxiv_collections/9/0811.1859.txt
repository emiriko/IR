Chaotic cryptography is based on the properties of chaos as source of
entropy. Many different schemes have been proposed to take advantage of those
properties and to design new strategies to encrypt information. However, the
right and efficient use of chaos in the context of cryptography requires a
thorough knowledge about the dynamics of the selected chaotic system. Indeed,
if the final encryption system reveals enough information about the underlying
chaotic system it could be possible for a cryptanalyst to get the key, part of
the key or some information somehow equivalent to the key just analyzing those
dynamical properties leaked by the cryptosystem. This paper shows what those
dynamical properties are and how a cryptanalyst can use them to prove the
inadequacy of an encryption system for the secure exchange of information. This
study is performed through the introduction of a series of mathematical tools
which should be the basic framework of cryptanalysis in the context of digital
chaos-based cryptography.
