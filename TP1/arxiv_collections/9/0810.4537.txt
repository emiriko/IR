We consider a quantum particle coupled (with strength $\la$) to a spatial
array of independent non-interacting reservoirs in thermal states (heat baths).
Under the assumption that the reservoir correlations decay exponentially in
time, we prove that the long-time behavior of the particle is diffusive for
small, but finite $\la$. Our proof relies on an expansion around the kinetic
scaling limit ($\la \searrow 0$, while time and space scale as $\la^{-2}$) in
which the particle satisfies a Boltzmann equation. We also show an
equipartition theorem: the distribution of the kinetic energy of the particle
tends to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, up to a correction of $O(\la^2)$.
