We develop an understanding of the anomalous metal state of the parent
compounds of recently discovered iron based superconductors starting from a
strong coupling viewpoint, including orbital degrees of freedom. On the basis
of an intermediate-spin (S=1) state for the Fe^{2+} ions, we derive a
Kugel-Khomskii spin-orbital Hamiltonian for the active t_{2g} orbitals. It
turns out to be a highly complex model with frustrated spin and orbital
interactions. We compute its classical phase diagrams and provide an
understanding for the stability of the various phases by investigating its
spin-only and orbital-only limits. The experimentally observed spin-stripe
state is found to be stable over a wide regime of physical parameters and can
be accompanied by three different types of orbital orders. Of these the
orbital-ferro and orbital-stripe orders are particularly interesting since they
break the in-plane lattice symmetry -- a robust feature of the undoped
compounds. We compute the magnetic excitation spectra for the effective spin
Hamiltonian, observing a strong reduction of the ordered moment, and point out
that the proposed orbital ordering pattern can be measured in resonant X-ray
diffraction.
