The half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb is one of the local-moment ferromagnets with
unique properties for future applications. Band structure calculations predict
exclusively majority bands at the Fermi level, thus indicating {100%} spin
polarization there. As one thinks about applications and the design of
functional materials, the influence of chemical disorder in these materials
must be considered. The magnetization, spin polarization, and electronic
structure are expected to be sensitive to structural and stoichiometric
changes. In this contribution, we report on an investigation of the
spin-dependent electronic structure of NiMnSb. We studied the influence of
chemical disorder on the unoccupied electronic density of states by use of the
ab-initio Coherent Potential Approximation method. The theoretical analysis is
discussed along with corresponding spin-resolved Appearance Potential
Spectroscopy measurements. Our theoretical approach describes the spectra as
the fully-relativistic self-convolution of the matrix-element weighted,
orbitally resolved density of states.
