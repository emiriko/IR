In this paper we introduce the class of W_p scale mixture random vectors with
a particular radial decomposition and a independent splitting property
specified by some random variable W_p, and a positive constant p. We derive
several conditional limit results assuming that the distribution of the random
radius is in the max-domain of attraction of a univariate extreme value
distribution and W_p has a certain tail asymptotic behaviour. As an application
we obtain the joint asymptotic distribution of concomitants of order statics
considering certain bivariate W_p scale miture samples.
