This is a Response to a recent Comment [F.Y. Wu et al., Phil. Mag. 88, 3093
(2008), arXiv:0811.3876] on the conjectured solution of the three-dimensional
(3D) Ising model [Z.D. Zhang, Phil. Mag. 87, 5309 (2007), arXiv:0705.1045].
Several points are made: 1) Conjecture 1, regarding the additional rotation, is
understood as performing a transformation for smoothing all the crossings of
the knots; 2) The weight factors in Conjecture 2 are interpreted as a novel
topologic phase; 3) The conjectured solution and its low- and high-temperature
expansions are supported by the mathematical theorems for the analytical
behavior of the Ising model. The physics behind the extra dimension is also
discussed briefly.
