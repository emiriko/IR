Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon in which signal to noise (SN) ratio
gets improved by noise addition rather than removal as envisaged classically.
SR was first claimed in climatology a few decades ago and then in other
disciplines as well. The same as it is observed in natural systems, SR is used
also for allowable SN enhancements at will. Here I report a proof of principle
that SR can be useful in exploration geophysics. For this I perform high
frequency GaussVanicek variance spectral analyses (GVSA) of model traces
characterized by varying levels of complexity, completeness and pollution. This
demonstration justifies all further research on SR in applied geophysics, as
energy demands and depletion of reachable supplies potentially make SR vital in
a near future.
