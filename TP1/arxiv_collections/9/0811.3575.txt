A simple and most promising oxide-assisted catalyst-free method is used to
prepare silicon nitride nanowires that give rise to high yield in a short time.
After a brief analysis of the state of the art, we reveal the crucial role
played by the oxygen partial pressure: when oxygen partial pressure is slightly
below the threshold of passive oxidation, a high yield inhibiting the formation
of any silica layer covering the nanowires occurs and thanks to the synthesis
temperature one can control nanowire dimensions.
