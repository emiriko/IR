We present quantum dynamics of collisions between two para-H2 molecules from
low (1 mK) to high collision energies (1 eV). The calculations are carried out
using a quantum scattering code that solves the time-independent Schrodinger
equation in its full dimensionality without any decoupling approximations. The
six-dimensional potential energy surface for the H4 system developed by
Boothroyd et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 666 (2002)] is used in the calculations.
Elastic, inelastic and state-to-state cross sections as well as rate
coefficients from T = 1 K to 400 K obtained from our calculations are compared
with available experimental and theoretical results. Overall, good agreement is
obtained with previous studies.
