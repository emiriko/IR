A coarse-grained model developed by Marrink et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 111,
7812 (2007)] is applied to investigate vesiculation of lipid
[dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)] droplets in water. Three kinds of
morphologies of micelles are found with increasing lipid droplet size. When the
initial lipid droplet is smaller, the equilibrium structure of the droplet is a
spherical micelle. When the initial lipid droplet is larger, the lipid ball
starts to transform into a disk micelle or vesicle. The mechanism of vesicle
formation from a lipid ball is analyzed from the self-assembly of DPPC on the
molecular level, and the morphological transition from disk to vesicle with
increasing droplet size is demonstrated. Importantly, we discover that the
transition point is not very sharp, and for a fixed-size lipid ball, the disk
and vesicle appear with certain probabilities. The splitting phenomenon, i.e.,
the formation of a disk/vesicle structure from a lipid droplet, is explained by
applying a hybrid model of the Helfrich membrane theory. The elastic module of
the DPPC bilayer and the smallest size of a lipid droplet for certain formation
of a vesicle are successfully predicted.
