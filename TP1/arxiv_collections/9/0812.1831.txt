One of the most important topics in geophysics is to study convection in a
sea. Based on the algebraic characteristics of the equations of dynamic
convection in a sea, we introduce various schemes with multiple parameter
functions to solve these equations and obtain families of new explicit exact
solutions with multiple parameter functions. Moreover, symmetry transformations
are used to simplify our arguments.
