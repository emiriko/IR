Double beta processes in 64-Zn, 70-Zn, 180-W, and 186-W have been searched
for with the help of large volume (0.1-0.7 kg) low background ZnWO4 crystal
scintillators at the Gran Sasso National Laboratories of the INFN. Total time
of measurements exceeds 10 thousands hours. New improved half-life limits on
double electron capture and electron capture with positron emission in 64-Zn
have been set, in particular (all the limits are at 90% C.L.): T1/2(0nu2EC)>
1.1e20 yr, T1/2(2nuECbeta+)>7.0e20 yr, and T1/2(0nuECbeta+)>4.3e20 yr. The
different modes of double beta processes in 70-Zn, 180-W, and 186-W have been
restricted at the level of 1e17-1e20 yr.
