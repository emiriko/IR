We justify the practical use of the Shuvaev integral transform approach to
calculate the skewed distributions, needed to describe diffractive processes,
directly from the conventional diagonal global parton distributions. We address
doubts which have been raised about this procedure. We emphasise that the
approach, on the one hand, satisfies all theoretical reqirements, and, on the
other hand, is consistent with DVCS data at NLO. We construct an easily
accessible package for the computation of these skewed distributions.
