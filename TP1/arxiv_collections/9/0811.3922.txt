In this paper, we parametrize certain irreducible supercuspidal
representations of U(1,1) and U(2) via explicit induction data. The
parametrization depends on traceless elements of negative valuation in a
quadratic extension of base field. We use the lattice model of the Weil
representation to determine which traceless elements are involved in the theta
correspondence for reductive dual pair U(1,1) and U(2).
