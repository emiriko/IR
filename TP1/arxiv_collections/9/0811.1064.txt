The one-dimensional deterministic economic model recently studied by
Gonzalez-Estevez et al. [Physica A 387, 4367 (2008)] is considered on a
two-dimensional square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. In this
model, the evolution of each agent is described by a map coupled with its
nearest neighbors. The map has two factors: a linear term that accounts for the
agent's own tendency to grow and an exponential term that saturates this growth
through the control effect of the environment. The regions in the parameter
space where the system displays Pareto and Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics are
calculated for the cases of von Neumann and of Moore's neighborhoods. It is
found that, even when the parameters in the system are kept fixed, a transition
from Pareto to Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior can occur when the number of neighbors
of each agent increases.
