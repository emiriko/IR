The angular dependences of the spontaneous emission by hot electrons in
multivalley semiconductors are studied theoretically and experimentally using
$n$-Ge as an example. We demonstrate that the change in the scattering
mechanism caused by the growth of electron temperature can affect the angular
scattering dependence. In the case when the heating field is applied along the
symmetry axis of the crystal [for $n$-Ge it is the axis (1,0,0,)], the angular
dependence of the emission was observed experimentally for the first time, and
the corresponding theory is proposed. When electrons have identical
concentration and temperature in every valley, the angular dependence of
emission is shown to be related to the violation of symmetry of the energy
distribution of electrons (from the theoretical viewpoint, this effect means
going beyond the scope of the traditional diffusion approximation).
