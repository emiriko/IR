Minkowski structure of the Fermion propagator in QED$_{2+1}$ is evaluated
using dispersion like method Including massive fermion loop to the photon
spectral function there is no infrared divergences in the gauge d=-1.Screening
effects suppress the chiral order parmeter for small numbers of fermion flavour
N.We evaluate the order parameter as a function of coupling constant c and
N.There exsists a critical region where the chiral symmetry is dynamically
broken.
