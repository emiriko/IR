In a previous work (arXiv:0806.1503v2), we defined a family of subcomplexes
of the $n$-dimensional half cube by removing the interiors of all half cube
shaped faces of dimension at least $k$, and we proved that the homology of such
a subcomplex is concentrated in degree $k-1$. This homology group supports a
natural action of the Coxeter group $W(D_n)$ of type $D$. In this paper, we
explicitly determine the characters (over ${\Bbb C}$) of these homology
representations, which turn out to be multiplicity free. Regarded as
representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ by restriction, the homology
representations turn out to be direct sums of certain representations induced
from parabolic subgroups. The latter representations of $\sym_n$ agree (over
${\Bbb C}$) with the representations of $\sym_n$ on the $(k-2)$-nd homology of
the complement of the $k$-equal real hyperplane arrangement.
