We study the a_0 and K_0^* light scalar mesons in 2+1 flavor full QCD.
Particular attention is paid to fitting excited states, with an eye toward
determining whether scattering states are revealed. An ultimate goal will be to
see how dynamical quarks affect the picture outlined with an earlier quenched
study using overlap fermions, namely, that it is the a_0(1450), not the
a_0(980), which is the lowest $\bar{q}q$ isovector scalar state.
