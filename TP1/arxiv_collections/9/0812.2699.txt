Linearized equations of motion for gravitational and scalar fields are found
and solved in a stabilized brane world model in five-dimensional Brans-Dicke
theory. The physical degrees of freedom are isolated, the mass spectrum of
Kaluza-Klein excitations is found and the coupling constants of these
excitations to matter on the negative tension brane are calculated.
