We obtain bi-Hamiltonian structure for a family of integrable systems on the
sphere S with an additional integral of third order in momenta. These results
are applied to the Goryachev system and Goryachev-Chaplygin top for which we
give an explicit procedure to find the separated coordinates and the separated
relations.
