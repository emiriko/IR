One of the current challenges of Information Systems is to ensure
semi-structured data transmission, such as multimedia data, in a distributed
and pervasive environment. Information Sytems must then guarantee users a
quality of service ensuring data accessibility whatever the hardware and
network conditions may be. They must also guarantee information coherence and
particularly intelligibility that imposes a personalization of the service.
Within this framework, we propose a design method based on original models of
multimedia applications and quality of service. We also define a supervision
platform Kalinahia using a user centered heuristic allowing us to define at any
moment which configuration of software components constitutes the best answers
to users' wishes in terms of service.
