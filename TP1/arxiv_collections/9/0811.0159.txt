Three bosons with large scattering length show universal properties that do
not depend on the details of the interaction at short distances. In the
three-boson system, these properties include a geometric spectrum of shallow
three-body states called "Efimov states" and log-periodic dependence of
scattering observables on the scattering length. We investigate the
modification of the Efimov states in a finite cubic box and calculate the
dependence of their energies on the box size using effective field theory. We
explicitly verify the renormalization of the effective field theory in the
finite volume.
