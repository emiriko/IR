We study adaptive control of classical ergodic Hamiltonian systems, where the
controlling parameter varies slowly in time and is influenced by system's state
(feedback). An effective adiabatic description is obtained for slow variables
of the system. A general limit on the feedback induced negative entropy
production is uncovered. It relates the quickest negentropy production to
fluctuations of the control Hamiltonian. The method deals efficiently with the
entropy-information trade off.
