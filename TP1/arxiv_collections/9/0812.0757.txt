A review is presented of jet substructure measurements from the H1 and ZEUS
Collaborations at HERA. The results presented include tests of perturbative
QCD, comparison of the properties of quark and gluon jets, the comparison of
the pattern of QCD radiation in different hard scattering processes,
determination of the strong coupling and studies of the underlying subprocesses
dynamics and of the pattern of parton radiation.
