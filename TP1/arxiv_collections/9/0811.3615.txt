We introduce and study the notion of a biholomorphic gerbe with connection.
The biholomorphic gerbe provides a natural geometrical framework for
generalized Kahler geometry in a manner analogous to the way a holomorphic line
bundle is related to Kahler geometry. The relation between the gerbe and the
generalized Kahler potential is discussed.
