Effective Casimir forces induced by thermal fluctuations in the vicinity of
bulk critical points are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations in
three-dimensional systems for film geometries and within the experimentally
relevant Ising and XY universality classes. Several surface universality
classes of the confining surfaces are considered, some of which are relevant
for recent experiments. A novel approach introduced previously EPL 80, 60009
(2007), based inter alia on an integration scheme of free energy differences,
is utilized to compute the universal scaling functions of the critical Casimir
forces in the critical range of temperatures above and below the bulk critical
temperature. The resulting predictions are compared with corresponding
experimental data for wetting films of fluids and with available theoretical
results.
