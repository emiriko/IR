This paper describes a simulator of ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies for
cancer diagnosis. When performing biopsy series, the clinician has to move the
ultrasound probe and to mentally integrate the real-time bi-dimensional images
into a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the anatomical environment.
Such a 3D representation is necessary to sample regularly the prostate in order
to maximize the probability of detecting a cancer if any. To make the training
of young physicians easier and faster we developed a simulator that combines
images computed from three-dimensional ultrasound recorded data to haptic
feedback. The paper presents the first version of this simulator.
