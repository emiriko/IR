We demonstrate nuclear double resonance for nanometer-scale volumes of spins
where random fluctuations rather than Boltzmann polarization dominate. When the
Hartmann-Hahn condition is met in a cross-polarization experiment, flip-flops
occur between two species of spins and their fluctuations become coupled. We
use magnetic resonance force microscopy to measure this effect between 1H and
13C spins in 13C-enriched stearic acid. The development of a cross-polarization
technique for statistical ensembles adds an important tool for generating
chemical contrast in nanometer-scale magnetic resonance.
