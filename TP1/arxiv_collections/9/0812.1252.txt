We demonstrate that left-handed resonance transmission from metallic
metamaterial, composed of periodically arranged double rings, can be extended
to visible spectrum by introducing an active medium layer as the substrate. The
severe ohmic loss inside metals at optical frequencies is compensated by
stimulated emission of radiation in this active system. Due to the resonance
amplification mechanism of recently proposed lasing spaser, the left-handed
transmission band can be restored up to 610 nm wavelength, in dependence on the
gain coefficient of the active layer. Additionally, threshold gains for
different scaling levels of the double-ring unit are investigated to evaluate
the gain requirement of left-handed transmission restoration at different
frequency ranges.
