We calculate the relative conserved currents, superpotentials and conserved
quantities between two homogeneous and isotropic universes. In particular we
prove that their relative "energy" (defined as the conserved quantity
associated to cosmic time coordinate translations for a comoving observer) is
vanishing and so are the other conserved quantities related to a Lie subalgebra
of vector fields isomorphic to the Poincar\'e algebra. These quantities are
also conserved in time. We also find a relative conserved quantity for such a
kind of solutions which is conserved in time though non-vanishing. This example
provides at least two insights in the theory of conserved quantities in General
Relativity. First, the contribution of the cosmological matter fluid to the
conserved quantities is carefully studied and proved to be vanishing. Second,
we explicitly show that our superpotential (that happens to coincide with the
so-called KBL potential although it is generated differently) provides strong
conservation laws under much weaker hypotheses than the ones usually required.
In particular, the symmetry generator is not needed to be Killing (nor Killing
of the background, nor asymptotically Killing), the prescription is quasi-local
and it works fine in a finite region too and no matching condition on the
boundary is required.
