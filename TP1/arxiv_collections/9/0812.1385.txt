The distinguishing result of this paper is a $\mathbf{P}$-time enumerable
partition of all the potential perfect matchings in a bipartite graph. This
partition is a set of equivalence classes induced by the missing edges in the
potential perfect matchings.
  We capture the behavior of these missing edges in a polynomially bounded
representation of the exponentially many perfect matchings by a graph theoretic
structure, called MinSet Sequence, where MinSet is a P-time enumerable
structure derived from a graph theoretic counterpart of a generating set of the
symmetric group. This leads to a polynomially bounded generating set of all the
classes, enabling the enumeration of perfect matchings in polynomial time. The
sequential time complexity of this $\mathbf{\#P}$-complete problem is shown to
be $O(n^{45}\log n)$.
  And thus we prove a result even more surprising than $\mathbf{NP = P}$, that
is, $\mathbf{\#P}=\mathbf{FP}$, where $\mathbf{FP}$ is the class of functions,
$f: \{0, 1\}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $, computable in polynomial time on a
deterministic model of computation.
