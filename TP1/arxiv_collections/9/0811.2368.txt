A formalism is presented to evaluate the Sivers function in constituent quark
models. A non-relativistic reduction of the scheme is performed and applied to
the Isgur-Karl model. The sign for the $u$ and $d$ flavor contributions that we
obtained turns out to be opposite. The Burkardt Sum Rule is fulfilled to a
large extent. After the estimate of the QCD evolution of the results from the
momentum scale of the model to the experimental one, a reasonable agreement
with the available data is obtained.
