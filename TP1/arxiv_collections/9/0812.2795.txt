We use Omnes representations of the form factors V, A_1 and A_2 for exclusive
semileptonic B--> rho decays, and apply them to combine experimental partial
branching fraction information with theoretical calculations of the three form
factors to extract |Vub|. We find a slightly lower result, |Vub|=(2.8 +- 0.2)x
10^{-3}, than the values extracted from exclusive semileptonic B-->pi decays
and using all other inputs in CKM fits. The disagreement is greater when we
compare to the result extracted from inclusive B -> X_u l nu decays.
