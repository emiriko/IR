I explore the phenomenology, constraints and tuning for several weakly
coupled implementations of multi-parameter gauge mediation and compare to
minimal gauge mediation. The low energy spectra are distinct from that of
minimal gauge mediation, a wide range of NLSPs is found and spectra are
significantly compressed thus tunings may be generically reduced to a part in
10 to a part in 20.
