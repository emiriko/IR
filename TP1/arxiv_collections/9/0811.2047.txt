We propose replacing concurrence by convex-roof extended negativity (CREN)
for studying monogamy of entanglement (MoE). We show that all proven MoE
relations using concurrence can be rephrased in terms of CREN. Furthermore we
show that higher-dimensional (qudit) extensions of MoE in terms of CREN are not
disproven by any of the counterexamples used to disprove qudit extensions of
MoE in terms of concurrence. We further test the CREN version of MoE for qudits
by considering fully or partially coherent mixtures of a qudit W-class state
with the vacuum and show that the CREN version of MoE for qudits is satisfied
in this case as well. The CREN version of MoE for qudits is thus a strong
conjecture with no obvious counterexamples.
