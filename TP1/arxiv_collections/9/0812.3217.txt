Using special capacitors our experiments discovered that the ground state K,
Rb or Cs atom is polar atom with a large permanent electric dipole moment (EDM)
of the order of eao (ao is Bohr radius) as excited state of hydrogen atom. But
we can not calculate the EDM of an atom using Boltzmann constant. The mechanism
of polar atoms by which orientation polarization arises completely differs from
polar molecules. The orientation polarization of polar molecule, such as HCl or
H2O etc, is a molecule as a whole turned toward the direction of an external
field. Unlike polar molecules, the orientation polarization of polar atom, such
as K, Rb or Cs atom, is only the valence electron in the outermost shell, along
a highly elliptical orbit, turned toward the direction of the field, but the
rest of the atom does not move! The article derived the new form of Boltzmann
constant. When it was applied to orientation polarization of polar atoms, its
value k is far less than 1.38*10-23 J/K(for example, k=7.14*10-29 J/K for Cs
atom) . When it was applied to any molecule, non-polar atom or translation and
vibration of polar atom, its value k=1.38*10-23J/K. The reason is that the
nucleus moves together with the rest of the molecule or atom. (see
