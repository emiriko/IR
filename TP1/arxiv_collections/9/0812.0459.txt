We present the theory of a single spin meter consisting of a quantum dot in a
magnetic field under microwave irradiation combined with a charge counter. We
show that when a current is passed through the dot, a change in the average
occupation number occurs if the microwaves are resonant with the on-dot Zeeman
splitting. The width of the resonant change is given by the microwave induced
Rabi frequency, making the quantum dot a sensitive probe of the local magnetic
field and enabling the detection of the state of a nearby spin. If the dot-spin
and the nearby spin have different g-factors a non-demolition readout of the
spin state can be achieved. The conditions for a reliable spin readout are
found.
