Fermi-Dirac integrals appear frequently in semiconductor problems, so a basic
understanding of their properties is essential. The purpose of these notes is
to collect in one place, some basic information about Fermi-Dirac integrals and
their properties.
  We also present Matlab scripts that calculate Fermi-Dirac integrals (the
"script F" defined by Dingle (1957)) in three different ways. The codes are
available in Appendix and at the following website: "Notes on Fermi-Dirac
Integrals (4th Edition)" by Raseong Kim, Xufeng Wang, and Mark Lundstrom at
http://nanohub.org/resources/5475
  In the 4th edition, we also provide a new table-based Matlab script (download
available at https://github.com/wang159/FDIntegral_Table) that is less likely
to give large errors in a wide range of input while still much faster than the
rigorous numerical integration.
