We consider the moduli space, in the sense of Kisin, of finite flat models of
a 2-dimensional representation with values in a finite field of the absolute
Galois group of a totally ramified extension of $mathbb{Q}_p$. We determine the
connected components of this space and describe its irreducible components.
These results prove a modified version of a conjecture of Kisin.
