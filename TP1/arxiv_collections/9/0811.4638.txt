We present an holographical soft wall model which is able to reproduce not
only Regge spectra for hadrons with arbitrary integer spin, but also with spin
1/2 and 3/2, and with an arbitrary number of constituents. The model includes
the anomalous dimension of operators than create hadrons, together with a
dilaton, whose form is suggested by Einstein equations and the AdS metric.
