For manipulations of multipartite quantum systems, it was well known that all
local operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) constitute a proper
subset of the class of separable operations. Recently, Gheorghiu and Griffiths
found that LOCC and general separable operations are equally powerful for
transformations between bipartite pure states. In this letter we extend this
comparison to mixed states and show that in general separable operations are
strictly stronger than LOCC when transforming a mixed state to a pure entangled
state. A remarkable consequence of our finding is the existence of entanglement
monotone which may increase under separable operations.
