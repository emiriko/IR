The UV divergences associated with transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distribution functions (PDF) are calculated together with the ensuing one-loop
anomalous dimensions in the light-cone gauge. Time-reversal-odd effects in the
anomalous dimensions are observed and the role of Glauber gluons is discussed.
A generalized renormalization procedure of TMD PDFs is proposed, relying upon
the renormalization of contour-dependent operators with obstructions.
