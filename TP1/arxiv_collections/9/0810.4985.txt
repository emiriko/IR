We show that for a generic nullhomotopic simple closed curve C in the
boundary of a compact, orientable, mean convex 3-manifold M with trivial second
homology, there is a unique area minimizing disk D embedded in M where the
boundary of D is C. We also show that the same is true for absolutely area
minimizing surfaces.
