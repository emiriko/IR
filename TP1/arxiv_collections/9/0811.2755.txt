Anomalous far infrared monochromatic transmission through a lattice of
Abrikosov vortices in a type-II superconducting film is found and reported. The
transmitted frequency corresponds to the photonic mode localized by the defects
of the Abrokosov lattice. These defects are formed by extra vortices placed out
of the nodes of the ideal Abrokosov lattice. The extra vortices can be pinned
by crystal lattice defects of a superconductor. The corresponding frequency is
studied as a function of magnetic field and temperature in the framework of the
Dirac-type two-band model. While our approach is valid for all type-II
superconductors, the specific calculations have been performed for the
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO). The control of the transmitted
frequency by varying magnetic field and/or temperature is analyzed. It is
suggested that found anomalously transmitted localized mode can be utilized in
the far infrared monochromatic filters.
