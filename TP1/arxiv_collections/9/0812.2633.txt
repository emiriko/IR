We experimentally demonstrate pseudothermal ghost imaging and ghost
diffraction using only a single single-pixel detector. We achieve this by
replacing the high resolution detector of the reference beam with a computation
of the propagating field, following a recent proposal by Shapiro [J. H.
Shapiro, arXiv:0807.2614 (2008)]. Since only a single detector is used, this
provides an experimental evidence that pseudothermal ghost imaging does not
rely on non-local quantum correlations. In addition, we show the
depth-resolving capability of this ghost imaging technique.
