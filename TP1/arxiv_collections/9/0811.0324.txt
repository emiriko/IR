Optical orientation is a highly efficient tool for the generation of
nonequilibrium spin polarization in semiconductors. Combined with
spin-polarized transport it offers new functionalities for conventional
electronic devices, such as pn junction bipolar diodes or transistors. In
nominally nonmagnetic junctions optical orientation can provide a source for
spin capacitance--the bias-dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation--or for
spin-polarized current in bipolar spin-polarized solar cells. In magnetic
junctions, the nonequilibrium spin polarization generated by spin orientation
in a proximity of an equilibrium magnetization gives rise to the spin-voltaic
effect (a realization of the Silsbee-Johnson coupling), enabling efficient
control of electrical properties such as the I-V characteristics of the
junctions by magnetic and optical fields. This article reviews the main results
of investigations of spin-polarized and magnetic pn junctions, from spin
capacitance to the spin-voltaic effect.
