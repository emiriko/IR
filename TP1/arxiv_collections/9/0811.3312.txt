In a recent paper [1] (also at http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/0803.3721), I made
several critical remarks on a 'Hermitian time operator' proposed by Galapon [2]
(also at http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0111061).
  Galapon has correctly pointed out that remarks pertaining to 'denseness' of
the commutator domain are wrong [3]. However, the other remarks still apply,
and it is further noted that a given quantum system can be a member of this
domain only at a set of times of total measure zero.
