A cyclotomic polynomial Phi_n(x) is said to be ternary if n=pqr with p,q and
r distinct odd prime factors. Ternary cyclotomic polynomials are the simplest
ones for which the behaviour of the coefficients is not completely understood.
Eli Leher showed in 2007 that neighboring ternary cyclotomic coefficients
differ by at most four. We show that, in fact, they differ by at most one.
Consequently, the set of coefficients occurring in a ternary cyclotomic
polynomial consists of consecutive integers.
  As an application we reprove in a simpler way a result of Bachman from 2004
on ternary cyclotomic polynomials with an optimally large set of coefficients.
