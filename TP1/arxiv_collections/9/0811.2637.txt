In this paper, the design of universal compressive sensing filter based on
normal filters including the lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and bandstop filters
with different cutoff frequencies (or bandwidth) has been developed to enable
signal acquisition with sub-Nyquist sampling. Moreover, to control flexibly the
size and the coherence of the compressive sensing filter, as an example, the
microstrip filter based on defected ground structure (DGS) has been employed to
realize the compressive sensing filter. Of course, the compressive sensing
filter also can be constructed along the identical idea by many other
structures, for example, the man-made electromagnetic materials, the plasma
with different electron density, and so on. By the proposed architecture, the
n-dimensional signals of S-sparse in arbitrary orthogonal frame can be exactly
reconstructed with measurements on the order of Slog(n) with overwhelming
probability, which is consistent with the bonds estimated by theoretical
analysis.
