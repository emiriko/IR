Superconductivity is found in 50% K-doped EuFe2As2 sample below 33 K. Our
results of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and 57Fe and 151Eu
Mossbauer spectroscopy provide clear evidence that the ordering of the Fe
moments observed at 190 K in undoped EuFe2As2 is completely suppressed in our
50% K doped sample, thus there is no coexistence between the Fe magnetic order
and the superconducting state. However, short range ordering of the Eu moments
is coexisting with the superconducting state below 15 K. A bump in the
susceptibility well below Tc as well as a slight broadening of the Fe Mossbauer
line below 15 K evidence an interplay between the Eu magnetism and the
superconducting state.
