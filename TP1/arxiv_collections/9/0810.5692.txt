We use molecular dynamics simulation results on viscous binary Lennard-Jones
mixtures to examine the correlation between the potential energy and the
virial. In accord with a recent proposal [U. R. Pedersen et. al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 100, 015701 (2008)], the fluctuations in the two quantities are found to
be strongly correlated, exhibiting a proportionality constant, Gamma,
numerically equal to one-third the slope of an inverse power law approximation
to the intermolecular potential function. The correlation is stronger at higher
densities, where interatomic separations are in the range where the inverse
power law approximation is more accurate. These same liquids conform to
thermodynamic scaling of their dynamics, with the scaling exponent equal to
Gamma. Thus, the properties of strong correlation between energy and pressure
and thermodynamic scaling both reflect the ability of an inverse power law
representation of the potential to capture interesting features of the dynamics
of dense, highly viscous liquids.
