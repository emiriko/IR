The direct constraint on the parameters of short range pseudomagnetic
interaction of free neutron with matter is obtained from the recent test
experiment on a search for neutron EDM by crystal-diffraction method. It is
shown that this constraint on a product of scalar to pseudo-scalar coupling
constants $g_s g_p$ is better than that of any other method for the range
$\lambda < 10^{-5}$cm.
