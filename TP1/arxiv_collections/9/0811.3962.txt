Calculation of the vacuum polarization, $<\phi^2(x)>$, and expectation value
of the stress tensor, $<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>$, has seen a recent resurgence, notably
for black hole spacetimes. To date, most calculations of this type have been
done only in four dimensions. Extending these calculations to $d$ dimensions
includes $d$-dimensional renormalization. Typically, the renormalizing terms
are found from Christensen's covariant point splitting method for the
DeWitt-Schwinger expansion. However, some manipulation is required to put the
correct terms into a form that is compatible with problems of the vacuum
polarization type. Here, after a review of the current state of affairs for
$<\phi^2(x)>$ and $<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>$ calculations and a thorough introduction to
the method of calculating $<\phi^2(x)>$, a compact expression for the
DeWitt-Schwinger renormalization terms suitable for use in even-dimensional
spacetimes is derived. This formula should be useful for calculations of
$<\phi^2(x)>$ and $<T_{\mu\nu}(x)>$ in even dimensions, and the renormalization
terms are shown explicitly for four and six dimensions. Furthermore, use of the
finite terms of the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion as an approximation to
$<\phi^2(x)>$ for certain spacetimes is discussed, with application to four and
five dimensions.
