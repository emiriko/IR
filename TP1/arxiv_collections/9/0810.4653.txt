We found that spin-one new light particle exchanges are strongly bounded by
high-energy and small momentum transfer np elastic scattering data; the
analogous bound for a scalar particle is considerably weaker, while for a
pseudoscalar particle no bounds can be set. These bounds are compared with the
bounds extracted from low-energy n-Pb scattering experiments and from the
bounds of pi0 and K+ meson decays.
