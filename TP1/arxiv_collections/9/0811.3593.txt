We present an implementation of absorbing boundary conditions for the
Einstein equations based on the recent work of Buchman and Sarbach. In this
paper, we assume that spacetime may be linearized about Minkowski space close
to the outer boundary, which is taken to be a coordinate sphere. We reformulate
the boundary conditions as conditions on the gauge-invariant
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli scalars. Higher-order radial derivatives are eliminated
by rewriting the boundary conditions as a system of ODEs for a set of auxiliary
variables intrinsic to the boundary. From these we construct boundary data for
a set of well-posed constraint-preserving boundary conditions for the Einstein
equations in a first-order generalized harmonic formulation. This construction
has direct applications to outer boundary conditions in simulations of isolated
systems (e.g., binary black holes) as well as to the problem of
Cauchy-perturbative matching. As a test problem for our numerical
implementation, we consider linearized multipolar gravitational waves in TT
gauge, with angular momentum numbers l=2 (Teukolsky waves), 3 and 4. We
demonstrate that the perfectly absorbing boundary condition B_L of order L=l
yields no spurious reflections to linear order in perturbation theory. This is
in contrast to the lower-order absorbing boundary conditions B_L with L<l,
which include the widely used freezing-Psi_0 boundary condition that imposes
the vanishing of the Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0.
