We propose some formulations of the notion of "operational independence" of
two subsystems of a larger quantum system and clarify their relation to other
independence concepts in the literature. In addition, we indicate why the
operational independence of quantum subsystems holds quite generally, both in
nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum theory.
