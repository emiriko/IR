We detected broadband coherent terahertz (THz) emission from multiferroic
BiFeO3 after illuminating a high-quality bulk single ferroelectric domain
crystal with a ~100 fs optical pulse. The dependence of the emitted THz
waveform on the energy and polarization of the optical pulse is consistent with
the optical rectification mechanism of THz emission. The THz emission provides
a sensitive probe of the electric polarization state of BiFeO3, enabling
applications in ferroelectric memories and ferroelectric domain imaging. We
also report room-temperature THz optical constants of BiFeO3.
