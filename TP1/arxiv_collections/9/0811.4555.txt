Two-dimensional manganese oxide layers have been grown on Pd(100) and have
been characterized by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron
diffraction (LEED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The complex
surface phase diagram of MnOx on Pd(100) is reported, where nine different
novel Mn oxide phases have been detected as a function of the chemical
potential of oxygen mO. Three regions of the chemical potential of oxygen can
be identified, in which structurally related oxide phases are formed, often in
coexistence at the surface. The different regions of mO are reflected in the
oxidation states of the respective Mn oxide nanolayers as revealed by the Mn 2p
and O 1s XPS binding energies. The MnOx nanolayers form two-dimensional wetting
layers and it is speculated that they mediate the epitaxial growth of MnO on
Pd(100) by providing structurally graded interfaces.
