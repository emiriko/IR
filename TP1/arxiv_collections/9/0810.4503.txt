The scaling limit of planar loop-erased random walks is described by a
stochastic Loewner evolution with parameter kappa=2. In this note SLE(2) in the
upper half-plane H minus a simply-connected compact subset K of H is studied.
As a main result, the left-passage probability with respect to K is explicitly
determined.
