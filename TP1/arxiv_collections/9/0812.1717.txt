Using molecular-dynamics simulation and finite-element modelling, we simulate
nanoindentation into the three principal surfaces -- the (100), (110) and (111)
surface -- of Cu and Al. In the elastic regime, the simulation data agree
fairly well with the linear elastic theory of indentation into an elastically
anisotropic substrate. With increasing indentation, the effect of pressure
hardening becomes visible. When the critical stress for dislocation nucleation
is reached, even the elastically isotropic Al shows a strong dependence of the
surface orientation on the force-displacement curves. After the load drop, when
plasticity ahs set in, the influence of the surface orientation is lost, and
the contact pressure (hardness) becomes independent of the surface orientation.
