Using exact diagonalisation and Density Matrix Renormalisation group (DMRG)
approach, we analyse the transition to a localised state of a weakly
interacting quasi-1D Bose gas subjected to a quasiperiodic potential. The
analysis is performed by calculating the superfluid fraction, density profile,
momentum distribution and visibility for different periodicities of the second
lattice and in the presence (or not) of a weak repulsive interaction. It is
shown that the transition is sharper towards the maximally incommensurate ratio
between the two lattice periodicities, and shifted to higher values of the
second lattice strength by weak repulsive interactions. We also relate our
results to recent experiments.
