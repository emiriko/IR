The Feshbach shape resonances in the interband pairing in superconducting
superlattices of quantum wells or quantum stripes is shown to provide the
mechanism for high Tc superconductivity. This mechanism provides the Tc
amplification driven by the architecture of material: superlattices of quantum
wells (intercalated graphite or diborides) and superlattices of quantum stripes
(doped high Tc cuprate perovskites) where the chemical potential is tuned to a
Van Hove-Lifshitz singularity (vHs) in the electronic energy spectrum of the
superlattice associated with the change of the Fermi surface dimensionality in
one of the subbands.
