In this paper, we discuss some general connections between the notions of
positive map, weak majorization and entropic inequalities in the context of
detection of entanglement among bipartite quantum systems. First, basing on the
fact that any positive map $\Lambda:M_{d}(\mathbb{C})\to M_{d}(\mathbb{C})$ can
be written as the difference between two completely positive maps
$\Lambda=\Lambda_{1}-\Lambda_{2}$, we propose a possible way to generalize the
Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion. Then we present two methods of
derivation of some general classes of entropic inequalities useful for the
detection of entanglement. While the first one follows from the aforementioned
generalized majorization relation and the concept of the Schur--concave
decreasing functions, the second is based on some functional inequalities. What
is important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and
entropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states
with positive partial transposition when using indecomposable positive maps. We
also point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is
detected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\Lambda$, then
there exist entropic inequalities derived from $\Lambda$ (by both procedures)
that also detect this state. In this sense, they are equivalent to the
necessary criterion $[I\ot\Lambda](\varrho_{AB})\geq 0$. Moreover, our
inequalities provide a way of constructing multi--copy entanglement witnesses
and therefore are promising from the experimental point of view. Finally, we
discuss some of the derived inequalities in the context of recently introduced
protocol of state merging and possibility of approximating the mean value of a
linear entanglement witness.
