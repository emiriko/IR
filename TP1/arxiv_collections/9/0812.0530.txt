We consider holography for d-dimensional scale invariant but non-Lorentz
invariant field theories, which do not admit the full Schrodinger symmetry
group. We find new realizations of the corresponding (d+1)-dimensional gravity
duals, engineered with a variety of matter Lagrangians, and their finite
temperature generalizations. The thermodynamic properties of the finite
temperature backgrounds are precisely those expected for anisotropic, scale
invariant field theories. The brane and string theory realizations of such
backgrounds are briefly discussed, along with their holographic interpretation
in terms of marginal but non Lorentz invariant deformations of conformal field
theories. We initiate discussion of holographic renormalization in these
backgrounds, and note that such systematic renormalization is necessary to
obtain the correct behavior of correlation functions.
