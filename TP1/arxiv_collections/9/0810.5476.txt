Possible crystalline modifications of chemical compounds at low temperatures
correspond to local minima of the energy landscape. Determining these minima
via simulated annealing is one method for the prediction of crystal structures,
where the number of atoms per unit cell is the only information used. It is
demonstrated that this method can be applied to covalent systems, at the
example of boron nitride, using ab initio energies in all stages of the
optimization, i.e. both during the global search and the subsequent local
optimization. Ten low lying structure candidates are presented, including both
layered structures and 3d-network structures such as the wurtzite and zinc
blende types, as well as a structure corresponding to the beta-BeO type.
