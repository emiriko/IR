The differential cross section and deuteron analysing powers of the dp ->
{pp}n charge-exchange reaction have been measured with the ANKE spectrometer at
the COSY storage ring. Using a deuteron beam of energy 1170 MeV, data were
obtained for small momentum transfers to a {pp} system with low excitation
energy. A good quantitative understanding of all the measured observables is
provided by the impulse approximation using known neutron-proton amplitudes.
The proof of principle achieved here for the method suggests that measurements
at higher energies will provide useful information in regions where the
existing np database is far less reliable.
