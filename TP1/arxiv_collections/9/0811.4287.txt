small In this paper, we define $q$-analogues of Dirichlet's beta function at
positive integers, which can be written as
$\beta_q(s)=\sum_{k\geq1}\sum_{d|k}\chi(k/d)d^{s-1}q^k$ for $s\in\N^*$, where
$q$ is a complex number such that $|q|<1$ and $\chi$ is the non trivial
Dirichlet character modulo 4. For odd $s$, these expressions are connected with
the automorphic world, in particular with Eisenstein series of level 4.
  From this, we derive through Nesterenko's work the transcendance of the
numbers $\beta_q(2s+1)$ for $q$ algebraic such that $0<|q|<1$. Our main result
concerns the nature of the numbers $\beta_q(2s)$: we give a lower bound for the
dimension of the vector space over $\Q$ spanned by
$1,\beta_q(2),\beta_q(4),...,\beta_q(A)$, where $1/q\in\Z\setminus\{-1;1\}$ and
$A$ is an even integer. As consequences, for $1/q\in\Z\setminus\{-1;1\}$, on
the one hand there is an infinity of irrational numbers among
$\beta_q(2),\beta_q(4),...$, and on the other hand at least one of the numbers
$\beta_q(2),\beta_q(4),..., \beta_q(20)$ is irrational.
