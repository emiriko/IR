We characterize those derivations from the convolution algebra
$\ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+)$ to its dual which are weakly compact. In particular, we
provide examples which are weakly compact but not compact. The characterization
is combinatorial, in terms of "translation-finite" subsets of ${\mathbb Z}_+$,
and we investigate how this notion relates to other notions of "smallness" for
infinite subsets of ${\mathbb Z}_+$. In particular, we show that a set of
strictly positive Banach density cannot be translation-finite; the proof has a
Ramsey-theoretic flavour.
