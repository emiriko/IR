We have epitaxially grown c-axis oriented SrxLa1-xCuO2 thin films by rf
sputtering on KTaO3 substrates with x = 0.12. The as-grown deposits are
insulating and a series of superconducting films with various Tc(R=0) up to 26
K have been obtained by in-situ oxygen reduction. Transport measurements in the
ab plane of these samples have been undertaken. We report original results on
the temperature dependence of the Hall effect and on the anisotropic
magnetoresistance (T > Tc). We discuss the magnitude of upper critical fields
and anisotropy, the Hall effect, which presents changes of sign indicative of
the existence of two types of carriers, the normal state magnetoresistance,
negative in parallel magnetic field, a possible signature of spin scattering.
These properties are compared to those of hole-doped cuprates, such as
BiSr(La)CuO with comparable Tc.
