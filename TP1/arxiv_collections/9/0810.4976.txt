Two criticisms which have prevented the realistic interpretation of entangled
state from being widely accepted are addressed and shown to be unfounded. A
local realistic theory, which reproduces all the quantum probabilistic
predictions, is constructed for Hardy's experiment based on the realistic
interpretation of the entangled two-particle Hardy state.
