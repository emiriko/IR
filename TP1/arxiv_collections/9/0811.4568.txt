Let g be the Lie algebra of a connected reductive group G over an
algebraically closed field k of characteristic p>0. Let $Z$ be the centre of
the universal enveloping algebra U=U(g) of g. Its maximal spectrum is called
the Zassenhaus variety of g. We show that, under certain mild assumptions on G,
the field of fractions Frac(Z) of Z is G-equivariantly isomorphic to the
function field of the dual space g* with twisted G-action. In particular
Frac(Z) is rational. This confirms a conjecture J. Alev. Furthermore we show
that Z is a unique factorisation domain, confirming a conjecture of A. Braun
and C. Hajarnavis. Recently, A. Premet used the above result about Frac(Z), a
result of Colliot-Thelene, Kunyavskii, Popov and Reichstein and reduction mod p
arguments to show that the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture cannot hold for simple
complex Lie algebras that are not of type A, C or G_2.
