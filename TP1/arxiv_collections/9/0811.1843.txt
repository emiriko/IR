The effect of moderate cooling on CdZnTe semiconductor detectors has been
studied for the COBRA experiment. Improvements in energy resolution and low
energy threshold were observed and quantified as a function of temperature.
Leakage currents are found to contribute typically $\sim$5 keV to the widths of
photopeaks.
