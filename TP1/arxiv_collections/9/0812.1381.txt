We demonstrate that magnetic multilayer nanopillars can be efficiently
protected from oxidation by coating with silicon. Both the protected and the
oxidized nanopillars exhibit an increase of reversal current at cryogenic
temperatures. However the magnetic excitation onset current increases only in
the oxidized samples. We show that oxidized nanopillars exhibit anomalous
switching statistics at low temperature, providing a simple test for the
quality of magnetic nanodevices.
