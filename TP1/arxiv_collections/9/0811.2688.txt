We consider a class of nonlinear partial-differential equations, including
the spatially homogeneous Fokker-Planck-Landau equation for Maxwell (or
pseudo-Maxwell) molecules. Continuing the work of
Fontbona-Gu\'erin-M\'el\'eard, we propose a probabilistic interpretation of
such a P.D.E. in terms of a nonlinear stochastic differential equation driven
by a standard Brownian motion. We derive a numerical scheme, based on a system
of $n$ particles driven by $n$ Brownian motions, and study its rate of
convergence. We finally deal with the possible extension of our numerical
scheme to the case of the Landau equation for soft potentials, and give some
numerical results.
