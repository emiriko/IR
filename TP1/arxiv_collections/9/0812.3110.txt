In this talk, I will give an overview of the theoretical status of staggered
Lattice QCD with the "fourth-root trick." In this regularization of QCD, a
separate staggered quark field is used for each physical flavor, and the
inherent four-fold multiplicity that comes with the use of staggered fermions
is removed by taking the fourth root of the staggered determinant for each
flavor. At nonzero lattice spacing, the resulting theory is nonlocal and not
unitary, but there are now strong arguments that this disease is cured in the
continuum limit. In addition, the approach to the continuum limit can be
understood in detail in the framework of effective field theories such as
staggered chiral perturbation theory.
