The Bechgaard salts and the high T$_c$ cuprates are described by two and
three band models, respectively, with the lowest band (nearly) half filled. In
organics the interactions are small, while in cuprates the repulsion $U_d$ on
the Cu site is the largest energy. The Mott AF state is stable in undoped
materials in both cases. In the metallic phase of cuprates the $U_d\to\infty$
limit produces a moderate effective repulsion. The theories of the coherent SDW
and charge-transfer correlations in the metallic phases of organics and
cuprates are thus similar. In (undoped) organics those correlations are
associated with commensurate $2k_F$ SDW and $4k_F$ bond or site modes. The
corresponding modes in metallic cuprates are the incommensurate SDW and in
particular O$_x$/O$_y$ quadrupolar charge transfer with wave vector
$2q_{SDW}=q_0+G$. They are enhanced for dopings $x>0$, which bring the Fermi
level close to the van Hove singularity. Strong coupling to the lattice
associates the static incommensurate O$_x$/O$_y$ charge transfer with collinear
"nematic" stripes. In contrast to organics, the coherent correlations in
cuprates compete with local $d_{10}\leftrightarrow d_9$ quantum charge-transfer
disorder.
