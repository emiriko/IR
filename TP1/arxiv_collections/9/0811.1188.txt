We study dynamic ground state properties in the crossover from weak (BCS) to
strong coupling (BEC) superfluidity. Our approach is based on the attractive
Hubbard model which is analyzed by the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)
combined with the numerical renormalization group (NRG). We present an
extension of the NRG method for effective impurity models to selfconsistent
calculations with superconducting symmetry breaking. In the one particle
spectra we show quantitatively how the Bogoliubov quasiparticles at weak
coupling become suppressed at intermediate coupling. We also present results
for the spin and charge gap. The extension of the NRG method to selfconsistent
superconducting solutions opens the possibility to study a range of other
important applications.
