We examined doping effect of 3d transition metal elements (TM: Cr, Mn, Co,
Ni, and Cu) at the Fe site of a quaternary fluoroarsenide CaFeAsF, an analogue
of 1111-type parent compound LaFeAsO. The anomaly at ~120 K observed in
resistivity (rho) vs. temperature (T) plot for the parent compound is
suppressed by the doping of each TM element. Furthermore, Co- and Ni-doping
(CaFe1-xTMxAsF, TM = Co, Ni) induces superconductivity with a transition
temperature maximized at the nominal x = 0.10 for Co (22 K) and at x = 0.05 for
Ni (12 K). These optimal doping levels may be understood by considering that
Ni2+(3d8) adds double electrons to the FeAs layers compared with Co2+ (3d7).
Increased x for Co or Ni breaks the superconductivity while metallic nature
drho/dT > 0 is still kept. These observations indicate that Co and Ni work as
electron donors. In contrast, neither of Cr, Mn nor Cu-doping induce
superconductivity, yielding drho/dT < 0 in the below the rho-T anomaly
temperature, indicating that these transition metal ions act as scattering
centers. The two different behavior of TM replacing the Fe site is discussed in
relation to the changes in the lattice constants with the doping.
