We study the distribution of the time-integrated current in an
exactly-solvable toy model of heat conduction, both analytically and
numerically. The simplicity of the model allows us to derive the full current
large deviation function and the system statistics during a large deviation
event. In this way we unveil a relation between system statistics at the end of
a large deviation event and for intermediate times. Midtime statistics is
independent of the sign of the current, a reflection of the time-reversal
symmetry of microscopic dynamics, while endtime statistics do depend on the
current sign, and also on its microscopic definition. We compare our exact
results with simulations based on the direct evaluation of large deviation
functions, analyzing the finite-size corrections of this simulation method and
deriving detailed bounds for its applicability. We also show how the
Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem can be used to determine the range of
validity of simulation results.
