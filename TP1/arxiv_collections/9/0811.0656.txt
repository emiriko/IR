We calculate the two-time current correlation function using the experimental
data of the current-time characteristics of the Gas-DNA-decorated carbon
nanotube field effect transistor. The pattern of the correlation function is a
measure of the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors and suggest that
these gas flow sensors may also be used as DNA sequence detectors. The system
is modelled by a one-dimensional tight-binding Hamiltonian and we present
analytical calculations of quantum electronic transport for the system using
the time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function formalism and the adiabatic
expansion. The zeroth and first order contributions to the current
$I^{(0)}(\bar{t})$ and $I^{(1)}(\bar{t})$ are calculated, where $I^{(0)}
(\bar{t})$ is the Landauer formula. The formula for the time-dependent current
is then used to compare the theoretical results with the experiment.
