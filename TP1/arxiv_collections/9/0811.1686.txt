Large contingency tables arise in many contexts but especially in the
collection of survey and census data by government statistical agencies.
Because the vast majority of the variables in this context have a large number
of categories, agencies and users need a systematic way of constructing tables
which are summaries of such contingency tables. We propose such an approach in
this paper by finding members of a class of restricted log-linear models which
maximize the likelihood of the data and use this to find a parsimonious means
of representing the table. In contrast with more standard approaches for model
search in hierarchical log-linear models (HLLM), our procedure systematically
reduces the number of categories of the variables. Through a series of
examples, we illustrate the extent to which it can preserve the interaction
structure found with HLLMs and be used as a data simplification procedure prior
to HLL modeling. A feature of the procedure is that it can easily be applied to
many tables with millions of cells, providing a new way of summarizing large
data sets in many disciplines. The focus is on information and description
rather than statistical testing. The procedure may treat each variable in the
table in different ways, preserving full detail, treating it as fully nominal,
or preserving ordinality.
