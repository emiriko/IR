Perturbative gravity about global de Sitter space is subject to
linearization-stability constraints. Such constraints imply that quantum states
of matter fields couple consistently to gravity {\it only} if the matter state
has vanishing de Sitter charges; i.e., only if the state is invariant under the
symmetries of de Sitter space. As noted by Higuchi, the usual Fock spaces for
matter fields contain no de Sitter-invariant states except the vacuum, though a
new Hilbert space of de Sitter invariant states can be constructed via
so-called group-averaging techniques. We study this construction for free
scalar fields of arbitrary positive mass in any dimension, and for linear
vector and tensor gauge fields in any dimension. Our main result is to show in
each case that group averaging converges for states containing a sufficient
number of particles. We consider general $N$-particle states with smooth
wavefunctions, though we obtain somewhat stronger results when the
wavefunctions are finite linear combinations of de Sitter harmonics. Along the
way we obtain explicit expressions for general boost matrix elements in a
familiar basis.
