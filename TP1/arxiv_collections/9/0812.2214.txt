In this paper we have calculated the spectral dimension of loop quantum
gravity (LQG) using simple arguments coming from the area spectrum at different
length scales. We have obtained that the spectral dimension of the spatial
section runs from 2 to 3, across a 1.5 phase, when the energy of a probe scalar
field decrees from high to low energy. We have calculated the spectral
dimension of the space-time also using results from spin-foam models, obtaining
a 2-dimensional effective manifold at hight energy. Our result is consistent
with other two approach to non perturbative quantum gravity: causal dynamical
triangulation and asymptotic safety quantum gravity.
