We have demonstrated that the middle-infrared (mid-IR) peaks in the optical
conductivity spectra of Ce$X_3$ ($X$ = Pd, Sn, In) can be explained by
first-principle band structure calculation with the spin-orbit interaction. The
mid-IR peak shapes in these materials are not identical to one another:
CePd$_3$, CeSn$_3$, and CeIn$_3$ have a triple-peak structure, double-peak
structure and broad single-peak structure, respectively. These peaks can be
theoretically explained by the optical transition from the occupied state to
the spin-orbit splitted Ce $4f$ state. This result indicates that the mid-IR
peaks originate from the simple band picture with the Ce $4f$ state near the
Fermi level, not from the conventional cf hybridization gap based on the
periodic Anderson model.
