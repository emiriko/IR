There is growing evidence in favour of the temporal-coding hypothesis that
temporal correlation of neuronal discharges may serve to bind distributed
neuronal activity into unique representations and, in particular, that $\theta$
(3.5-7.5 Hz) and $\delta$ ($0.5<$3.5 Hz) oscillations facilitate information
coding. The $\theta$ and $\delta$ rhythms are shown to be involved in various
sleep stages, and during an{\ae}sthesia, and they undergo changes with the
depth of an{\ae}sthesia. We introduce a thalamocortical model of interacting
neuronal ensembles to describe phase relationships between $\theta$ and
$\delta$ oscillations, especially during deep and light an{\ae}sthesia.
Asymmetric and long range interactions among the thalamocortical neuronal
oscillators are taken into account. The model results are compared with the
experimental observations of Musizza et al. {\it J. Physiol. (London)} 2007
580:315-326. The $\delta$ and $\theta$ activities are found to be separately
generated and are governed by the thalamus and cortex respectively. Changes in
the degree of intra--ensemble and inter--ensemble synchrony imply that the
neuronal ensembles inhibit information coding during deep an{\ae}sthesia and
facilitate it during light an{\ae}sthesia.
