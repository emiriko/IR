The canonical thermodynamic model has been used frequently to describe the
disassembly of hot nuclear matter consisting of neutrons and protons. Such
matter is formed in intermediate energy heavy ion collisions. Here we extend
the method to include, in addition to neutrons and protons, lambda particles.
This allows us to include productions of hypernuclei in intermediate energy
heavy ion collisions. We can easily predict average mass number of hypernuclei
produced and values of relative cross-sections of different hypernuclei.
Computation of absolute cross-section was not attempted at this stage and will
require much more detailed work.
