We examine in detail the neutrino masses and mixing patterns in an extension
of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with three gauge-singlet neutrinos
and R-parity violation. The Majorana masses for the gauge-singlet neutrinos as
well as the usual $\mu$-term for the Higgs superfields are generated at the
electroweak scale through the vacuum expectation values of the singlet
sneutrinos. The resulting effective mass matrix for the three light neutrinos
have contributions from the seesaw mechanism involving the singlet neutrinos as
well as due to the mixing with the heavy neutralinos. This model is popularly
known in the literature as the "$\mu$ from $\nu$ supersymmetric standard model"
($\mu\nu$SSM). We show that even with flavour diagonal neutrino Yukawa
couplings, the global data on three-flavour neutrinos can be well accounted for
in this scenario, at the tree level. We also analyze the mixing in the chargino
and the Higgs sector and calculate the decays of the lightest supersymmetric
particle in this model. The decay branching ratios show certain correlations
with the neutrino mixing angles, which can be tested at the LHC. Some other
phenomenological implications of such a model have been discussed.
