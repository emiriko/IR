We investigate the chiral dynamics of gauge theories developing an infrared
stable fixed point. We determine the dependence of the bilinear fermion
condensate on the underlying fermion mass and its anomalous dimension. We
introduce the instanton contributions and investigate how they affect the
dynamics near the fixed point. We generalize the Gell-Mann Oakes Renner
relation and suggest to use it to uncover the presence of an infrared fixed
point of the underlying gauge theory. Our results have an immediate impact on
the construction of sensible extensions of the Standard Model of particle
interactions and the general understanding of the phase diagram of strongly
coupled theories.
