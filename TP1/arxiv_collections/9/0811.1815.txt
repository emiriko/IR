Design details of a 127 degree electrostatic cylindrical spectrometer
equipped with a position-sensitive micro-channel plate detector for measuring
the sputtered ions in collisions of highly charged ions with solid surface is
described. The nonlinear relationship between the point of fall versus the
ionic energy, the blurring of the point of fall caused by the divergence of
incident angle and the finite entrance aperture, the transform from a position
spectrum to an energy spectrum, as well as the influence of the fringing fields
are discussed.
