We investigate the mass differences of charm and bottom heavy baryons, using
MILC lattice gauge configurations with 2+1 dynamical sea quark flavors. We
extend our previous work to three lattice spacings: fine (a~0.09), coarse
(a~0.12), and medium-coarse (a~0.15) ensembles. For extrapolations and
interpolations, we apply simultaneous quadratic fits and simple linear fits
with the full QCD data points for the valence quark masses as well as the sea
quark masses.
