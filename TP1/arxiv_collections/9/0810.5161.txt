After providing a concise overview on quasicrystals and their discovery more
than a quarter of a century ago, I consider the unexpected interplay between
nanotechnology and quasiperiodic crystals. Of particular relevance are efforts
to fabricate artificial functional micro- or nanostructures, as well as efforts
to control the self-assembly of nanostructures, where current knowledge about
the possibility of having long-range order without periodicity can provide
significant advantages. I discuss examples of systems ranging from artificial
metamaterials for photonic applications, through self-assembled soft matter, to
surface waves and optically-induced nonlinear photonic quasicrystals.
