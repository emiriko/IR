N=1 SQCD with SU(N_c) colors and N_F flavors of light quarks is considered
within the dynamical scenario which assumes that quarks can be in two different
phases only. These are: a) either the HQ (heavy quark) phase where they are
confined, b) or they are higgsed, at the appropriate values of parameters of
the Lagrangian.
  The mass spectra of this (direct) theory and its Seiberg's dual are obtained
and compared, for quarks of equal or unequal masses. It is shown that in all
cases when there is the additional small parameter at hand (it is
0<(3N_c-N_F)/N_F << 1 for the direct theory, or its analog 0<(2N_F-3N_c)/N_F <<
1 for the dual one), the mass spectra of the direct and dual theories are
parametrically different. A number of other regimes are also considered.
