Butanol, an alcohol which can be produced from biomass sources, has received
recent interest as an alternative to gasoline for use in spark ignition engines
and as a possible blending compound with fossil diesel or biodiesel. Therefore,
the autoignition of the four isomers of butanol (1-butanol, 2-butanol,
iso-butanol, and tert-butanol) has been experimentally studied at high
temperatures in a shock tube and a kinetic mechanism for description of their
high-temperature oxidation has been developed. Ignition delay times for
butanol/oxygen/argon mixtures have been measured behind reflected shock waves
at temperatures and pressures ranging from approximately 1200 to 1800 K and 1
to 4 bar. Electronically excited OH emission and pressure measurements were
used to determine ignition delay times. A detailed kinetic mechanism has been
developed to describe the oxidation of the butanol isomers and validated by
comparison to the shock tube measurements. Reaction flux and sensitivity
analysis indicate that the consumption of 1 butanol and iso-butanol, the most
reactive isomers, takes place primarily by H-atom abstraction resulting in the
formation of radicals, the decomposition of which yields highly reactive
branching agents, H-atoms and OH radicals. Conversely, the consumption of tert
butanol and 2-butanol, the least reactive isomers, takes place primarily via
dehydration, resulting in the formation of alkenes, which lead to resonance
stabilized radicals with very low reactivity. To our knowledge, the ignition
delay measurements and oxidation mechanism presented here for 2-butanol,
iso-butanol, and tert butanol are the first of their kind..
