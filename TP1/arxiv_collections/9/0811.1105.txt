We discuss nonlocal symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws that follow
from the systematic potentialisation of evolution equations. Those are the Lie
point symmetries of the auxiliary systems, also known as potential symmetries.
We define higher-degree potential symmetries which then lead to nonlocal
conservation laws and nonlocal transformations for the equations. We
demonstrate our approach by the Burgers' hierarchy and the
Calogero-Degasperis-Ibragimov-Shabat hierarchy.
