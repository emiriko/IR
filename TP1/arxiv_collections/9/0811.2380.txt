The total cross-sections measured at LEP for e+e- annihilation into tau+tau-,
c\bar{c} and b\bar{b} at 2E ~ 200 GeV are used to derive the upper limits
3*10^{-17}, 5*10^{-17}, 2*10^{-17} e*cm for the electric dipole moments and
4*10^{-17}, 7*10^{-17}, 2.5*10^{-17} e*cm for the weak dipole moments of the
tau-lepton, c-, and b-quarks, respectively. Some of the existing limits on
these moments are improved and for the b-quark the improvement is rather
significant.
