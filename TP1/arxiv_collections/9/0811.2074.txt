The layout of a new instrument designed to study the interaction of highly
charged ions with surfaces, which consists of an ion source, a beamline
including charge separation and a target chamber, is presented here. By varying
the charge state and impact velocity of the projectiles separately, the
dissipation of potential and kinetic energy at or below the surface can be
studied independently. The target chamber offers the use of tunable
metal-insulator-metal devices as detectors for internal electronic excitation,
a timeof-flight system to study the impact induced particle emission and the
possibility to transfer samples in situ to a UHV scanning probe microscope.
Samples and detectors can be prepared in situ as well. As a first example data
on graphene layers on SrTiO3 which have been irradiated with Xe36+ are
presented.
