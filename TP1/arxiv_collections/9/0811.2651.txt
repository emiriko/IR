We present a new model, based on colour rearrangements, which at the same
time can describe both hidden and open charm production in B-meson decays. The
model is successfully compared to both inclusive decays, such as B to J/psi X
and B to D_s X, as well as exclusive ones, such as B to J/psi K^(*) and B to
D^(*) D^(*)K. It also gives a good description of the momentum distribution of
direct J/psi's, especially in the low-momentum region, which earlier has been
claimed as a possible signal for new exotic states.
