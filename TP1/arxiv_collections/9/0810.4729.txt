The topic of quantum noise has become extremely timely due to the rise of
quantum information physics and the resulting interchange of ideas between the
condensed matter and AMO/quantum optics communities. This review gives a
pedagogical introduction to the physics of quantum noise and its connections to
quantum measurement and quantum amplification. After introducing quantum noise
spectra and methods for their detection, we describe the basics of weak
continuous measurements. Particular attention is given to treating the standard
quantum limit on linear amplifiers and position detectors using a general
linear-response framework. We show how this approach relates to the standard
Haus-Caves quantum limit for a bosonic amplifier known in quantum optics, and
illustrate its application for the case of electrical circuits, including
mesoscopic detectors and resonant cavity detectors.
