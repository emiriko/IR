We prove that any nonconstant entire holomorphic curve from the complex line
C into a projective algebraic hypersurface X = X^n in P^{n+1}(C) of arbitrary
dimension n (at least 2) must be algebraically degenerate provided X is generic
if its degree d = deg(X) satisfies the effective lower bound: d larger than or
equal to n^{{(n+1)}^{n+5}}.
