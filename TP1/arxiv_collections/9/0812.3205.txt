This is a comment on a recent paper by Yoshimura and Arai [Phys. Rev. Lett.
101, 154101 (2008)] on phase reduction of noisy limit-cycle oscillators, in
which the authors claimed that the conventional phase stochastic differential
equation used in previous studies does not give a proper approximation and
proposed a modified phase equation. Here we point out that both phase equations
are valid depending on the situation. We argue that the relative size of
amplitude relaxation time and noise correlation time determines which of the
two equations is appropriate in the white-noise limit. The conventional phase
equation is also a proper approximation to noisy limit cycles with sufficiently
fast amplitude relaxation, which can be used as a starting point for further
analysis.
