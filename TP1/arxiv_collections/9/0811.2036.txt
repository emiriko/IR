An interacting bosonic model of Kitaev type is proposed on the
three-dimensional diamond lattice. Similarly to the two-dimensional Kitaev
model on the honeycomb lattice which exhibits both Abelian and non-Abelian
phases, the model has two (``weak'' and ``strong'' pairing) phases. In the weak
pairing phase, the auxiliary Majorana hopping problem is in a topological
superconducting phase characterized by a non-zero winding number introduced in
A. P. Schnyder, S. Ryu, A. Furusaki, and A. W. W. Ludwig, arXiv:0803.2786. The
topological character of the weak pairing phase is protected by a discrete
symmetry.
