We propose a novel scheme to generate entanglement among quantum-dot-based
charge qubits via sequential electron transfer in an auxiliary quantum dot
structure whose transport properties are conditioned by qubit states. The
transfer protocol requires the utilization of resonant optical pulses combined
with an appropriate voltage gate pattern. As an example illustrating the
application of this scheme, we examine the nine-qubit Shor code state
preparation together with the error syndrome measurement.
