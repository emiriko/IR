A simple modification of the definition of the S-matrix is proposed. It is
expected that the divergences related to nonzero self-energies are considerably
milder with the modified definition than with the usual one. This conjecture is
verified in a few examples using perturbation theory. The proposed formula is
written in terms of the total Hamiltonian operator and a free Hamiltonian
operator and is therefore applicable in any case when these Hamiltonian
operators are known.
