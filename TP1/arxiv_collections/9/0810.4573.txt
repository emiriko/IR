We analyze the dark matter problem in the context of supersymmetric
U(1)_{B-L} model. In this model, the lightest neutalino can be the B-L gaugino
widetilde {Z}_{B-L} or the extra Higgsinos widetilde{chi}_{1,2} dominated. We
compute the thermal relic abundance of these particles and show that, unlike
the LSP in MSSM, they can account for the observed relic abundance with no
conflict with other phenomenological constraints. The prospects for their
direct detection, if they are part of our galactic halo, are also discussed.
