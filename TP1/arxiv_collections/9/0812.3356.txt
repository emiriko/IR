A new heuristic method for the evaluation of definite integrals is presented.
This method of brackets has its origin in methods developed for theevaluation
of Feynman diagrams. We describe the operational rules and illustrate the
method with several examples. The method of brackets reduces the evaluation of
a large class of definite integrals to the solution of a linear system of
equations.
