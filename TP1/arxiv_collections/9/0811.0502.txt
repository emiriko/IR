The tensor terms of the Skyrme effective interaction are included in the
self-consistent Hartree-Fock plus Random Phase Approximation (HF+RPA) model.
The Gamow-Teller (GT) strength function of 90Zr and 208Pb are calculated with
and without the tensor terms. The main peaks are moved downwards by about 2 MeV
when including the tensor contribution. About 10% of the non-energy weighted
sum rule is shifted to the excitation energy region above 30 MeV by the RPA
tensor correlations. The contribution of the tensor terms to the energy
weighted sum rule is given analytically, and compared to the outcome of RPA.
