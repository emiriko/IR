A condition for the synchronizability of a pair of PDE systems, coupled
through a finite set of variables, is commonly the existence of internal
synchronization or internal coherence in each system separately. The condition
was previously illustrated in a forced-dissipative system, and is here extended
to Hamiltonian systems, using an example from particle physics. Full
synchronization is precluded by Liouville's theorem. A form of synchronization
weaker than "measure synchronization" is manifest as the positional coincidence
of coherent oscillations ("breathers" or "oscillons") in a pair of coupled
scalar field models in an expanding universe with a nonlinear potential, and
does not occur with a variant of the model that does not exhibit oscillons.
