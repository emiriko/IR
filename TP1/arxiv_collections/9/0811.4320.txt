Both even- and odd-numbered neutral carbon clusters Cn (n = 2-10) are
systematically studied using the energy minimization method and the modified
Brenner potential for the carbon-carbon interactions. Many stable
configurations were found and several new isomers are predicted. For the lowest
energy stable configurations we obtained their binding energies and bond
lengths. We found that for n < 6 the linear isomer is the most stable one while
for n > 5 the monocyclic isomer becomes the most stable. The latter was found
to be regular for all studied clusters. The dependence of the binding energy
for linear and cyclic clusters versus the cluster size n (n = 2-10) is found to
be in good agreement with several previous calculations, in particular with ab
initio calculations as well as with experimental data for n = 2-5.
