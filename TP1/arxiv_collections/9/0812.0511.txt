We consider supersymmetric models where gauge mediation provides the dominant
contributions to the soft supersymmetry breaking terms while gravity mediation
provides sub-dominant yet non-negligible contributions. We further assume that
the gravity-mediated contributions are subject to selection rules that follow
from a Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry. This class of models constitutes an example
of viable and natural non-minimally flavor violating models. The constraints
from mixing in the neutral K system imply that the modifications to the
Standard Model predictions for mixing in the neutral B_d and B_s systems are
generically at most at the percent level, but can be of order ten percent for
large $\tan \beta$. The modifications for the neutral D system mixing are
generically at most of order a few percent, but in a special subclass of models
they can be of order one. We point out $\Delta B=1$ processes relevant for
flavor violation in hybrid mediation.
