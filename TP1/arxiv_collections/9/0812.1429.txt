We study the regularity at the positions of the (fixed) nuclei of solutions
to (non-relativistic) multiconfiguration equations (including Hartree--Fock) of
Coulomb systems. We prove the following: Let {phi_1,...,phi_M} be any solution
to the rank--M multiconfiguration equations for a molecule with L fixed nuclei
at R_1,...,R_L in R^3. Then, for any j in {1,...,M} and k in {1,...,L}, there
exists a neighbourhood U_{j,k} in R^3 of R_k, and functions phi^{(1)}_{j,k},
phi^{(2)}_{j,k}, real analytic in U_{j,k}, such that phi_j(x) =
phi^{(1)}_{j,k}(x) + |x - R_k| phi^{(2)}_{j,k}(x), x in U_{j,k} A similar
result holds for the corresponding electron density. The proof uses the
Kustaanheimo--Stiefel transformation, as applied earlier by the authors to the
study of the eigenfunctions of the Schr"odinger operator of atoms and molecules
near two-particle coalescence points.
