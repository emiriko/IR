In this article we will show how to compute $U_p$ acting on spaces of
overconvergent $p$-adic modular forms when $X_0(p)$ has genus 1. We first give
a construction of Banach bases for spaces of overconvergent $p$-adic modular
forms, and then give an algorithm to approximate both the characteristic power
series of the $U_p$ operator and eigenvectors of finite slope for $U_p$, and
present some explicit examples. We will also relate this to the conjectures of
Clay on the slopes of overconvergent modular forms.
