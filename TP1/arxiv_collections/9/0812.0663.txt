We have performed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
on the optimally-doped Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ compound and determined
the accurate momentum dependence of the superconducting (SC) gap in four
Fermi-surface sheets including a newly discovered outer electron pocket at the
M point. The SC gap on this pocket is nearly isotropic and its magnitude is
comparable ($\Delta$ $\sim$ 11 meV) to that of the inner electron and hole
pockets ($\sim$12 meV), although it is substantially larger than that of the
outer hole pocket ($\sim$6 meV). The Fermi-surface dependence of the SC gap
value is basically consistent with $\Delta$($k$) = $\Delta$$_0$cos$k_x$cos$k_y$
formula expected for the extended s-wave symmetry. The observed finite
deviation from the simple formula suggests the importance of multi-orbital
effects.
