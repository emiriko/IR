We provide an overview on superstatistical techniques applied to complex
systems with time scale separation. Three examples of recent applications are
dealt with in somewhat more detail: the statistics of small-scale velocity
differences in Lagrangian turbulence experiments, train delay statistics on the
British rail network, and survival statistics of cancer patients once diagnosed
with cancer. These examples correspond to three different universality classes:
Lognormal superstatistics, chi-square superstatistics and inverse chi-square
superstatistics.
