We study the upper tails for the energy of a randomly charged symmetric and
transient random walk. We assume that only charges on the same site interact
pairwise. We consider annealed estimates, that is when we average over both
randomness, in dimension three or more. We obtain a large deviation principle,
and an explicit rate function for a large class of charge distributions.
