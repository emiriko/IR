An MC@NLO for heavy quarks in photoproduction is presented. This is the first
lepton-hadron process to be included into MC@NLO. To construct an MC@NLO
process dependent so called MC-subtraction terms need to be calculated. The
resulting calculation is compared to a fixed order NLO calculation and the
HERWIG event generator and is shown to perform well.
