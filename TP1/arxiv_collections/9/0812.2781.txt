Full Faddeev-type calculations are performed for one-neutron knockout
reaction of $^{14}$Be on proton target at 69 MeV/u incident energy. Inclusive
transverse momentum distributions for the outgoing ($^{12}$Be + n) system and
semi-inclusive cross sections are presented. A significant proton-core single
scattering contribution emerges where the valence neutron has non zero angular
momentum relative to the core. This indicates that distorted-wave impulse
approximation is inadequate and the complete multiple scattering series must be
taken into account for the considered reaction. The magnitude of the
semi-inclusive cross section at quasifree scattering conditions is a clear
signature of the angular momentum of the valence nucleon.
