We present a mathematical formalism describing the propagation of a
completely general electromagnetic wave in a birefringent medium. Analytic
formulas for the refraction and reflection from a plane interface are obtained.
As a particular example, a Bessel beam impinging at an arbitrary angle is
analyzed in detail. Some numerical results showing the formation and
destruction of optical vortices are presented.
