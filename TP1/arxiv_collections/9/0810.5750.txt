Diffraction methods are at the heart of structure determination of solids.
While Bragg-like scattering (pure point diffraction) is a characteristic
feature of crystals and quasicrystals, it is not straightforward to interpret
continuous diffraction intensities, which are generally linked to the presence
of disorder. However, based on simple model systems, we demonstrate that it may
be impossible to draw conclusions on the degree of order in the system from its
diffraction image. In particular, we construct a family of one-dimensional
binary systems which cover the entire entropy range but still share the same
purely diffuse diffraction spectrum.
