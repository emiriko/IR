We measure the lasing dynamics of single and coupled photonic crystal
nanocavity array lasers fabricated in the indium gallium arsenide phosphide
material system. Under short optical excitation, single cavity lasers produce
pulses as fast as 11 ps (FWHM), while coupled cavity lasers show significantly
longer lasing duration which is not explained by a simple rate equations model.
A Finite Difference Time Domain simulation including carrier gain and diffusion
suggests that asynchronous lasing across the nanocavity array extends the
laser's pulse duration.
