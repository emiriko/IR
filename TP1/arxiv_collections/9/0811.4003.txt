We investigate signatures of non-classicality in quantum states, in
particular, those involved in the DQC1 model of mixed-state quantum computation
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5672 (1998)]. To do so, we consider two known
non-classicality criteria. The first quantifies disturbance of a quantum state
under locally noneffective unitary operations (LNU), which are local unitaries
acting invariantly on a subsystem. The second quantifies measurement induced
disturbance (MID) in the eigenbasis of the reduced density matrices. We study
the role of both figures of non-classicality in the exponential speedup of the
DQC1 model and compare them vis-a-vis the interpretation provided in terms of
quantum discord. In particular, we prove that a non-zero quantum discord
implies a non-zero shift under LNUs. We also use the MID measure to study the
locking of classical correlations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 067902 (2004)] using
two mutually unbiased bases (MUB). We find the MID measure to exactly
correspond to the number of locked bits of correlation. For three or more MUBs,
it predicts the possibility of superior locking effects.
