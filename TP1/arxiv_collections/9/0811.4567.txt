We use the truncated Wigner approximation to derive stochastic classical
field equations for the description of polariton condensates. Our equations are
shown to reduce to the Boltzmann equation in the limit of low polariton
density. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to analyze the momentum
distribution and the first and second order coherence when the particle density
is varied across the condensation threshold.
