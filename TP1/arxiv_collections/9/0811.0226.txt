We show an arithmetic generalization of the recent work of Lazarsfeld-Mustata
which uses Okounkov bodies to study linear series of line bundles. As
applications, we derive a log-concavity inequality on volumes of arithmetic
line bundles and an arithmetic Fujita approximation theorem for big line
bundles.
