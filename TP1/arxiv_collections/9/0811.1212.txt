We calculate the temperature dependent conductivity of graphene in the
presence of randomly distributed Coulomb impurity charges arising from the
temperature dependent screening of the Coulomb disorder without any phonons.
The purely electronic temperature dependence of our theory arises from two
independent mechanisms: the explicit temperature dependence of the finite
temperature dielectric function $\epsilon(q,T)$ and the finite temperature
energy averaging of the transport scattering time. We find that the calculated
temperature dependent conductivity is non-monotonic, decreasing with
temperature at low temperatures, and increasing at high temperatures. We
provide a critical comparison with the corresponding physics in
semiconductor-based parabolic band 2D electron gas systems.
