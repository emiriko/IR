We study Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworlds with finite thickness. In
respect to standard (thin) DGP Friedmann equation, finite thickness of the
brane causes a subtle modification of the cosmological equations that can lead
to significant physical consequences. The resulting cosmology is governed by
two length scales which are associated with the brane thickness and with the
crossover length respectively. In this setup both early inflation and late-time
acceleration of the expansion are a consequence of the 5D geometry. At early
times, as well as at late times, 5D effects become dominant (gravity leaks into
the extra dimension), while, at intermediate times, gravity is effectively 4D
due to non-trivial physics occuring in standard (thin) DGP scenarios.
