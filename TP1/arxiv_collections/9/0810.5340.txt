We study the free boundary evolution between two irrotational, incompressible
and inviscid fluids in 2-D without surface tension. We prove local-existence in
Sobolev spaces when, initially, the difference of the gradients of the pressure
in the normal direction has the proper sign, an assumption which is also known
as the Rayleigh-Taylor condition. The well-posedness of the full water wave
problem was first obtained by Wu \cite{Wu}. The methods introduced in this
paper allows us to consider multiple cases: with or without gravity, but also a
closed boundary or a periodic boundary with the fluids placed above and below
it. It is assumed that the initial interface does not touch itself, being a
part of the evolution problem to check that such property prevails for a short
time, as well as it does the Rayleigh-Taylor condition, depending conveniently
upon the initial data. The addition of the pressure equality to the contour
dynamic equations is obtained as a mathematical consequence, and not as a
physical assumption, from the mere fact that we are dealing with weak solutions
of Euler's equation in the whole space.
