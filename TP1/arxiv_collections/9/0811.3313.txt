We have used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations to calculate the energy
barrier for H$_2$ dissociation on the Mg(0001) surface. The calculations employ
pseudopotentials and systematically improvable B-spline basis sets to expand
the single particle orbitals used to construct the trial wavefunctions.
Extensive tests on system size, time step, and other sources of errors,
performed on periodically repeated systems of up to 550 atoms, show that all
these errors together can be reduced to $\sim 0.03$ eV. The DMC dissociation
barrier is calculated to be $1.18 \pm 0.03$ eV, and is compared to those
obtained with density functional theory using various exchange-correlation
functionals, with values ranging between 0.44 and 1.07 eV.
