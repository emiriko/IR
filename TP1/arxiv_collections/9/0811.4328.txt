We give a simple argument for the exclusive existence of mirror and
electromaghetic ion cyclotron modes in anisotropic high-$\beta$ plasmas. It is
shown that, in addition to a large domain of coexistence of both modes, two
domains exist in parameter space $(A,\beta_\perp)$ where solely either mirror
modes or electromagnetic ion cyclotron modes can be excited. In the overlap
region the modes with the larger growth rate should win. However nonlinear
effects may modify such a conclusion.
