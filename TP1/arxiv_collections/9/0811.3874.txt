We implement self-consistent microscopic calculations in order to describe
out-of-equilibrium non-local transport in normal metal-superconductor-normal
metal hybrid structures in the presence of a magnetic field and for arbitrary
interface transparencies. A four terminal setup simulating usual experimental
situations is described by means of a tight-binding model. We present results
for the self-consistent order parameter and current profiles within the sample.
These profiles illustrate a crossover from a quasi-equilibrium to a strong
non-equilibrium situation when increasing the interface transparencies and the
applied voltages. We analyze in detail the behavior of the non-local
conductance in these two different regimes. While in quasi-equilibrium
conditions this can be expressed as the difference between elastic cotunneling
and crossed Andreev transmission coefficients, in a general situation
additional contributions due to the voltage dependence of the self-consistent
order parameter have to be taken into account. The present results provide a
first step towards a self-consistent theory of non-local transport including
non-equilibrium effects and describe qualitatively a recent experiment [Phys.
