We present results of micromagnetic simulations of thin ferromagnetic rings
undergoing magnetization reversal. This geometry is one of few examples in
micromagnetics in which the transition states have been found analytically in a
1D model. According to this model, at low fields and large ring sizes, the
energetically preferred transition state is a localized magnetization
fluctuation (instanton saddle). At high fields and small ring size, the
preferred saddle state is a uniformly rotated magnetization (constant saddle).
In the first part of this paper, we use numerical micromagnetic simulations to
test these predictions of the 1D analytical model for more realistic
situations, including a variety of ring radii, annular widths and magnetic
fields. The predicted activation energies for magnetization reversal are found
to be in close agreement with numerical results, even for rings with a large
annular width where the 1D approximation would be expected to break down. We
find that this approximation breaks down only when the ring's annular width
exceeds its radius. In the second part, we present new metastable states found
in the large radius limit and discuss how they provide a more complete
understanding of the energy landscape of magnetic nanorings.
