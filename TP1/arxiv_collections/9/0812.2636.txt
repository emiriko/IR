The hypervolume indicator is an increasingly popular set measure to compare
the quality of two Pareto sets. The basic ingredient of most hypervolume
indicator based optimization algorithms is the calculation of the hypervolume
contribution of single solutions regarding a Pareto set. We show that exact
calculation of the hypervolume contribution is #P-hard while its approximation
is NP-hard. The same holds for the calculation of the minimal contribution. We
also prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a solution has the least
hypervolume contribution. Even deciding whether the contribution of a solution
is at most $(1+\eps)$ times the minimal contribution is NP-hard. This implies
that it is neither possible to efficiently find the least contributing solution
(unless $P = NP$) nor to approximate it (unless $NP = BPP$).
  Nevertheless, in the second part of the paper we present a fast approximation
algorithm for this problem. We prove that for arbitrarily given $\eps,\delta>0$
it calculates a solution with contribution at most $(1+\eps)$ times the minimal
contribution with probability at least $(1-\delta)$. Though it cannot run in
polynomial time for all instances, it performs extremely fast on various
benchmark datasets. The algorithm solves very large problem instances which are
intractable for exact algorithms (e.g., 10000 solutions in 100 dimensions)
within a few seconds.
