We study the equilibrium shape, shape transitions and optimal size of
strained heteroepitaxial nanoislands with a two-dimensional atomistic model
using simply adjustable interatomic pair potentials. We map out the global
phase diagram as a function of substrate-adsorbate misfit and interaction. This
phase diagram reveals all the phases corresponding to different well-known
growth modes. In particular, for large enough misfits and attractive substrate
there is a Stranski-Krastanow regime, where nano-sized islands grow on top of
wetting films. We analyze the various terms contributing to the total island
energy in detail, and show how the competition between them leads to the
optimal shape and size of the islands. Finally, we also develop an analytic
interpolation formula for the various contributions to the total energy of
strained nanoislands.
