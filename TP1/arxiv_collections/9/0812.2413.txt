We calculate the probability that the rapidity gaps in diffractive processes
survive both eikonal and enhanced rescattering. We present arguments that
enhanced rescattering, which violates soft-hard factorization, is not very
strong. Accounting for NLO effects, there is no reason to expect that the black
disc regime is reached at the LHC. We discuss the predictions for the survival
of the rapidity gaps for exclusive Higgs production at the LHC.
