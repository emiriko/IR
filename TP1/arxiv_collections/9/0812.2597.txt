We normalize the combinatorial Laplacian of a graph by the degree sum, look
at its eigenvalues as a probability distribution and then study its Shannon
entropy. Equivalently, we represent a graph with a quantum mechanical state and
study its von Neumann entropy. At the graph-theoretic level, this quantity may
be interpreted as a measure of regularity; it tends to be larger in relation to
the number of connected components, long paths and nontrivial symmetries. When
the set of vertices is asymptotically large, we prove that regular graphs and
the complete graph have equal entropy, and specifically it turns out to be
maximum. On the other hand, when the number of edges is fixed, graphs with
large cliques appear to minimize the entropy.
