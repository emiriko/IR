This is an extended version of the talk given by the Author at the 40th
Symposium on Mathematical Physics held in Torun, Poland, June 25-28, 2008. We
review the methods of canonical quantization of free particle motion on curved
submanifolds considered as a system with second class constraints. The work is
based on our previous articles, quant-ph/0508044 and quant-ph/0508111. However,
some new results are also presented.
