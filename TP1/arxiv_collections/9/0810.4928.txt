In the framework of the k_T-factorization approach, the production and
polarization of Upsilon mesons at the Fermilab Tevatron is considered, and a
comparision of the calculated double differential distributions and spin
alignment parameter $\alpha$ with the D0 experimental data is shown. We argue
that measuring the double differential cross section and the polarization of
upsilonium states can serve as a crucial test discriminating two competing
theoretical approaches to the parton dynamics in QCD.
