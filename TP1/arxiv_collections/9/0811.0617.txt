The modified O'Raifeartaigh model from the context of the generalized seesaw
mechanism of neutrino mass is investigated. In our evaluation of effective
potentials of the theory, both the component field and the superspace
formalisms to approach the problem are presented. In the component field
formalism, we take into account the Bose-Einstein condensates in the scalar
sector by the method of many-boson theory, i.e. we consider both the
condensates and the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov-type self-energies of quantum
fluctuations. The diagonalization of the mass matrix of the fermion sector
gives the same functional forms of the mass eigenvalues in the generalized
seesaw mechanism. The stability condition in the vicinity of the classical
vacuum which shows the generalized seesaw situation is obtained by the
examination of the mass eigenvalues of the scalar sector of the model. The
superspace formalism will be devoted to a comparison between its result with
that of the component field formalism.
