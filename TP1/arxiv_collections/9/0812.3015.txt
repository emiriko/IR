We experimentally examine the nonclassical character of a class of
non-Gaussian states known as phase-diffused squeezed states. These states may
show no squeezing effect at all, and therefore provide an interesting example
to test nonclassicality criteria. The characteristic function of the
Glauber-Sudarshan representation (P function) proves to be a powerful tool to
detect nonclassicality. Using this criterion we find that phase-diffused
squeezed states are always nonclassical, even if the squeezing effect vanishes.
Testing other criteria of nonclassicality based on higher-order squeezing and
the positive semidefinitness of special matrices of normally ordered moments,
it is found that these criteria fail to reveal the nonclassicality for some of
the prepared phase-diffused squeezed states.
