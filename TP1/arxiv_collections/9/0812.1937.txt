A meaning is given to the state of a system that is consistent with the
trans-coordinate physics previously proposed by the author. The collapse of
such a state is described using the previously proposed q-rules. A Hamiltonian
is defined for these states and it is shown that their square modulus is
conserved. Keywords: invariance, state reduction, wave collapse.
