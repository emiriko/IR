In this paper, we have established a new framework of truncated inverse
sampling for estimating mean values of non-negative random variables such as
binomial, Poisson, hyper-geometrical, and bounded variables. We have derived
explicit formulas and computational methods for designing sampling schemes to
ensure prescribed levels of precision and confidence for point estimators.
Moreover, we have developed interval estimation methods.
