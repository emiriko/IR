This paper reports the pi-A isotherms and spectroscopic characteristics of
mixed Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of non-amphiphilic carbazole
(CA) molecules mixed with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and stearic acid (SA).
pi-A isotherm studies of mixed monolayer and as well as also the collapse
pressure study of isotherms definitely conclude that CA is incorporated into
PMMA and SA matrices. However CA is stacked in the PMMA/SA chains and forms
microcrystalline aggregates as is evidenced from the scanning electron
micrograph picture. Nature of these aggregated species in the mixed LB films
has been revealed by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies.
The presence of two different kinds of band systems in the fluorescence spectra
of the mixed LB films have been observed. This may be due to the formation of
low dimensional aggregates in the mixed LB films. Intensity distribution of
different band system is highly sensitive to the microenvironment of two
different matrices as well as also on the film thickness
