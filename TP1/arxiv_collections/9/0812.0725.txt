We consider, in a superspace, new operator dependent noncommutative (NC)
geometries of the nonlinear quantum Hall limit related to classes of f-deformed
Landau operators in the spherical harmonic well. Different NC coordinate
algebras are determined using unitary representation spaces of Fock-Heisenberg
tensored algebras and of the Schwinger-Fock realisation of the su(1,1) Lie
algebra. A reduced model allowing an underlying N=2 superalgebra is also
discussed.
