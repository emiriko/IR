We show that the equation of motion from the Dirac-Born-Infeld effective
action of a general scalar field with some specific potentials admits exact
solutions after appropriate field redefinitions. Based on the exact solutions
and their energy-momentum tensors, we find that massive scalars and massless
scalars of oscillating modes in the DBI effective theory are not pressureless
generically for any possible momenta, which implies that the pressureless
"tachyon matter" forming at late time of the tachyon condensation process
should not really be some massive matter. It is more likely that the tachyon
field at late time behaves as a massless scalar of zero modes. At kinks, the
tachyon can be viewed as a massless scalar of a translational zero mode
describing a stable and static D-brane with one dimension lower. Near the
vacuum, the tachyon in regions without the caustic singularities can be viewed
as a massless scalar that has the same zero mode solution as a fundamental
string moving with a critical velocity. We find supporting evidences to this
conclusion by considering a DBI theory with modified tachyon potential, in
which the development of caustics near the vacuum may be avoided.
