X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction (XPS, XPD) and scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) have been used for study of NbOx-structures on the
Nb(110) surface. It is shown that niobium atoms are ordered to form a
two-dimensional superstructure with equidistant spacing between the chains of
niobium atoms. Chemical shifts of Nb3d- and O1s-levels demonstrate that the
oxide layer corresponds to niobium monoxide NbO and the most part of oxygen in
chemisorbed state is localized on the surface. A model of quasi-ordered
structure of NbO on the Nb(110) surface is proposed.
