We conduct the first numerical simulations of lattice theories with exact
supersymmetry arising from the orbifold constructions of
\cite{Cohen:2003xe,Cohen:2003qw,Kaplan:2005ta}. We consider the $\cQ=4$ theory
in $D=0,2$ dimensions and the $\cQ=16$ theory in $D=0,2,4$ dimensions. We show
that the U(N) theories do not possess vacua which are stable
non-perturbatively, but that this problem can be circumvented after truncation
to SU(N). We measure the distribution of scalar field eigenvalues, the spectrum
of the fermion operator and the phase of the Pfaffian arising after integration
over the fermions. We monitor supersymmetry breaking effects by measuring a
simple Ward identity. Our results indicate that simulations of ${\cal N}=4$
super Yang-Mills may be achievable in the near future.
