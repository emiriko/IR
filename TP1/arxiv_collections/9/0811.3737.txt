We visualize the fundamental property of pQCD: the smaller size of the
colorless quark-gluon configurations leads to a more rapid increase of its
interaction with energy. Within the frame of dipole model we use the $k_t$
factorization theorem to generalize the DGLAP approximation and/or leading
$\ln(x_0/x)$ approximation and evaluate the interaction of quark dipole with a
target. In the limit of fixed $Q^2$ and $x\to 0$ we found the increase with
energy of transverse momenta of quark(antiquark) within q$\bar q$ pair produced
by strongly virtual photon. The average $p^2_t$ is evaluated analytically
within the double logarithmic approximation. We demonstrate that the invariant
mass$^2$ of the q$\bar q$ pair increases with the energy as
$M^2_0(x_0/x)^{\lambda}$, where $\lambda\sim 0.4\alpha_sN_c/\pi$ for transverse
photons, and as $\sim M^2_0 \exp{0.17[(4\alpha_sN_c/\pi)\log(x_0/x)]^{1/2}}$
for longitudinal photons, where $M^2_0 \approx 0.7Q^2$ at the energies of the
order $s_0\sim 10^4$ GeV$^2$ ($x_0\sim 10^{-2}$). The magnitude of the effect
depends strongly on the small $x$ behavior of the gluon distribution. Similar
pattern of the energy dependence of $M^2$ is found in the LO DGLAP
approximation generalized to account for $k_t$ factorization. We discuss the
impact of the found phenomenon on the dependence of the coherence length on the
initial energy and demonstrate that the shape of final hadron state in DIS has
biconcave form instead of pancake. Some implications of the found phenomena for
the hard processes in pp collisions are discussed.
