Properties of multi-antikaonic nuclei (MKN), where several numbers of $K^-$
mesons are bound, are studied in the relativistic mean-field model, combined
with chiral dynamics for kaonic part of the thermodynamic potential. The
density profiles for nucleons and $K^-$ mesons, the single particle energy of
the $K^-$ mesons, and binding energy of the MKN are obtained. The effects of
the $\bar K-\bar K$ interactions on these quantities are discussed in
comparison with other meson ($\sigma$, $\omega$, and $\rho$)-exchange models.
It is shown that the $\bar K-\bar K$ interactions originate from two
contributions: One is the contact interaction between antikaons inherent in
chiral symmetry, and the other is the one generated through coupling between
the $K^-$ and meson mean fields. Both effects of the $\bar K-\bar K$ repulsive
interactions become large on the ground state properties of the MKN as the
number of the embedded $K^-$ mesons increases. A relation between the
multi-antikaonic nuclei and kaon condensation in infinite and uniform matter is
mentioned.
