We study Andreev reflection in a normal conductor-molecule-superconductor
junction using a first principles approach. In particular, we focus on a family
of molecules consisting of a molecular backbone and a weakly coupled side
group. We show that the presence of the side group can lead to a Fano resonance
in the Andreev reflection. We use a simple theoretical model to explain the
results of the numerical calculations and to make predictions about the
possible sub-gap resonance structures in the Andreev reflection coefficient.
