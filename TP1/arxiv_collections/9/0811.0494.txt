We present experimental results of high frequency quantized charge pumping
through a quantum dot formed by the electric field arising from applied
voltages in a GaAs/AlGaAs system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic
field B. Clear changes are observed in the quantized current plateaus as a
function of applied magnetic field. We report on the robustness in the length
of the quantized plateaus and improvements in the quantization as a result of
the applied B field.
