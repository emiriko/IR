We describe the relation between two characterizations of conjugacy in groups
of piecewise-linear homeomorphisms, discovered by Brin and Squier in [2] and
Kassabov and Matucci in [5]. Thanks to the interplay between the techniques, we
produce a simplified point of view of conjugacy that allows us to easily
recover centralizers and lends itself to generalization.
