The Skyrme model, an effective low energy theory rooted in large $N_c$ QCD,
has been applied to the study of dense matter. Matter is described by various
crystal structures of skyrmions. When this system is heated, the dominating
thermal degrees of freedom are the fluctuating pions. Taking these mechanisms
jointly produces a description of the chiral phase transition leading to the
conventional phase diagram with critical temperatures and densities in
agreement with expected values.
