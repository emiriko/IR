We continue our study of intermittency for the parabolic Anderson model
$\partial u/\partial t = \kappa\Delta u + \xi u$ in a space-time random medium
$\xi$, where $\kappa$ is a positive diffusion constant, $\Delta$ is the lattice
Laplacian on $\Z^d$, $d \geq 1$, and $\xi$ is a simple symmetric exclusion
process on $\Z^d$ in Bernoulli equilibrium. This model describes the evolution
of a \emph{reactant} $u$ under the influence of a \emph{catalyst} $\xi$.
  In G\"artner, den Hollander and Maillard (2007) we investigated the behavior
of the annealed Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential growth rates as
$t\to\infty$ of the successive moments of the solution $u$. This led to an
almost complete picture of intermittency as a function of $d$ and $\kappa$. In
the present paper we finish our study by focussing on the asymptotics of the
Lyaponov exponents as $\kappa\to\infty$ in the \emph{critical} dimension $d=3$,
which was left open in G\"artner, den Hollander and Maillard (2007) and which
is the most challenging. We show that, interestingly, this asymptotics is
characterized not only by a \emph{Green} term, as in $d\geq 4$, but also by a
\emph{polaron} term. The presence of the latter implies intermittency of
\emph{all} orders above a finite threshold for $\kappa$.
