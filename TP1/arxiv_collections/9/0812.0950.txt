We find the dual equivalent (gauge invariant) version of the Maxwell theory
in D=4 with a Proca-like mass term by using the symplectic embedding method.
The dual theory obtained (Maxwell-Podolsky) includes a higher-order derivative
term and preserve the gauge symmetry. We also furnish an investigation of the
pole structure of the vector propagator by the residue matrix which considers
the eventual existence of the negative-norm of the theory.
