A coupled-channel analysis of the $^{18,20,22}$O$(p,p')$ data has been
performed to determine the neutron transition strengths of 2$^+_1$ states in
Oxygen targets, using the microscopic optical potential and inelastic form
factor calculated in the folding model. A complex density- and \emph{isospin}
dependent version of the CDM3Y6 interaction was constructed, based on the
Brueckner-Hatree-Fock calculation of nuclear matter, for the folding model
input. Given an accurate isovector density dependence of the CDM3Y6
interaction, the isoscalar ($\delta_0$) and isovector ($\delta_1$) deformation
lengths of 2$^+_1$ states in $^{18,20,22}$O have been extracted from the
folding model analysis of the $(p,p')$ data. A specific $N$-dependence of
$\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$ has been established which can be linked to the
neutron shell closure occurring at $N$ approaching 16. The strongest isovector
deformation was found for 2$^+_1$ state in $^{20}$O, with $\delta_1$ about 2.5
times larger than $\delta_0$, which indicates a strong core polarization by the
valence neutrons in $^{20}$O. The ratios of the neutron/proton transition
matrix elements ($M_n/M_p$) determined for 2$^+_1$ states in $^{18,20}$O have
been compared to those deduced from the mirror symmetry, using the measured
$B(E2)$ values of 2$^+_1$ states in the proton rich $^{18}$Ne and $^{20}$Mg
nuclei, to discuss the isospin impurity in the $2^+_1$ excitation of the
$A=18,T=1$ and $A=20,T=2$ isobars.
