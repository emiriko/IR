Since the very beginning of hardware development, computer processors were
invented with ever-increasing clock frequencies and sophisticated in-build
optimization strategies. Due to physical limitations, this 'free lunch' of
speedup has come to an end.
  The following article gives a summary and bibliography for recent trends and
challenges in CMP architectures. It discusses how 40 years of parallel
computing research need to be considered in the upcoming multi-core era. We
argue that future research must be driven from two sides - a better expression
of hardware structures, and a domain-specific understanding of software
parallelism.
