The substantial progress that has been achieved in lattice QCD in the last
years is pointed out. I compare the simulation cost and systematic effects of
several lattice QCD formulations and discuss a number of topics such as lattice
spacing scaling, applications of chiral perturbation theory, non-perturbative
renormalization and finite volume effects. Additionally, the importance of
demonstrating universality is emphasized.
