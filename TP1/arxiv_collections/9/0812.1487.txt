A microstructured array of 1254 electrodes on a substrate has been configured
to generate an array of local minima of electric field strength with a
periodicity of 120 $\mu$m about 25 $\mu$m above the substrate. By applying
sinusoidally varying potentials to the electrodes, these minima can be made to
move smoothly along the array. Polar molecules in low-field seeking quantum
states can be trapped in these traveling potential wells. Recently, we
experimentally demonstrated this by transporting metastable CO molecules at
constant velocities above the substrate [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 153003].
Here, we outline and experimentally demonstrate how this microstructured array
can be used to decelerate polar molecules directly from a molecular beam. For
this, the sinusoidally varying potentials need to be switched on when the
molecules arrive above the chip, their frequency needs to be chirped down in
time, and they need to be switched off before the molecules leave the chip
again. Deceleration of metastable CO molecules from an initial velocity of 360
m/s to a final velocity as low as 240 m/s is demonstrated in the 15-35 mK deep
potential wells above the 5 cm long array of electrodes. This corresponds to a
deceleration of almost $10^5$ $g$, and about 85 cm$^{-1}$ of kinetic energy is
removed from the metastable CO molecules in this process.
