We obtain a novel result in QCD for long range rapidity correlations between
gluons produced in the collision of saturated high energy hadrons or nuclei.
This result, obtained in a high energy factorization framework, provides strong
justification for the Glasma flux tube picture of coherent strong color fields.
Our formalism can be applied to "near side ridge" events at RHIC and in future
studies of long range rapidity correlations at the LHC.
