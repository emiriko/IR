Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high
energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial
resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying
short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI)
collaboration is developing Column-Parallel CCDs (CPCCDs) for the vertex
detector of a future Linear Collider. The CPCCDs can be read out many times
faster than standard CCDs, significantly increasing their operating speed. An
Analytic Model has been developed for the determination of the charge transfer
inefficiency (CTI) of a CPCCD. The CTI values determined with the Analytic
Model agree largely with those from a full TCAD simulation. The Analytic Model
allows efficient study of the variation of the CTI on parameters like readout
frequency, operating temperature and occupancy.
