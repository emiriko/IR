We consider a dusty plasma, in which the dust particles have a magnetic
dipole moment. A Hall-MHD type of model, generalized to account for the
intrinsic magnetization, is derived. The model is shown to be energy
conserving, and the energy density and flux is derived. The general dispersion
relation is then derived, and we show that kinetic Alfv\'en waves exhibit an
instability for a low temperature and high density plasma. We discuss the
implication of our results.
