Here, Darboux's classical results about transformations with differential
substitutions for hyperbolic equations are extended to the case of parabolic
equations of the form $L u = \big(D^2_{x} + a(x,y) D_x + b(x,y) D_y +
c(x,y)\big)u=0$.
  We prove a general Theorem that provides a way to determine transformations
for parabolic equations shown above. It turnes out that transforming operators
$M$ of some higher order can be always represented as a composition of some
first-order operators that consecutively define a series of transformations.
  Existence of inverse transformations implies some differential constrains on
the coefficients of the initial operator. We show that these relations can
imply famous integrable equations, in particular, the Boussinesq equation.
