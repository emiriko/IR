Motivated by the problem of solving the Einstein equations, we discuss high
order finite difference discretizations of first order in time, second order in
space hyperbolic systems.Particular attention is paid to the case when first
order derivatives that can be identified with advection terms are approximated
with non-centered finite difference operators.We first derive general
properties of these discrete operators, then we extend a known result on
numerical stability for such systems to general order of accuracy.As an
application we analyze the shifted wave equation, including the behavior of the
numerical phase and group speeds at different orders of approximations. Special
attention is paid to when the use of off-centered schemes improves the accuracy
over the centered schemes.
