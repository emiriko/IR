In this paper, we study the thermodynamical properties of the
(2+1)dimensional black hole with a Coulomb-like electric field and the
differential form of the first law of thermodynamics is derived considering a
virtual displacement of its event horizon. This approach shows that it is
possible to give a thermodynamical interpretation to the field equations near
the horizon. The Lambda=0 solution is studied and its interesting
thermodynamical properties are commented.
