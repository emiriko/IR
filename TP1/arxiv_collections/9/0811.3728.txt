Rare earth based intermetallics, SmScGe and NdScGe, are shown to exhibit near
zero net magnetization with substitutions of 6 to 9 atomic percent of Nd and 25
atomic percent of Gd, respectively. The notion of magnetic compensation in them
is also elucidated by the crossover of zero magnetization axis at low magnetic
fields (less than 103 Oe) and field-induced reversal in the orientation of the
magnetic moments of the dissimilar rare earth ions at higher magnetic fields.
These magnetically ordered materials with no net magnetization and appreciable
conduction electron polarization display an attribute of an exchange bias
field, which can be tuned. The attractively high magnetic ordering temperatures
of about 270 K, underscore the importance of these materials for potential
applications in spintronics.
