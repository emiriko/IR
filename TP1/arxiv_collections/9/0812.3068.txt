We consider the relational characterisation of branching bisimilarity with
explicit divergence. We prove that it is an equivalence and that it coincides
with the original definition of branching bisimilarity with explicit divergence
in terms of coloured traces. We also establish a correspondence with several
variants of an action-based modal logic with until- and divergence modalities.
