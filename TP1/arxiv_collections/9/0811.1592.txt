We present Monte Carlo preliminary results about the feasibility to detect
the Chic family in p-p collisions at 14 TeV in the ALICE Central Barrel at CERN
LHC. The Chic1 and Chic2 were forced to decay in the channel J/Psi + gamma ->
e+ e- + gamma and were merged with a proton-proton non-biased collision. After
MonteCarlo transport and simulation of the detector response, the e+, e- and
converted gamma were reconstructed and identified in the ALICE ITS, TPC and TRD
detectors. Separate signals corresponding to gamma from Chic1 and from Chic2
were observed. The position and relative weight of the fit to gaussians agreed
with the input values within the statistical limits. Similar studies will be
done for Pb-Pb collisions.
