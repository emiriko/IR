We combine the results of magnetic and transport measurements with neutron
diffraction data to construct the structural and magnetic phase diagram of the
entire family of SrMn$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$O$_3$ ($0 \leqslant x \leqslant 1$)
perovskites. We have found antiferromagnetic ordering of the C type for lightly
Ru-substituted materials ($0.06 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.5$) in a similar manner
to $R_{y}$Sr$_{1-y}$MnO$_3$ ($R$=La, Pr), due to the generation of Mn$^{3+}$ in
both families of manganite perovskites by either $B$-site substitution of
Ru$^{5+}$ for Mn$^{4+}$ or $A$-site substitution of $R^{3+}$ for Sr$^{2+}$.
This similarity is driven by the same ratio of $d^4$ / $d^3$ ions in both
classes of materials for equivalent substitution level. In both cases, a
tetragonal lattice distortion is observed, which for some compositions ($0.06
\leqslant x \leqslant 0.2$) is coupled to a C-type AF transition and results in
a first order magnetic and resistive transition. Heavily substituted
SrMn$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$O$_3$ materials are ferromagnetic due to dominating
exchange interactions between the Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Intermediate substitution
($0.6 \leqslant x \leqslant 0.7$) leads to a spin-glass behavior instead of a
quantum critical point reported previously in single crystals, due to enhanced
disorder.
