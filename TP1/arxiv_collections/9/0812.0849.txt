The International Lattice Data Grid (ILDG) continues stable operation for
about one year and has accumulated a lot of valuable configurations. After a
brief review of the ILDG system, we highlight large physics projects, whose
configurations are already available on the grid or will be open to the public
in the near future. With such information, one can make better use of the ILDG.
Statistics about the ILDG is also reported.
