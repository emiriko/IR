The spatio-temporal dynamics of three interacting species, two preys and one
predator, in the presence of two different kinds of noise sources is studied.
To describe the spatial distributions of the species we use a model based on
Lotka-Volterra equations. A correlated dichotomous noise acts on \beta, the
interaction parameter between the two preys, and a multiplicative white noise
affects directly the dynamics of each one of the three species. We study the
time behaviour of the three species in single site for different values of the
multiplicative noise intensity, finding noise-induced oscillations of the three
species densities with an anticorrelated behaviour of the two preys.
Afterwards, by considering a spatially extended system formed by a
two-dimensional lattice with N sites and applying a mean field approach, we get
the corresponding moment equations in Gaussian approximation. Within this
formalism we obtain the time behaviour of the first and second order moments
for different values of multiplicative noise intensity, with \beta(t) subject
to the same dichotomous noise source. Finally, we compare our results with
those obtained by using a coupled map lattice model, consisting of a time
discrete version of the Lotka-Volterra equations.
