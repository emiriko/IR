We report an experiment of creating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on an atom
chip. The chip based Z-wire current and a homogeneous bias magnetic field
create a tight magnetic trap, which allows for a fast production of BEC. After
an 4.17s forced radio frequency evaporative cooling, a condensate with about
3000 atoms appears. And the transition temperature is about 300nK. This compact
system is quite robust, allowing for versatile extensions and further studying
of BEC.
