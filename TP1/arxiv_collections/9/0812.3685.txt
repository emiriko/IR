We study the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems driven across a
critical point by quenching an Hamiltonian parameter at a certain velocity.
General scaling laws are derived for the density of excitations and energy
produced during the quench as a function of quench velocity and bath
temperature. The scaling laws and their regimes of validity are verified for
the XY spin chain locally coupled to bosonic baths. A detailed derivation and
analysis of the kinetic equation of the problem is presented.
