It is widely believed that the critical properties of several planar lattice
models, like the Eight Vertex or the Ashkin-Teller models, are well described
by an effective Quantum Field Theory obtained as formal scaling limit. On the
basis of this assumption several extended scaling relations among their indices
were conjectured. We prove the validity of some of them, among which the ones
by Kadanoff, [K], and by Luther and Peschel, [LP].
