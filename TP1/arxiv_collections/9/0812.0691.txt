Collisional parton energy loss is revisited within a simple model assuming
incoherent elastic scattering of on-shell projectile partons on partonic
constituents of the QGP with HTL screening. The thermal motion of plasma
particles is carefully taken into account. Results on $dE/dx$ are found to be
consistent with other authors. There is a significant discrepancy in the energy
loss pattern for the cases with thermal motion on and off, which illustrates
the importance of taking the kinematics into account exactly. The dependence on
the mass of the partons forming the plasma is included in the calculations and
its influence on the collisional energy loss is studied. The mass hierarchy of
collisional energy loss is found to have a strong dependence on the mass
introduced for plasma particles. Due to difference in the mass hierarchy with
radiative energy loss, the collisional one when included increases the relative
suppression of heavy quarks compared to light quarks.
