It is shown that a mechanism of energy redistribution and dissipation by the
inertial waves can be effectively utilized in isotropic turbulence at small
Reynolds numbers (when the nonlocal interactions are the dominating ones). This
mechanism totally suppresses the local interactions (cascades) in isotropic
turbulence at the Taylor-scale based Reynolds number $R_{\lambda} < 10^2$. This
value of $R_{\lambda}$ (that can be considered as a bifurcation value at which
the local regime emerges from the nonlocal one in isotropic turbulence) is in
agreement with recent direct numerical simulations data. Applicability of this
approach to channel flows is also briefly discussed. A theory of multimode
bifurcations has been developed in order to explain anomalous (in comparison
with the Landau-Hopf bifurcations) properties of the nonlocal-local bifurcation
in isotropic turbulence.
