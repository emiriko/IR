We present an study of the dynamics and decay pattern of phase singularities
due to the action of a system with a discrete rotational symmetry of finite
order. A topological charge conservation rule is identified. The role played by
the underlying symmetry is emphasized. An effective model describing the short
range dynamics of the vortex clusters has been designed. A method to engineer
any desired configuration of clusters of phase singularities is proposed. Its
flexibility to create and control clusters of vortices is discussed.
