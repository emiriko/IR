Preliminary results on azimuthal asymmetries in leptoproduction of real
photons on an unpolarized hydrogen target measured at the HERMES experiment are
presented. The analysis of data taken with different beam charges and
helicities allows for a simultaneous extraction of asymmetries originating from
the interference term and the squared DVCS amplitude. Sizeable asymmetry
amplitudes for the first cosine moment of the beam-charge asymmetry and the
first sine moment of the beam-spin asymmetry have been found. The results are
compared to different theoretical calculations.
