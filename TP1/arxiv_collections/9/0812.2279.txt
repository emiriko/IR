Microscopic surface diffusivity theory based on atomic ionization energy
concept is developed to explain the variations of the atomic and displacement
polarizations with respect to the surface diffusion activation energy of
adatoms in the process of self-assembly of quantum dots on plasma-exposed
surfaces. These polarizations are derived classically, while the atomic
polarization is quantized to obtain the microscopic atomic polarizability. The
surface diffusivity equation is derived as a function of the ionization energy.
The results of this work can be used to fine-tune the delivery rates of
different adatoms onto nanostructure growth surfaces and optimize the
low-temperature plasma based nanoscale synthesis processes.
