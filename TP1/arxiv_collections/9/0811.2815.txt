In this paper we show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are
appropriate for the description in a consistent way world sheet superstring and
superstring field theories. A new Lagrangian for the closed world sheet
superstring is obtained. We also show that the superstring field is a linear
superposition of UET of compact support (CUET), and give the notion of
anti-superstring. We evaluate the propagator for the string field, and
calculate the convolution of two of them.
