We present a model for odd-$C$ (negative charge parity) glueballs with three
constituent gluons. The model is an extension of a previous study of two-gluon
glueballs. We show that, even if spin-1 gluons seem to reproduce properly the
lattice QCD spectrum for $C=+$ states, the extension for $C=-$ cannot match
with the lattice results. Resorting to the helicity formalism, we show how
transverse gluons fit in better agreement the lattice QCD spectrum.
