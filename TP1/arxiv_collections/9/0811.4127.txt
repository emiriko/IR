The adiabatic magnetization of a superconductor is a cooling principle
proposed in the 30s, which has never been exploited up to now. Here we present
a detailed dynamic description of the effect, computing the achievable final
temperatures as well as the process timescales for different superconductors in
various regimes. We show that, although in the experimental conditions explored
so far the method is in fact inefficient, a suitable choice of initial
temperatures and metals can lead to unexpectedly large cooling effect, even in
the presence of dissipative phenomena. Our results suggest that this principle
can be re-envisaged today as a performing refrigeration method to access the
microK regime in nanodevices.
