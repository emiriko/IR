With the help of a physically motivated ansatz, which is fitted to the data,
we estimate the size of possible duality violations in hadronic tau decay. The
result is that the uncertainty associated with these violations could impact
the alpha_s determination from the total decay width at a level which we
estimate to be \delta alpha_s(m_tau) \sim 0.003-0.010. Consequently, it cannot
be neglected.
