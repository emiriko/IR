The quasiclassical correction to the Moliere's formula for multiple
scattering is derived. The consideration is based on the scattering amplitude,
obtained with the first quasiclassical correction taken into account for
arbitrary localized but not spherically symmetric potential. Unlike the leading
term, the correction to the Moliere's formula contains the target density $n$
and thickness $L$ not only in the combination $nL$ (areal density). Therefore,
this correction can be reffered to as the bulk density correction. It turns out
that the bulk density correction is small even for high density. This result
explains the wide region of applicability of the Moliere's formula.
