We consider an inertial model of chemotactic aggregation generalizing the
Keller-Segel model and we study the linear dynamical stability of an infinite
and homogeneous distribution of cells (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial
cells,...) when inertial effects are accounted for. These inertial terms model
cells directional persistance. We determine the condition of instability and
the growth rate of the perturbation as a function of the cell density and the
wavelength of the perturbation. We discuss the differences between overdamped
(Keller-Segel) and inertial models. Finally, we show the analogy between the
instability criterion for biological populations and the Jeans instability
criterion in astrophysics.
