In this paper, we address the equivalence of the analytic and probabilistic
notions of harmonicity in the context of general symmetric Hunt processes on
locally compact separable metric spaces. Extensions to general symmetric right
processes on Lusin spaces including infinite dimensional spaces are mentioned
at the end of this paper.
