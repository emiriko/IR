We prove an inversion identity for the open AdS/CFT SU(1|1) quantum spin
chain which is exact for finite size. We use this identity, together with an
analytic ansatz, to determine the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the
corresponding Bethe ansatz equations. We also solve the closed chain by
algebraic Bethe ansatz.
