Gap solitons near a band edge of a spatially periodic nonlinear PDE can be
formally approximated by solutions of Coupled Mode Equations (CMEs). Here we
study this approximation for the case of the 2D Periodic Nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger / Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with a non-separable potential of
finite contrast. We show that unlike in the case of separable potentials [T.

(2009)] the CME derivation has to be carried out in Bloch rather than physical
coordinates. Using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction we then give a rigorous
justification of the CMEs as an asymptotic model for reversible non-degenerate
gap solitons and even potentials and provide $H^s$ estimates for this
approximation. The results are confirmed by numerical examples including some
new families of CMEs and gap solitons absent for separable potentials.
