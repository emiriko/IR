Several aspects of the 4d imprint of the 5d bulk Weyl radiation are
investigated within a recently proposed model solution. It is shown that the
solution has a number of physically interesting properties. The constraints on
the model imposed by combined measurements of rotation curve and lensing are
discussed. A brief comparison with a well known scalar field model is also
given.
