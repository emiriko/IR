The gravitational corrections to the gauge coupling constants of abelian and
non-abelian gauge theories has been shown to diverge quadratically. Since this
result will have interesting consequences, this has been analyzed by several
authors from different approaches. We propose to discuss this issue from a
phenomenological approach. We analyze the SU(5) gauge coupling unification and
argue that the gravitational corrections to gauge coupling constants may not
vanish when higher dimensional non-renormalizable terms are included in the
problem.
