We study the properties of the congruence of null geodesics propagating near
the so-called truly naked horizons (TNH) - objects having finite Kretschmann
scalar but with diverging tidal acceleration for freely falling observers. The
expansion of outgoing rays near the future horizon always tends to vanish for
the non-extremal case but may be non-zero for the distorted (ultra)extremal
one. It tends to diverge for the ingoing ones if the the null energy condition
(NEC) is satisfied in the vicinity of the horizon outside. However, it also
tends to zero for NEC violating cases except the remote horizons. We also
discuss the validity of test particle approximation for TNHs and find the
sufficient condition for backreaction remaining small.
