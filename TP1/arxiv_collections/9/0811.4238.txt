We consider non minimal coupling between matters and gravity in modified
theories of gravity. In contrary to the current common sense, we report that
quantum mechanics can effectively emerge when the space-time geometry is
sufficiently flat. In other words, quantum mechanics might play no role when
and where the space-time geometry is highly curved.
  We study the first two simple models of Effectively Emergent Quantum
Mechanics(EEQM): R-dependent EEQM and G-dependent EEQM where R is the Ricci
scalar and G is the Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian density. We discuss that these EEQM
theories might be fine tuned to remain consistent with all the implemented
experiments and performed observations. In particular, we observe that
G-dependent EEQM softens the problem of quantum gravity.
