The statistical mechanics of periodically driven ("Floquet") systems in
contact with a heat bath exhibits some radical differences from the traditional
statistical mechanics of undriven systems. In Floquet systems all quasienergies
can be placed in a finite frequency interval, and the number of near
degeneracies in this interval grows without limit as the dimension N of the
Hilbert space increases. This leads to pathologies, including drastic changes
in the Floquet states, as N increases. In earlier work these difficulties were
put aside by fixing N, while taking the coupling to the bath to be smaller than
any quasienergy difference. This led to a simple explicit theory for the
reduced density matrix, but with some major differences from the usual time
independent statistical mechanics. We show that, for weak but finite coupling
between system and heat bath, the accuracy of a calculation within the
truncated Hilbert space spanned by the N lowest energy eigenstates of the
undriven system is limited, as N increases indefinitely, only by the usual
neglect of bath memory effects within the Born and Markov approximations. As we
seek higher accuracy by increasing N, we inevitably encounter quasienergy
differences smaller than the system-bath coupling. We therefore derive the
steady state reduced density matrix without restriction on the size of
quasienergy splittings. In general, it is no longer diagonal in the Floquet
states. We analyze, in particular, the behavior near a weakly avoided crossing,
where quasienergy near degeneracies routinely appear. The explicit form of our
results for the denisty matrix gives a consistent prescription for the
statistical mechanics for many periodically driven systems with N infinite, in
spite of the Floquet state pathologies.
