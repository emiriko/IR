A class of extra dimensional models with a warped metric predict tunneling of
a massive particle localized on our brane and escaping into additional
dimensions. The experimental signature of this effect is the disappearance of
the particle from our world, i.e. the particle $\to invisible$ decay. We point
out that measurements of $Z\prime \to invisible$ decay width of a new heavy
gauge boson $Z\prime$ at the CERN LHC can be effectively used to probe the
existence of large extra dimensions. This result enhances motivations for a
more sensitive search and study for this decay mode and suggests additional
direction for testing extra dimensions in collider experiments.
