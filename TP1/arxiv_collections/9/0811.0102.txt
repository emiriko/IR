We experimentally address the importance of tuning in athermal phase
transitions, which are triggered only by a slowly varying external field acting
as tuning parameter. Using higher order statistics of fluctuations, a singular
critical instability is detected for the first time in spite of an apparent
universal self-similar kinetics over a broad range of driving force. The
results as well as the experimental technique are likely to be of significance
to many slowly driven non-equilibrium systems from geophysics to material
science which display avalanche dynamics.
