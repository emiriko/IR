A new class of truncation schemes of delta expansion on the lattice is
studied. We show that the order of expansion in delta which is introduced as
the dilation parameter can be taken large enough and the result gives rise to
the Borel transformation with respect to the relevant variable in the lattice
models. The explicit simulation of the continuum scaling from the expansion
effective at large spacings is investigated in anharmonic oscillators, d=2
non-linear sigma model at large N and Gross-Neveu model with Wilson fermions.
