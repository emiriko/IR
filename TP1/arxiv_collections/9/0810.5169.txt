We introduce an infinite set of integer mappings that generalize the
well-known Collatz-Ulam mapping and we conjecture that an infinite subset of
these mappings feature the remarkable property of the Collatz conjecture,
namely that they converge to unity irrespective of which positive integer is
chosen initially.
