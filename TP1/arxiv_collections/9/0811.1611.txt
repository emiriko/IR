A novel quantum dynamical model based on the dissipative quantum dynamics of
open quantum systems is presented. It allows the treatment of both
deep-inelastic processes and quantum tunneling (fusion) within a fully quantum
mechanical coupled-channels approach. Model calculations show the transition
from pure state (coherent) to mixed state (decoherent and dissipative) dynamics
during a near-barrier nuclear collision. Energy dissipation, due to
irreversible decay of giant-dipole excitations of the interacting nuclei,
results in hindrance of quantum tunneling.
