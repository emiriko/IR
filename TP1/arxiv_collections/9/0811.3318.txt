We report quantum Monte Carlo calculations of biexciton binding energies in
ideal two-dimensional bilayer systems with isotropic electron and hole masses.
We have also calculated exciton-exciton interaction potentials, and pair
distribution functions for electrons and holes in bound biexcitons. Comparing
our data with results obtained in a recent study using a model exciton-exciton
potential [C. Schindler and R. Zimmermann, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 045313
(2008)], we find a somewhat larger range of layer separations at which
biexcitons are stable. We find that individual excitons retain their identity
in bound biexcitons for large layer separations.
