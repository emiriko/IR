We study the transference of an initial leptonic charge contained in a
complex scalar field (waterfall field) at the end of the inflation to the
leptons of the standard model and then convert this leptonic charge in baryonic
charge by sphaleron process. The proposal is that this is done trough the decay
of the complex scalar field particles into the right-handed neutrino which in
turn decays into the left-handed lepton doublet and the Higgs field of the
standard model. It must be analyzed in what environment the transference is
done. We propose that the inflaton (the dominant energy density of the
universe) decay into ultrarelativistic fermions before the waterfall field
particles decay in the right-handed neutrino, leaving a thermalized bath where
the transference of the leptonic asymmetry can be achieved.
