Using the idea of transformation optics, we propose a metamaterial device
that serves as a frequency-selective super-absorber, which consists of an
absorbing core material coated with a shell of isotropic double negative
metamaterial. For a fixed volume, the absorption cross section of the
super-absorber can be made arbitrarily large at one frequency. The double
negative shell serves to amplify the evanescent tail of the high order incident
cylindrical waves, which induces strong scattering and absorption. Our
conclusion is supported by both analytical Mie theory and numerical finite
element simulation. Interesting applications of such a device are discussed.
