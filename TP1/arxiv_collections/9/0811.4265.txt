We show that vortices appear in the modes of an astigmatic optical cavity
when it is put into rotation about its optical axis. We study the properties of
these vortices and discuss numerical results for a specific realization of such
a set-up. Our method is exact up to first order in the time-dependent paraxial
approximation and involves bosonic ladder operators in the spirit of the
quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator.
