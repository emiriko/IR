We present a detailed analysis of the self-organization phenomenon in which
the stylized facts originate from finite size effects with respect to the
number of agents considered and disappear in the limit of an infinite
population. By introducing the possibility that agents can enter or leave the
market depending on the behavior of the price, it is possible to show that the
system self-organizes in a regime with a finite number of agents which
corresponds to the stylized facts. The mechanism to enter or leave the market
is based on the idea that a too stable market is unappealing for traders while
the presence of price movements attracts agents to enter and speculate on the
market. We show that this mechanism is also compatible with the idea that
agents are scared by a noisy and risky market at shorter time scales. We also
show that the mechanism for self-organization is robust with respect to
variations of the exit/entry rules and that the attempt to trigger the system
to self-organize in a region without stylized facts leads to an unrealistic
dynamics. We study the self-organization in a specific agent based model but we
believe that the basic ideas should be of general validity.
