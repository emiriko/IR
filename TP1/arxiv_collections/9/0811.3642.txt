The small-$x_B$ deep inelastic scattering in the saturation region is
governed by the non-linear evolution of Wilson-line operators. In the leading
logarithmic approximation it is given by the BK equation for the evolution of
color dipoles. I discuss recent calculation of the next-to-leading order
evolution of color dipoles in QCD and ${\cal N}=4$ SYM.
