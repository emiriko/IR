Following our recent theoretical studies [M. G. Silveirinha, C. A. Fernandes,
Phys. Rev. B, 78, 033108, 2008], it is experimentally verified that an array of
crossed metallic wires may behave as a nonresonant material with extremely
large index of refraction at microwaves, and may enable the realization of
ultra-subwavelength waveguides.
