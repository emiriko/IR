By using polarized inelastic neutron scattering measurements, we show that
the spin-lattice quantum entanglement in mutliferroics results in hybrid
elementary excitations, involving spin and lattice degrees of freedom. These
excitations can be considered as multiferroic Godstone modes. We argue that the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction could be at the origin of this hybridization.
