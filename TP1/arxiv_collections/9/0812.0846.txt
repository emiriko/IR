Electron transport through two parallel quantum dots is a kind of solid-state
realization of double-path interference. We demonstrate that the inter-dot
Coulomb correlation and quantum coherence would result in strong current
fluctuations with a divergent Fano factor at zero frequency. We also provide
physical interpretation for this surprising result, which displays its generic
feature and allows us to recover this phenomenon in more complicated systems.
