We present a brief survey of results where quantum information processing is
useful to solve distributed computation tasks. We describe problems that are
impossible to solve using classical resources but that become feasible with the
help of quantum mechanics. We also give examples where the use of quantum
information significantly reduces the need for communication. The main focus of
the survey is on communication complexity but we also address other distributed
tasks.
