We refined crystal structures of newly found members of the Fe-1111
superconductor family, CaFe\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF and SrFe\_{1-x}Co\_{x}AsF (x = 0,
0.06, 0.12) by powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. The tetragonal to
orthorhombic phase transitions were observed at ~120 K for unsubstituted
CaFeAsF and at ~180 K for unsubstituted SrFeAsF, the transition temperatures
agreeing with kinks observed in temperature-dependent resistivity curves.
Although the transition temperature decreases, the structural phase transitions
were observed below 100 K in both samples of x = 0.06, and finally they were
suppressed in the doping level of x = 0.12. The refined structures reveal that
distortions of the FeAs4 tetrahedron from the regular tetrahedron likely
originate from mismatches in atomic radii among the constituent elements. In
this system, the enlarged FeAs4 tetrahedron resulting from larger radius of Sr
than that of Ca is flattened along a-b plane, whereas the smaller radius of Ca
makes the tetrahedron closer to regular one, and their characteristic shapes
are further enhanced by Co substitution. These results suggest that the CaFeAsF
compound is a promising candidate for higher-Tc superconductor.
