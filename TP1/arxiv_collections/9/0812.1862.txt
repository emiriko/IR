We have studied the phase diagram of the one dimensional XXZ model with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. We have applied the quantum
renormalization group (QRG) approach to get the stable fixed points, critical
point and the scaling of coupling constants. This model has three phases,
ferromagnetic, spin-fluid and N\'{e}el phases which are separated by a critical
line which depends on the DM coupling constant. We have shown that the
staggered magnetization is the order parameter of the system and investigated
the influence of DM interaction on the chiral ordering as a helical magnetic
order.
