We have measured the short-range attractive force between crystalline Ge
plates, and found contributions from both the Casimir force and an electrical
force possibly generated by surface patch potentials. Using a model of surface
patch effects that generates an additional force due to a distance dependence
of the apparent contact potential, the electrical force was parameterized using
data at distances where the Casimir force is relatively small. Extrapolating
this model, to provide a correction to the measured force at distances less
than 5 $\mu$m, shows a residual force that is in agreement, within experimental
uncertainty, with five models that have been used to calculate the Casimir
force.
