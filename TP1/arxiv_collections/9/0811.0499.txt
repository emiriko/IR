Life and language are discrete combinatorial systems (DCSs) in which the
basic building blocks are finite sets of elementary units: nucleotides or
codons in a DNA sequence and letters or words in a language. Different
combinations of these finite units give rise to potentially infinite numbers of
genes or sentences. This type of DCS can be represented as an Alphabetic
Bipartite Network ($\alpha$-BiN) where there are two kinds of nodes, one type
represents the elementary units while the other type represents their
combinations. There is an edge between a node corresponding to an elementary
unit $u$ and a node corresponding to a particular combination $v$ if $u$ is
present in $v$. Naturally, the partition consisting of the nodes representing
elementary units is fixed, while the other partition is allowed to grow
unboundedly. Here, we extend recently analytical findings for $\alpha$-BiNs
derived in [Peruani et al., Europhys. Lett. 79, 28001 (2007)] and empirically
investigate two real world systems: the codon-gene network and the
phoneme-language network. The evolution equations for $\alpha$-BiNs under
different growth rules are derived, and the corresponding degree distributions
computed. It is shown that asymptotically the degree distribution of
$\alpha$-BiNs can be described as a family of beta distributions. The one-mode
projections of the theoretical as well as the real world $\alpha$-BiNs are also
studied. We propose a comparison of the real world degree distributions and our
theoretical predictions as a means for inferring the mechanisms underlying the
growth of real world systems.
