This paper presents a new procedure of generating hash functions which can be
evaluated using some mathematical tools. This procedure is based on discrete
chaotic iterations.
  First, it is mathematically proven, that these discrete chaotic iterations
can be considered as a \linebreak particular case of topological chaos. Then,
the process of generating hash function based on the \linebreak topological
chaos is detailed. Finally it is shown how some tools coming from the domain of
\linebreak topological chaos can be used to measure quantitatively and
qualitatively some desirable properties for hash functions. An illustration
example is detailed in order to show how one can create hash functions using
our theoretical study.
