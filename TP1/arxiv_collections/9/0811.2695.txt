The strong coupling constants $g_{{\Sigma_{Q}\Lambda_{Q}\pi}}$ ($Q=b$ and
$c$) are studied in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules using the
most general form of the baryonic currents. The predicted coupling constants
are used to estimate the decay widths for the
$\Sigma_{Q}\longrightarrow\Lambda_{Q}\pi$ decays which are compared with the
predictions of the other approaches and existing experimental data.
