By analyzing the data sets of 17.3 pb$^{-1}$ taken at $\sqrt s= 3.773$ GeV
and of 6.5 pb$^{-1}$ taken at $\sqrt s= 3.650$ GeV with the BES-II detector at
the BEPC collider, we measure the observed cross sections for the exclusive
light hadron final states of $K_S^0K^-\pi^+$, $K_S^0K^-\pi^+\pi^0$,
$K_S^0K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-$, $K_S^0K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$,
$K_S^0K^-\pi^+\pi^+\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$ and $K_S^0K^-\pi^+\pi^0\pi^0$ produced in
$e^+ e^-$ annihilation at the two energy points. We set the upper limits on the
observed cross sections and the branching fractions for $\psi(3770)$ decay to
these final states at 90% C.L..
