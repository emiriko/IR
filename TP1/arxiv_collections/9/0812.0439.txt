We explore the behavior of persistent current and low-field magnetic response
in mesoscopic one-channel rings and multi-channel cylinders within the
tight-binding framework. We show that the characteristic properties of
persistent current strongly depend on total number of electrons $N_e$, chemical
potential $\mu$, randomness and total number of channels. The study of
low-field magnetic response reveals that only for one-channel rings with fixed
$N_e$, sign of the low-field currents can be predicted exactly, even in the
presence of disorder. On the other hand, for multi-channel cylinders, sign of
the low-field currents cannot be mentioned exactly, even in the perfect systems
with fixed $N_e$ as it significantly depends on the choices of $N_e$, $\mu$,
number of channels, disordered configurations, etc.
