Transposable elements may acquire unrelated gene fragments into their
sequences in a process called transduplication. Transduplication of
protein-coding genes is common in plants, but is unknown of in animals. Here,
we report that the Turmoil-1 transposable element in C. elegans has
incorporated two protein-coding sequences into its inverted terminal repeat
(ITR) sequences. The ITRs of Turmoil-1 contain a conserved RNA recognition
motif (RRM) that originated from the rsp- 2 gene and a fragment from the
protein-coding region of the cpg-3 gene. We further report that an open reading
frame specific to C. elegans may have been created as a result of a Turmoil-1
insertion. Mutations at the 5' splice site of this open reading frame may have
reactivated the transduplicated RRM motif
