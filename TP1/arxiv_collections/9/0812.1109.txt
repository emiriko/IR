We consider quantum transport and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) through
an interacting quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime, attached to
ferromagnetic leads. We show that there exist two kinds of anomalies of TMR,
which have different origin. One type, associated with TMR sign change and
appearing at conductance resonances, is of single particle origin. The second
type, inducing a pronounced increase of TMR value far beyond 100%, is caused by
electron correlations. It is manifested in-between Coulomb blockade conductance
peaks. Both types of anomalies are discussed for zero and finite bias and their
robustness to the temperature increase is also demonstrated. The results are
presented in the context of recent experiments on semiconductor quantum dots in
which similar features of TMR have been observed.
