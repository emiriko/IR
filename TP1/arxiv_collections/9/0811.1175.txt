We discuss the measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters at future
long baseline experiments in terms of the motivation of the experiments, the
quantities of interest from the theoretical point of view, the phenomenology of
these experiments, and the experiment choice. We illustrate the oscillation
physics potential of a neutrino factory, as a representative for the most
challenging technologies. Finally, we point out that a future neutrino
oscillation facility might also be affected by the unexpected.
