We provide an alternative, simpler proof of the existence of thick
triangulations for noncompact $\mathcal{C}^1$ manifolds. Moreover, this proof
is simpler than the original one given in \cite{pe}, since it mainly uses tools
of elementary differential topology. The role played by curvatures in this
construction is also emphasized.
