Experimental valence electron energy loss spectra (VEELS), up to the Li K
edge, obtained on different phases of LixFePO4 are compared to first principles
calculations using the density functional code WIEN2k. In the 4-7 eV range, a
large peak is identified in the FePO4 spectrum, but is absent in LiFePO4, which
could allow the easy formation of energy filtered images. The intensity of this
peak, non sensitive to the precise orientation of the crystal, is large enough
to rapidly determine existing phases in the sample and permit future dynamical
studies. Solid solution and two-phases regions are also differentiated using Fe
M2,3 / Li K edges.
