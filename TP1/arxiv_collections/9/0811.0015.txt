Optical Feshbach resonances [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 193001 (2005)] and
pump-dump photoassociation with short laser pulses [Phys. Rev. A 73, 033408
(2006)] have been proposed as means to coherently form stable ultracold alkali
dimer molecules. In an optical Feshbach resonance, the intensity and possibly
frequency of a cw laser are ramped up linearly followed by a sudden switch-off
of the laser. This is applicable to tightly trapped atom pairs. In short-pulse
photoassociation, the pump pulse forms a wave-packet in an electronically
excited state. The ensuing dynamics carry the wave-packet to shorter
internuclear distances where, after half a vibrational period, it can be
deexcited to the electronic ground state by the dump pulse. Short-pulse
photoassociation is suited for both shallow and tight traps. The applicability
of these two means to produce ultracold molecules is investigated here for
$^{88}$Sr. Dipole-allowed transitions proceeding via the $B^1\Sigma_u^+$
excited state as well as transitions near the intercombination line are
studied.
