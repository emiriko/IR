A Riemannian manifold (M,g) is said to be Einstein if its Ricci tensor
satisfies ric(g) = cg, for some real number c. In the homogeneous case, a
problem that is still open is the so called Alekseevskii Conjecture. This
conjecture says that any homogeneous Einstein space with negative scalar
curvature (i.e. c < 0) is a solvmanifold: a simply connected solvable Lie group
endowed with a left invariant Riemannian metric. The aim of this paper is to
classify Einstein solvmanifolds of dimension 9 whose nilradicals are 7-step
nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension 8.
