The sign-reversing fully gapped superconducting state, which is expected to
be realized in oxypnictide superconductors, can be prominently affected by
nonmagnetic impurities due to the interband scattering of Cooper pairs. We
study this problem based on the isotropic two-band BCS model: In oxypnictide
superconductors, the interband impurity scattering $I'$ is not equal to the
intraband one $I$. In the Born scattering regime, the reduction in Tc is
sizable and the impurity-induced density of states (DOS) is prominent if $I\sim
I'$, due to the interband scattering. Although impurity-induced DOS can yield a
power-law temperature dependence in $1/T_1$, a sizable suppression in Tc is
inevitably accompanied. In the unitary scattering regime, in contrast, impurity
effect is very small for both Tc and DOS except at $I=I'$. By comparing theory
and experiments, we expect that the degree of anisotropy in the $s_\pm$-wave
gap function strongly depends on compounds.
