The issue of group-blind multiuser detection in MAC channel among wireless
nodes in the environment of multiple networks coexisting and sharing spectrum
is addressed under the Framework of coalitional game. We investigate the
performance and stability of multiple access channel (MAC) with linear
decorrelating multiuser detection under varying SNR, channel gains and
coalitional structures, in which both single BS and multiple BSs cases were
considered. The main results and conclusion are as follows: (1) the grand
coalition is payoff maximizing under loose SNR; (2) it is in conformity with
group and coalitional rationality forming coalition among nodes that have
comparative channel gains.
