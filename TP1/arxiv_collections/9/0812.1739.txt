It is demonstrated that the claim in the paper "Crossing $\omega=-1$ by a
single scalar field on a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane" by H Zhang and Z-H Zhu
[Phys.Rev.D75,023510(2007)], about a prove that there do not exist scaling
solutions in a universe with dust in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld
scenario, is incorrect.
