Adiabatic quantum annealing is a paradigm of analog quantum computation,
where a given computational job is converted to the task of finding the global
minimum of some classical potential energy function and the search for the
global potential minimum is performed by employing external kinetic quantum
fluctuations and subsequent slow reduction (annealing) of them. In this method,
the entire potential energy landscape (PEL) may be accessed simultaneously
through a delocalized wave-function, in contrast to a classical search, where
the searcher has to visit different points in the landscape (i.e., individual
classical configurations) sequentially. Thus in such searches, the role of the
potential energy might be significantly different in the two cases. Here we
discuss this in the context of searching of a single isolated hole (potential
minimum) in a golf-course type gradient free PEL. We show, that the quantum
particle would be able to locate the hole faster if the hole is deeper, while
the classical particle of course would have no scope to exploit the depth of
the hole. We also discuss the effect of the underlying quantum phase transition
on the adiabatic dynamics.
