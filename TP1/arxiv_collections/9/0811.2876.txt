Recently, in the context of f(R) modified theories of gravity, it was shown
that a curvature-matter coupling induces a non-vanishing covariant derivative
of the energy-momentum, implying non-geodesic motion and, under appropriate
conditions, leading to the appearance of an extra force. We study the
implications of this proposal and discuss some directions for future research.
