Topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices, have long fascinated
physicists. A novel twist is added in quantum systems like the B-phase of
superfluid helium He$_3$, where vortices are associated with low energy
excitations in the cores. Similarly, cosmic strings may be tied to propagating
fermion modes. Can analogous phenomena occur in crystalline solids that host a
plethora of topological defects? Here we show that indeed dislocation lines are
associated with one dimensional fermionic excitations in a `topological
insulator', a novel band insulator believed to be realized in the bulk material
Bi$_{0.9}$Sb$_{0.1}$. In contrast to fermionic excitations in a regular quantum
wire, these modes are topologically protected like the helical edge states of
the quantum spin-Hall insulator, and not scattered by disorder. Since
dislocations are ubiquitous in real materials, these excitations could dominate
spin and charge transport in topological insulators. Our results provide a
novel route to creating a potentially ideal quantum wire in a bulk solid.
