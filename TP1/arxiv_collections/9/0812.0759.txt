Image Fusion, a technique which combines complimentary information from
different images of the same scene so that the fused image is more suitable for
segmentation, feature extraction, object recognition and Human Visual System.
In this paper, a simple yet efficient algorithm is presented based on contrast
using wavelet packet decomposition. First, all the source images are decomposed
into low and high frequency sub-bands and then fusion of high frequency
sub-bands is done by the means of Directive Contrast. Now, inverse wavelet
packet transform is performed to reconstruct the fused image. The performance
of the algorithm is carried out by the comparison made between proposed and
existing algorithm.
