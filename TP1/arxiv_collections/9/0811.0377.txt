With the previous results for the analytical blowup solutions of the
N-dimensional Euler-Poisson equations, we extend the similar structure to
construct an analytical family of solutions for the isothermal Navier-Stokes
equations and pressureless Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent
viscosity.
