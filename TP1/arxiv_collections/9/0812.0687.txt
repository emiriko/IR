We review and elaborate on our discussion in hep-th/0606112 on the interplay
between the target space and the worldsheet description of the open topological
string partition function, for the example of the conifold. We discuss the
appropriate phase space and canonical form for the system. We find a map
between choices of polarization and the worldsheet description, based on which
we study the behavior of the partition function under canonical
transformations.
