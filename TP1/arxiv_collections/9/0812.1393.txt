The conductance and thermoelectric power (TEP) of graphene is simultaneously
measured using microfabricated heater and thermometer electrodes. The sign of
the TEP changes across the charge neutrality point as the majority carrier
density switches from electron to hole. The gate dependent conductance and TEP
exhibit a quantitative agreement with the semiclassical Mott relation. In the
quantum Hall regime at high magnetic field, quantized thermopower and Nernst
signals are observed and are also in agreement with the generalized Mott
relation, except for strong deviations near the charge neutrality point.
