The differential cross section and the polarization observables for $\Delta
$--isobar production in the deuteron electrodisintegration process, $e^-+d\to
e^-+\Delta +N$, are calculated in a general formalism based on structure
functions. The obtained expressions have a general nature, hold for
one--photon--exchange, assuming P--invariance of the electromagnetic
interaction and the conservation of the hadron electromagnetic current. The
dependence of the differential cross section of the $e^-+d\to e^- +\Delta +N$
reaction on the vector and tensor polarizations of the deuteron target with
unpolarized and longitudinally polarized electrons is considered. The general
dependence of the asymmetries on two of five kinematic variables, the azimuthal
angle $\phi$ and $\epsilon$ (linear polarization of the virtual photon) is
calculated. A similar analysis is performed for the polarization of the nucleon
produced in $\gamma ^*d \to \Delta N$ reaction provided the electron beam is
unpolarized or longitudinally polarized. Polarization effects, which are due to
the strong $\Delta N-$ interaction in the final state are calculated. The
photoproduction of the $\Delta $--isobar on the deuteron target has been
considered in detail, as a particular case. The differential cross section and
various polarization observables have been derived in terms of the reaction
amplitudes. The polarization observables due to the linear and circular
polarizations of the photon, when the deuteron target is arbitrarily polarized
have been derived in terms of the reaction amplitudes. The polarization of the
final nucleon is also considered.
