We study the light scalar mesons in the QCD sum rule. We construct both the
diquark-antidiquark currents $(qq)(\bar q \bar q)$ and the meson-meson currents
$(\bar qq)(\bar qq)$. We find that there are five independent currents for both
cases, and derive the relations between them. For the meson-meson currents,
five independent currents are formed by products of color singlet $\bar q q$
pairs or color octet pairs. However, they can be related to each other, and the
relations are derived. We obtain the masses of the light scalar mesons which
are consistent with the experiments.
