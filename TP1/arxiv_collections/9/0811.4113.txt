A new version of the Feynman graph plotting tool JaxoDraw is presented.
Version 2.0 is a fundamental re-write of most of the JaxoDraw core and some
functionalities, in particular importing graphs, are not backward-compatible
with the 1.x branch. The most prominent new features include: drawing of Bezier
curves for all particle modes, on-the-fly update of edited objects, multiple
undo/redo functionality, the addition of a plugin infrastructure, and a general
improved memory performance. A new LaTeX style file is presented that has been
written specifically on top of the original axodraw.sty to meet the needs of
this this new version.
