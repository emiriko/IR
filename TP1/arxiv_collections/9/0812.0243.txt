The notion of a causal boundary for a spacetime has been a controversial
topic during the last three decades. Moreover, recently the role of the
boundary in the AdS/CFT correspondence for plane waves, have stimulated its
redefinition with some possible alternatives.
  Our aim is threefold. First, to review the different classical approaches to
boundaries of spacetimes, emphasizing their drawbacks and the progressive
redefinitions of the c-boundary. Second, to explain how plane waves and AdS/CFT
correspondence come into play, stressing the role of the c-boundary as the
holographic boundary in this correspondence. And, third, to discuss the
present-day status of the c-boundary, making clear the arguments of a
definitive proposal.
