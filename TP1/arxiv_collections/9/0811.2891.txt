We recalculate the leading one-loop contributions to mu > e gamma and mu ->
eee in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity, recovering previous results for
the former. When all the Goldstone interactions are taken into account, the
latter is also ultraviolet finite. The present experimental limits on these
processes require a somewhat heavy effective scale ~2.5 TeV, or the flavour
alignment of the Yukawa couplings of light and heavy leptons at the ~10% level,
or the splitting of heavy lepton masses to a similar precision. Present limits
on tau decays set no bounds on the corresponding parameters involving the tau
lepton
