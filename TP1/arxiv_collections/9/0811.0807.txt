We present results for the strangeness contribution to the nucleon, <N|ss|N>,
and to the spin of the nucleon, Delta s. By combining several variance
reduction techniques for all-to-all propagators we are able to obtain gains in
terms of computer time of factors of 25-30 for the disconnected loop that is
needed within the calculation of Delta s, relative to the standard approach of
just employing time partitioning/dilution. For <N|ss|n>, the error is dominated
by the gauge noise.
