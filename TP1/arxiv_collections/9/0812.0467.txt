We explore a novel mechanism for control of periodicity in persistent current
in a twisted normal metal loop threaded by a magnetic flux $\phi$. A simple
tight-binding model is used to describe the system. Quite interestingly we see
that, depending on the number of twist $p$, the persistent current exhibits
$\phi_0/p$ ($\phi_0=ch/e$, the elementary flux-quantum) periodicity. Such
fractional periodicity provides a new finding in the study of persistent
current.
