We consider determinantal point processes on a compact complex manifold X in
the limit of many particles. The correlation kernels of the processes are the
Bergman kernels associated to a a high power of a given Hermitian holomorphic
line bundle L over X. The empirical measure on X of the process, describing the
particle locations, converges in probability towards the pluripotential
equilibrium measure, expressed in term of the Monge-Amp\`ere operator. The
asymptotics of the corresponding fluctuations in the bulk are shown to be
asymptotically normal and described by a Gaussian free field and applies to
test functions (linear statistics) which are merely Lipschitz continuous.
Moreover, a scaling limit of the correlation functions in the bulk is shown to
be universal and expressed in terms of (the higher dimensional analog of) the
Ginibre ensemble. This geometric setting applies in particular to normal random
matrix ensembles, the two dimensional Coulomb gas, free fermions in a strong
magnetic field and multivariate orthogonal polynomials.
