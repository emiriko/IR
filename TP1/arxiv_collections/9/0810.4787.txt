We adapt a finite difference method of solution of the two-dimensional
massless Dirac equation, developed in the context of lattice gauge theory, to
the calculation of electrical conduction in a graphene sheet or on the surface
of a topological insulator. The discretized Dirac equation retains a single
Dirac point (no "fermion doubling"), avoids intervalley scattering as well as
trigonal warping, and preserves the single-valley time reversal symmetry (=
symplectic symmetry) at all length scales and energies -- at the expense of a
nonlocal finite difference approximation of the differential operator. We
demonstrate the symplectic symmetry by calculating the scaling of the
conductivity with sample size, obtaining the logarithmic increase due to
antilocalization. We also calculate the sample-to-sample conductance
fluctuations as well as the shot noise power, and compare with analytical
predictions.
