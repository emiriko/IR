It is shown, that the conventional presentation of the Maxwell equations for
the electromagnetic field in the Riemannian space-time appears to be
problematic. The reason of hesitations is the fact, that a solution of the
Maxwell equations in the space-time of Minkowski do not turn into solution of
the Maxwell equations in the Riemannian space-time after replacement of
Minkowskian world function $\sigma_{M}$ by the world function $\sigma_R$ of the
Riemannian space-time in the solution.
