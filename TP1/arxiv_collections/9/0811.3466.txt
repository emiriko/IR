The anisotropic superconducting state properties in Cu0.03TaS2 have been
investigated by magnetization, magnetoresistance, and specific heat
measurements. It clearly shows that Cu0.03TaS2 undergoes a superconducting
transition at TC = 4.03 K. The obtained superconducting parameters demonstrate
that Cu0.03TaS2 is an anisotropic type-II superconductor. Combining specific
heat jump = 1.6(4), gap ratio 2/kBTC = 4.0(9) and the estimated electron-phonon
coupling constant ~ 0.68, the superconductivity in Cu0.03TaS2 is explained
within the intermediate coupling BCS scenario. First-principles electronic
structure calculations suggest that copper intercalation of 2H-TaS2 causes a
considerable increase of the Fermi surface volume and the carrier density,
which suppresses the CDW fluctuation and favors the raise of TC.
