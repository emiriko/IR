The individual parts of the total angular momentum operator in interacting
theories cannot satisfy the canonical angular momentum commutation rule,
including those proposed in the above paper. Furthermore, the operators in the
new proposal a) are non-local in general gauge, b) do not have proper Lorentz
transformation properties, and c) do not have any known physical measurements.
