It is shown that in experiments on single molecule magnets (SMM's) in which
transitions between two lowest spin states are induced by sweeping the applied
magnetic field along the easy axis, the transitions are fully incoherent.
Nuclear spins and the dipolar coupling of molecular spins are identified as the
main sources of decoherence, and the form of the decoherence is calculated. The
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) process is examined in light of this
decoherence, and it is shown that the correct formula for the spin-flip
probability is better given by a more recent formula of Kayanuma's than that of
LZS. The two formulas are shown to be identical in the limit of rapid sweeps.
An approximate way of incorporating the molecular spin dipole field into the
rate equations for this process is developed.
