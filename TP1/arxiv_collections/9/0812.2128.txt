Measurements of the sound velocities in a single crystal of MnSi were
performed in the temperature range 4-150 K. Elastic constants, controlling
propagation of longitudinal waves reveal significant softening at a temperature
of about 29.6 K and small discontinuities at $\sim$28.8 K, which corresponds to
the magnetic phase transition in MnSi. In contrast the shear elastic moduli do
not show any softening at all, reacting only to the small volume deformation
caused by the magneto-volume effect. The current ultrasonic study exposes an
important fact that the magnetic phase transition in MnSi, occurring at 28.8 K,
is just a minor feature of the global transformation marked by the rounded
maxima or minima of heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, sound
velocities and absorption, and the temperature derivative of resistivity.
