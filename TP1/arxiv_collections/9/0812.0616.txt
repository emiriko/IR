In a series of recently published papers we reanalyzed the existing
treatments of Veneziano and Veneziano-like amplitudes and the models associated
with these amplitudes. In this work we demonstrate that the already obtained
new partition function for these amplitudes can be exactly mapped into that for
the Polychronakos-Frahm (P-F) spin chain model. This observation allows us to
recover many of the existing string-theoretic models, including the most recent
ones.
