We study the relaxation dynamics of systems of straight, parallel crystal
dislocations, starting from initially random and uncorrelated positions of the
individual dislocations. A scaling model of the relaxation process is
constructed by considering the gradual extinction of the initial density
fluctuations present in the system. The model is validated by ensemble
simulations of the discrete dynamics of dislocations. Convincing agreement is
found for systems of edge dislocations in single slip irrespective of the net
Burgers vector of the dislocation system. It is also demonstrated that the
model does not work in multiple slip geometries.
