We describe the design, fabrication, and measurement of a cavity
opto-mechanical system consisting of two nanobeams of silicon nitride in the
near-field of each other, forming a so-called "zipper" cavity. A photonic
crystal patterning is applied to the nanobeams to localize optical and
mechanical energy to the same cubic-micron-scale volume. The picrogram-scale
mass of the structure, along with the strong per-photon optical gradient force,
results in a giant optical spring effect. In addition, a novel damping regime
is explored in which the small heat capacity of the zipper cavity results in
blue-detuned opto-mechanical damping.
