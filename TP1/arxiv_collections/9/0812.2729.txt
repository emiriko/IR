Considerable work has been done on the one-loop effective action in combined
electromagnetic and gravitational fields, particularly as a tool for
determining the properties of light propagation in curved space. After a short
review of previous work, I present some recent results obtained using the
worldline formalism. In particular, I will discuss various ways of generalizing
the QED Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian to the Einstein-Maxwell case.
