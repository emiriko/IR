We apply the concept of subset seeds proposed in [1] to similarity search in
protein sequences. The main question studied is the design of efficient seed
alphabets to construct seeds with optimal sensitivity/selectivity trade-offs.
We propose several different design methods and use them to construct several
alphabets.We then perform an analysis of seeds built over those alphabet and
compare them with the standard Blastp seeding method [2,3], as well as with the
family of vector seeds proposed in [4]. While the formalism of subset seed is
less expressive (but less costly to implement) than the accumulative principle
used in Blastp and vector seeds, our seeds show a similar or even better
performance than Blastp on Bernoulli models of proteins compatible with the
common BLOSUM62 matrix.
