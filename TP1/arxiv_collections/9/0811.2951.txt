Let G be a Lie group, $T^*G$ its cotangent bundle with its natural Lie group
structure obtained by performing a left trivialization of T^*G and endowing the
resulting trivial bundle with the semi-direct product, using the coadjoint
action of G on the dual space of its Lie algebra.
  We investigate the group of automorphisms of the Lie algebra of $T^*G$. More
precisely, amongst other results, we fully characterize the space of all
derivations of the Lie algebra of $T^*G$.
  As a byproduct, we also characterize some spaces of operators on G amongst
which, the space J of bi-invariant tensors on G and prove that if G has a
bi-invariant Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian metric, then J is isomorphic to
the space of linear maps from the Lie algebra of G to its dual space which are
equivariant with respect to the adjoint and coadjoint actions, as well as that
of bi-invariant bilinear forms on G.
  We discuss some open problems and possible applications.
