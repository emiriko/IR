The determination of alpha_s(M_Z) via perturbative analyses of
short-distance-sensitive lattice observables is revisited, incorporating new
lattice data and performing a modified version of the original analysis. The
analysis employs two high-intrinsic-scale observables, log (W_11) and
log(W_12), and one lower-intrinsic-scale observable, log(W_12/u_0^6). We find
good consistency among the values extracted using the different observables and
a final result, alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1192(11), in excellent agreement with various
recent non-lattice determinations, as well as with the results of a similar,
but not identical, re-analysis by the HPQCD collaboration. The relation between
the two re-analyses is discussed, focussing on the complementarity of the two
approaches.
