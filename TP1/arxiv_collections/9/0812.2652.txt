A fundamental Doppler-like but asymmetric wave effect that shifts received
signals in frequency in proportion to their respective source distances, was
recently described as means for a whole new generation of communication
technology using angle and distance, potentially replacing TDM, FDM or CDMA,
for multiplexing. It is equivalent to wave packet compression by scaling of
time at the receiver, converting path-dependent phase into distance-dependent
shifts, and can multiply the capacity of physical channels. The effect was
hitherto unsuspected in physics, appears to be responsible for both the
cosmological acceleration and the Pioneer 10/11 anomaly, and is exhibited in
audio data. This paper discusses how it may be exploited for instant, passive
ranging of signal sources, for verification, rescue and navigation; incoherent
aperture synthesis for smaller, yet more accurate radars; universal immunity to
jamming or interference; and precision frequency scaling of radiant energy in
general.
