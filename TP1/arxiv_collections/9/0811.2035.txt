A pair of optical pulses traveling through two dispersive media will become
broadened and, as a result, the degree of coincidence between the optical
pulses will be reduced. For a pair of entangled photons, however, nonlocal
dispersion cancellation in which the dispersion experienced by one photon
cancels the dispersion experienced by the other photon is possible. In this
paper, we report an experimental demonstration of nonlocal dispersion
cancellation using entangled photons. The degree of two-photon coincidence is
shown to increase beyond the limit attainable without entanglement. Our results
have important applications in fiber-based quantum communication and quantum
metrology.
