We report on the search for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) and charged Q-balls
with the SLIM experiment at the Chacaltaya High Altitude Laboratory (5230 m
a.s.l.) from 2001 to 2005. The SLIM experiment was a 427 m$^{2}$ array of
Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) arranged in modules of $24 \times 24$ cm$^{2}$
area. SLIM NTDs were exposed to the cosmic radiation for 4.22 years after which
they were brought back to the Bologna Laboratory where they were etched and
analyzed. We estimate the properties and energy losses in matter of nuclearites
(large SQM nuggets), strangelets (small charged SQM nuggets) and Q-balls; and
discuss their detection with the SLIM experiment. The flux upper limits in the
CR of such downgoing particles are at the level of $1.3 10^{-15}$/cm$^{2}$/s/sr
(90% CL).
