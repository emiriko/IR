Flavour mixing is described within the Standard Model by the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements. With the increasingly higher
statistics collected by many experiments, the matrix elements are measured with
improved precision, allowing for more stringent tests of the Standard Model. In
this paper, a review of the current status of the absolute values of the CKM
matrix elements is presented, with particular attention to the latest
measurements.
