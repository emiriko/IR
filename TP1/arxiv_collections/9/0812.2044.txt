In charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions, highly charged macroions, dressed
by strongly correlated counterions, carry an effective charge that can be
substantially reduced (renormalized) from the bare charge. Interactions between
dressed macroions are screened by weakly correlated counterions and salt ions.
Thermodynamic and structural properties of colloidal suspensions depend
sensitively on the magnitudes of both the effective charge and the effective
screening constant. Combining a charge renormalization theory of effective
electrostatic interactions with Monte Carlo simulations of a one-component
model, we compute osmotic pressures and pair distribution functions of
deionized colloidal suspensions. This computationally practical approach yields
close agreement with corresponding results from large-scale simulations of the
primitive model up to modest electrostatic coupling strengths.
