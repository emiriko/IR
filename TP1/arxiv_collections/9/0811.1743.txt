In this work we calculate the effects of the electroweak flavour changing
neutral currents dimension six effective operators on single top production at
the LHC. These results are then combined with previous ones we have obtained
for the strong sector. This allow us, for the first time, to perform a combined
analysis of flavour changing neutral currents in top production with all
contributing dimension six operators. Finally, we study the feasibility of
their observation and characterization both at the Tevatron and at the LHC.
