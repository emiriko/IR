We study the effects that a non zero strong-CP-violating parameter theta
would have on the deuteron and diproton binding energies and on the
triple-alpha process. Both these systems exhibit fine tuning, so it is
plausible that a small change in the nuclear force would produce catastrophic
consequences. Such a nuclear force is here understood in the framework of an
effective Lagrangian for pions and nucleons, and the strength of the
interaction varies with theta. We find that the effects are not too dramatic.
