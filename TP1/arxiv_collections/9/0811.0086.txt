Based on previous studies computing coefficients of the electroweak chiral
Lagrangian from C.T.Hill's schematic topcolor-assisted technicolor model, we
generalize the calculation to K.Lane's prototype natural topcolor-assisted
technicolor model. We find that typical features of the model are qualitatively
similar as those of Hill's model, but Lane's model prefers smaller technicolor
group and Z' mass must be smaller than 400GeV, further S parameter is around
order of +1 mainly due to existence of three doublets of techniquarks. We
obtain the values for all coefficients of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian up
to order of p^4. Apart from negative large four fermion coupling values, ETC
impacts on the electroweak chiral Lagrangian coefficients are small, since
techniquark self energy which determines these coefficients in general receives
almost no influence from ETC induced four fermion interactions except for its
large momentum tail.
