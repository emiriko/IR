A dressed-quark core contribution to nucleon electromagnetic form factors is
calculated. It is defined by the solution of a Poincare' covariant Faddeev
equation in which dressed-quarks provide the elementary degree of freedom and
correlations between them are expressed via diquarks. The nucleon-photon vertex
involves a single parameter; i.e., a diquark charge radius. It is argued to be
commensurate with the pion's charge radius. A comprehensive analysis and
explanation of the form factors is built upon this foundation. A particular
feature of the study is a separation of form factor contributions into those
from different diagram types and correlation sectors, and subsequently a
flavour separation for each of these. Amongst the extensive body of results
that one could highlight are: r_1^{n,u}>r_1^{n,d}, owing to the presence of
axial-vector quark-quark correlations; and for both the neutron and proton the
ratio of Sachs electric and magnetic form factors possesses a zero.
