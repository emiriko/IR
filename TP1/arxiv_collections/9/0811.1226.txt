We construct, generalizing appropriately the method applied by J. Teschner in
the case of the Virasoro conformal blocks, the braiding and fusion matrices of
the Neveu-Schwarz super-conformal blocks. Their properties allow for an
explicit verification of the bootstrap equation in the NS sector of the N=1
supersymmetric Liouville field theory.
