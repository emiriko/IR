A damage-plasticity constitutive model for the description of fracture in
plain concrete is presented. Two approaches, the local model comprising the
adjustment of the softening modulus and the nonlocal model based on spatial
averaging of history variables, are applied to the analysis of a concrete bar
subjected to uniaxial tension and to a three-point bending test. The influence
of mesh size and the decomposition into damage and plasticity components are
discussed. It is shown that for the two examples studied, both approaches
result in mesh-independent results. However, the nonlocal model, which relies
on spatial averaging of history variables, exhibits sensitivity with respect to
boundary conditions, which requires further studies.
