Eukaryotic cells possess a sensible chemical compass allowing them to orient
toward sources of soluble chemicals. The extracellular chemical signal triggers
separation of the cell membrane into two domains populated by different
phospholipid molecules and oriented along the signal anisotropy. We propose a
theory of this polarization process, which is articulated into subsequent
stages of germ nucleation, patch coarsening and merging into a single domain.
We find that the polarization time, $t_\epsilon$, depends on the anisotropy
degree $\epsilon$ through the power law $t_\epsilon\propto \epsilon^{-2}$, and
that in a cell of radius $R$ there should exist a threshold value
$\epsilon_\mathrm{th}\propto R^{-1}$ for the smallest detectable anisotropy.
