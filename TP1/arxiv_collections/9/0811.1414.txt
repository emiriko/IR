For percolating systems, we propose a universal exponent relation connecting
the leading corrections to scaling of the cluster size distribution with the
dynamic corrections to the asymptotic transport behaviour at criticality. Our
derivation is based on a cluster-resolved scaling theory unifying the scaling
of both the cluster size distribution and the dynamics of a random walker. We
corroborate our theoretical approach by extensive simulations for a site
percolating square lattice and numerically determine both the static and
dynamic correction exponents.
