The paper questions the robustness of average case time complexity of the
fast and popular quicksort algorithm. Among the six standard probability
distributions examined in the paper, only continuous uniform, exponential and
standard normal are supporting it whereas the others are supporting the worst
case complexity measure. To the question -why are we getting the worst case
complexity measure each time the average case measure is discredited? -- one
logical answer is average case complexity under the universal distribution
equals worst case complexity. This answer, which is hard to challenge, however
gives no idea as to which of the standard probability distributions come under
the umbrella of universality. The morale is that average case complexity
measures, in cases where they are different from those in worst case, should be
deemed as robust provided only they get the support from at least the standard
probability distributions, both discrete and continuous. Regretfully, this is
not the case with quicksort.
