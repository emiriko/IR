In the recent literature there has been a resurgence of interest in the
fourth-order field-theoretic model of Pais-Uhlenbeck \cite {Pais-Uhlenbeck 50
a}, which has not had a good reception over the last half century due to the
existence of {\em ghosts} in the properties of the quantum mechanical solution.
Bender and Mannheim \cite{Bender 08 a} were successful in persuading the
corresponding quantum operator to `give up the ghost'. Their success had the
advantage of making the model of Pais-Uhlenbeck acceptable to the physical
community and in the process added further credit to the cause of advancement
of the use of ${\cal PT} $ symmetry. We present a case for the acceptance of
the Pais-Uhlenbeck model in the context of Dirac's theory by providing an
Hamiltonian which is not quantum mechanically haunted. The essential point is
the manner in which a fourth-order equation is rendered into a system of
second-order equations. We show by means of the method of reduction of order
\cite {Nucci} that it is possible to construct an Hamiltonian which gives rise
to a satisfactory quantal description without having to abandon Dirac.
