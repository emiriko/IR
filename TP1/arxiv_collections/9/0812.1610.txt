The Color Glass Condensate picture of the nuclear wave function at small-x
successfully predicted the suppressed production of high-pT particles at
forward rapidities in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC. This triggered more
efforts which resulted in theoretical improvements and predictions for
different observables which will provide further phenomenological tests. I
review recent theoretical developments and discuss the resulting predictions.
