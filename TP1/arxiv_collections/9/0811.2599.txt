The spin-dependent interactions in mesons are considered in detail in the
framework of the Field Correlator Method. Analytic expressions for the
spin-dependent potentials in heavy and light quarkonia are derived with the QCD
string moment of inertia taken into account. Recent lattice data are analysed
using these formulae and the data are shown to be consistent with very small
values of the gluonic correlation length, <0.1 fm. The Field Correlator and the
Eichten-Feinberg definitions of the spin-dependent potentials in the lowest,
Gaussian approximation for the QCD vacuum are compared to one another and the
two approaches are shown to be equivalent in the limit of a vanishing vacuum
correlation length, whereas for finite values of the latter the difference
between these two approaches can be explained by the contribution of the
higher-order field corelators, starting from the quartic one.
