The analytical expressions for the van der Waals potential energy and force
between two crossed carbon nanotubes are presented. The Lennard-Jones potential
for two carbon atoms and the method of the smeared out approximation suggested
by L.A. Girifalco were used. The exact formula is expressed in terms of
rational and elliptical functions. The potential and force for carbon nanotubes
were calculated. The uniform potential curves for single- and multi- wall
nanotubes were plotted. The equilibrium distance, maximal attractive force, and
potential energy have been estimated.
