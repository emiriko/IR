It is know that PT-symmetric models have real spectra provided the symmetry
is not spontaneously broken. Even pseudo-hermitian models have real spectra,
which enlarge the the class of non-hermitian models possessing real spectra. We
however consider non-hermitian models in higher dimensions which are not
necessarily explicit PT-symmetric nor pseudo-hermitian. We show that the models
may generate real spectra depending upon the coupling constants of the
Hamiltonian. Our models thus further generalize the class of non-hermitian
systems, which possess real spectra.
