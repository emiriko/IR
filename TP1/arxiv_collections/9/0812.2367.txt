In this paper we try to establish a connection between a three-dimensional
Lotka--Volterra dynamical system and two-dimensional topological surgery. There
are many physical phenomena exhibiting two-dimensional topological surgery
through a `hole drilling' process. By our connection, such phenomena may be
modelled mathematically by the above dynamical system.
