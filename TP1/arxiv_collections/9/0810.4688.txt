By the Wolff's cluster Monte Carlo simulations and numerical minimization
within a mean field approach, we study the low temperature phase diagram of
water, adopting a cell model that reproduces the known properties of water in
its fluid phases. Both methods allows us to study the water thermodynamic
behavior at temperatures where other numerical approaches --both Monte Carlo
and molecular dynamics-- are seriously hampered by the large increase of the
correlation times. The cluster algorithm also allows us to emphasize that the
liquid--liquid phase transition corresponds to the percolation transition of
tetrahedrally ordered water molecules.
