We report the effect of Si doping on the magnetization behavior of CeFe2. It
is found that Si stabilizes the dynamic antiferromagnetic state of CeFe2.
Multi-step magnetization behavior, unusual relaxation effect, thermal and
magnetic history dependence, which are signatures of martensitic scenario, are
found to be present in this system. We also show that one can induce the
magnetization steps with the help of appropriate measurement protocol. Detailed
magnetization relaxation studies have been carried out to understand the
dynamics of magnetic phase transition.
