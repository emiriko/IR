We investigate polyethylene imine and diazonium salts as stable,
complementary dopants on graphene. Transport in graphene devices doped with
these molecules exhibits asymmetry in electron and hole conductance. The
conductance of one carrier is preserved, while the conductance of the other
carrier decreases. Simulations based on nonequilibrium Green's function
formalism suggest that the origin of this asymmetry is imbalanced carrier
injection from the graphene electrodes caused by misalignment of the electrode
and channel neutrality points.
