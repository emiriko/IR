The realization of high-transition-temperature superconductivity (HTSC)
confined to nanometre-sized interfaces has been a long-standing goal because of
potential applications and the opportunity to study quantum phenomena in
reduced dimensions. Here we discuss HTSC at free surfaces, interfaces, and
nanoscale cluster surfaces, and show that the percolative self-organized model
of bulk HTSC also gives an excellent description of HTSC in
quasi-two-dimensional contexts.
