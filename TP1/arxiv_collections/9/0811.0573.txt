Work in the Open Archives Initiative - Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE)
focuses on an important aspect of infrastructure for eScience: the
specification of the data model and a suite of implementation standards to
identify and describe compound objects. These are objects that aggregate
multiple sources of content including text, images, data, visualization tools,
and the like. These aggregations are an essential product of eScience, and will
become increasingly common in the age of data-driven scholarship. The OAI-ORE
specifications conform to the core concepts of the Web architecture and the
semantic Web, ensuring that applications that use them will integrate well into
the general Web environment.
