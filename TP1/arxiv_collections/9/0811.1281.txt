We developed a method for estimating the positional distribution of
transcription fac-tor (TF) binding sites using ChIP-chip data, and applied it
to recently published experiments on binding sites of nine TFs; OCT4, SOX2,
NANOG, HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF6, FOXA2, USF1 and CREB1. The data were obtained from a
genome-wide cov-erage of promoter regions from 8kb upstream of the
Transcription Start Site (TSS) to 2kb downstream. The number of target genes of
each TF ranges from few hundred to several thousand. We found that for each of
the nine TFs the estimated binding site distribution is closely approximated by
a mixture of two components: a narrow peak, localized within 300 base pairs
upstream of the TSS, and a distribution of almost uni-form density within the
tested region. Using Gene Ontology and Enrichment analysis, we were able to
associate (for each of the TFs studied) the target genes of both types of
binding with known biological processes. Most GO terms were enriched either
among the proximal targets or among those with a uniform distribution of
binding sites. For example, the three stemness-related TFs have several hundred
target genes that belong to "development" and "morphogenesis" whose binding
sites belong to the uniform dis-tribution.
