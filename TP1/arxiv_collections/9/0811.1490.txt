We give a geometric description of the motion of eigenvalues of a Brownian
motion with values in some matrix spaces. In the second part we consider a
paper by Polya where he introduced a function close to the Riemann zeta
function, which satisfies Riemann hypothesis. We show that each of these two
functions can be related to Brownian motion on a symmetric space.
