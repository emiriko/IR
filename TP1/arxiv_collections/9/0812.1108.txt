The status of the CMS RPC Gas Gain Monitoring (GGM) system developed at the
Frascati Laboratory of INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare) is reported
on. The GGM system is a cosmic ray telescope based on small RPC detectors
operated with the same gas mixture used by the CMS RPC system. The GGM gain and
efficiency are continuously monitored on-line, thus providing a fast and
accurate determination of any shift in working point conditions. The
construction details and the first result of GGM commissioning are described.
