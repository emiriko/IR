This is a short analysis of the changes in the concept of entropy as applied
to physics of the present-day and Early Universe. Of special interest is a
leading role of such a notion as deformation of a physical theory. The relation
to a symmetry of the corresponding theory is noted. As this work is not a
survey, the relevant author's works are mainly considered. This paper is to be
published in special issue "Symmetry and Entropy" of journal SYMMETRY: Culture
and Science
