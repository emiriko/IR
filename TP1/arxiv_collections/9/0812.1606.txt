We describe a novel scheme to implement scalable quantum information
processing using Li-Cs molecular state to entangle $^{6}$Li and $^{133}$Cs
ultracold atoms held in independent optical lattices. The $^{6}$Li atoms will
act as quantum bits to store information, and $^{133}$Cs atoms will serve as
messenger bits that aid in quantum gate operations and mediate entanglement
between distant qubit atoms. Each atomic species is held in a separate optical
lattice and the atoms can be overlapped by translating the lattices with
respect to each other. When the messenger and qubit atoms are overlapped,
targeted single spin operations and entangling operations can be performed by
coupling the atomic states to a molecular state with radio-frequency pulses. By
controlling the frequency and duration of the radio-frequency pulses,
entanglement can either be created or swapped between a qubit messenger pair.
We estimate operation fidelities for entangling two distant qubits and discuss
scalability of this scheme and constraints on the optical lattice lasers.
