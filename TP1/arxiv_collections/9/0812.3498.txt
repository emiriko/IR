We consider the propagation of a tilted high order paraxial vortex-beam
through a homogeneous anisotropic medium of a uniaxial crystal. We found that
the initially circularly polarized beam bearing the l-order optical vortex
splits into ordinary and extraordinary beams with a complex vortex structure.
After a series of dislocation reactions the vortices gather together at the
axis of the partial beam with the initial circular polarization shaping the
l-order optical vortex. However, only l-1 vortices gather together on the axis
of the partial beam with the orthogonal circular polarization. One optical
vortex is shifted along the direction perpendicular to the inclination plane of
the beam. Such a vortex displacement induces the transverse shift of the
partial beam. In fact, we deal with the beam quadrefringence in a uniaxial,
homogeneous anisotropic medium. The first two beams is a result of the
splitting of the initial tilted beam into the ordinary and extraordinary once.
