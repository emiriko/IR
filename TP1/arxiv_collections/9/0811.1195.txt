At high area fractions, monolayers of colloidal dimer particles form a
degenerate crystal (DC) structure in which the particle lobes occupy triangular
lattice sites while the particles are oriented randomly along any of the three
lattice directions. We report that dislocation glide in DCs is blocked by
certain particle orientations. The mean number of lattice constants between
such obstacles is 4.6 +/- 0.2 in experimentally observed DC grains and 6.18 +/-
0.01 in simulated monocrystalline DCs. Dislocation propagation beyond these
obstacles is observed to proceed through dislocation reactions. We estimate
that the energetic cost of dislocation pair separation via such reactions in an
otherwise defect free DC grows linearly with final separation, hinting that the
material properties of DCs may be dramatically different from those of 2-D
crystals of spheres.
