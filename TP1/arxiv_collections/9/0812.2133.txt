We discuss flavor charges and states for interacting mixed neutrinos in QFT.
We show that the Pontecorvo states are not eigenstates of the flavor charges.
This implies that their use in describing the flavor neutrinos produces a
violation of lepton charge conservation in the production/detection vertices.
The flavor states defined as eigenstates of the flavor charges give the correct
representation of mixed neutrinos in charged current weak interaction
processes.
