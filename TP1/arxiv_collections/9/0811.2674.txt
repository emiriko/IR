Taking into account the gluon condensate contributions, the form factors of
the semileptonic $B_c^- \to D^{*0}\ell\nu$ transition with $l=\tau, e$ are
calculated in the framework of the three point QCD sum rules. The heavy quark
effective theory limit of the form factors are also computed. The relevant
total decay width as well as the branching ratio are evaluated and compared
with the predictions of the other non-perturbative approaches.
