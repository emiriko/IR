As one exact candidate of the higher dimensional black hole, the 5D
Ricci-flat Schwarzschild-de Sitter black string space presents something
interesting. In this paper, we give a numerical solution to the real scalar
field around the Nariai black hole by the polynomial approximation. Unlike the
previous tangent approximation, this fitting function makes a perfect match in
the leading intermediate region and gives a good description near both the
event and the cosmological horizons. We can read from our results that the wave
is close to a harmonic one with the tortoise coordinate. Furthermore, with the
actual radial coordinate the waves pile up almost equally near the both
horizons.
