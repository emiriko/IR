When independent Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), described quantum
mechanically by Fock (number) states, are sent into interferometers, the
measurement of the output port at which the particles are detected provides a
binary measurement, with two possible results $\pm1$. With two interferometers
and two BEC's, the parity (product of all results obtained at each
interferometer) has all the features of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen quantity,
with perfect correlations predicted by quantum mechanics when the settings
(phase shifts of the interferometers) are the same. When they are different,
significant violations of Bell inequalities are obtained. These violations do
not tend to zero when the number $N$ of particles increases, and can therefore
be obtained with arbitrarily large systems, but a condition is that all
particles should be detected. We discuss the general experimental requirements
for observing such effects, the necessary detection of all particles in
correlation, the role of the pixels of the CCD detectors, and that of the
alignments of the interferometers in terms of matching of the wave fronts of
the sources in the detection regions. Another scheme involving three
interferometers and three BEC's is discussed; it leads to Greenberger Horne
Zeilinger (GHZ) sign contradictions, as in the usual GHZ case with three
particles, but for an arbitrarily large number of them. Finally,
generalizations of the Hardy impossibilities to an arbitrarily large number of
particles are introduced. BEC's provide a large versality for observing
violations of local realism in a variety of experimental arrangements.
