We discuss how large three-body loss of atoms in an optical lattice can give
rise to effective hard-core three-body interactions. For bosons, in addition to
the usual atomic superfluid, a dimer superfluid can then be observed for
attractive two-body interactions. The non-equilibrium dynamics of preparation
and stability of these phases are studied in 1D by combining time-dependent
Density Matrix Renormalisation Group techniques with a quantum trajectories
method.
