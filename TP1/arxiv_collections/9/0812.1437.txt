We classify the switching kinetics of ferroelectrics including both
epitaxial/polycrystalline thin films and single-crystalline/ceramic bulks at
various applied fields into four categories, depending on whether the
depolarization field and/or the polarization reversal induced by the switching
promotion effect between adjacent parts can be neglected. We show that our
statistical model developed very recently [Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter
21, 012207 (2009)] in its generalized form applies to all these four
categories. Finally we make the comparison between our model and the
conventional Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi model and discuss the behavior of the
switching currents for different n.
