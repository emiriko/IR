We discuss coherent QCD radiation from space-like parton branching and its
effects on multi-jet final states at high-energy hadron colliders.
  Coherence effects for small longitudinal momentum fractions x are not
included in the branching algorithms of standard shower Monte Carlo event
generators. On the other hand, they are taken into account only partially in
perturbative next-to-leading-order calculations for multi-jets. Such effects
are present to all orders in alpha_s and can become logarithmically enhanced
with \sqrt{s} / E_T, where E_T is the hardest jet transverse energy. We present
results of summing coherence effects to all orders by parton-branching Monte
Carlo methods based on transverse-momentum dependent matrix elements.
