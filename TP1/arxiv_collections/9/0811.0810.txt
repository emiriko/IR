We reply to claims (by Deutsch, Zeh, Brown and Wallace) that the pilot-wave
theory of de Broglie and Bohm is really a many-worlds theory with a superfluous
configuration appended to one of the worlds. Assuming that pilot-wave theory
does contain an ontological pilot wave (a complex-valued field in configuration
space), we show that such claims arise from not interpreting pilot-wave theory
on its own terms. Specifically, the theory has its own ('subquantum') theory of
measurement, and in general describes a 'nonequilibrium' state that violates
the Born rule. Furthermore, in realistic models of the classical limit, one
does not obtain localised pieces of an ontological pilot wave following
alternative macroscopic trajectories: from a de Broglie-Bohm viewpoint,
alternative trajectories are merely mathematical and not ontological. Thus,
from the perspective of pilot-wave theory itself, many worlds are an illusion.
It is further argued that, even leaving pilot-wave theory aside, the theory of
many worlds is rooted in the intrinsically unlikely assumption that quantum
measurements should be modelled on classical measurements, and is therefore
unlikely to be true.
