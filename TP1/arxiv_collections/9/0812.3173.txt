Aerodynamic models are developed to describe coherent structures and
transport processes in hurricanes moving over open seas. The models consist of
the lower boundary layer and upper adiabatic layer. Except friction at the
air/sea interface,proposed modeling avoids the common turbulent approximations
while using explicitly or implicitly basic stability constraints. The models
analyze dynamics of upper hurricane adiabatic layer, dynamics and transport
processes in hurricane boundary layer, and genesis and maturing of hurricane.
The proposed modeling provides a rude enough but consistent analytical
description of basic processes in hurricanes. The present paper qualitatively
describes the model of mature hurricane, briefly discusses the basic
thermodynamic relations and aerodynamic equations, and establishes the
principles of horizontal motion for mature hurricane.
