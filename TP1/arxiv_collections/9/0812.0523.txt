In order to identify the Higgs sector realized in nature, the predictions for
Higgs boson masses, production cross sections and decay widths have to be
compared with experimental results. We give a brief overview about computer
codes for the evaluation of the properties of charged Higgs bosons, mostly
focusing on the case of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We
briefly review the relevance of the various contributions to the charged MSSM
Higgs boson mass arising at the one-loop level.
