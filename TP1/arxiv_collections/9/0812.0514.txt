Historically it happen so that in branches of physics connected with field
theory and of physics of material systems (continuous media) the concept of
"conservation laws" has a different meaning. In field theory "conservation
laws" are those that claim the existence of conservative physical quantities or
objects. These are conservation laws for physical fields. In contrast to that
in physics (and mechanics) of material systems the concept of "conservation
laws" relates to conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, angular
momentum, and mass that establish the balance between the change of physical
quantities and external action.
  In the paper presented it is proved that there exist a connection between of
conservation laws for physical fields and those for material systems. This
points to the fact that physical fields are connected with material systems.
Such results has an unique significance for field theories. This enables one to
substantiate many basic principles of field theories, such as, for example, the
unity of existing field theories and the causality. The specific feature of
field theory equations, namely, their connection to the equations for material
systems, is elicited. Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric
differential forms, which reflect the properties of conservation laws.
