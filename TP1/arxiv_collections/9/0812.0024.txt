We prove that a diagrammatic evaluation of the Kubo formula for the
electronic transport conductivity due the exchange of bosonic excitations, in
the usual conserving ladder approximation, yields a result consistent with the
Boltzmann equation. In particular, we show that an uncontrolled approximation
that has been used to solve the integral equation for the vertex function is
unnecessary. An exact solution of the integral equation yields the same
asymptotic low-temperature behavior as the approximate one, albeit with a
different prefactor, and agrees with the temperature dependence of the
Boltzmann solution. Examples considered are electron scattering from acoustic
phonons, and from helimagnons in helimagnets.
