We prove that any flat G-bundle, where G is a complex connected reductive
algebraic group, on the punctured disc admits the structure of an oper. This
result is important in the local geometric Langlands correspondence proposed in
arXiv:math/0508382. Our proof uses certain deformations of the affine Springer
fibers which could be of independent interest. As a byproduct, we construct
representations of affine Weyl groups on the homology of these deformations
generalizing representations constructed by Lusztig.
