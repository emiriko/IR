We report on the development of a new theoretical tool that allows for
isospin projection of Slater determinants and we present its first
applications. In particular, we determine the isospin mixing in ground states
of N=Z nuclei and discuss its dependence on the size of the harmonic-oscillator
basis used in the calculations. We also discuss the unphysical contribution to
the isospin mixing caused by the spurious isospin-symmetry breaking inherent to
the mean-field approach. We show that these contributions may be as large as
30% of the value of the isospin-mixing parameter.
