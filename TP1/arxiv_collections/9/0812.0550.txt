A pronounced uniform polar distortion extending over several unit cells
enables thin LaAlO3 overlayers on SrTiO3(001) to counteract the charge dipole
and thereby neutralize the "polarization catastrophe" that is suggested by
simple ion-counting. This unanticipated mechanism, obtained from density
functional theory calculations, allows several unit cells of the LaAlO3
overlayer to remain insulating (hence, fully ionic). The band gap of the
system, defined by occupied O $2p$ states at the surface and unoccupied Ti 3d
states at the interface in some cases $\sim$20 \AA distant, decreases with
increasing thickness of the LaAlO3-film before an insulator-to-metal transition
and a crossover to an electronic reconstruction occurs at around five
monolayers of LaAlO3.
