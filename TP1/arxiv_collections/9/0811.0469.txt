We describe an algorithm computing the exact value of the mean current, its
variance, and higher order cumulants for stochastic driven systems. The method
uses a Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation expansion of the generating function
of the current, and can be extended to compute covariances of multiple
currents. As an example of application of the method, we give numerical
evidence for a simple relation [Eq.(5)] between the second and the fourth
cumulants of the current in a symmetric exclusion process.
