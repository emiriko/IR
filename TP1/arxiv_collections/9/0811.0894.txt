Beauty production in events containing two muons in the final state has been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 114
pb-1. A low transverse-momentum threshold for muon identification, in
combination with the large rapidity coverage of the ZEUS muon system, gives
access to almost the full phase space for beauty production. The total cross
section for beauty production in ep collisions at sqrt(s)= 318 GeV has been
measured to be sigma_tot(ep -> bbbar X) = 13.9 +- 1.5(stat.) +4.0 -4.3(syst.)
nb. Differential cross sections and a measurement of bbbar correlations are
also obtained, and compared to other beauty cross-section measurements, Monte
Carlo models and next-to-leading-order QCD predictions.
