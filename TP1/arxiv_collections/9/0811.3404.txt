We reconsider the two different facets of $\pi$ and $K$ mesons as $q \bar q$
bound states and approximate Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We address several topics,
including masses, mass splittings between $\pi$ and $\rho$ and between $K$ and
$K^*$, meson wavefunctions, charge radii, and the $K-\pi$ wavefunction overlap.
