We employ the functional renormalization group to study dynamical properties
of the two-dimensional Bose gas. Our approach is free of infrared divergences,
which plague the usual diagrammatic approaches, and is consistent with the
exact Nepomnyashchy identity, which states that the anomalous self-energy
vanishes at zero frequency and momentum. We recover the correct infrared
behavior of the propagators and present explicit results for the spectral
line-shape, from which we extract the quasi-particle dispersion and damping.
