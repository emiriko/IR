We consider a system of nonlinear wave equations with constraints that arises
from the Einstein equations of general relativity and describes the geometry of
the so-called Gowdy symmetric spacetimes on T3. We introduce two numerical
methods, which are based on pseudo-spectral approximation. The first approach
relies on marching in the future time-like direction and toward the coordinate
singularity t=0. The second approach is designed from asymptotic formulas that
are available near this singularity; it evolves the solutions in the past
timelike direction from "final" data given at t=0. This backward method relies
a novel nonlinear transformation, which allows us to reduce the nonlinear
source terms to simple quadratic products of the unknown variables. Numerical
experiments are presented in various regimes, including cases where "spiky"
structures are observed as the coordinate singularity is approached. The
proposed backward strategy leads to a robust numerical method which allows us
to accurately simulate the long-time behavior of a large class of Gowdy
spacetimes.
