In this paper we explore the constraints from B-physics observables in SUSY
models of Minimal Flavor Violation, in the large tan beta regime, for both low
and high scale supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We find that the rare B-decays
b -> s gamma and B_s -> mu+ mu- can be quite sensitive to the scale M at which
supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the visible sector. In the case of
high scale supersymmetry breaking, we show that the additional gluino
contribution to the b -> s gamma and B_s -> mu+ mu- rare decay rates can be
significant for large tan beta, mu and M_3. The constraints on B_u -> tau nu
are relatively insensitive to the precise scale of M. We also consider the
additional constraints from the present direct Higgs searches at the Tevatron
in the inclusive H/A -> tau tau channel, and the latest CDMS direct dark matter
detection experiments. We find that altogether the constraints from B-physics,
Higgs physics and direct dark matter searches can be extremely powerful in
probing regions of SUSY parameter space for low M_A and large tan beta, leading
to a preference for models with a lightest CP-even Higgs mass close to the
current experimental limit. We find interesting regions of parameter space that
satisfy all constraints and can be probed by Higgs searches at the Tevatron and
the LHC and by direct dark matter searches in the near future.
