The factor complexity of the infinite word $\ubeta$ canonically associated to
a non-simple Parry number $\beta$ is studied. Our approach is based on the
notion of special factors introduced by Berstel and Cassaigne. At first, we
give a handy method for determining infinite left special branches; this method
is applicable to a broad class of infinite words which are fixed points of a
primitive substitution. In the second part of the article, we focus on infinite
words $\ubeta$ only. To complete the description of its special factors, we
define and study $(a,b)$-maximal left special factors. This enables us to
characterize non-simple Parry numbers $\beta$ for which the word $\ubeta$ has
affine complexity.
