This work presents a new phenomenological description of QCD vacuum where the
color background field is depicted by a constant parallel vector with amplitude
proportional to $\sigma\sim 0.28 GeV^2$. The familiar Regge relation can be
derived directly in a classic meaning. A new mass formula of hadrons are
conjectured to give a very consistent description of hadron mass spectra. The
lower bounds of the baryon mass are determined to be $\sqrt{3\sigma}$ for
nucleon and $\sqrt{5\sigma}$ for isospin-3/2 baryon. In the meanwhile, the
mass-square differences of $1 {}^3 S_1$ and $1 {}^1 S_0$ meson states are
obtained to be $2 \sigma$. We also predict the mass of the lowest four-quark
state to be $\sqrt{4\sigma}$, which favors the $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ to be
four-quark candidates. On the other hand, the effective heavy quark confinement
potential is a direct result of this model.
