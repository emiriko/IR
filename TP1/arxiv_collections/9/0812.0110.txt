For a test body orbiting an axisymmetric body in Newtonian gravitational
theory with multipole moments Q_L, (and for a charge in a non-relativistic
orbit about a charge distribution with the same multipole moments) we show that
there exists, in addition to the energy and angular momentum component along
the symmetry axis, a conserved quantity analogous to the Carter constant of
Kerr spacetimes in general relativity, if the odd-L moments vanish, and the
even-L moments satisfy Q_2L = m (Q_2/m)^L. Strangely, this is precisely the
relation among mass moments enforced by the no-hair theorems of rotating black
holes. By contrast, if Newtonian gravity is supplemented by a multipolar
gravitomagnetic field, whose leading term represents frame-dragging (or if the
electrostatic field is supplemented by a multipolar magnetic field), we are
unable to find an analogous Carter-like constant. This further highlights the
very special nature of the Kerr geometry of general relativity.
