While quantum computers are capable of simulating many quantum systems
efficiently, the simulation algorithms must begin with the preparation of an
appropriate initial state. We present a method for generating physically
relevant quantum states on a lattice in real space. In particular, the present
algorithm is able to prepare general pure and mixed many-particle states of any
number of particles. It relies on a procedure for converting from a
second-quantized state to its first-quantized counterpart. The algorithm is
efficient in that it operates in time that is polynomial in all the essential
descriptors of the system, such the number of particles, the resolution of the
lattice, and the inverse of the maximum final error. This scaling holds under
the assumption that the wavefunction to be prepared is bounded or its
indefinite integral known and that the Fock operator of the system is
efficiently simulatable.
