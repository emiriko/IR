Quantum computation and communication rely on the ability to manipulate
quantum states robustly and with high fidelity. Thus, some form of error
correction is needed to protect fragile quantum superposition states from
corruption by so-called decoherence noise. Indeed, the discovery of quantum
error correction (QEC) turned the field of quantum information from an academic
curiosity into a developing technology. Here we present a continuous-variable
experimental implementation of a QEC code, based upon entanglement among 9
optical beams. In principle, this 9-wavepacket adaptation of Shor's original
9-qubit scheme allows for full quantum error correction against an arbitrary
single-beam (single-party) error.
