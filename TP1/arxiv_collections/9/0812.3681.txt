(111) Silicon quantum wells have been studied extensively, yet no convincing
explanation exists for the experimentally observed breaking of 6 fold valley
degeneracy into 2 and 4 fold degeneracies. Here, systematic sp3d5s*
tight-binding and effective mass calculations are presented to show that a
typical miscut modulates the energy levels which leads to breaking of 6 fold
valley degeneracy into 2 lower and 4 raised valleys. An effective mass based
valley-projection model is used to determine the directions of valley-minima in
tight-binding calculations of large supercells. Tight-binding calculations are
in better agreement with experiments compared to effective mass calculations.
