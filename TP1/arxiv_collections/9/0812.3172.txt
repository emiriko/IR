We compute the two-point functions of the scalar and graviton in a Coleman-De
Luccia type instanton background in general dimensions. These are analytically
continued to Lorentzian signature. We write the correlator in a form convenient
for examining the "holographic" properties of this background inspired by the
work of Freivogel, Sekino, Susskind and Yeh(FSSY). Based on this, we speculate
on what kind of boundary theory we would have on this background if we assume
that there exists a holographic duality.
