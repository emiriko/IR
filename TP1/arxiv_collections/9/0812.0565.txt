This (withdrawn) creative essay intended to consider the appearance of time's
arrow in a fully symmetric universe compatible with "pilot wave" or
transactional interpretations (D. Bohm or J.G. Kramer, respectively). The
(unstated) hypothesis was that, despite unitary time evolution, the inherent
Hilbert transform operator found in the energy operator of the Schrodinger
equation and in commutation relations of Fourier observables indicates
dissipation and seemingly, entropy increase.
