Strong 1D lattices usually lead to unconnected two-dimensional gases. The
long-range character of the dipole-dipole interactions leads to a novel
scenario where non-overlapping gases at different sites may interact
significantly. We show that the excitations of non-overlapping condensates in
1D optical lattices acquire a band-like character, being collectively shared by
different sites. In particular, the hybridization of the modes significantly
enhances the rotonization of the excitations, and may induce roton-instability.
We discuss the observability of this effect in on-going experiments.
