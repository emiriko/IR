The propagation invariance of Bessel beams as well as their transversal
structure are used to perform a comparative analysis of their effect on cold
atoms for four different configurations and combinations thereof. We show that,
even at temperatures for which the classical description of the atom center of
mass motion is valid, the interchange of momentum, energy and orbital angular
momentum between light and atoms yields efficient tools for all-optical
trapping, transporting and, in general, manipulating the state of motion of
cold atoms.
