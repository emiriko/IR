We study the properties of strange and charm mesons in hot and dense matter
within a self-consistent coupled-channel approach for the experimental
conditions of density and temperature expected for the CBM experiment at
FAIR/GSI. The in-medium solution at finite temperature accounts for Pauli
blocking effects, mean-field binding on all the baryons involved, and meson
self-energies. In the strange sector, the $\bar K$ spectral function spreads
over a wide range of energies, reflecting the melting of the $\Lambda (1405)$
resonance and the contribution of $(\Lambda,\Sigma,\Sigma^*)N^{-1}$ components
at finite temperature. In the case of charm mesons, the dynamically-generated
$\Lambda_c(2593)$ and $\Sigma_c(2880)$ resonances remain close to their
free-space position while acquiring a remarkable width. As a result, the $D$
meson spectral density shows a single pronounced peak for energies close to the
$D$ meson free-space mass that broadens with increasing matter density with an
extended tail particularly towards lower energies. We also discuss the
implications for the $D_{s0}(2317)$, $D_0(2400)$ and the predicted X(3700)
resonances at FAIR energies.
