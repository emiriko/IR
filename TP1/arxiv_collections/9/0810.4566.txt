$J/\psi$ production at forward and midrapidity at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion
Collider (RHIC) is calculated within a previously constructed rate-equation
approach accounting for both direct production and regeneration from $c$ and
$\bar c$. The results are compared to experimental data. The observed stronger
suppression at forward rapidity can be qualitatively explained by a smaller
statistical regeneration component together with stronger cold nuclear matter
induced suppression compared to midrapidity. The $\chi_c$ over $J/\psi$ ratio
and $\psi'$ over $J/\psi$ ratio are also calculated.
