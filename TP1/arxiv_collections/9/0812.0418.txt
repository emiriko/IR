Some unique source -- the world, W -- must underlie all the information
realized in the universe throughout time. Perceived reality, R, is a
progressively emerging representation of W in the form of the geometrical
universe. Time corresponds to the process of emergence. When first represented
in R, information about W is expressed in a non-localized, quantum manner. As
the emergence proceeds, most information becomes inaccessible (entropy),
supporting the robust, redundant encoding of accessible records. The past is
encoded in and inferred from present records; the anticipated future will
preserve present information and reveal unpredictable new information about W.
Emergence of the future demands non-unitary reduction of quantum states and
increased Kolmogorov complexity of the quasi-classical records in terms of
which the quantum states are known. Given the limited information content of
records, the quasi-classical universe lacks fine details; whereas the future
must be uncertain to admit new information.
