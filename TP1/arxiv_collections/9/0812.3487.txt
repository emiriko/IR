Many real-world networks have broad degree distributions. For some systems,
this means that the functional significance of the vertices is also broadly
distributed, in other cases the vertices are equally significant, but in
different ways. One example of the latter case is metabolic networks, where the
high-degree vertices -- the currency metabolites -- supply the molecular groups
to the low-degree metabolites, and the latter are responsible for the
higher-order biological function, of vital importance to the organism. In this
paper, we propose a generalization of currency metabolites to currency
vertices. We investigate the network structural characteristics of such
systems, both in model networks and in some empirical systems. In addition to
metabolic networks, we find that a network of music collaborations and a
network of e-mail exchange could be described by a division of the vertices
into currency vertices and others.
