Recently a test of nonclassicality for a single qubit was proposed [R. Alicki
and N. Van Ryn, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 41, 062001 (2008)]. We present an
optimized experimental realization of this test leading to a 46 standard
deviation violation of classicality. This factor of 5 improvement over our
previous result was achieved by moving from the infrared to the visible where
we can take advantage of higher efficiency and lower noise photon detectors.
