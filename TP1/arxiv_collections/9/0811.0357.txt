From the radiation balance diagram illustrating the IPCC reports one can
estimate the power received by Earth from the sun at Pin = 342 W/m2 and the
power consumed, remitted and reflected by the earth and its atmosphere at Pout
= 599 kW/m2. It seems that the earth emits more power than it receives. The
earth s ground mean temperature is estimated at 15 C. A calculation based on
the black body radiation theory gives an earth s ground mean temperature of the
order of -18 C which is much lower than 15 C. The important gap between these
calculated and estimated temperature mean values requires an explanation. Here
we show that a gray body separated from vacuum by an interface and submitted to
outside incident radiation can behave like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier.
The Earth which is a gray body separated from the space by an interface,
behaves like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. The balance of the energy
exchanged between Earth and outer space is reconsidered and the 15 C Earth s
ground temperature mean value is then derived. Our result revives the
discussion on the parameters that control the Earth climate. The solar and
terrestrial radiation reflection coefficients by the earth and its atmosphere
acquire a privileged role. The Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier can be a
starting point to improve the energy use. The materials having the adequate
reflection coefficients will be indicated for specific applications.
