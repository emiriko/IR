We present auroral evidence for multiple and, most probably, small scale
reconnection in the near Earth magnetospheric plasma sheet current layer during
auroral activity. Hall currents as the source of upward and downward
field-aligned currents require generation of the corresponding electron fluxes.
The auroral spatial ordering in a multiple sequence of these fluxes requires
the assumption of the existence of several -- and possibly -- even many
tailward reconnection sites.
