We investigate the effects of vacancies, disorder and sublattice polarization
on the electronic properties of a monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall
regime. Energy spectra as a function of magnetic field and the localization
properties of the states within the graphene Landau levels (LLs) are calculated
through a tight-binding model. We first discuss our results considering
vacancies in the lattice, where we show that vacancies introduce extra levels
(or well-defined bands) between consecutive LLs. An striking consequence here
is that extra Hall resistance plateaus are expected to emerge when an organized
vacancy superlattice is considered. Secondly, we discuss the anomalous
localization properties we have found for the lowest LL, where an increasing
disorder is shown to enhance the wave functions delocalization (instead of
inducing localization). This unexpected effect is shown to be directly related
to the way disorder increasingly destroys the sublattice (valley) polarization
of the states in the lowest LL. The reason why this anomalous disorder effect
occurs only for the zero-energy LL is that, in absence of disorder, only for
this level all the states are sublattice polarized, i.e., their wave functions
have amplitudes in only one of the sublattices.
