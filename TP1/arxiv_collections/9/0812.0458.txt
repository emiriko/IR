By improving the experimental conditions and extensive data accumulation, we
have achieved very high-precision in the measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen
effect in the underdoped high-temperature superconductor
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.5}$. We find that the main oscillation, so far believed
to be single-frequency, is composed of three closely spaced frequencies. We
attribute this to bilayer splitting and warping of a single quasi-2D Fermi
surface, indicating that \emph{c}-axis coherence is restored at low temperature
in underdoped cuprates. Our results do not support the existence of a larger
frequency of the order of 1650 T reported recently in the same compound [S.E.
