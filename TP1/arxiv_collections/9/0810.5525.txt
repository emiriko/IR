The generalised deformed su_{q}(2) model is applied to 79 superdeformed bands
in the region A~190. The transition energies and the moments of inertia are
calculated within the model, Its validity is investigated by comparing it with
the experimental data. Both the standard su_{q}(2) and the generalized one fail
to account for the uprising and the downturn of the dynamic moment of inertia.
Both models, however, show remarkable agreement with the available experimental
data at low angular frequancy (hw <= 0.25MeV).
