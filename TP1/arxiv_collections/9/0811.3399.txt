This paper reports on photoionisation loading based on ultrafast pulses of
singly-ionised strontium ions in a linear Paul trap. We take advantage of an
autoionising resonance of Sr neutral atoms to form Sr+ by two-photon absorption
of femtosecond pulses at a wavelength of 431nm. We compare this technique to
electron-bombardment ionisation and observe several advantages of
photoionisation. It actually allows the loading of a pure Sr+ ion cloud in a
low radio-frequency voltage amplitude regime. In these conditions up to 4x10^4
laser-cooled Sr+ ions were trapped.
