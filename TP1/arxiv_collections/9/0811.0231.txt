A freely cooling granular gas with velocity dependent restitution coefficient
is studied in one dimension. The restitution coefficient becomes near elastic
when the relative velocity of the colliding particles is less than a velocity
scale $\delta$. Different statistical quantities namely density distribution,
occupied and empty cluster length distributions, and spatial density and
velocity correlation functions, are obtained using event driven molecular
dynamic simulations. We compare these with the corresponding quantities of the
sticky gas (inelastic gas with zero coefficient of restitution). We find that
in the inhomogeneous cooling regime, for times smaller than a crossover time
$t_1$ where $t_1 \sim \delta^{-1}$, the behaviour of the granular gas is
equivalent to that of the sticky gas. When $\delta \rt 0$, then $t_1 \rt
\infty$ and hence, the results support an earlier claim that the freely cooling
inelastic gas is described by the inviscid Burgers equation. For a real
granular gas with finite $\delta$, the existence of the time scale $t_1$ shows
that, for large times, the granular gas is not described by the inviscid
Burgers equation.
