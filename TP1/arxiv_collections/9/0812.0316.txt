In systems characterized by a rough potential energy landscape, local
energetic minima and saddles define a network of metastable states whose
topology strongly influences the dynamics. Changes in temperature, causing the
merging and splitting of metastable states, have non trivial effects on such
networks and must be taken into account. We do this by means of a recently
proposed renormalization procedure. This method is applied to analyze the
topology of the network of metastable states for different polypeptidic
sequences in a minimalistic polymer model. A smaller spectral dimension emerges
as a hallmark of stability of the global energy minimum and highlights a
non-obvious link between dynamic and thermodynamic properties.
