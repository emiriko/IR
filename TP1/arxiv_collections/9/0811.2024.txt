These lectures stress the theoretical elements that underlie a wide range of
phenomenological studies of high-energy QCD, which include both soft and hard
processes. After a brief introduction to the basics of QCD, various aspects of
QCD-based phenomenology are covered: colour transparency, hadronization of
colour charges, Regge phenomenology, parton model, Bjorken scaling and its
violation, DGLAP evolution equation, BFKL formalism, GLR-MQ evolution equation
and saturation. In the last part of the lecture, we employ the light-cone
dipole formalism to describe deep inelastic lepton scattering, Drell-Yan
processes, direct photon production, diffraction, quark and gluon shadowing in
nuclei, the Cronin effect and nuclear broadening.
