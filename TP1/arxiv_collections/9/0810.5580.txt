Results are presented on event-by-event fluctuations of transverse momenta
$p_T$ in central Pb+Pb interactions at 20$A$, 30$A$, 40$A$, 80$A$, and 158$A$
GeV. The analysis was performed for charged particles at forward center-of-mass
rapidity ($1.1 < y^{*}_{\pi} < 2.6$). Three fluctuation measures were studied:
the distribution of average transverse momentum - $M(p_T)$ - in the event, the
$\Phi_{p_{T}}$ fluctuation measure and two-particle transverse momentum
correlations. Fluctuations of $p_T$ are small and show no significant energy
dependence in the energy range of the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. Results
are compared with QCD-inspired predictions for the critical point, and with the
UrQMD model. Transverse momentum fluctuations, similar to multiplicity
fluctuations, do not show the increase expected for freeze-out near the
critical point of QCD.
