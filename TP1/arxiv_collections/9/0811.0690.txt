An interesting aspect in the research of complex (dusty) plasmas is the
experimental study of the interaction of micro-particles with the surrounding
plasma for diagnostic purposes. Local electric fields can be determined from
the behaviour of particles in the plasma, e.g. particles may serve as
electrostatic probes. Since in many cases of applications in plasma technology
it is of great interest to describe the electric field conditions in front of
floating or biased surfaces, the confinement and behaviour of test particles is
studied in front of floating walls inserted into a plasma as well as in front
of additionally biased surfaces. For the latter case, the behaviour of
particles in front of an adaptive electrode, which allows for an efficient
confinement and manipulation of the grains, has been experimentally studied in
dependence on the discharge parameters and on different bias conditions of the
electrode. The effect of the partially biased surface (dc, rf) on the charged
micro-particles has been investigated by particle falling experiments. In
addition to the experiments we also investigate the particle behaviour
numerically by molecular dynamics, in combination with a fluid and
particle-in-cell description of the plasma.
