Here it is shown that a radial magnetic field leads to rotation of a Bose
condensed exciton cloud due to Aharonov-Bohm effect for an electron and a hole
forming an exciton. As in the case of mechanical rotation of superfluids,
rotation is accompanied by penetration of vortices into the cloud at some
critical magnetic field. Penetration of vortices strongly affects the total
intensity and the angular distribution of photoluminescence from the exciton
cloud. This effect can be used for an effective experimental manifestation of
exciton Bose condensation.
