We investigate ground-state properties of interacting two-component Bose
gases in a hard-wall trap using both the Bethe ansatz and exact numerical
diagonalization method. For equal intra- and inter-atomic interaction, the
system is exactly solvable. Thus the exact ground state wavefunction and
density distributions for the whole interacting regime can be obtained from the
Bethe ansatz solutions. Since the ground state is a degenerate state with total
spin S=N/2, the total density distribution are same for each degenerate state.
The total density distribution evolves from a Gauss-like Bose distribution to a
Fermi-like one as the repulsive interaction increases. The distribution of each
component is N_i/N of the total density distribution. This is approximately
true even in the experimental situation. In addition the numerical results show
that with the increase of interspecies interaction the distributions of two
Tonks-Girardeau gases exhibit composite fermionization crossover with each
component developing N peaks in the strongly interacting regime.
