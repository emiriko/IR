We study Voronoi diagrams for distance functions that add together two convex
functions, each taking as its argument the difference between Cartesian
coordinates of two planar points. When the functions do not grow too quickly,
then the Voronoi diagram has linear complexity and can be constructed in
near-linear randomized expected time. Additionally, the level sets of the
distances from the sites form a family of pseudocircles in the plane, all cells
in the Voronoi diagram are connected, and the set of bisectors separating any
one cell in the diagram from each of the others forms an arrangement of
pseudolines in the plane. We apply these results to the smoothed distance or
biotope transform metric, a geometric analogue of the Jaccard distance whose
Voronoi diagrams can be used to determine the dilation of a star network with a
given hub. For sufficiently closely spaced points in the plane, the Voronoi
diagram of smoothed distance has linear complexity and can be computed
efficiently. We also experiment with a variant of Lloyd's algorithm, adapted to
smoothed distance, to find uniformly spaced point samples with exponentially
decreasing density around a given point.
