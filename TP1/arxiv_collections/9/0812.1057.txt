We investigate the possibility of using icosahedral symmetry as a family
symmetry group in the lepton sector. The rotational icosahedral group, which is
isomorphic to A5, the alternating group of five elements, provides a natural
context in which to explore (among other possibilities) the intriguing
hypothesis that the solar neutrino mixing angle is governed by the golden
ratio. We present a basic toolbox for model-building using icosahedral
symmetry, including explicit representation matrices and tensor product rules.
As a simple application, we construct a minimal model at tree level in which
the solar angle is related to the golden ratio, the atmospheric angle is
maximal, and the reactor angle vanishes to leading order. The approach provides
a rich setting in which to investigate the flavor puzzle of the Standard Model.
