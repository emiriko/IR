We introduce an improved version of rational equivalence in tropical
intersection theory which can be seen as a replacement of chapter 8 of our
previous article arXiv:0709.3705v2. Using this new definition, rational
equivalence is compatible with push-forwards of cycles. Moreover, we prove that
every tropical cycle in R^r is equivalent to a uniquely determined affine
cycle, called its degree.
