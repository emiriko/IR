We show that the dynamics of automorphisms on all projective complex
manifolds X (of dimension 3, or of any dimension but assuming the Good Minimal
Model Program or Mori's Program) are canonically built up from the dynamics on
just three types of projective complex manifolds: complex tori, weak Calabi-Yau
manifolds and rationally connected manifolds. As a by-product, we confirm the
conjecture of Guedj for automorphisms on 3-dimensional projective manifolds,
and also determine pi_1(X).
