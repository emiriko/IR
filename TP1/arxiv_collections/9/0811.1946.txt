We study the class N of graphs, the right-angled Artin groups defined on
which do not contain surface subgroups. We prove that a presumably smaller
class N' is closed under amalgamating along complete subgraphs, and also under
adding bisimplicial edges. It follows that chordal graphs and chordal bipartite
graphs belong to N'.
