Synchronization control in arrays of identical output-coupled continuous-time
linear systems is studied. Sufficiency of new conditions for the existence of a
synchronizing feedback law are analyzed. It is shown that for neutrally stable
systems that are detectable form their outputs, a linear feedback law exists
under which any number of coupled systems synchronize provided that the
(directed, weighted) graph describing the interconnection is fixed and
connected. An algorithm generating one such feedback law is presented. It is
also shown that for critically unstable systems detectability is not
sufficient, whereas full-state coupling is, for the existence of a linear
feedback law that is synchronizing for all connected coupling configurations.
