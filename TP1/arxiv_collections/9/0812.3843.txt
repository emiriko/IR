We propose a model for $D^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+$ decays following
experimental results which indicate that the two-pion interaction in the
$S$-wave is dominated by the scalar resonances $f_0(600)/\sigma$ and
$f_0(980)$. The weak decay amplitude for $D^+\to R \pi^+$, where $R$ is a
resonance that subsequently decays into $\pi^+\pi^-$, is constructed in a
factorization approach. In the $S$-wave, we implement the strong decay $R\to
\pi^-\pi^+$ by means of a scalar form factor. This provides a unitary
description of the pion-pion interaction in the entire kinematically allowed
mass range $m_{\pi\pi}^2$ from threshold to about 3 GeV$^2$. In order to
reproduce the experimental Dalitz plot for $\Dppp$, we include contributions
beyond the $S$-wave. For the $P$-wave, dominated by the $\rho(770)^0$, we use a
Breit-Wigner description. Higher waves are accounted for by using the usual
isobar prescription for the $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)^0$. The major
achievement is a good reproduction of the experimental $m_{\pi\pi}^2$
distribution, and of the partial as well as the total $\Dppp$ branching ratios.
Our values are generally smaller than the experimental ones. We discuss this
shortcoming and, as a byproduct, we predict a value for the poorly known $D\to
\sigma$ transition form factor at $q^2=m_\pi^2$.
