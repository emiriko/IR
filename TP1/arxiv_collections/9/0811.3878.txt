The advances in Charge Coupled Devices in one hand and the high resolution
measurements of holographic technique on the other hand, we have adopted the
method of digital real-time holographic interferometry for the diagnostics of
high density plasma. The measured values of plasma electron density agree with
the measurements from other techniques.
