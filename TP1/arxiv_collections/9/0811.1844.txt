We propose a scheme for performing quantum simulations with atoms in cavities
based on a photon detection feedback loop that requires only linear optical
elements. Atoms can be stored individually without the need of directly
interacting with one another. The scheme is able to simulate any time evolution
that can be written as a sum of two-qubit Hamiltonians, .e.g., any next
neighbor interaction on a lattice. It can also be made robust against photon
losses.
