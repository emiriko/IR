We investigate the impact of finite volume effects on the critical number of
flavours, N_f^c, for chiral symmetry restoration in QED3. To this end we solve
a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations on a torus. For order parameters
such as the anomalous dimension of the fermion wave function or the chiral
condensate we find substantial evidence for a large dependence on the volume.
We observe a shift in N_f^c from values in the range of 3.61 \le N_f^c \le 3.84
in the infinite volume/continuum limit down to values below N_f \le 1.5 at
finite volumes in agreement with earlier results of Gusynin and Reenders in a
simpler truncation scheme. These findings explain discrepancies in N_f^c
between continuum and lattice studies.
