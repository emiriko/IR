In recent decades there has been a resurge of interest in the foundations of
quantum theory, partly motivated by new experimental techniques, partly by the
emerging field of quantum information science. Old questions, asked since the
seminal article by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR), are being revisited. The
work of John Bell has changed the direction of investigation by recognising
that those fundamental philosophical questions can have, after all, input from
experiment. Abner Shimony has aptly termed this new field of enquiry
"experimental metaphysics". The objective of this Thesis is to contribute to
that body of research, by formalising old concepts, proposing new ones, and
finding new results in well-studied areas. Without losing from sight that the
appeal of experimental metaphysics comes from the adjective, every major result
is followed by clear experimental proposals for quantum-atom optical setups.
