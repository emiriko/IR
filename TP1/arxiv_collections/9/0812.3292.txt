We have designed and realized a prototype that implements a
continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol based on coherent states
and reverse reconciliation. The system uses time and polarization multiplexing
for optimal transmission and detection of the signal and phase reference, and
employs sophisticated error-correction codes for reconciliation. The security
of the system is guaranteed against general coherent eavesdropping attacks. The
performance of the prototype was tested over preinstalled optical fibres as
part of a quantum cryptography network combining different quantum key
distribution technologies. The stable and automatic operation of the prototype
over 57 hours yielded an average secret key distribution rate of 8 kbit/s over
a 3 dB loss optical fibre, including the key extraction process and all quantum
and classical communication. This system is therefore ideal for securing
communications in metropolitan size networks with high speed requirements.
