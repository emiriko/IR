In this paper, a model for understanding the effects of selection using
systems- level computational approaches is introduced. A number of concepts and
principles essential for understanding the motivation for constructing the
model will be introduced first. This will be followed by a description of
parameters, measurements, and graphical representations used in the model. Four
possible outcomes for this model are then introduced and described. In
addition, the relationship of relative fitness to selection is described.
Finally, the consequences and potential lessons learned from the model are
discussed.
