We find an exact spin liquid state without time reversal symmetry on the
kagome lattice with odd number of electrons per unit cell and explicit wave
functions for all eigenstates. We also obtain that all spin-spin correlations
are zero except trivial cases. We then show that there are anyonic excitations
in our model. Finally, we demonstrate the existence of ground state degeneracy
and gapless edge states indicating nontrivial topological order in our model.
We also label all eiginstates on torus by local and global string operators.
