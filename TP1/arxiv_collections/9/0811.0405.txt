We present a method for accurately predicting the long time popularity of
online content from early measurements of user access. Using two content
sharing portals, Youtube and Digg, we show that by modeling the accrual of
views and votes on content offered by these services we can predict the
long-term dynamics of individual submissions from initial data. In the case of
Digg, measuring access to given stories during the first two hours allows us to
forecast their popularity 30 days ahead with remarkable accuracy, while
downloads of Youtube videos need to be followed for 10 days to attain the same
performance. The differing time scales of the predictions are shown to be due
to differences in how content is consumed on the two portals: Digg stories
quickly become outdated, while Youtube videos are still found long after they
are initially submitted to the portal. We show that predictions are more
accurate for submissions for which attention decays quickly, whereas
predictions for evergreen content will be prone to larger errors.
