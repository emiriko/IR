A direct fit of the isoscalar spin-orbit and both isoscalar and isovector
tensor coupling constants to the f5/2-f7/2 SO splittings in 40Ca, 56Ni, and
48Ca requires: (i) a significant reduction of the standard isoscalar spin-orbit
strength and (ii) strong attractive tensor coupling constants. The aim of this
paper is to address the consequences of these strong attractive tensor and weak
spin-orbit fields on total binding energies, two-neutron separation energies
and nuclear deformability.
