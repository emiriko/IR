A broad continuum-like spin excitation (1--10 meV) with a peak structure
around 2.4 meV has been observed in the ferroelectric $ab$ spiral spin phase of
Gd$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ by using terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy.
Based on a complete set of light-polarization measurements, we identify the
spin excitation active for the light $E$ vector only along the a-axis, which
grows in intensity with lowering temperature even from above the magnetic
ordering temperature but disappears upon the transition to the $A$-type
antiferromagnetic phase. Such an electric-dipole active spin excitation as
observed at THz frequencies can be ascribed to the two-magnon excitation in
terms of the unique polarization selection rule in a variety of the
magnetically ordered phases.
