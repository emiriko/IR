In light of recent analyses that have shown that nontrivial hidden-sector
dynamics in models of supersymmetry breaking can lead to a significant impact
on the predicted low-energy supersymmetric spectrum, we extend these studies to
consider hidden-sector effects in extensions of the MSSM to include a seesaw
model for neutrino masses. A dynamical hidden sector in an interval of mass
scales below the seesaw scale would yield renormalization-group running
involving both the anomalous dimension from the hidden sector and the
seesaw-extended MSSM renormalization group equations (RGEs). These effects
interfere in general, altering the generational mixing of the sleptons, and
allowing for a substantial change to the expected level of charged-lepton
flavour violation in seesaw-extended MSSM models. These results provide further
support for recent theoretical observations that knowledge of the hidden sector
is required in order to make concrete low-energy predictions, if the hidden
sector is strongly coupled. In particular, hidden-sector dynamics may impact
our ability to reconstruct the supersymmetric seesaw parameters from low-energy
observations.
