The remarkable sensitivity of the c-axis resistivity and magnetoresistance in
cuprates to the spin ordering is used to clarify the doping-induced
transformation from an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator to a superconducting
(SC) metal in RBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} (R = Lu, Y) single crystals. The established
phase diagram demonstrates that the AF and SC regions apparently overlap: the
superconductivity in RBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}, in contrast to La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4, sets
in before the long-range AF order is completely destroyed by hole doping.
Magnetoresistance measurements of superconducting crystals with low T_c<15-20 K
give a clear view of the magnetic-field induced superconductivity suppression
and recovery of the long-range AF state. What still remains to be understood is
whether the AF order actually persists in the SC state or just revives when the
superconductivity is suppressed, and, in the former case, whether the
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity reside in nanoscopically separated
phases or coexist on an atomic scale.
