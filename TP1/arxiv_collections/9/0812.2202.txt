The two major approaches to sparse recovery are L1-minimization and greedy
methods. Recently, Needell and Vershynin developed Regularized Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (ROMP) that has bridged the gap between these two approaches.
ROMP is the first stable greedy algorithm providing uniform guarantees.
  Even more recently, Needell and Tropp developed the stable greedy algorithm
Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit (CoSaMP). CoSaMP provides uniform
guarantees and improves upon the stability bounds and RIC requirements of ROMP.
CoSaMP offers rigorous bounds on computational cost and storage. In many cases,
the running time is just O(NlogN), where N is the ambient dimension of the
signal. This review summarizes these major advances.
