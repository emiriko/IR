The exclusive $\pi\pi$ and $\rho\pi$ production in hard $\gamma^{\ast}\gamma$
scattering in the forward kinematical region where the virtual photon is highly
off-shell is studied using the $\gamma\to\pi^-$ Transition Distribution
Amplitudes obtained in realistic models for the pion. For $\rho\pi$ production
we confirm the previous estimates before QCD evolution. Nevertheless, once
evolution is taken into account this cross section grows one order of
magnitude. In the case of $\pi\pi$ production we have evaluated the cross
section including the pion pole contribution. We observe that this contribution
is responsible for an enhancement of two orders of magnitude with respect to
the cross section evaluated without the pion pole term.
