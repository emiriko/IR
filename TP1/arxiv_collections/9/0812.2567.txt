In this paper, we consider the Shapley network design game on undirected
networks. In this game, we have an edge weighted undirected network $G(V,E)$
and $n$ selfish players where player $i$ wants to choose a path from source
vertex $s_i$ to destination vertex $t_i$. The cost of each edge is equally
split among players who pass it. The price of stability is defined as the ratio
of the cost of the best Nash equilibrium to that of the optimal solution. We
present an $O(\log n/\log\log n)$ upper bound on price of stability for the
single sink case, i.e, $t_i=t$ for all $i$.
