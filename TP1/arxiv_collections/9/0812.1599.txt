The effects of policy sharing between agents in a multi-agent dynamical
system has not been studied extensively. I simulate a system of agents
optimizing the same task using reinforcement learning, to study the effects of
different population densities and policy sharing. I demonstrate that sharing
policies decreases the time to reach asymptotic behavior, and results in
improved asymptotic behavior.
