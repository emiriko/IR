In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 170502 (2007); quant-ph/0703227],
Chandran and coworkers study the entanglement properties of valence bond (VB)
states. Their main result is that VB states do not contain (or only an
insignificant amount of) two-site entanglement, whereas they possess multi-body
entanglement. Two examples ("RVB gas and liquid") are given to illustrate this
claim, which essentially comes from a lower bound derived for spin correlators
in VB states. We show in this Comment that (i) for the "RVB liquid" on the
square lattice, the calculations and conclusions of Chandran et al. are
incorrect. (ii) A simple analytical calculation gives the exact value of the
correlator for the "RVB gas", showing that the bound found by Chandran et al.
is tight. (iii) The lower bound for spin correlators in VB states is equivalent
to a celebrated result of Anderson dating from more than 50 years ago.
