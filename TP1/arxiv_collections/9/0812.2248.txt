We investigate an interacting particle system inspired by the gypsy moth,
whose populations grow until they become sufficiently dense so that an epidemic
reduces them to a low level. We consider this process on a random 3-regular
graph and on the $d$-dimensional lattice and torus, with $d\geq2$. On the
finite graphs with global dispersal or with a dispersal radius that grows with
the number of sites, we prove convergence to a dynamical system that is chaotic
for some parameter values. We conjecture that on the infinite lattice with a
fixed finite dispersal distance, distant parts of the lattice oscillate out of
phase so there is a unique nontrivial stationary distribution.
