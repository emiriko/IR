We study the effect of interference between the Standard Model Higgs boson
resonance and the continuum background in the process gamma gamma -> H -> b
b-bar at a photon collider. Taking into account virtual gluon exchange between
the final-state quarks, we calculate the leading corrections to the height of
the resonance for the case of a light (m_H < 160 GeV) Higgs boson. We find that
the interference is destructive and around 0.1--0.2% of the peak height,
depending on the mass of the Higgs and the scattering angle. This suppression
is smaller by an order of magnitude than the anticipated experimental accuracy
at a photon collider. However, the fractional suppression can be significantly
larger if the Higgs coupling to b quarks is increased by physics beyond the
Standard Model.
