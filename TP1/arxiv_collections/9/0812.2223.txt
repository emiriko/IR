We study natural families of d-bar operators on the moduli space of stable
parabolic vector bundles. Applying a families index theorem for hyperbolic cusp
operators from our previous work, we find formulae for the Chern characters of
the associated index bundles. The contributions from the cusps are explicitly
expressed in terms of the Chern characters of natural vector bundles related to
the parabolic structure. We show that our result implies formulae for the Chern
classes of the associated determinant bundles consistent with a result of
Takhtajan and Zograf.
