We calculate, with several corrections, the non-relativistic binding by Higgs
exchange and gluon exchange between six top and six anti-top quarks (actually
replaced by left-handed b quarks from time to time). The remarkable result is
that, within our calculational accuracy of the order of 14% in the top quark
Yukawa coupling g_t, the experimental running top-quark Yukawa coupling g_t =
0.935 happens to have just that value which gives a perfect cancellation of the
unbound mass = 12 top-quark masses by this binding energy. In other words the
bound state is massless to the accuracy of our calculation. Our calculation is
in disagreement with a similar calculation by Kuchiev et al., but this
deviation may be explained by a phase transition. We and Kuchiev et al. compute
on different sides of this phase transition.
