For coherent electron spins, hyperfine coupling to nuclei in the host
material can either be a dominant source of unwanted spin decoherence or, if
controlled effectively, a resource allowing storage and retrieval of quantum
information. To investigate the effect of a controllable nuclear environment on
the evolution of confined electron spins, we have fabricated and measured
gate-defined double quantum dots with integrated charge sensors made from
single-walled carbon nanotubes with a variable concentration of 13C (nuclear
spin I=1/2) among the majority zero-nuclear-spin 12C atoms. Spin-sensitive
transport in double-dot devices grown using methane with the natural abundance
(~ 1%) of 13C is compared with similar devices grown using an enhanced (~99%)
concentration of 13C. We observe strong isotope effects in spin-blockaded
transport, and from the dependence on external magnetic field, estimate the
hyperfine coupling in 13C nanotubes to be on the order of 100 micro-eV, two
orders of magnitude larger than anticipated theoretically. 13C-enhanced
nanotubes are an interesting new system for spin-based quantum information
processing and memory, with nuclei that are strongly coupled to gate-controlled
electrons, differ from nuclei in the substrate, are naturally confined to one
dimension, lack quadrupolar coupling, and have a readily controllable
concentration from less than one to 10^5 per electron.
