Magnetic phase transitions in multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) induced
by magnetic field, epitaxial strain, and composition modification are
considered. These transitions from a spatially modulated spin spiral state to a
homogenous antiferromagnetic one are accompanied by the release of latent
magnetization and a linear magnetoelectric effect that makes BiFeO3-based
materials efficient room-temperature single phase multiferroics.
