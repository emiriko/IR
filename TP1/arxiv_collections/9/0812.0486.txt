We consider some well-known families of two-player, zero-sum, perfect
information games that can be viewed as special cases of Shapley's stochastic
games. We show that the following tasks are polynomial time equivalent:
  - Solving simple stochastic games.
  - Solving stochastic mean-payoff games with rewards and probabilities given
in unary. - Solving stochastic mean-payoff games with rewards and probabilities
given in binary.
