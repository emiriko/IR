We apply the supergraph with spurion technique to compute the renormalization
of one-loop diagrams that contributes to electron and selectron self energies
in a softly broken Supersymmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED). In
particular, we calculate the one-loop gauge superfield contribution to the
two-point function.
