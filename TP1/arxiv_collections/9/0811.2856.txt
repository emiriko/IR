We present a new formulation of the time-dependent self-interaction
correction (TDSIC). It is derived variationally obeying explicitly the
constraints on orthonormality of the occupied single-particle orbitals. The
thus emerging rather involved symmetry condition amongst the orbitals is dealt
with using two separate sets of (occupied) single-particle wavefunctions,
related by a unitary transformation. The double-set TDSIC scheme is well suited
for numerical implementation. We present results for laser-excited dynamics in
a 1D model for a molecule and in fully fledged 3D calculations.
