It is shown that operator-selfdecomposable measures, or more precisely their
Urbanik decomposability semigroups, induce generalized Mehler semigroups of
bounded linear operators. Moreover, those semigroups can be represented as
random integrals of operator valued functions with respect to stochastic L\'evy
processes. Our Banach space setting is in the contrast with the Hilbert spaces
on which so far and most often the generalized Mehler semigroups were studied.
Furthermore, we give new proofs of the random integral representation.
