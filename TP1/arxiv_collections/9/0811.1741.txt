In order to understand a boundary description of Hawking radiation in the
AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the trace anomaly method in AdS$_2$
space. In this method, Hawking radiation is derived from the trace anomaly of
the energy-momentum tensor in the bulk. We find a correspondence between the
energy-momentum tensor and a composite operator in CFT$_1$ and understand the
anomalous properties of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of this composite
operator. By using this correspondence, we reproduce Hawking radiation from the
boundary description. In addition, we find a correspondence between higher-spin
currents in the bulk and composite operators in the boundary.
