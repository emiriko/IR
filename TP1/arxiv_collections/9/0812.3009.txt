This paper deals with the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system in a bounded spatial
domain. We study the existence of solutions having a specific form, namely
standing waves in equilibrium with a purely electrostatic field. We prescribe
Dirichlet boundary conditions on the matter field, and either Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary conditions on the electric potential.
