We study a classical fully-frustrated honeycomb lattice Ising model using
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and exact calculations . The Hamiltonian
realizes a degenerate ground state manifold of equal-energy states, where each
hexagonal plaquette of the lattice has one and only one frustrated bond, with
an extensive residual entropy that grows as the number of spins N. Traditional
single-spin flip Monte Carlo methods fail to sample all possible spin
configurations in this ground state efficiently, due to their separation by
large energy barriers. We develop a non-local "chain-flip" algorithm that
solves this problem, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the Ising Hamiltonian
with and without perturbative interactions. The two perturbations considered
are a slightly weakened bond, and an external magnetic field h. For some cases,
the chain-flip move is necessary for the simulation to find an ordered ground
state. In the case of the magnetic field, two magnetized ground states with
non-extensive entropy are found, and two special values of h exist where the
residual entropy again becomes extensive, scaling proportional to N ln phi,
where phi is the golden ratio.
