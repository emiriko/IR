We investigate the Casimir force between two dissimilar plane mirrors the
material properties of which are described by Drude or Lorentz models. We
calculate analytically the short and long distance asymptote of the force and
relate its behavior to the influence of interacting surface plasmons. In
particular we discuss conditions under which Casimir repulsion could be
achieved.
