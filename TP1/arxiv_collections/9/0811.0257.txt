The linear stability of the homogeneous equilibrium of non-relativistic
fluids with mass flux and special relativistic fluids with the absolute value
of the energy vector as internal energy is investigated. It is proved that the
equilibrium is asymptotically stable in both cases due to purely thermodynamic
restrictions; the only requirements are the thermodynamic stability and the
nonnegativity of the transport coefficients.
