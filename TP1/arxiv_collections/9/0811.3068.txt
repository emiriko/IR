We study asymptotically AdS topological black hole solutions with k=0 (plane
symmetric) in the Einstein gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term, the dilaton and a
"cosmological constant" in various dimensions. We derive the field equations
for suitable ansatz for general D dimensions. We determine the parameter
regions including dilaton couplings where such solutions exist and construct
black hole solutions of various masses numerically in D=4,5,6 and 10
dimensional spacetime with (D-2)-dimensional hypersurface of zero curvature.
