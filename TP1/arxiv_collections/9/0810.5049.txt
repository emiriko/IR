We investigate structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of SrFeAsF as
a new parent for superconductors using state-of-the-art density-functional
theory method. Calculated results show that striped antiferromagnetic order is
the magnetic ground state in the Fe layer and interlayer magnetic interaction
is tiny. Calculated As and Sr positions are in agreement with experiment. There
are only two uniaxially-dispersed bands near the Fermi level. The valent charge
is mainly in the Fe and F layers, and the magnetic moment is confined to the Fe
atoms. Inter-Fe-spin couplings is due to superexchange through As atoms. These
are useful to understanding the SrFeAsF and should have helpful implications to
doped samples.
