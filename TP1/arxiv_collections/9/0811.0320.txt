We investigate the effects of weak to moderate disorder on the T=0 Mott
metal-insulator transition in two dimensions. Our model calculations
demonstrate that the electronic states close to the Fermi energy become more
spatially homogeneous in the critical region. Remarkably, the higher energy
states show the opposite behavior: they display enhanced spatial inhomogeneity
precisely in the close vicinity to the Mott transition. We suggest that such
energy-resolved disorder screening is a generic property of disordered Mott
systems.
