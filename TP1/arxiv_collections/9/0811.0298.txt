The model (Lagrangian) with a peculiar extra U(1)is clearly presented. The
assigned extra U(1) gauge charges give a strong constraint to build
Lagrangians. The Z' discovery limits are estimated and predicted at the
Tevatron and the LHC. The new contributions of the muon anomalous magnetic
moment are investigated at one and two loops, and we predict that the deviation
from the standard model may be explained. The electron electric dipole moment
could also be generated because of the explicit CP violation effect in the
Higgs sector, and a sizable contribution is expected for a moderately sized CP
phase(argument of the CP-odd Higgs).
