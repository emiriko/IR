A series of endofullerenes M@C60 were calculated from the first principles
(unrestricted Hartree Fock and DFT B3LYP) methods with effective core potential
(M = Ag, Cs) and all-electronic basis set (M = Li, Na, Cu). An arbitrary
symmetry distortion (down to C1 point group) was assumed. The geometrical and
electronic properties of M@C60 are compared for this series of endoatoms
including the off-center position of enoatoms within C60, effective charges and
spin density. The latter values are featured for Ag@C60 and Cu@C60.
