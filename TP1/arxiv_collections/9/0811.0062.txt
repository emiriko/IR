Let $D$ be the incidence graph of the projective plane over $\FF_3$. The
Artin group of the graph $D$ maps onto the bimonster and a complex hyperbolic
reflection group $\Gamma$ acting on 13 dimensional complex hyperbolic space
$Y$. The generators of the Artin group are mapped to elements of order 2 (resp.
3) in the bimonster (resp. $\Gamma$). Let $Y^{\circ} \subseteq Y$ be the
complement of the union of the mirrors of $\Gamma$. Daniel Allcock has
conjectured that the orbifold fundamental group of $Y^{\circ}/\Gamma$ surjects
onto bimonster. In this article we study the reflection group $\Gamma$. Our
main result shows that there is homomorphism from the Artin group of $D$ to the
orbifold fundamental group of $Y^{\circ}/\Gamma$, obtained by sending the Artin
generators to the generators of monodromy around the mirrors of the generating
reflections in $\Gamma$. This answers a question in Allcock's article "A
monstrous proposal" and takes a step towards the proof of Allcock's conjecture.
The finite group $\op{PGL}(3, \FF_3) \subseteq \Aut(D)$ acts on $Y$ and fixes a
complex hyperbolic line pointwise. We show that the restriction of
$\Gamma$-invariant meromorphic automorphic forms on $Y$ to the complex
hyperbolic line fixed by $\op{PGL}(3, \FF_3)$ gives meromorphic modular forms
of level 13.
