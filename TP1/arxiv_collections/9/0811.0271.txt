The identity of dark matter has not been solved up to this date, a problem
that became the main topic of this conference. There are many theoretical
candidates for dark matter particle, including gravitino from supergravity
models. For gravitino dark matter scenario, the phenomenology depends much on
what the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is. We show here that
sneutrino can naturally be the NLSP in the Non-Universal Higgs Masses (NUHM)
model, and that this scenario is still phenomenologically viable.
