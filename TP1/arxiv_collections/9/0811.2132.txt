A technique is presented for precision measurements of the area densities,
density * T, of approximately 5% radiation length carbon and 208Pb targets used
in an experiment at Jefferson Laboratory to measure the neutral pion radiative
width. The precision obtained in the area density for the carbon target is +/-
0.050%, and that obtained for the lead target through an x-ray attenuation
technique is +/- 0.43%.
