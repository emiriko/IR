We apply density functional theory and the augmented spherical wave method to
analyze the electronic structure of V2O3 in the vicinity of an interface to
Al2O3. The interface is modeled by a heterostructure setup of alternating
vanadate and aluminate slabs. We focus on the possible modifications of the
V2O3 electronic states in this geometry, induced by the presence of the
aluminate layers. In particular, we find that the tendency of the V 3d states
to localize is enhanced and may even cause a metal-insulator transition.
