We develop a nonequilibrium mode-coupling theory for uniformly sheared
systems starting from microscopic, thermostatted SLLOD equations of motion. Our
theory aims at describing stationary-state properties including rheological
ones of sheared systems, and this is accomplished via two steps. Firstly, a set
of self-consistent equations is formulated based on the projection-operator
formalism and on the mode-coupling approach for the transient density
correlators which measure the correlations between the density fluctuations in
the initial equilibrium state and the ones at later times after the shearing
force is turned on. The transient time-correlation function formalism is then
used which, combined with the mode-coupling approximation, expresses
stationary-state properties in terms of the transient density correlators. A
detailed comparison of our theory is also presented with the related
mode-coupling theory which is based on the Smoluchowski equation for Brownian
particles under stationary shearing.
