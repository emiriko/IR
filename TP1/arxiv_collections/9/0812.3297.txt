We study the effects of gluon radiation in top pair production and their
decays for e+e- annihilation at the ILC. To achieve this we apply the POWHEG
method and interface our results to the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig++.
We consider a center-of-mass energy of 500GeV and compare decay correlations
and bottom quark distributions before hadronization.
