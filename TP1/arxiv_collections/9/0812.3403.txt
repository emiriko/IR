In this work, we derive the equations of motion governing the hydrodynamics
of spin-F spinor condensates. We pursue a description based on standard
physical variables (total density and superfluid velocity), alongside 2F
`spin-nodes': unit vectors that describe the spin F state, and also exhibit the
point-group symmetry of a spinor condensate's mean-field ground state. The
hydrodynamic equations of motion consist of a mass continuity equation, 2F
Landau-Lifshitz equations for the spin-nodes, and a modified Euler equation. In
particular, we provide a generalization of the Mermin-Ho relation to spin one,
and find an analytic solution for the skyrmion texture in the incompressible
regime of a spin-half condensate. These results exhibit a beautiful geometrical
structure that underlies the dynamics of spinor condensates.
