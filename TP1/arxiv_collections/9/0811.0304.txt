We review a work by M.Ninomiya and myself about a model for the initial state
- i.e. which solution to the equations of motions - that is being realized. The
to be realized solution is suggeted to be the one for which a certain number
depending on the whole history of the development of the whole Unverse is
minimal. This number is called "the imaginary part of the action" and since
this article is meant to be somewhat popular the concept of an action is
suggestively explained. At first the model of ours give too many miracles, but
we believe to have argued that the number of miracles is drastically reduced so
the model is not immediately excluded from having a chance of being true. A
suggested miracle that has occured is the stopping by the US Congress of the
large accelerator SSC under construction already in Texas. A similar bad fait
is predicted for the soon to start accelerator LHC in Geneva! By translation
submission it has still not started up to its proper energy per particle.
