A novel information-geometric approach to chaotic dynamics on curved
statistical manifolds based on Entropic Dynamics (ED) is suggested.
Furthermore, an information-geometric analogue of the Zurek-Paz quantum chaos
criterion is proposed. It is shown that the hyperbolicity of a non-maximally
symmetric 6N-dimensional statistical manifold M_{s} underlying an ED Gaussian
model describing an arbitrary system of 3N non-interacting degrees of freedom
leads to linear information-geometric entropy growth and to exponential
divergence of the Jacobi vector field intensity, quantum and classical features
of chaos respectively.
