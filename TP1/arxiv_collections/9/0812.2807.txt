We present a theoretical study of a system with competing short-range
ferromagnetic attraction and a long-range anti-ferromagnetic repulsion, in the
presence of a uniform external magnetic field. The interplay between these
interactions, at sufficiently low temperature, leads to the self-tuning of the
magnetization to a value which triggers phase coexistence, even in the presence
of the external field. The investigation of this phenomenon is performed using
a Ginzburg-Landau functional in the limit of an infinite number of order
parameter components (large $N$ model). The scalar version of the model is
expected to describe the phase separation taking place on a cell surface when
this is immersed in a uniform concentration of chemical stimulant. A phase
diagram is obtained as function of the external field and the intensity of the
long-range repulsion. The time evolution of order parameter and of the
structure factor in a relaxation process are studied in different regions of
the phase diagram.
