Competition between random genetic drift and natural selection plays a
central role in evolution: Whereas non-beneficial mutations often prevail in
small populations by chance, mutations that sweep through large populations
typically confer a selective advantage. Here, however, we observe chance
effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in
large microbial populations. Initially well-mixed populations of two
fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well-defined,
sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The
formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a
thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial and
yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale
genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable
footprint of past range expansions.
