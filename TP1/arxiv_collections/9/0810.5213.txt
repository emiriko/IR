The coupled dynamics of the isovector and isoscalar giant quadrupole
resonances and low lying modes (including scissors) are studied with the help
of the Wigner Function Moments (WFM) method generalized to take into account
pair correlations. Equations of motion for collective variables are derived on
the basis of the Time Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) equations in
the harmonic oscillator model with quadrupole-quadrupole (QQ) residual
interaction and a Gaussian pairing force. Special care is taken of the
continuity equation.
