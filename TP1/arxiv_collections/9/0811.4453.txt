We propose a novel non-Hermitian adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm.
One of the new ideas is to use a non-Hermitian auxiliary "initial'' Hamiltonian
that provides an effective level repulsion for the main Hamiltonian. This
effect enables us to develop an adiabatic theory which determines ground state
much more efficiently than Hermitian methods.
