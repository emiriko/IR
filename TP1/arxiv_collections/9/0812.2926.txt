The recurrent theme of this paper is that sequences of long temporal patterns
as opposed to sequences of simple statements are to be fed into computation
devices, being them (new proposed) models for brain activity or
multi-core/many-core computers. In such models, parts of these long temporal
patterns are already committed while other are predicted. This combination of
matching patterns and making predictions appears as a key element in producing
intelligent processing in brain models and getting efficient speculative
execution on multi-core/many-core computers. A bridge between these far-apart
models of computation could be provided by appropriate design of massively
parallel, interactive programming languages. Agapia is a recently proposed
language of this kind, where user controlled long high-level temporal
structures occur at the interaction interfaces of processes. In this paper
Agapia is used to link HTMs brain models with TRIPS multi-core/many-core
architectures.
