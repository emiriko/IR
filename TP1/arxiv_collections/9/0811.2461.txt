We investigate non-relativistic limits of the N=3 Chern-Simons matter system
in 1+2 dimensions. The relativistic theory can generate several inequivalent
super Schodinger invariant theories, depending on the degrees of freedom we
choose to retain in the non-relativistic limit. The maximally supersymmetric
Schrodinger invariant theory is obtained by keeping all particle degrees of
freedom. The other descendants, where particles and anti-particles coexist, are
also Schrodinger invariant but preserve less supersymmetries. Thus, we have a
family of super Schrodinger invariant field theories produced from the parent
relativistic theory.
