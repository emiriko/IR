The large-scale properties of chemical reaction systems, such as the
metabolism, can be studied with graph-based methods. To do this, one needs to
reduce the information -- lists of chemical reactions -- available in
databases. Even for the simplest type of graph representation, this reduction
can be done in several ways. We investigate different simple network
representations by testing how well they encode information about one
biologically important network structure -- network modularity (the propensity
for edges to be cluster into dense groups that are sparsely connected between
each other). To reach this goal, we design a model of reaction-systems where
network modularity can be controlled and measure how well the reduction to
simple graphs capture the modular structure of the model reaction system. We
find that the network types that best capture the modular structure of the
reaction system are substrate-product networks (where substrates are linked to
products of a reaction) and substance networks (with edges between all
substances participating in a reaction). Furthermore, we argue that the
proposed model for reaction systems with tunable clustering is a general
framework for studies of how reaction-systems are affected by modularity. To
this end, we investigate statistical properties of the model and find, among
other things, that it recreate correlations between degree and mass of the
molecules.
