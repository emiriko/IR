We study the competition between interference due to multiple single-particle
paths and Coulomb interaction in a simple model of an Anderson-like impurity
with local-magnetic-field-induced level splitting coupled to ferromagnetic
leads. The model along with its potential experimental relevance in the field
of spintronics serves as a nontrivial benchmark system where various quantum
transport approaches can be tested and compared. We present results for the
linear conductance obtained by a spin-dependent implementation of the density
matrix renormalization group scheme which are compared with a mean-field
solution as well as a seemingly more advanced Hubbard-I approximation. We
explain why mean-field yields nearly perfect results, while the more
sophisticated Hubbard-I approach fails, even at a purely conceptual level since
it breaks hermiticity of the related density matrix. Furthermore, we study
finite bias transport through the impurity by the mean-field approach and
recently developed higher-order density matrix equations. We find that the
mean-field solution fails to describe the plausible results of the higher-order
density matrix approach both quantitatively and qualitatively as it does not
capture some essential features of the current-voltage characteristics such as
negative differential conductance.
