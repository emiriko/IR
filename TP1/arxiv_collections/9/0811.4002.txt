The conventional interpretation of the recent magneto-oscillation experiments
in underdoped Cuprates, requires that there be a state of altered translational
symmetry in the pseudogap state which is not supported by structural and Angle
Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. I show here that the
observed oscillations may be reconciled with the conclusion arrived in ARPES
experiments that the fermi-surface, suitably defined, has the shape of four
arcs which shrink to four points as $T \to 0$. Experiments, including infrared
absorption in a magnetic field, are suggested to distinguish between such a
state from that obtained by the conventional interpretation of the
magneto-oscillations.
