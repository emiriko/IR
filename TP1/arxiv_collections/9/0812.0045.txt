In this paper we develop a method to compute the Burns-Epstein invariant of a
spherical CR homology sphere, up to an integer, from its holonomy
representation. As application, we give a formula for the Burns-Epstein
invariant, modulo an integer, of a spherical CR structure on a Seifert fibered
homology sphere in terms of its holonomy representation.
