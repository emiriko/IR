We re-examine a population model which exhibits a continuous absorbing phase
transition which belongs to directed percolation in 1+1 dimensions and a first
order transition in 2+1 dimensions and above. Studying the model on fractal
lattices, we examine at what fractal dimension 1<d_f<2, the change in order
occurs. As well as commenting on the order of the transitions, we produce
estimates for the critical points and, for continuous transitions, some
critical exponents.
