One possible extension of the Standard Model scalar sector includes SU(2)_L
doublet scalars that are color octets rather than singlets. We focus on models
in which the couplings to fermions are consistent with the principle of minimal
flavor violation (MFV), in which case these color octet scalars couple most
strongly to the third generation of quarks. When the Yukawa coupling of color
octet scalars to Standard Model fermions is less than unity, these states can
live long enough to bind into color-singlet spin-0 hadrons, which we call
octetonia. In this paper, we consider the phenomenology of octetonia at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Predictions for their production via gluon-gluon
fusion and their two-body decays into Standard Model gauge bosons, Higgs
bosons, and \bar{t}t are presented.
