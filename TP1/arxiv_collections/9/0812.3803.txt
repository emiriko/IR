We present a complete study of rare K and B meson decays in a warped extra
dimensional model with a custodial protection of (both diagonal and
non-diagonal) Z d_L^i \bar d_L^j couplings, including K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu,
K_L -> pi^0 nu anti-nu, K_L -> pi^0 l^+ l^-, K_L -> mu^+ mu^-, B_{s,d} -> mu^+
mu^-, B -> K nu anti-nu, B -> K^* nu anti-nu and B -> X_{s,d} nu anti-nu. In
this model in addition to Standard Model one loop contributions these processes
receive tree level contributions from the Z boson and the new heavy electroweak
gauge bosons. We analyse all these contributions that turn out to be dominated
by tree level Z boson exchanges governed by right-handed couplings to down-type
quarks. Imposing all existing constraints from Delta F=2 transitions analysed
by us recently and fitting all quark masses and CKM mixing parameters we find
that a number of branching ratios for rare K decays can differ significantly
from the SM predictions, while the corresponding effects in rare B decays are
modest, dominantly due to the custodial protection being more effective in B
decays than in K decays. In order to reduce the parameter dependence we study
correlations between various observables within the K system, within the B
system and in particular between K and B systems, and also between Delta F=2
and Delta F=1 observables. These correlations allow for a clear distinction
between this new physics scenario and models with minimal flavour violation or
the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity, and could give an opportunity to future
experiments to confirm or rule out the model. We show how our results would
change if the custodial protection of Z d_L^i bar d^j_L couplings was absent.
In the case of rare B decays the modifications are spectacular.
