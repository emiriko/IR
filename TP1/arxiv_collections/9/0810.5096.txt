Let $D$ be an unbounded domain in $\RR^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We show that if $D$
contains an unbounded uniform domain, then the symmetric reflecting Brownian
motion (RBM) on $\overline D$ is transient. Next assume that RBM $X$ on
$\overline D$ is transient and let $Y$ be its time change by Revuz measure
${\bf 1}_D(x) m(x)dx$ for a strictly positive continuous integrable function
$m$ on $\overline D$. We further show that if there is some $r>0$ so that
$D\setminus \overline {B(0, r)}$ is an unbounded uniform domain, then $Y$
admits one and only one symmetric diffusion that genuinely extends it and
admits no killings. In other words, in this case $X$ (or equivalently, $Y$) has
a unique Martin boundary point at infinity.
