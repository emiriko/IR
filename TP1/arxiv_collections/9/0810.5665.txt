The observation of a non-classical rotation inertia (NCRI) fraction in bulk
solid 4He by M. Chan and E. Kim attracted significant interest as a possible
manifestation of supersolid state of matter. Despite numerous experimental and
theoretical studies inspired by this observation, an explicit explanation for
this phenomenon is still missing. Neutron scattering experiments on solid elium
may help to shed light on the physical grounds of NCRI and answer the question
on whether this phenomenon could be caused by Bose-Einstein Condensation. In
this paper we are going to discuss the results obtained in experiments
involving neutron scattering on solid 4He. Microscopic quantitative data such
as mean kinetic energy, mean square momentum and mean square displacement of
helium atoms as well as the lattice parameter have been obtained for the first
time for solid 4He in temperature range 70 mK - 500 mK. No change was seen in
the single atom kinetic energy within statistical error better than 1per cent
as well as change in the lattice parameter within 0.03 per cent. The mean
square displacement did not change in the region of expected supersolid
transition either. All these results suggest that the NCRI transition is quite
different from the superfluid transition in liquid 4He.
