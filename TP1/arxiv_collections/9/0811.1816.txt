We demonstrate a precision frequency measurement using a phase-stabilized
120-km optical fiber link over a physical distance of 50 km. The transition
frequency of the 87Sr optical lattice clock at the University of Tokyo is
measured to be 429228004229874.1(2.4) Hz referenced to international atomic
time (TAI). The measured frequency agrees with results obtained in Boulder and
Paris at a 6*10^-16 fractional level, which matches the current best
evaluations of Cs primary frequency standards. The results demonstrate the
excellent functions of the intercity optical fibre link, and the great
potential of optical lattice clocks for use in the redefinition of the second.
