Mecheri and Marsch concluded that drift currents caused by density gradients
can serve as an energy source for a plasma instability, in particular for the
excitation of ion-cyclotron waves in the solar corona. It is pointed out that
these authors overlooked some fundamental properties of the drift motion in
inhomogeneous plasmas. The calculation is repeated, taking into account the
missing terms. It is shown that the diamagnetic drift, which is essential for
the new physical phenomena obtained by Mecheri and Marsch, can not contribute
to the flux in the continuity equation. Moreover, the part of the ion
polarization drift contribution to the ion cancels out exactly with the
contribution of the part of the stress tensor drift to the same flux. The
ion-cyclotron waves in the solar corona can thus not be excited in the way
suggested by Mecheri and Marsch.
