We studied a left-right symmetric model that can accommodate the neutrino
dark energy (\nd) proposal. Type III seesaw mechanism is implemented to give
masses to the neutrinos. After explaining the model, we study the consistency
of the model by minimizing the scalar potential and obtaining the conditions
for the required vacuum expectation values of the different scalar fields. This
model is then embedded in an SO(10) grand unified theory and the allowed
symmetry breaking scales are determined by the condition of the gauge coupling
unification. Although $SU(2)_{R}$ breaking is required to be high, its Abelian
subgroup $U(1)_{R}$ is broken in the TeV range, which can then give the
required neutrino masses and predicts new gauge bosons that could be detected
at LHC. The neutrino masses are studied in details in this model, which shows
that at least 3 singlet fermions are required.
