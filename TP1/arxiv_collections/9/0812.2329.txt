We study the properties of nonlinear superalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and algebras
$\mathcal{A}_b$ arising from a one-to-one correspondence between the sets of
relations that extract AdS-group irreducible representations $D(E_0,s_1,s_2)$
in AdS$_d$-spaces and the sets of operators that form $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{A}_b$, respectively, for fermionic, $s_i=n_i+{1/2}$, and bosonic,
$s_i=n_i$, $n_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, $i=1,2$, HS fields characterized by a Young
tableaux with two rows. We consider a method of constructing the Verma modules
$V_\mathcal{A}$, $V_{\mathcal{A}_b}$ for $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}_b$ and
establish a possibility of their Fock-space realizations in terms of formal
power series in oscillator operators which serve to realize an additive
conversion of the above (super)algebra ($\mathcal{A}$) $\mathcal{A}_b$,
containing a set of 2nd-class constraints, into a converted (super)algebra
$\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$ = $\mathcal{A}_{b}$ + $\mathcal{A}'_b$ ($\mathcal{A}_c$ =
$\mathcal{A}$ + $\mathcal{A}'$), containing a set of 1st-class constraints
only. For the algebra $\mathcal{A}_{b{}c}$, we construct an exact nilpotent
BFV--BRST operator $Q'$ having nonvanishing terms of 3rd degree in the powers
of ghost coordinates and use $Q'$ to construct a gauge-invariant Lagrangian
formulation (LF) for HS fields with a given mass $m$ (energy $E_0(m)$) and
generalized spin $\mathbf{s}$=$(s_1,s_2)$. LFs with off-shell algebraic
constraints are examined as well.
