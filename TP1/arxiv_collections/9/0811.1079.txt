We study the entanglement dynamics of strongly driven atoms off-resonantly
coupled with cavity fields. We consider conditions characterized not only by
the atom-field coupling but also by the atom-field detuning. By studying two
different models within the framework of cavity QED, we show that the so-called
atomic entanglement sudden death (ESD) always occurs if the atom-field coupling
lager than the atom-field detuning, and is independent of the type of initial
atomic state.
