In this paper we have presented a generalized treatment of a photon
scattering by a harmonic oscillator initially at ground state. We have
predicted the scattering cross-section of the oscillator and showed how the
treatment invariably requires the formalisms of renormalization. As a special
case of our treatment, we discussed about Rayleigh and Thomson Scattering and
computed the total cross-section in order to be consistent with experimental
results. Two approximations are adopted in order to simplify the problem but
without any digression from our goal. A second order perturbation theory is
employed where the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator is considered
to be the only intermediate state and A dipole approximation is utilized.
Throughout this paper we have used Gaussian units.
