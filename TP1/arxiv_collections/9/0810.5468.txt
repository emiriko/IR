The dynamics of a spin--1/2 neutral particle possessing electric and magnetic
dipole moments interacting with external electric and magnetic fields in
noncommutative coordinates is obtained. Noncommutativity of space is interposed
in terms of a semiclassical constrained Hamiltonian system. The relation
between the quantum phase acquired by a particle interacting with an
electromagnetic field and the (semi)classical force acting on the system is
examined and generalized to establish a formulation of the quantum phases in
noncommutative coordinates. The general formalism is applied to physical
systems yielding the Aharonov-Bohm, Aharonov-Casher, He-McKellar-Wilkens and
Anandan phases in noncommutative coordinates. Bounds for the noncommutativity
parameter theta are derived comparing the deformed phases with the experimental
data on the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phases.
