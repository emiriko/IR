In the frame of collective dynamics in water, models built on elementary
excitations and long-range electromagnetic interactions in the cell and bulk
liquid are presented. Making use of the low effective mass of water coherence
domains (CDs), we examined the relevance of simple quantum models to cellular
characteristics. A hypothesis of CDs Bose-type condensation, and models of CD
in spherical wells with impenetrable and semipenetrable walls, and of an
isotropic oscillator consisting of two interacting CDs were investigated.
Estimated cellular volumes matched to medium-sized bacteria and small
prokaryotes, and to some organelles in eukaryotic cells. Also, the cytotoxic
effects of heavy water in eukaryotes were explained. In another approach we
proposed a plasmon-like model of hydrogen-oxygen ionic plasma in liquid water.
In addition to plasmonic oscillations, the model predicted sound-like
non-equilibrium elementary excitations that we called densitons (the sound
anomaly of water), the vaporization heat and the permittivity dispersion, in
agreement to experimental data. The fields generated by ionic plasma
oscillations in living cells may support long distance intercellular
correlations.
