The interior of cells is crowded thus making it important to assess the
effects of macromolecules on the folding of proteins. Using the Self-Organized
Polymer (SOP) model, which is a coarse-grained representation of polypeptide
chains, we probe the mechanical stability of Ubiquitin (Ub) monomers and
trimers ((Ub)$_3$) in the presence of monodisperse spherical crowding agents.
Crowding increases the volume fraction ($\Phi_c$)-dependent average force
($<f_u(\Phi_c)>$), relative to the value at $\Phi_c = 0$, needed to unfold Ub
and the polyprotein. For a given $\Phi_c$, the values of $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$
increase as the diameter ($\sigma_c$) of the crowding particles decreases. The
average unfolding force $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$ depends on the ratio $\frac{D}{R_g}$,
where $D \approx \sigma_c (\frac{\pi}{6 \Phi_c})^{{1/3}}$ with $R_g$ being the
radius of gyration of Ub (or (Ub)$_3$) in the unfolded state. Examination of
the unfolding pathways shows that, relative to $\Phi_c = 0$, crowding promotes
reassociation of ruptured secondary structural elements. Both the nature of the
unfolding pathways and $<f_u(\Phi_c)>$ for (Ub)$_3$ are altered in the presence
of crowding particles with the effect being most dramatic for the subunit that
unfolds last. We predict, based on SOP simulations and theoretical arguments,
that $<f_u(\Phi_c) > \sim \Phi_c^{\frac{1}{3\nu}}$, where $\nu$ is the Flory
exponent that describes the unfolded (random coil) state of the protein.
