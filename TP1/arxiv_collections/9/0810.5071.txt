In this paper the Yennie-Frautschi-Suura approach is used to simulate real
and virtual QED corrections in particle decays. It makes use of the universal
structure of soft photon corrections to resum the leading logarithmic QED
corrections to all orders, and it allows a systematic correction of this
approximate result to exact fixed order results from perturbation theory. The
approach has been implemented as a Monte Carlo algorithm, which a posteriori
modifies decay matrix elements through the emission of varying numbers of
photons. The corresponding computer code is incorporated into the SHERPA event
generator framework.
