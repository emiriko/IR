The sampling of Boltzmann distributions by stochastic Markov processes, can
be strongly limited by the crossing time of high (free) energy barriers. As a
result, the system may stay trapped in metastable states, and the relaxation
time to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution may be very large compared to
the available computational time. In this paper, we show how, by a simple
modification of the Hamiltonian, one can dramatically decrease the relaxation
time of the system, while retaining the same equilibrium distribution. The
method is illustrated on the case of the one-dimensional double-well potential.
