Theoretical and computational studies of the quantum phase diagram of the
one-dimensional half-filled extended Hubbard model (EHM) indicate a narrow bond
order wave (BOW) phase with finite magnetic gap $E_m$ for on-site repulsion $U
< U^*$, the critical point, and nearest neighbor interaction $V_c \approx U/2$
near the boundary of the charge density wave (CDW) phase. Potentials with more
extended interactions that retain the EHM symmetry are shown to have a less
cooperative CDW transition with higher $U^*$ and wider BOW phase. Density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is used to obtain $E_m$ directly as the
singlet-triplet gap, with finite $E_m$ marking the BOW boundary $V_s(U)$. The
BOW/CDW boundary $V_c(U)$ is obtained from exact finite-size calculations that
are consistent with previous EHM determinations. The kinetic energy or bond
order provides a convenient new estimate of $U^*$ based on a metallic point at
$V_c(U)$ for $U < U^*$. Tuning the BOW phase of half-filled Hubbard models with
different intersite potentials indicates a ground state with large charge
fluctuations and magnetic frustration. The possibility of physical realizations
of a BOW phase is raised for Coulomb interactions.
