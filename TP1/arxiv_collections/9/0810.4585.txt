I outline experimental results on heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider for a non-technical audience. This includes: elliptic flow
and nearly ideal hydrodynamics; the suppression of hard particles and the ratio
R_AA; and electromagnetic signals, including dileptons and direct photons.
Especially puzzling is why the behavior of heavy (charm) quarks appears to be
so similar to that of light quarks.
