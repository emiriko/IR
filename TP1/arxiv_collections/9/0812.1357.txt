The enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last
decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum random walk (QRW) with the
problem of data clustering, and develop two clustering algorithms based on the
one dimensional QRW. Then, the probability distributions on the positions
induced by QRW in these algorithms are investigated, which also indicates the
possibility of obtaining better results. Consequently, the experimental results
have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and
efficiently, and the clustering algorithms are of fast rates of convergence.
Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
