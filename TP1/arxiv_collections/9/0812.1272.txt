We report the results of neutron measurements carried out during the
application of ultrasounds to a solution containing only stable elements like
Iron and Chlorine, without any other radioactive source of any kind. These
measurements, carried out by CR39 detectors and a Boron TriFouride electronic
detector, evidenced the emission of neutron pulses. These pulses stand well
above the electronic noise and the background of the laboratory where the
measurements were carried out.
