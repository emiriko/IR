The formation of hypernuclei in hadron-induced reactions and in heavy-ion
collisions within a combination of a covariant transport model and a
statistical fragmentation approach is investigated. We study the applicability
and limitations of such a hybrid approach by comparing fragmentation data in
heavy-ion collisions and proton induced reactions. It turns out that the
combined approach describes fairly well multiplicities and momentum spectra of
fragments. We thus extend the model by including strangeness degrees of freedom
in the fragmentation process, modeled by a phase-space coalescence method. We
provide theoretical predictions on spectra and on inclusive cross sections of
light hypernuclei for the future experiments on hypernuclear physics at the new
GSI facility.
