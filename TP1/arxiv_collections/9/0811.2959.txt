Recent data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC show strong near-side
correlations extending over several units of rapidity. This ridge-like
correlation exhibits an abrupt onset with collision centrality. In this talk, I
argue that the centrality and beam-energy dependence of these near-angle
correlations could provide access to information about the Quark Gluon Plasma
phase boundary and the Equation of State of nuclear matter. A beam-energy-scan
at RHIC will better reveal the true source of these correlations and should be
a high priority at RHIC.
