We discuss the tuning of the anisotropic clover action and Symanzik-improved
gauge action in lattice perturbation theory. The fermion action is constructed
from stout-smeared spatial links, which complicates the calculation
considerably. In addition, the full quark-mass dependence of the action
parameters is included in this study. We present results for the fermion and
gauge aspect ratios for varying bare aspect ratios, quark masses and smearing
parameters.
