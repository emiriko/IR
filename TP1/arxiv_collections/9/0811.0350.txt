Magnetostatic spin wave dispersion and loss are measured in micron scale spin
wave-guides in ferromagnetic, metallic CoTaZr. Results are in good agreement
with model calculations of spin wave dispersion and up to three different modes
are identified. Attenuation lengths of the order of 3 microns are several of
orders of magnitude shorter than that predicted from eddy currents in these
thin wires.
