The dynamical behaviors of two interacting dark energy models are considered.
In addition to the scaling attractors found in the non-interacting quintessence
model with exponential potential, new accelerated scaling attractors are also
found in the interacting dark energy models. The coincidence problem is reduced
to the choice of parameters in the interacting dark energy models.
