We demonstrate that simultaneous reconstruction of scattering and absorption
of a mesoscopic system using angularly-resolved measurements of scattered light
intensity is possible. Image reconstruction is realized based on the algebraic
inversion of a generalized Radon transform relating the scattering and
absorption coefficients of the medium to the measured light intensity and
derived using the single-scattering approximation to the radiative transport
equation.
