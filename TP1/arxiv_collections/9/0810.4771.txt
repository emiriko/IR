Normal mode analysis is a widely used technique for reconstructing
conformational changes of proteins from the knowledge of native structures. In
this Letter, we investigate to what extent normal modes capture the salient
features of the dynamics over a range of temperatures from close to T = 0 to
above unfolding. We show that on the one hand, the use of normal modes at
physiological temperatures is justified provided proteins are cooperative. On
the other hand, it is imperative to consider several modes in order to
eliminate the unpredictable temperature dependence of single- mode
contributions to the protein fluctuations.
