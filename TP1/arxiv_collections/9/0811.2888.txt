If the electroweak symmetry is broken by some unspecified strong dynamics,
composite fermions may exist with definite transformation properties under
SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R/SU(2)_{L+R} and may play a role in giving masses by mixing to
all the standard quarks and leptons. Assuming this to be the case, we analyze
the role of Singlets, Doublets and Triplets in the ElectroWeak Precision Tests
and in Flavour Physics. Doublets and Triplets are generically disfavoured. In
the Singlet case, we specify the breaking patterns of the flavour group that
allow to keep the CKM picture of flavour physics and we discuss the effects of
the mixing between composite and elementary fermions. These mixings affect in
particular the rather peculiar LHC phenomenology of the composite fermions.
