The method of screening and renormalization is used to include the Coulomb
interaction between the charged particles in the description of few-body
nuclear reactions. Calculations are done in the framework of Faddeev-type
equations in momentum-space. The reliability of the method is demonstrated. The
Coulomb effect on observables is discussed.
