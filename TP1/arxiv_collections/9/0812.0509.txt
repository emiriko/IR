We address three different problematic Casimir experiments in this work. The
first is the classical Casimir force measured between two metal half spaces;
here in the form of the Casimir pressure measurement between a gold sphere and
a gold plate as performed by Decca et al. [Phys. Rev. D 75, 077101 (2007)];
theory predicts a large negative thermal correction, absent in the high
precision experiment. The second experiment is the measurement of the Casimir
force between a metal plate and a laser irradiated semiconductor membrane as
performed by Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. B 76, 035338 (2007)]; the change in force
with laser intensity is larger than predicted by theory. The third experiment
is the measurement of the Casimir force between an atom and a wall in the form
of the measurement by Obrecht et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 063201 (2007)] of the
change in oscillation frequency of a Rb Bose-Einstein condensate trapped to a
fused silica wall; the change is smaller than predicted by theory. We show that
saturation effects can explain the discrepancies between theory and experiment
observed in all these cases.
