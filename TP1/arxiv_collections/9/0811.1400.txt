A comprehensive study of the cascade baryon spectrum using lattice QCD
affords the prospect of predicting the masses of states not yet discovered
experimentally, and determining the spin and parity of those states for which
the quantum numbers are not yet known. The study of the cascades, containing
two strange quarks, is particularly attractive for lattice QCD in that the
chiral effects are reduced compared to states composed only of u/d quarks, and
the states are typically narrow. We report preliminary results for the cascade
spectrum obtained by using anisotropic N_f = 2 Wilson lattices with temporal
lattice spacing inverse 5.56 GeV.
