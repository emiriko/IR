We present the light-cone QCD sum rules up to twist 6 for the electromagnetic
form factors of the $\Lambda$ baryon. To estimate the magnetic moment of the
baryon, the magnetic form factor is fitted by the dipole formula. The numerical
value of our estimation is $\mu_\Lambda=-(0.64\pm0.04)\mu_N$, which is in
accordance with the experimental data and the existing theoretical results. We
find that it is twist 4 but not the leading twist distribution amplitudes that
dominate the results.
