The universal method of construction of the rigorous lower bounds to the
Weizsacker energy is presented. We study a few-fermion systemat the unitarity.
Upper and lower bounds to the density functional theory(DFT) ground state
energy within the local density approximation (LDA) aregiven. Therigorous lower
bounds to the accuracy of the method are derived.
