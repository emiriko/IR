Magnetic defects have pronounced effects on the magnetic properties of the
face-centered cubic compound LiV2O4. The magnetic defects arise from crystal
defects present within the normal spinel structure. High-energy x-ray
diffraction studies were performed on LiV2O4 single crystals to search for
superstructure peaks or any other evidence of periodicity in the arrangement of
the crystal defects present in the lattice. Entire reciprocal lattice planes
are mapped out with help of synchrotron radiation. No noticeable differences in
the x-ray diffraction data between a crystal with high magnetic defect
concentration and a crystal with low magnetic defect concentration have been
found. This indicates the absence of any long-range periodicity or short-range
correlations in the arrangements of the crystal/magnetic defects.
