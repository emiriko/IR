We study, numerically and analytically, a model of a one-dimensional array of
carbon nanotube resonators in a two-terminal configuration. The system is
brought into resonance upon application of an AC-signal superimposed on a
DC-bias voltage. When the tubes in the array are close to each other,
electrostatic interactions between tubes become important for the array
dynamics. We show that both transverse and longitudinal parametric resonances
can be excited in addition to primary resonances. The intertube electrostatic
interactions couple modes in orthogonal directions and affect the mode
stability.
