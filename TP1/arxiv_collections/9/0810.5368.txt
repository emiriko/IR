We have studied the intrinsic normal and superconducting properties of the
oxypnictide LaFePO. These samples exhibit bulk superconductivity and the
evidence suggests that stoichiometric LaFePO is indeed superconducting, in
contrast to other reports. We find that superconductivity is independent of the
interplane residual resistivity $\rho_0$ and discuss the implications of this
on the nature of the superconducting order parameter. Finally we find that,
unlike $T_c$, other properties in single-crystal LaFePO including the
resistivity and magnetoresistance, can be very sensitive to disorder.
