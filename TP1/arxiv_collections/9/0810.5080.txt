Cosmological singularity and asymptotic behaviour of scale factor of
generalized cosmological models are analyzed in respect of their structural
stability. It is shown, that cosmological singularity is structurally unstable
for the majority of models with barotropic perfect fluid with strong energy
condition. Inclusion of Lambda-term extends the set of structurally stable
cosmological models.
