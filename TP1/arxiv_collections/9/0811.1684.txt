The SWAP gate plays a central role in network designs for qubit quantum
computation. However, there is a view to generalize qubit quantum computing to
higher dimensional quantum systems. In this paper we construct a generalized
SWAP gate using only instances of the generalized controlled-NOT gate to
cyclically permute the states of $d$ qudits for $d$ prime.
