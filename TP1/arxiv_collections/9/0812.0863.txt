We propose a different type of Landau instability in trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates by a helically moving environment. In the presence of quantized
vortices, the instability can cause spontaneous radiation and amplification of
Kelvin waves. This study gives a microscopic understanding of the
Donnelly-Glaberson instability which was known as a hydrodynamic instability in
superfluid helium.
  The Donnelly-Glaberson instability can be a powerful tool for observing the
dispersion relation of Kelvin waves, vortex reconnections, and quantum
turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.
