We investigate the Friedberg-Lee (FL) symmetry and its promotion to include
the $\mu - \tau$ symmetry, and call that the twisted FL symmetry.Based on the
twisted FL symmetry, two possible schemes are presented toward the realistic
neutrino mass spectrum and the tri-bimaximal mixing.In the first scheme, we
suggest the semi-uniform translation of the FL symmetry.The second one is based
on the $S_3$ permutation family symmetry.The breaking terms, which are twisted
FL symmetric, are introduced.Some viable models in each scheme are also
presented.
