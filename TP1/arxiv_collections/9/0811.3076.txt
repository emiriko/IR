The notion of color algebras is generalized to the class of F-ary algebras,
and corresponding decoloration theorems are established. This is used to give a
construction of colored structures by means of tensor products with
Clifford-like algebras. It is moreover shown that color algebras admit
realisations as q=0 quon algebras.
