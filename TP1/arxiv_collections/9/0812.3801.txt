Ferroelectric Ising chain magnet Ca$_3$Co$_{2-x}$Mn$_x$O$_6$ ($x\simeq$0.96)
was studied in magnetic fields up to 33 T. Magnetization and neutron scattering
measurements reveal successive metamagnetic transitions from the zero-field
$\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \downarrow$ spin configuration to the $\uparrow
\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow$ state with a broad magnetization plateau, and
then to the $\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow$ state. The absence of
hysteresis in these plateaus reveals an intriguing coupling between the
intra-chain state and the three-dimensional geometrically frustrated magnetic
system. Inversion symmetry, broken in the $\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow
\downarrow$ state, is restored in the $\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \downarrow$
state, leading to the complete suppression of the electric polarization driven
by symmetric superexchange.
