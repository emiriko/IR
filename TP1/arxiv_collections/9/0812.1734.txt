We apply the dynamical systems tools to study the linear dynamics of a
self-interacting scalar field trapped on a Randall-Sundrum brane. The simplest
kinds of self-interaction potentials are investigated: a) constant potential,
and b) exponential potential. It is shown that the dynamics of the
Randall-Sundrum model significantly differs from the standard four-dimensional
behavior at early times: in all cases of interest the (singular) empty universe
is the past attractor for every trajectory in phase space, meanwhile the
kinetic energy-dominated solution is always a saddle critical point. The
late-time dynamics is not affected by the brane effects.
