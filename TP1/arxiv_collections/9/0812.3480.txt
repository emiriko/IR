Generally, natural scientific problems are so complicated that one has to
establish some effective perturbation or nonperturbation theories with respect
to some associated ideal models. In this Letter, a new theory that combines
perturbation and nonperturbation is constructed. An artificial nonlinear
homotopy parameter plays the role of a perturbation parameter, while other
artificial nonlinear parameters, of which the original problems are
independent, introduced in the nonlinear homotopy models are nonperturbatively
determined by means of a principle minimal sensitivity. The method is
demonstrated through several quantum anharmonic oscillators and a non-hermitian
parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian system. In fact, the framework of the theory
is rather general that can be applied to a broad range of natural phenomena.
Possible applications to condensed matter physics, matter wave systems, and
nonlinear optics are briefly discussed.
