We consider heavy quark interactions in quenched and unquenched lattice QCD.
In a region just above the deconfinement point, non-Abelian gluon polarization
leads to a strong increase in the binding. Comparing quark-antiquark and
quark-quark interaction, the dependence of the binding on the separation
distance $r$ is found to be the same for the colorless singlet $Q\bar Q$ and
the colored anti-triplet $QQ$ state. In a potential model description of
in-medium $J/\Psi$ behavior, this enhancement of the binding leads to a
survival up to temperatures of 1.5 $T_c$ or higher; it could also result in
$J/\Psi$ flow.
