The dynamics of particles in turbulence when the particle-size is larger than
the dissipative scale of the carrier flow is studied. Recent experiments have
highlighted signatures of particles finiteness on their statistical properties,
namely a decrease of their acceleration variance, an increase of correlation
times -at increasing the particles size- and an independence of the probability
density function of the acceleration once normalized to their variance. These
effects are not captured by point particle models. By means of a detailed
comparison between numerical simulations and experimental data, we show that a
more accurate model is obtained once Faxen corrections are included.
