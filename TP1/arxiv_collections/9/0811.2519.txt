The history of data analysis that is addressed here is underpinned by two
themes, -- those of tabular data analysis, and the analysis of collected
heterogeneous data. "Exploratory data analysis" is taken as the heuristic
approach that begins with data and information and seeks underlying explanation
for what is observed or measured. I also cover some of the evolving context of
research and applications, including scholarly publishing, technology transfer
and the economic relationship of the university to society.
