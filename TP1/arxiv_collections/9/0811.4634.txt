We have applied the bond valence method to cerium oxides to determine the
oxidation states of the Ce ion at the various site symmetries of the crystals.
The crystals studied include cerium dioxide and the two sesquioxides along with
some selected intermediate phases which are crystallographically well
characterized. Our results indicate that cerium dioxide has a mixed-valence
ground state with an f-electron population on the Ce site of 0.27 while both
the A- and C-sesquioxides have a nearly pure f^1 configuration. The Ce sites in
most of the intermediate oxides have non-integral valences. Furthermore, many
of these valences are different from the values predicted from a naive
consideration of the stoichiometric valence of the compound.
