The scope of this work was the determination of kinetic parameters of the
thermal oxidative degradation of a Mediterranean scrub using a hybrid method
developed at the laboratory. DSC and TGA were used in this study under air
sweeping to record oxidative reactions. Two dominating and overlapped
exothermic peaks were recorded in DSC and individualized using an experimental
and numerical separation. This first stage allowed obtaining the enthalpy
variation of each exothermic phenomenon. In a second time, a model free method
was applied on each isolated curve to determine the apparent activation
energies. A reactional kinetic scheme was proposed for the global exotherm
composed of two independent and consecutive reactions. In fine mean values of
enthalpy variation and apparent activation energy previously determined were
injected in a model fitting method to obtain the reaction order and the
preexponential factor of each oxidative reaction. We plan to use these data in
a sub-model to be integrated in a wildland fire spread model.
