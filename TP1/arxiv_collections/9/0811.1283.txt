Theoretical predictions suggest the presence of tetrahedral symmetry as an
explanation for the vanishing intra-band E2-transitions at the bottom of the
odd-spin negative parity band in $^{156}Gd$. The present study reports on
experiment performed to address this phenomenon. It allowed to determine the
intra-band E2 transitions and branching ratios B(E2)/B(E1) of two of the
negative-parity bands in $^{156}Gd$.
