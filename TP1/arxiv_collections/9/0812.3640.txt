The Parisi solution of the mean-field spin glass has been widely accepted and
celebrated. Its marginal stability in 3d and its complexity however raised the
question of its relevance to real spin glasses. This paper gives a short
overview of the important experimental results which could be understood within
the mean-field solution. The existence of a true phase transition and the
particular behaviour of the susceptibility below the freezing temperature,
predicted by the theory, are clearly confirmed by the experimental results. The
behaviour of the complex order parameter and of the Fluctuation Dissipation
ratio are in good agreement with results of spontaneous noise measurements. The
very particular ultrametric symmetry, the key feature of the theory, provided
us with a simple description of the rejuvenation and memory effects observed in
experiment. Finally, going a step beyond mean-field, the paper shortly
discusses new analyses in terms of correlated domains characterized by their
length scales, as well as new experiments on superspin glasses which compare
well with recent theoretical simulations.
