A nonuniform extension of the Glauber model on a one-dimensional lattice with
boundaries is investigated. Based on detailed balance, reaction rates are
proposed for the system. The static behavior of the system is investigated. It
is shown that there are cases where the system exhibits a static phase
transition, which is a change of behavior of the static profile of the
expectation values of the spins near end points.
