This paper reviews the major methods and theories regarding the preservation
of new media artifacts such as videogames, and argues for the importance of
collecting and coming to a better understanding of videogame artifacts of
creation, which will help build a more detailed understanding of the essential
qualities of these culturally significant artifacts. We will also review the
major videogame collections in the United States, Europe and Japan to give an
idea of the current state of videogame archives, and argue for a fuller, more
comprehensive coverage of these materials in institutional repositories.
