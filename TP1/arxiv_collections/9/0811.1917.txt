We study the aggregation of AR processes and generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
(OU) processes. Mixture of spectral densities with random poles are the main
tool. In this context, we apply our results for the aggregation of doubly
stochastic interactives processes, see Dacunha-Castelle and Fermin (2006).
Thus, we study the relationship between aggregation of autoregressive processes
and long memory considering complex interaction structures. We precise a very
interesting qualitative phenomena: how the long memory creation depends on the
poles concentration near to the boundary of stability (measured in the
Prokhorov sense). Our results extends the results given by Oppenheim and Viano
(2004), and highlight the importance of the angular dispersion measure of poles
in the appearance of the long memory.
