In the present paper it is demonstrated that the quantum correlation (2-dim
unitary parameter vectors) can be arbitrarily close approximated with a local
hidden variables model. Moreover, the CHSH inequality can be violated with the
present model. This does not conclusively demonstrate that locality and
causality can be restored to quantum mechanics. However, it does show that an
experimental search for local hidden causality need not be fruitless
beforehand.
