Plasmonic gratings of different periodicities are fabricated on top of
Silicon nanocrystals embedded in Silicon Dioxide. Purcell enhancements of up to
2 were observed, which matches the value from simulations. Plasmonic
enhancements are observed for the first three orders of the plasmonic modes,
with the peak enhancement wavelength varying with the periodicity. Biharmonic
gratings are also fabricated to extract the enhanced emission from the first
order plasmonic mode, resulting in enhancements with quality factors of up to
16.
