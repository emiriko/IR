We review non-perturbative static potentials commonly used in potential
models for quarkonia at finite T. Potentials derived from Polyakov loop
correlators are shown to be inappropriate for this purpose. The q\bar{q} free
energy is physical but has the wrong spatial decay and perturbative limit. The
so-called singlet free energy is gauge dependent and unphysical. An appropriate
static real time potential can be defined through a generalisation of pNRQCD to
finite T. In perturbation theory, its real part reproduces the Debye-screened
potential, its imaginary part accounts for Landau damping. Possibilities for
its non-perturbative evaluation are discussed.
