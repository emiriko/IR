Cumulants of a fluctuating current can be obtained from a free energy-like
generating function which for Markov processes equals the largest eigenvalue of
a generalized generator. We determine this eigenvalue with the DMRG for
stochastic systems. We calculate the variance of the current in the different
phases, and at the phase transitions, of the totally asymmetric exclusion
process. Our results can be described in the terms of a scaling ansatz that
involves the dynamical exponent z. We also calculate the generating function of
the activity near the absorbing state transition of the contact process. Its
scaling properties can be expressed in terms of known critical exponents.
