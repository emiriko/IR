A hight degree of spin polarization is achieved for a Mn atom localized in a
semiconductor quantum dot using quasi-resonant optical excitation at zero
magnetic field. Optically created spin polarized carriers generate an energy
splitting of the Mn spin and enable magnetic moment orientation controlled by
the photon helicity and energy. The dynamics and the magnetic field dependence
of the optical pumping mechanism shows that the spin lifetime of an isolated Mn
atom at zero magnetic field is controlled by a magnetic anisotropy induced by
the built-in strain in the quantum dots.
