In every dimension $d\ge1$, we establish the existence of a constant $v_d>0$
and of a subset $\mathcal U_d$ of $\mathbb R^d$ such that the following holds:
$\mathcal C+\mathcal U_d=\mathbb R^d$ for every convex set $\mathcal C\subset
\mathbb R^d$ of volume at least $v_d$ and $\mathcal U_d$ contains at most
$\log(r)^{d-1}r^d$ points at distance at most $r$ from the origin, for every
large $r$.
