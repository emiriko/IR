We obtain explicitly the renormalization group equations for the quark mass
matrices in terms of a set of rephasing invariant parameters. For a range of
assumed high energy values for the mass ratios and mixing parameters, they are
found to evolve rapidly and develop hierarchies as the energy scale decreases.
To achieve the experimentally observed high degree of hierarchy, however, the
introduction of new models with specific properties becomes necessary.
