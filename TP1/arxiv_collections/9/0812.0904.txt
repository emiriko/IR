In this letter, we present a closed-form approximation of the outage
probability for the multi-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems with
fixed gain in Rayleigh fading channel. The approximation is derived from the
outage event for each hop. The simulation results show the tightness of the
proposed approximation in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.
