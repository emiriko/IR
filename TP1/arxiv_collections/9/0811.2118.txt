The magnetic behavior of molecular Single-Chain Magnets is investigated in
the framework of a one-dimensional Ising model with single spin-flip Glauber
dynamics. Opportune modifications to the original theory are required in order
to account for reciprocal non-collinearity of local anisotropy axes and the
crystallographic (laboratory) frame. The extension of Glauber's theory to the
case of a collinear Ising ferrimagnetic chain is also discussed. Within this
formalism, both the dynamics of magnetization reversal in zero field and the
response of the system to a weak magnetic field, oscillating in time, are
studied. Depending on the geometry, selection rules are found for the
occurrence of slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures, as well
as for resonant behavior of the a.c. susceptibility as a function of
temperature at low frequencies. The present theory applies successfully to some
real systems, namely Mn-, Dy-, and Co-based molecular magnetic chains, showing
that Single-Chain-Magnet behavior is not only a feature of collinear ferro- and
ferrimagnetic, but also of canted antiferromagnetic chains.
