We present a theoretical study for adhesion-induced lateral phase separation
for a membrane with short stickers, long stickers and repellers confined
between two hard walls. The effects of confinement and repellers on lateral
phase separation are investigated. We find that the critical potential depth of
the stickers for lateral phase separation increases as the distance between the
hard walls decreases. This suggests confinement-induced or force-induced mixing
of stickers. We also find that stiff repellers tend to enhance, while soft
repellers tend to suppress adhesion-induced lateral phase separation.
