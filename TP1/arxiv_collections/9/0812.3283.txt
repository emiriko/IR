A peculiar feature, observed in the BaBar data on e+e- -> baryon-antibaryon
cross sections, is the non-vanishing cross section at threshold for all these
processes. This is the expectation due to the Coulomb enhancement factor acting
on a charged fermion pair. Remarkably, in the case of e+e- -> p-pbar it is
found that Coulomb final state interactions largely dominate the cross section
at threshold and it turns out a form factor |G(4Mp^2)|~1, as a point-like
fermion. Also in the case of e+e- -> Lambda_c-antiLambda_c, as recently
measured by Belle for the first time, a point-like behavior is suggested for
the charmed charged baryon, being the Lambda_c form factor at threshold |G|~1,
even if within a large error. In the case of neutral strange baryons the
non-vanishing cross section at threshold is interpreted as a remnant of quark
pair Coulomb interaction before the hadronization, taking into account the
asymmetry between attractive and repulsive Coulomb factors. Besides strange
baryon cross sections are successfully compared to U-spin invariance
relationships.
