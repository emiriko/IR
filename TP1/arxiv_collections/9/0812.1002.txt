We recently reported the formation of ultracold LiCs molecules in the
rovibrational ground state X1Sigma+,v''=0,J''=0 [J. Deiglmayr et al., PRL 101,
133004 (2008)]. Here we discuss details of the experimental setup and present a
thorough analysis of the photoassociation step including the photoassociation
line shape. We predict the distribution of produced ground state molecules
using accurate potential nergy curves combined with an ab-initio dipole
transition moment and compare this prediction with experimental ionization
spectra. Additionally we improve the value of the dissociation energy for the
X1Sigma+ state by high resolution spectroscopy of the vibrational ground state.
