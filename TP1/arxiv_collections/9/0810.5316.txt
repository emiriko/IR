We present a thorough characterization of the glassy dynamics of three
propylene glycols (mono-, di- and trimer) by broadband dielectric spectroscopy.
By covering a frequency range of more than 15 decades, we have access to the
entire variety of dynamic processes typical for glassy dynamics. These results
add three more molecular glass formers to the sparse list of materials for
which real broadband spectra, including the region of the fast beta-process,
are available. Some first analyses of the various observed dynamic processes
are provided.
