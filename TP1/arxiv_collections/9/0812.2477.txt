Any extension of the standard model that aims to describe TeV-scale physics
without fine-tuning must have a radiatively-stable Higgs potential. In little
Higgs theories, radiative stability is achieved through so-called collective
symmetry breaking. In this letter, we focus on the necessary conditions for a
little Higgs to have a collective Higgs quartic coupling. In one-Higgs doublet
models, a collective quartic requires an electroweak triplet scalar. In
two-Higgs doublet models, a collective quartic requires a triplet or singlet
scalar. As a corollary of this study, we show that some little Higgs theories
have dangerous singlets, a pathology where collective symmetry breaking does
not suppress quadratically-divergent corrections to the Higgs mass.
