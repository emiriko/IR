A bilayer lens is proposed based on transformation optics. It is shown that
Pendry's perfect lens, perfect bilayer lens made of indefinite media, and the
concept of compensated media are well unified under the scope of the proposed
bilayer lens. Using this concept, we also demonstrate how one is able to
achieve perfect imaging beyond passive objects or active sources which are
present in front of the lens.
