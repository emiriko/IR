We give a general proof for the existence and realizability of Clifford gates
in the Ising topological quantum computer. We show that all quantum gates that
can be implemented by braiding of Ising anyons are Clifford gates. We find that
the braiding gates for two qubits exhaust the entire two-qubit Clifford group.
Analyzing the structure of the Clifford group for n \geq 3 qubits we prove that
the the image of the braid group is a non-trivial subgroup of the Clifford
group so that not all Clifford gates could be implemented by braiding in the
Ising topological quantum computation scheme. We also point out which Clifford
gates cannot in general be realized by braiding.
