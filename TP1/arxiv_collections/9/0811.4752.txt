Using the technique of quantum transport of the interfering pair we examine
the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry signatures for the
particle-emitting sources of pions and kaons produced in the heavy ion
collisions at GSI-FAIR energies. The evolution of the sources is described by
relativistic hydrodynamics with the system equation of state of the first-order
phase transition from quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to hadronic matter. We use
quantum probability amplitudes in a path-integral formalism to calculate the
two-particle correlation functions, where the effects of particle decay and
multiple scattering are taken into consideration. We find that the HBT radii of
kaons are smaller than those of pions for the same initial conditions. Both the
HBT radii of pions and kaons increase with the system initial energy density.
The HBT lifetimes of the pion and kaon sources are sensitive to the initial
energy density. They are significantly prolonged when the initial energy
density is tuned to the phase boundary between the QGP and mixed phase. This
prolongations of the HBT lifetimes of pions and kaons may likely be observed in
the heavy ion collisions with an incident energy in the GSI-FAIR energy range.
