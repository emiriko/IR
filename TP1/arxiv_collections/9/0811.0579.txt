We present the architecture of the UNL-French deconverter, which "generates"
from the UNL interlingua by first"localizing" the UNL form for French, within
UNL, and then applying slightly adapted but classical transfer and generation
techniques, implemented in GETA's Ariane-G5 environment, supplemented by some
UNL-specific tools. Online interaction can be used during deconversion to
enhance output quality and is now used for development purposes. We show how
interaction could be delayed and embedded in the postedition phase, which would
then interact not directly with the output text, but indirectly with several
components of the deconverter. Interacting online or offline can improve the
quality not only of the utterance at hand, but also of the utterances processed
later, as various preferences may be automatically changed to let the
deconverter "learn".
