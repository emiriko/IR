We explore the sparticle and Higgs spectroscopy of an SU(5) inspired
extension of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). The
universal soft parameter m_0 is replaced by m_{\bar 5} and m_{10}, where
m_{\bar 5} and m_{10} denote universal soft scalar masses associated with
fields in the five and ten dimensional representations of SU(5). The special
case m_{\bar 5} << m_{10} yields a rather characteristic sparticle spectroscopy
which can be tested at the LHC. We highlight a few benchmark points in which
the lightest neutralino saturates the WMAP bound on cold dark matter abundance.
