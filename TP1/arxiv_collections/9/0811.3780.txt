We demonstrate an atomic interferometer based on ultra-cold atoms released
from an optical lattice. This technique yields a large improvement in signal to
noise over a related interferometer previously demonstrated. The interferometer
involves diffraction of the atoms using a pulsed optical lattice. For short
pulses a simple analytical theory predicts the expected signal. We investigate
the interferometer for both short pulses and longer pulses where the analytical
theory break down. Longer pulses can improve the precision and signal size. For
specific pulse lengths we observe a coherent signal at times that differs
greatly from what is expected from the short pulse model. The interferometric
signal also reveals information about the dynamics of the atoms in the lattice.
We investigate the application of the interferometer for a measurement of
$h/m_A$ that together with other well known constants constitutes a measurement
of the fine structure constant.
