We investigate the potential of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to discriminate between two theoretical models
predicting anomalous events with jets and large missing transverse energy,
minimal supersymmetry and Little Higgs with T Parity. We focus on a simple test
case scenario, in which the only exotic particles produced at the LHC are heavy
color-triplet states (squarks or T-quarks), and the only open decay channel for
these particles is into the stable missing-energy particle (neutralino or heavy
photon) plus a quark. We find that in this scenario, the angular and momentum
distributions of the observed jets are sufficient to discriminate between the
two models with a few inverse fb of the LHC data, provided that these
distributions for both models and the dominant Standard Model backgrounds can
be reliably predicted by Monte Carlo simulations.
