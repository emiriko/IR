Folding kinetics of a lattice model of protein is studied. It uses the Random
Energy Model for the intrachain couplings and a temperature dependent free
energy of solvation derived from a realistic hydration model of apolar solutes.
The folding times are computed using Monte Carlo simulations in the region of
the phase diagram where the chain occurs in the native structure. These folding
times are roughly equals for the temperatures of cold and warm denaturation for
a large range of solvent quality. Between these temperatures, the folding times
reach maxima and thus, at low temperatures, the kinetics of the chain always
speeds up as the temperature is decreased. The study of the conformational
space as function of the temperature permits to elucidate this phenomenon. At
low temperature, it shows that the activation barriers of the system decrease
faster than the temperature as the temperature is decreased. At high
temperature, the rate of the barriers over the temperature decreases as the
temperature is increased because the height of the barrier is almost constant.
