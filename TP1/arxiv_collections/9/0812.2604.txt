Markowitz (1952, 1959) laid down the ground-breaking work on the
mean-variance analysis. Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation
vector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to
the intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return
vector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on
empirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this
problem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio
selection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal
portfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on
estimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from
estimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to
the empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that the
no-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved by
allowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the
number of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of
stocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal
sparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical
optimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify all
optimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocation
vectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach is
illustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-French
industrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.
