The triplet superconductivity in $UGe_2$ and $URhGe$ coexists with itinerant
ferromagnetism such that in the pressure-temperature phase diagram the whole
region occupied by the superconducting state is situated inside a more vast
ferromagnetic region. In the same family metal UCoGe the pressure dependent
critical lines T_{Curie}(P) and T_{sc}(P) of the ferromagnet and the
superconducting phase transitions intersect each other. The two-band
multidomain superconducting ferromagnet state arises at temperatures below both
of these lines. Here I describe the symmetry and the order parameters of the
paramagnet as well of the multidomain ferromagnet superconducting states. The
Josephson coupling between two adjacent ferromagnet superconducting domains is
discussed.
