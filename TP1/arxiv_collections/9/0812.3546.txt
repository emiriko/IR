We study the exact entanglement dynamics of two qubits in a common structured
reservoir. We demonstrate that, for certain classes of entangled states,
entanglement sudden death occurs, while for certain initially factorized
states, entanglement sudden birth takes place. The backaction of the
non-Markovian reservoir is responsible for revivals of entanglement after
sudden death has occurred, and also for periods of disentanglement following
entanglement sudden birth.
