The relaxation of initially straight semiflexible polymers has been discussed
mainly with respect to the longest relaxation time. The biologically relevant
non-equilibrium dynamics on shorter times is comparatively poorly understood,
partly because "initially straight" can be realized in manifold ways. Combining
Brownian dynamics simulations and systematic theory, we demonstrate how
different experimental preparations give rise to specific short-time and
universal long-time dynamics. We also discuss boundary effects and the onset of
the stretch--coil transition.
