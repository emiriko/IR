The extended semantic realism (ESR) model embodies the mathematical formalism
of standard (Hilbert space) quantum mechanics in a noncontextual framework,
reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional instead of absolute. We
provide here an improved version of this model and show that it predicts that,
whenever idealized measurements are performed, a modified
Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (BCHSH) inequality holds if one takes into
account all individual systems that are prepared, standard quantum predictions
hold if one considers only the individual systems that are detected, and a
standard BCHSH inequality holds at a microscopic (purely theoretical) level.
These results admit an intuitive explanation in terms of an unconventional kind
of unfair sampling and constitute a first example of the unified perspective
that can be attained by adopting the ESR model.
