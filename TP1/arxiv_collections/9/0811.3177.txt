The 1996 Brune {\it et al.} experiment on vacuum Rabi oscillation is analyzed
by means of alternative models of atom-reservoir interaction. Agreement with
experimental Rabi oscillation data can be obtained if one defines jump
operators in the dressed-state basis, and takes into account thermal
fluctuations between dressed states belonging to the same manifold. Such
low-frequency transitions could be ignored in a closed cavity, but the cavity
employed in the experiment was open, which justifies our assumption. The cavity
quality factor corresponding to the data is $Q=3.31\cdot 10^{10}$, whereas $Q$
reported in the experiment was $Q=7\cdot 10^7$. The rate of decoherence arising
from opening of the cavity can be of the same order as an analogous correction
coming from finite time resolution $\Delta t$ (formally equivalent to
collisional decoherence). Peres-Horodecki separability criterion shows that the
rate at which the atom-field state approaches a separable state is controlled
by fluctuations between dressed states from the same manifold, and not by the
rate of transitions towards the ground state. In consequence, improving the $Q$
factor we do not improve the coherence properties of the cavity.
