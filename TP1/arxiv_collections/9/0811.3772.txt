Despite the obvious utility of the concept, it has often been argued that
time does not exist. I take the opposite perspective: let's imagine that time
does exist, and the universe is described by a quantum state obeying ordinary
time-dependent quantum mechanics. Reconciling this simple picture with the
known facts about our universe turns out to be a non-trivial task, but by
taking it seriously we can infer deep facts about the fundamental nature of
reality. The arrow of time finds a plausible explanation in a "Heraclitean
universe," described by a quantum state eternally evolving in an
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
