Under the operational restriction of the U(1)-superselection rule, states
that contain coherences between eigenstates of particle number constitute a
resource. Such resources can be used to facilitate operations upon systems that
otherwise cannot be performed. However, the process of doing this consumes
reference resources. We show this explicitly for an example of a unitary
operation that is forbidden by the U(1)-superselection rule.
