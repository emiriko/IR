The multirank separable kernels of the neutron-proton interaction for
uncoupled $S$ and $P$ partial waves (with the total angular momentum $J$=0,1)
are proposed. Two different methods of a relativistic generalization of
initially nonrelativistic form factors parametrizing the kernel are considered.
Using the constructed kernels the experimental data for phase shifts in the
elastic neutron-proton scattering for the laboratory energy up to 3 GeV and
low-energy parameters are described. The comparison of our results with other
model calculations are presented.
