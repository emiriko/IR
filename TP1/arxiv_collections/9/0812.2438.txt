The continuous wavelet transform may be enhanced by deconvolution with the
wavelet response function. After correcting for the cone-of-influence, the
power spectral density of the solar magnetic record as given by the derectified
yearly sunspot number is calculated, revealing a spectrum of odd harmonics of
the fundamental Hale cycle, and the integrated instant power is compared to a
reconstruction of global temperature in a normalized scatter plot displaying a
positive correlation after the turn of the twentieth century. Comparison of the
spectrum with that obtained from the Central England Temperature record
suggests that some features are shared while others are not, and the scatter
plot again indicates a possible correlation.
