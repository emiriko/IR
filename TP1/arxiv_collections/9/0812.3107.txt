We further define two-parameter quantum affine algebra
$U_{r,s}(\widehat{\frak {sl}_n})$ $(n>2)$ after the work on the finite cases
(see [BW1], [BGH1], [HS] & [BH]), which turns out to be a Drinfel'd double. Of
importance for the quantum {\it affine} cases is that we can work out the
compatible two-parameter version of the Drinfel'd realization as a quantum
affinization of $U_{r,s}(\frak{sl}_n)$ and establish the Drinfel'd isomorphism
Theorem in the two-parameter setting, via developing a new combinatorial
approach (quantum calculation) to the quantum {\it affine} Lyndon basis we
present (with an explicit valid algorithm based on the use of Drinfel'd
generators).
