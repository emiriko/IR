Colmez has given a recipe to associate a smooth modular representation
Omega(W) of the Borel subgroup of GL_2(Q_p) to a F_p^bar-representation W of
Gal(Qp^bar/Qp) by using Fontaine's theory of (phi,Gamma)-modules. We compute
Omega(W) explicitly and we prove that if W is irreducible and dim(W)=2, then
Omega(W) is the restriction to the Borel subgroup of GL_2(Q_p) of the
supersingular representation associated to W in Breuil's correspondence.
