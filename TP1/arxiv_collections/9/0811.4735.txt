Pressure dependence of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations spectra of
the quasi-two di- mensional organic metal (ET)8[Hg4Cl12(C6H5Br)]2 have been
studied up to 1.1 GPa in pulsed magnetic fields of up to 54 T. According to
band structure calculations, its Fermi surface can be regarded as a network of
compensated orbits. The SdH spectra exhibit many Fourier components typical of
such a network, most of them being forbidden in the framework of the
semiclassical model. Their amplitude remains large in all the pressure range
studied which likely rules out chemical potential oscillation as a dominant
contribution to their origin, in agreement with recent calculations relevant to
compensated Fermi liquids. In addition to a strong decrease of the magnetic
breakdown field and effective masses, the latter being likely due to a
reduction of the strength of electron correlations, a sizeable increase of the
scattering rate is observed as the applied pressure increases. This latter
point, which is at variance with data of most charge transfer salts is
discussed in connection with pressure-induced features of the temperature
dependence of the zero-field interlayer resistance
