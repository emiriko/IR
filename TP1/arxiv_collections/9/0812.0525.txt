A detailed experimental study of antiphase dynamics in a two-mode
semiconductor laser with optical injection is presented. The device is a
specially designed Fabry-Perot laser that supports two primary modes with a THz
frequency spacing. Injection in one of the primary modes of the device leads to
a rich variety of single and two-mode dynamical scenarios, which are reproduced
with remarkable accuracy by a four dimensional rate equation model. Numerical
bifurcation analysis reveals the importance of torus bifurcations in mediating
transitions to antiphase dynamics and of saddle-node of limit cycle
bifurcations in switching of the dynamics between single and two-mode regimes.
