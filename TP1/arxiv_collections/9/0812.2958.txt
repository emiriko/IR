We present two different models with electroweak scale right-handed
neutrinos. One of the models is created under the constraint that any addition
to the Standard Model must not introduce new higher scales. The model contains
right-handed neutrinos with electroweak scale masses and a lepton number
violating singlet scalar field. The scalar phenomenology is also presented. The
second model is a triplet Higgs model where again the right-handed neutrinos
have electroweak scale masses. In this case the model has a rich scalar
phenomenology and in particular we present the analysis involving the doubly
charged Higgs.
