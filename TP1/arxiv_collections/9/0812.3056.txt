In 1999, Reg Wood conjectured that the quotient of Q[x_1,...,x_n] by the
action of the rational Steenrod algebra is a graded regular representation of
the symmetric group S_n. As pointed out by Reg Wood, the analog of this
statement is a well known result when the rational Steenrod algebra is replaced
by the ring of symmetric functions; actually, much more is known about the
structure of the quotient in this case.
  We introduce a non-commutative q-deformation of the ring of symmetric
functions, which specializes at q=1 to the rational Steenrod algebra. We use
this formalism to obtain some partial results. Finally, we describe several
conjectures based on an extensive computer exploration. In particular, we
extend Reg Wood's conjecture to q formal and to any q complex not of the form
-a/b, with a in {1,...,n} and b a positive natural number.
