In this paper we study the breaking of chiral symmetry with non-confining
power-like potentials. The region of allowed exponents is identified and, after
the previous study of confining (positive exponent) potentials, we now
specialize in shorter range non-confining potentials, with a negative exponent.
These non-confining potentials are close to the Coulomb potential, and they are
also relevant as corrections to the linear confinement, and as models for the
quark potential at the deconfinement transition. The mass-gap equation is
constructed and solved, and the quarks mass, the chiral angle and the quark
energy are calculated analytically with a exponent expansion in the
neighbourhood of the Coulomb potential. It is demonstrated that chiral symmetry
breaking occurs, but only the chiral invariant false vacuum and a second
non-trivial vacuum exist. Moreover chiral symmetry breaking is led by the UV
part of the potential, with no IR enhancement of the quark mass. Thus the
breaking of chiral symmetry driven by non-confining potentials differs from the
one lead by confining potentials.
