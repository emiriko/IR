We report the observation of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in SrRuO3 using
the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The FMR oscillations in the
time-domain appear in response to a sudden, optically induced change in the
direction of easy-axis anistropy. The high FMR frequency, 250 GHz, and large
Gilbert damping parameter, alpha ~ 1, are consistent with strong spin-orbit
coupling. We find that the parameters associated with the magnetization
dynamics, including alpha, have a non-monotonic temperature dependence,
suggestive of a link to the anomalous Hall effect.
