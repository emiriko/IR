We examine the connection between the dwell time of a quantum particle in a
region of space and flux-flux correlations at the boundaries. It is shown that
the first and second moments of a flux-flux correlation function which
generalizes a previous proposal by Pollak and Miller [E. Pollak and W. H.
Miller, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 53}, 115 (1984)], agree with the corresponding
moments of the dwell-time distribution, whereas the third and higher moments do
not. We also discuss operational approaches and approximations to measure the
flux-flux correlation function and thus the second moment of the dwell time,
which is shown to be characteristically quantum, and larger than the
corresponding classical moment even for freely moving particles.
