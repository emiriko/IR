We present magnetization measurements in single crystals of the tetragonal
$YNi_2B_2C$ compound, which exhibit the phenomenon of peak effect as well as
the second magnetization peak anomaly for H $>$ 0.5T (H $||$ c). At the lower
field (50mT $<$ H $<$ 200mT), we have observed the presence of flux jumps,
which seem to relate to a structural change in the local symmetry of the flux
line lattice (a first order re-orientation transition across a local field in
some parts of the sample, in the range of 100mT to 150mT). These flux jumps are
also observed in a single crystal of $LuNi_2B_2C$ for H $||$ c in the field
region from 2 mT to 25 mT, which are compatible with the occurrence of a
re-orientation transition at a lower field in a cleaner crystal of this
compound, as compared to those of $YNi_2B_2C$. Vortex phase diagrams drawn for
H $||$ c in $LuNi_2B_2C$ and $YNi_2B_2C$ show that the ordered elastic glass
phase spans a larger part of (H, T) space in the former as compared to latter,
thereby, reaffirming the difference in the relative purity of the two samples.
