We present a procedure for finding the exact solution to the linear-response
Boltzmann equation for two-dimensional anisotropic systems and demonstrate it
on examples of non-crystalline anisotropic magnetoresistance in a system with
spin-orbit interaction. We show that two decoupled integral equations must be
solved in order to find the non-equilibrium distribution function up to linear
order in the applied electric field. The examples are all based on the Rashba
system with charged magnetic scatterers, a system where the non-equilibrium
distribution function and anisotropic magnetoresistance can be evaluated
analytically. Exact results are compared to earlier widely-used approximative
approaches. We find circumstances under which approximative approaches may
become unreliable even on a qualitative level.
