One-dimensional Ni/Ni3C core-shell nanoball chains with an average diameter
by around 30 nm were synthesized by means of a mild chemical solution method
using a soft template of trioctylphosphineoxide (TOPO). It was revealed that
the uniform Ni nanochains were capped with Ni3C thin shells by about 1 to 4 nm
in thickness and each Ni core consists of polygrains. The coercivity of the
core-shell nanochains is much enhanced (600 Oe at 5 K) and comparable with
single Ni nanowires due to the one-dimensional shape anisotropy. Deriving from
the distinctive structure of Ni core and Ni3C shell, this architecture may
possess a possible bi-functionality. This unique architecture is also useful
for the study on the magnetization reversal mechanism of one-dimensional
magnetic nanostructure.
