The thermodynamic properties of the ferromagnetic perovskite YTiO$_3$ are
investigated by thermal expansion, magnetostriction, specific heat, and
magnetization measurements. The low-temperature spin-wave contribution to the
specific heat, as well as an Arrott plot of the magnetization in the vicinity
of the Curie temperature $T_C\simeq27$ K, are consistent with a
three-dimensional Heisenberg model of ferromagnetism. However, a magnetic
contribution to the thermal expansion persists well above $T_C$, which
contrasts with typical three-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnets, as shown by a
comparison with the corresponding model system EuS. The pressure dependences of
$T_C$ and of the spontaneous moment $M_s$ are extracted using thermodynamic
relationships. They indicate that ferromagnetism is strengthened by uniaxial
pressures $\mathbf{p}\parallel \mathbf{a}$ and is weakened by uniaxial
pressures $\mathbf{p}\parallel \mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$ and hydrostatic pressure.
Our results show that the distortion along the $a$- and $b$-axes is further
increased by the magnetic transition, confirming that ferromagnetism is favored
by a large GdFeO$_3$-type distortion. The c-axis results however do not fit
into this simple picture, which may be explained by an additional
magnetoelastic effect, possibly related to a Jahn-Teller distortion.
