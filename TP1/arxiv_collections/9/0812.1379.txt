The distributed (Delta + 1)-coloring problem is one of most fundamental and
well-studied problems of Distributed Algorithms. Starting with the work of Cole
and Vishkin in 86, there was a long line of gradually improving algorithms
published. The current state-of-the-art running time is O(Delta log Delta +
log^* n), due to Kuhn and Wattenhofer, PODC'06. Linial (FOCS'87) has proved a
lower bound of 1/2 \log^* n for the problem, and Szegedy and Vishwanathan
(STOC'93) provided a heuristic argument that shows that algorithms from a wide
family of locally iterative algorithms are unlikely to achieve running time
smaller than \Theta(Delta log Delta).
  We present a deterministic (Delta + 1)-coloring distributed algorithm with
running time O(Delta) + 1/2 log^* n. We also present a tradeoff between the
running time and the number of colors, and devise an O(Delta * t)-coloring
algorithm with running time O(Delta / t + \log^* n), for any parameter t, 1 < t
< Delta^{1-epsilon}, for an arbitrarily small constant epsilon, 0 < epsilon <
1.
  On the way to this result we study a generalization of the notion of graph
coloring, which is called defective coloring. In an m-defective p-coloring the
vertices are colored with p colors so that each vertex has up to m neighbors
with the same color. We show that an m-defective p-coloring with reasonably
small m and p can be computed very efficiently. We also develop a technique to
employ multiple defect colorings of various subgraphs of the original graph G
for computing a (Delta+1)-coloring of G. We believe that these techniques are
of independent interest.
