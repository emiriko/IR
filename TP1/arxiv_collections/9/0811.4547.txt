We observe a seemingly complex magnetic field dependence of dielectric
constant of hexagonal YbMnO3 near the spin ordering temperature. After
rescaling, the data taken at different temperatures and magnetic fields
collapse on a single curve describing the sharp anomaly in nonlinear
magnetoelectric response at the magnetic transition. We show that this anomaly
is a result of the competition between two magnetic phases. The scaling and the
shape of the anomaly are explained using the phenomenological Landau
description of the competing phases in hexagonal manganites.
