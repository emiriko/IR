Relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (RHFB) theory with density-dependent
meson-nucleon couplings is presented. The integro-differential RHFB equations
are solved by expanding the different components of the quasi-particle spinors
in the complete set of eigen-solutions of the Dirac equations with Woods-Saxon
potentials. Using the finite-range Gogny force D1S as an effective interaction
in the pairing channel, systematic RHFB calculations are performed for Sn
isotopes and N=82 isotones. It is demonstrated that an appropriate description
of both mean field and pairing effects can be obtained within RHFB theory with
finite range Gogny pairing forces. Better systematics are also found in the
regions from the stable to the neutron-rich side with the inclusion of Fock
terms, especially in the presence of $\rho$-tensor couplings.
