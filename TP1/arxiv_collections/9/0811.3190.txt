The presence of strong local fluctuations -- dynamical heterogeneities -- has
been observed near the glass transitions of a wide variety of materials. Here
we explore the possible presence of universality in those fluctuations. We
compare the statistical properties of fluctuations obtained from numerical
simulations of four different glass-forming systems: two polymer systems and
two particle systems. We find strong evidence for universality, both in the
qualitative behavior of the fluctuations and in the remarkable agreement of the
scaling functions describing them.
