The recently discovered iron arsenide superconductors, which display
superconducting transition temperatures as high as 55 K, appear to share a
number of general features with high-Tc cuprates, including proximity to a
magnetically ordered state and robustness of the superconductivity in the
presence of disorder. Here we show that superconductivity in Fe1+dSe, the
parent compound of the superconducting arsenide family, is destroyed by very
small changes in stoichiometry. Further, we show that non-superconducting
Fe1+dSe is not magnetically ordered down to low temperatures. These results
suggest that robust superconductivity and immediate instability against an
ordered magnetic state should not be considered as intrinsic characteristics of
iron-based superconducting systems, and that Fe1+dSe may present a unique
opportunity for determining which materials characteristics are critical to the
existence of superconductivity in high Tc iron arsenide superconductors and
which are not.
