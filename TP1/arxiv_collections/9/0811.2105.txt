Taking a phenomenological approach, we study a color sextet scalar at the
LHC. We focus on the QCD production of a color sextet pair \Phi_6\bar{\Phi}_{6}
through gg fusion and q\bar{q} annihilation. Its unique coupling to
\bar{\psi^c}\psi allows the color sextet scalar to decay into same-sign diquark
states, such as \Phi_6\to tt/tt^*. We propose a new reconstruction in the
multijet plus same sign dilepton with missing transverse energy samples to
search for on-shell tt\bar{t}\bar{t} final states from sextet scalar pair
production. Thanks to the large QCD production, the search covers the sextet
mass range up to 1 TeV for 100 fb^-1 integrated luminosity.
