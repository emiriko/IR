A religion affiliation can be considered as a "degree of freedom" of an agent
on the human genre network. A brief review is given on the state of the art in
data analysis and modelization of religious "questions" in order to suggest and
if possible initiate further research, ... after using a "statistical physics
filter". We present a discussion of the evolution of 18 so called religions, as
measured through their number of adherents between 1900 and 2000. Some emphasis
is made on a few cases presenting a minimum or a maximum in the investigated
time range, - thereby suggesting a competitive ingredient to be considered,
beside the well accepted "at birth" attachement effect. The importance of the
"external field" is still stressed through an Avrami late stage crystal
growth-like parameter. The observed features and some intuitive interpretations
point to opinion based models with vector, rather than scalar, like agents.
