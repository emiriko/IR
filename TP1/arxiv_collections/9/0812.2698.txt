It is shown that quantum logic is a logic in the very same way in which
classical logic is a logic. Soundness and completeness of both quantum and
classical logics have been proved for novel lattice models that are not
orthomodular and therefore cannot be distributive either - as opposed to the
standard lattice models that are orthomodular and distributive for the
respective logics. Hence, we cannot attribute the orthomodularity to quantum
logic itself, and we cannot attribute the distributivity to classical logic
itself. The valuations of logics with respect of novel models turn out to be
non-numerical, and therefore truth values and truth tables cannot in general be
ascribed to the propositions of logics themselves but only to the variables of
some of their models -for example, the two-valued Boolean algebra. Logics are,
first of all, axiomatic deductive systems, and if we stop short of considering
their semantics (models, valuations, etc.), then both quantum and classical
logics will have a completely equal footing in the sense of being two deductive
systems that differ from each other in a few axioms and nothing else. There is
no ground for considering either of the two logics more "proper" than the
other. Semantics of these logics belong to their models, and we show that there
are bigger differences between the two aforementioned classical models than
between two corresponding quantum and classical models.
