We study the equilibrium conformations of a grafted polyelectrolyte (PE) in
the presence of explicit counterions (CI) using Monte Carlo simulations. The
interplay between attractive Lennard-Jones interactions (parametrized by
epsilon), and electrostatics (parametrized by A = q^2l_B/a, where q =counterion
valency, l_B = Bjerrum length and a = monomer diameter), results in a variety
of conformations, characterized as extended (E), pearls with m beads (P_m),
sausage (S) and globular (G). For large epsilon, we observe a transition from G
-> P_2 -> P_3 -> . . . -> S -> G with increasing A, i.e., a change from poor to
good, to reentrant poor solvent, whereas, at lower epsilon, the sequence of
transitions is, E -> S -> G. The conformation changes are directly related to
the nature of binding of CI onto the PE. The transition between S -> G is
continuous and associated with critical fluctuations in the shape driven by
fluctuations in the fraction of condensed CI.
