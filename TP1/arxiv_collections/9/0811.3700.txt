Parity-violating asymmetries in polarized electron scattering have been
interpreted as the asymmetries between opposite helicities of incoming fermion
based on the approximation of the spin polarization operator. Here exact
calculations of cross sections for parity-violating asymmetries in SLAC E158
and SLD have been performed using spin projection operators. And the
parity-violating factor incorporating with spin polarization and momentum has
been identified and shown that its sign depends on the spin polarization of
incoming particle and the relative velocity of incoming and target particles.
Therefore, I suggest a new concept of relative spin polarization to interpret
the parity-violating asymmetry as contributed by the antisymmetric nature of
the weak interactions depending on whether the spin direction of the incoming
electron is inward or outward relative to the target electron.
