This communication reports the formation of complex Langmuir monolayer at the
air-water interface with the water-soluble -trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)
molecules when interacted with the stearic acid (SA) molecules. The reaction
kinetics of the formation of the CTAB-SA complex was monitored by observing the
surface pressure versus time graph. Multilayered LB films of this complex doped
with congo red was successfully formed onto a quartz substrate. UV-Vis
absorption and steady state fluorescence spectroscopic characteristics of this
doped LB films confirms the successful incorporation of congo red molecules in
to the CTAB-SA complex films.
