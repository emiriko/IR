The reactions induced by the weakly bound 6Li projectile interacting with the
intermediate mass target 59Co were investigated. Light charged particles
singles and $\alpha$-$d$ coincidence measurements were performed at the near
barrier energies E_lab = 17.4, 21.5, 25.5 and 29.6 MeV. The main contributions
of the different competing mechanisms are discussed. A statistical model
analysis, Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels calculations and two-body
kinematics were used as tools to provide information to disentangle the main
components of these mechanisms. A significant contribution of the direct
breakup was observed through the difference between the experimental sequential
breakup cross section and the CDCC prediction for the non-capture breakup cross
section.
