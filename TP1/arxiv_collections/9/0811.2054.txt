The possibility of adiabatically cooling a spin-1 polar Bose gas to a
spin-nematic phase is theoretically discussed. The relation between the order
parameter of the final spin-nematic phase and the starting temperature of the
spinor Bose gas is obtained both using the mean-field approach for the high
temperature and spin-wave approach for the low temperature. We find that there
exists a good possibility to reach the spin-nematic ordering starting with
spinor antiferromagnetic Bose gases.
