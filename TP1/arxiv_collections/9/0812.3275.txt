Extending the construction of the (intrinsically defined) full algebra of
scalar valued Colombeau functions on a smooth manifold M (Grosser et al., Adv.
Math. 166 (2002), 179-206) we present a suitable basic space for eventually
obtaining tensor valued generalized functions on M, via the usual quotient
construction. This basic space canonically contains the tensor valued
distributions and permits a natural extension of the classical Lie derivative.
Its members are smooth functions depending - via a third slot - on so-called
transport operators, in addition to slots one (smooth n-forms on M) and two
(points of M) from the scalar case.
