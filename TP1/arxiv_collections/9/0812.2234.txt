We investigate the near-horizon limit of extremally rotating NS5-branes. The
resulting geometry has SL(2,R) \times U(1)^2 isometry. The asymptotic symmetry
group contains a chiral Virasoro algebra, and we obtain two different
realizations depending on the boundary conditions we impose. When one of the
two angular momenta vanishes, the symmetry is enhanced to AdS_3. The entropy of
the boundary theory can be estimated from the Cardy formula and it agrees with
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the bulk theory. We can embed the extremally
rotating NS5-brane geometry in an exactly solvable string background, which may
yield microscopic understanding of this duality, especially about the
mysterious enhancement of the symmetry from AdS_2 to AdS_3. The construction
suggests emerging Virasoro symmetries in the extreme corner of the (1+5)
dimensional little string theory.
