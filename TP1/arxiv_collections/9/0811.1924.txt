Charge transport properties of thin films of sol--gel processed undoped and
Al-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles with variable doping level between 0.8 at%
and 10 at% were investigated. The X-ray diffraction studies revealed a decrease
of the average crystallite sizes in highly doped samples. We provide estimates
of the conductivity and the resulting charge carrier densities with respect to
the doping level. The increase of charge carrier density due to extrinsic
doping were compared to the accumulation of charge carriers in field effect
transistor structures. This allowed to assess the scattering effects due to
extrinsic doping on the electron mobility. The latter decreases from 4.6*10^-3
cm^2/Vs to 4.5*10^-4 cm^2/Vs with increasing doping density. In contrast, the
accumulation leads to an increasing mobility up to 1.5*10^-2 cm^2/Vs. The
potential barrier heights related to grain boundaries between the crystallites
were derived from temperature dependent mobility measurements. The extrinsic
doping initially leads to a grain boundary barrier height lowering, followed by
an increase due to doping-induced structural defects. We conclude that the
conductivity of sol--gel processed nanocrystalline ZnO:Al is governed by an
interplay of the enhanced charge carrier density and the doping-induced charge
carrier scattering effects, achieving a maximum at 0.8 at% in our case.
