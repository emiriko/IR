The rotation of a quantum liquid induces vortices to carry angular momentum.
When the system is composed of multiple components that are distinguishable
from each other, vortex cores in one component may be filled by particles of
the other component, and coreless vortices form. Based on evidence from
computational methods, here we show that the formation of coreless vortices
occurs very similarly for repulsively interacting bosons and fermions, largely
independent of the form of the particle interactions. We further address the
connection to the Halperin wave functions of non-polarized quantum Hall states.
