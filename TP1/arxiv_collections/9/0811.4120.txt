We have developed and tested several new designs of GEM detectors with
micropattern electrodes manufactured by microelectronic technology. In one
design, the inner layer of the detector electrode consists of thin metallic
strips and the outer layer is made of a resistive grid manufactured by a screen
printing technology. In other designs, the electrodes were made of metallic
strips fed by HV via micro-resistors manufactured by a screen printing
technology. Due to these features, the new detectors have several important
advantages over conventional GEMs or ordinary thick GEMs. For example, the
resistive grid (in the first design) and the screen printed resistors (in other
designs) limited the current in case of discharges, making these detectors
intrinsically spark-protected.
  We will here describe our tests with the photosensitive versions of these
detectors (coated with CsI layers) and the efforts of implementing them in
several applications. In particular, we will focus on our activity towards the
ALICE RICH detector upgrade and on tests of simplified prototypes of cryogenic
dark matter detectors.
