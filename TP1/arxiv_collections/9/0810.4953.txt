We study the robustness of a fault-tolerant quantum computer subject to
Gaussian non-Markovian quantum noise, and we show that scalable quantum
computation is possible if the noise power spectrum satisfies an appropriate
"threshold condition." Our condition is less sensitive to very-high-frequency
noise than previously derived threshold conditions for non-Markovian noise.
