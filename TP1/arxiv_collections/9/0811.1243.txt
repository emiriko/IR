Entangled multi-spatial-mode fields have interesting applications in quantum
information, such as parallel quantum information protocols, quantum computing,
and quantum imaging. We study the use of a nondegenerate four-wave mixing
process in rubidium vapor at 795 nm to demonstrate generation of
quantum-entangled images. Owing to the lack of an optical resonator cavity, the
four-wave mixing scheme generates inherently multi-spatial-mode output fields.
We have verified the presence of entanglement between the multi-mode beams by
analyzing the amplitude difference and the phase sum noise using a dual
homodyne detection scheme, measuring more than 4 dB of squeezing in both cases.
This paper will discuss the quantum properties of amplifiers based on
four-wave-mixing, along with the multi mode properties of such devices.
