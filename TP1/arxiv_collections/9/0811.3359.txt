In modern surgery, a multitude of minimally intrusive operational techniques
are used which are based on the punctual heating of target zones of human
tissue via laser or radio-frequency currents. Traditionally, these processes
are modeled by the bioheat equation introduced by Pennes, who considers
Fourier's theory of heat conduction. We present an alternative and more
realistic model established by the hyperbolic equation of heat transfer. To
demonstrate some features and advantages of our proposed method, we apply the
obtained results to different types of tissue heating with high energy fluxes,
in particular radiofrequency heating and pulsed laser treatment of the cornea
to correct refractive errors. Hopefully, the results of our approach help to
refine surgical interventions in this novel field of medical treatment.
