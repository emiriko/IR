The Ettore Majorana paper - Theory of incomplete P triplets- published in
1931, focuses on the role of selection rules for the non-radiative decay of two
electron excitations in atomic spectra, involving the configuration interaction
between discrete and continuum channels. This work is a key step for
understanding the 1935 work of Ugo Fano on the asymmetric lineshape of two
electron excitations and the 1958 Herman Feshbach paper on the shape resonances
in nuclear scattering arising from configuration interaction between many
different scattering channels. The Feshbach resonances are today of high
scientific interest in many different fields and in particular for ultracold
gases and high Tc superconductivity.
