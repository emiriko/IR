We introduce a scheme to perform universal quantum computation in quantum
cellular automata (QCA) fashion in arbitrary subsystem dimension (not
necessarily finite). The scheme is developed over a one spatial dimension
$N$-element array, requiring only mirror symmetric logical encoding and global
pulses. A mechanism using ancillary degrees of freedom for subsystem specific
measurement is also presented.
