We study a new signature of lepton flavor violation (LFV) at the Photon
Collider (PC) within Supersymmetric (SUSY) theories. We consider the minimal
supersymmetric standard model within a large $\tan\beta$ scenario with all
superpartner masses in the ${\cal O}$(TeV) while the heavy Higgs bosons masses
lie below the TeV and develop sizable loop induced LFV couplings to the
leptons. We consider a photon collider based on an $e^+e^-$ linear collider
with $\sqrt{s}=800$ GeV with the parameters of the TESLA proposal and show
that, with the expected integrated $\gamma\gamma$-luminosity
$L_{\gamma\gamma}=200\div 500$ fb$^{-1}$, the "$\mu\tau$ fusion" mechanism is
the dominant channel for the process $\gaga\to\mu\tau b\bar{b}$ providing
detailed analytical and numerical studies of the signal and backgrounds. We
impose on the parameter space present direct and indirect constraints from $B$
physics and rare LFV $\tau$-decays and find that the LFV signal can be probed
for masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons $A,H$ from 300 GeV up to the
kinematical limit $\simeq 600$ GeV for 30$\leq\tan\beta\leq$60.
