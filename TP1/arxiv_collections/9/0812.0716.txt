We study radiative decays of heavy $Q{\bar Q}$ states, both for $Q=c$ and
$Q=b$, using an effective Lagrangian approach which exploits spin symmetry for
such states. We use existing data on radiative quarkonium transitions to
predict some unmeasured decay rates. We also discuss how these modes can be
useful to understand the structure of X(3872).
