An alternative process is presented for diffractive Higgs boson production in
peripheral $pp$ collisions, where the particles interact through the Double
Pomeron Exchange. The event rate is computed as a central-rapidity distribution
for Tevatron and LHC energies leading to a result around 0.6 pb, higher than
the predictions from previous approaches. Therefore, this result arises as an
enhanced signal for the detection of the Higgs boson in hadron colliders. The
predictions for the Higgs boson photoproduction are compared to the ones
obtained from a similar approach proposed by the Durham group, enabling an
analysis of the future developments of its application to $pp$ and $AA$
collisions.
