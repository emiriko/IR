In this paper we demonstrate a quantitative way to measure the membrane
potential of live cells by dielectric spectroscopy. We also show that the
values of the membrane potential obtained using our technique are in good
agreement with those obtained using traditional methods-voltage sensitive dyes.
The membrane potential is determined by fitting the experimental dielectric
dispersion curves with the dispersion curves obtain from a theoretical model.
Variations in the membrane potential were induced by modifying the
concentration of potassium chloride in the solution of the cell suspension in
the presence of valinomycin. For exemplification of the method, E. coli were
chosen for our experiments.
