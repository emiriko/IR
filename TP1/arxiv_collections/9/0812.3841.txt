The author proves that there is an open non empty set of metrics on any
3-manifold such that there exists a family of stably embedded minimal 2-spheres
whose area is unbounded. This generalizes the work of T. Colding and W.
Minicozzi who have shown an analogous result for the torus and B. Dean who
showed the positive genus case.
