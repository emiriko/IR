A recent publication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 140408 (2008)] shows that there
is a relation between mean-field chaos and multi-particle entanglement for BECs
in a periodically shaken double well. 'Schrodinger-cat' like mesoscopic
superpositions in phase-space occur for conditions for which the system
displays mean-field chaos. In the present manuscript, more general
highly-entangled states are investigated. Mean-field chaos accelerates the
emergence of multi-particle entanglement; the boundaries of stable regions are
particularly suited for entanglement generation.
