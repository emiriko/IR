We consider polynomially and rationally parameterized curves, where the
polynomials in the parameterization have fixed supports and generic
coefficients. We apply sparse (or toric) elimination theory in order to
determine the vertex representation of its implicit polygon, i.e. of the
implicit equation's Newton polygon. In particular, we consider mixed
subdivisions of the input Newton polygons and regular triangulations of point
sets defined by Cayley's trick. We distinguish polynomial and rational
parameterizations, where the latter may have the same or different
denominators; the implicit polygon is shown to have, respectively, up to 4, 5,
or 6 vertices.
