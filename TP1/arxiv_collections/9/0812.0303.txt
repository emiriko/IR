We study the ground state as well as the dynamics of chains of bosons with
local repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbour exchange using numerical
techniques based on density matrix decimation. We explore the development of
entanglement between the terminal sites of such chains as mechanisms are
invoked to concentrate population in these sites. We find that long-range
entanglement in the ground state emerges as a result of hopping taking place at
the whole chain length in systems with appropriate hopping coefficients.
Additionally, we find appropriate perturbations to increase the entanglement
between the end sites above their ground state values.
