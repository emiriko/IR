We recall the argument based both on Dirac's square root procedure and an
intrinsic Pauli principle that sterile fundamental fermions with spin 1/2
(sterinos) ought to appear in Nature in two or three generations, while the
Standard Model leptons and quarks are forced to develop three generations.
Then, sterinos in two or three generations, if stable, lead to the cold dark
matter in two or three species, when the thermal freeze-out mechanism works
properly. If they are stable only in their lowest generation, the so called
exciting cold dark matter may be formed.
