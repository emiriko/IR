Magnetite, Fe$_3$O$_4$, displays a highly complex low temperature crystal
structure that may be charge and orbitally ordered. Many of the recent
experimental claims of such ordering rely on resonant soft x-ray diffraction at
the oxygen K and iron L edges. We have re-examined this system and undertaken
soft x-ray diffraction experiments on a high-quality single crystal. Contrary
to previous claims in the literature, we show that the intensity observed at
the Bragg forbidden (001/2)$_c$ reflection can be explained purely in terms of
the low-temperature structural displacements around the resonant atoms. This
does not necessarily mean that magnetite is not charge or orbitally ordered,
but rather that the present sensitivity of resonant soft x-ray experiments does
not allow conclusive demonstration of such ordering.
