We develop one numerical method to compute black and gray solitons with
Kerr-type nonlocal nonlinearity. As two examples of nonlocal cases, the gray
soliton with exponentially decaying nonlocal response or with Gaussian nonlocal
response are discussed. For such two nonlocal cases, the analytical form of the
tails of nonlocal gray soliton is presented and the analytical relationship for
the maximal transverse velocity of nonlocal gray soliton to the characteristic
nonlocal length is obtained.
