In a recent paper, by working in the orbifold GUT limit of the Heterotic
string, we showed how one could accommodate gauge coupling unification in the
"mini-landscape" models of Lebedev et al. Furthermore, it was shown how one of
the solutions was consistent with the decoupling of other exotics with F=0. In
this short addendum, we show that this solution is also consistent with D=0.
