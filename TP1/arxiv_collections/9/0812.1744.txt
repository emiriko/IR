Auger relaxation in 2D strongly correlated electron gas can be represented as
an Auger-like process for neutral magnetoplasmon excitations. The case of
"dielectric" state with lack of free electrons (i.e. at integer filling $\nu$)
is considered. Really the Auger-like process is a coalescence of two
magnetoplasmons which are converted into a single one of a different plasmon
mode with zero 2D wave-vector. This event turns out to be energetically allowed
for magnetoplasmons near their roton minima where the spectrum has the infinite
density of states. As a result the additional possibility appears for indirect
observation of the magnetorotons by means of anti-Stokes Raman scattering. We
find the rate of this process employing the technique of Excitonic
Representation for the relevant matrix element calculation.
