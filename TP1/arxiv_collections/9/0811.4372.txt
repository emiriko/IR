Evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game is studied where
initially all players are linked via a regular graph, having four neighbors
each. Simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players are allowed to make
new connections and thus permanently extend their neighborhoods, provided they
have been successful in passing their strategy to the opponents. We show that
this simple coevolutionary rule shifts the survival barrier of cooperators
towards high temptations to defect and results in highly heterogeneous
interaction networks with an exponential fit best characterizing their degree
distributions. In particular, there exist an optimal maximal degree for the
promotion of cooperation, warranting the best exchange of information between
influential players.
