Supersymmetric models with spontaneously broken approximate R-symmetry
contain a light spin 0 particle, the R-axion. The properties of the particle
can be a powerful probe of the structure of the new physics. In this paper, we
discuss the possibilities of the R-axion detection at the LHC experiments. It
is challenge to observe this light particle in the LHC environment. However,
for typical values in which the mass of the R-axion is a few hundred MeV, we
show that those particles can be detected by searching for displaced vertices
from R-axion decay.
