The temperature and angular dependence of the upper critical field (Hc2) is
reported for cobalt-doped SrFe2As2 epitaxial films between Tc and 0.5 K in
pulsed magnetic fields up to 50 T. For H parallel c, Hc2 is close to a linear
function of temperature, while in the perpendicular direction there is
significant downward curvature that results in an Hc2 ratio (gamma =
Hc2(perpendicular)/Hc2(parallel) that decreases nearly linearly with
temperature, approaching gamma = 1 at low temperature with Hc2(0) = 47 T. We
measure the complete upper-critical field phase diagram including angular
dependence and model the data using a two band theory allowing us to determine
the anisotropy of both bands, their relative diffusivities, and the
relationship between BCS coupling constant matrix elements. We find an unusual
relationship between the diffusivities of the two bands, with two anisotropic
and opposite bands. This relationship is supported by the observation of a
local maximum for Hc2(parallel) at low temperature.
