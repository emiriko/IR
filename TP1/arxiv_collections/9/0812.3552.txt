Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) predicts a nonsingular evolution of the universe
through a bounce in the high energy region. But LQC has an ambiguity about the
quantization scheme. Recently, the authors in [Phys. Rev. D 77, 124008 (2008)]
proposed a new quantization scheme. Similar to others, this new quantization
scheme also replaces the big bang singularity with the quantum bounce. More
interestingly, it introduces a quantum singularity, which is traversable. We
investigate this novel dynamics quantitatively with a tachyon scalar field,
which gives us a concrete example. Our result shows that our universe can
evolve through the quantum singularity regularly, which is different from the
classical big bang singularity. So this singularity is only a week singularity.
