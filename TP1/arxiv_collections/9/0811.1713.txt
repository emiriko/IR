In this paper after reviewing the Schouten and de Rham definition of impair
and pair differential form fields (not to be confused with differential form
fields of even and odd grades) we prove that in a relativistic spacetime it is
possible (despite claims in contrary) to coherently formulate electromagnetism
(and we believe any other physical theory) using only pair form fields or, if
one wishes, using pair and impair form fields together, in an appropriate way.
Those two distinct descriptions involve only a mathematical choice and do not
seem to lead to any observable physical consequence if due care is taken.
Moreover, we show in details that a formulation of electromagnetic theory in
the Clifford bundle formalism of differential forms where the two Maxwell
equations of the so called free metric approach becomes a single equation is
compatible with both formulations of electromagnetism just mentioned above.
Moreover we derive directly from Maxwell equation the density of force
(coupling of the electromagnetic field with the charge current) that is a
postulate in the free metric approach to electromagnetism. We recall also a
formulation of the engineering version of Maxwell equations using electric and
magnetic fields as objects of the same nature, i.e., without using polar and
axial vectors.
