This is a summary of arXiv:0806.3458, where the low energy effective theory
of type IIA AdS_4 N=1 flux compactifications on nilmanifolds and cosets has
been analyzed. We compute the superpotential, the K\"ahler potential and the
mass spectrum for the light moduli. For the nilmanifold examples we perform a
cross-check on the result for the mass spectrum by calculating it from a direct
Kaluza-Klein reduction.
