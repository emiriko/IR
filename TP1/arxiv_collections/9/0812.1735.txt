To reduce background in experiments looking for rare events, such as the
GERDA double beta decay experiment, it is necessary to employ active
background-suppression techniques. One of such techniques is the pulse shape
analysis of signals induced by the interaction of radiation with the detector.
Analysis of the time-development of the impulses can distinguish between an
interaction of an electron and an interaction of a multiple-scattered photon
inside the detector. This information can be used to eliminate background
events from the recorded data. Results of pulse-shape analysis of signals from
a commercially available broad-energy germanium detector are presented and the
pulse-shape discrimination capability of such detector configuration for use in
low-background experiments is discussed.
