The Persistent Turning Walker Model (PTWM) was introduced by Gautrais et al
in Mathematical Biology for the modelling of fish motion. It involves a
nonlinear pathwise functional of a non-elliptic hypo-elliptic diffusion. This
diffusion solves a kinetic Fokker-Planck equation based on an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Gaussian process. The long time "diffusive" behavior of this
model was recently studied by Degond & Motsch using partial differential
equations techniques. This model is however intrinsically probabilistic. In the
present paper, we show how the long time diffusive behavior of this model can
be essentially recovered and extended by using appropriate tools from
stochastic analysis. The approach can be adapted to many other kinetic
"probabilistic" models.
