We have theoretically investigated the time-evolution of electron transport
from a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) to a quantum dot (QD). We clearly
showed that the coherent electron transport is remarkably modified depending on
the initial electronic state in the 2DES. The electron transport from the 2DES
to the QD is strongly enhanced when the initial state of electron in the 2DES
is localized below the QD. We indicate that these features should be obtained
in other nano-structure-electrode coupled systems, and the electron transport
between the systems having completely different geometrical conditions is
significantly affected by the initial spatial distribution of the electron
density.
