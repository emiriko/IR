We present results for final state charged particle (pseudo-)rapidity
distributions in $\rm{p}$ + $\bar{\rm{p}}$ / $\rm{p}$ + $\rm{p}$ and
Pb+Pb/Au+Au at ultra high energies (17.3 GeV $\leq$ $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ $\leq$
14 TeV) from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD-v2.3)
model. In addition, excitation functions of produced charged particle
multiplicities ($N_{\rm{ch}}$) and pseudorapidity spectra are investigated up
to LHC energies. Good agreement is observed between UrQMD and measured
pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles up to the highest Tevatron
and Sp$\bar{\rm{p}}$S energies.
