We study how parallel chip-firing on the complete graph K_n changes behavior
as we vary the total number of chips. Surprisingly, the activity of the system,
defined as the average number of firings per time step, does not increase
smoothly in the number of chips; instead it remains constant over long
intervals, punctuated by sudden jumps. In the large n limit we find a "devil's
staircase" dependence of activity on the number of chips. The proof proceeds by
reducing the chip-firing dynamics to iteration of a self-map of the circle S^1,
in such a way that the activity of the chip-firing state equals the Poincare
rotation number of the circle map. The stairs of the devil's staircase
correspond to periodic chip-firing states of small period.
