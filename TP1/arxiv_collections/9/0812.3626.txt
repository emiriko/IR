The Lieb-Oxford bound is a constraint upon approximate exchange-correlation
functionals. We explore a non-empirical tightening of that bound in both
universal and electron-number-dependent form. The test functional is PBE.
Regarding both atomization energies (slightly worsened) and bond lengths
(slightly bettered), we find the PBE functional to be remarkably insensitive to
the value of the Lieb-Oxford bound. This both rationalizes the use of the
original Lieb-Oxford constant in PBE and suggests that enhancement factors more
sensitive to sharpened constraints await discovery.
