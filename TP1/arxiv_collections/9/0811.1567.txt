The invariant Hilbert schemes considered in \cite{BC1} were proved to be
affine spaces. The proof relied on the classification of strict wonderful
varieties. We obtain in the present article a classification-free proof of the
affinity of these invariant Hilbert scheme by means of deformation theoretical
arguments. As a consequence we recover in a shorter way the classification of
strict wonderful varieties. This provides an alternative and new approach to
answer Luna's conjecture.
