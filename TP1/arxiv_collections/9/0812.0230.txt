The CP asymmetry in $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$ is expected to be similar to that in
$B^+\to K^+\pi^0$. The experimental data however show $\sim 5\sigma$ difference
between the two, leading to the so called $\Delta {A}_{K\pi}$ puzzle. Employing
sum rule(s) following from (approximate) flavour symmetry, we show that it is
possible to accommodate the observed experimental values within the standard
model (SM) for a narrow range of parameters. Sub-leading terms can bring the
theoretical predictions in better agreement with the data. Resolution via
modified electroweak penguin contributions is possible for a large CP violating
phase generated by the new physics. However, the data on polarization in $B\to
VV(T)$, $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing (and large CP phase) and
$B^+\to\tau^+\nu_{\tau}$ rate can not be simultaneously accommodated within SM
or new physics with only enhanced electroweak penguins. A plausible resolution
to these, and not spoiling the $B\to K\pi$ rates and asymmetries, could be a
general two Higgs doublet model.
