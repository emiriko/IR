We analyze some features of alternative Hermitian and quasi-Hermitian quantum
descriptions of simple and bipartite compound systems. We show that alternative
descriptions of two interacting subsystems are possible if and only if the
metric operator of the compound system can be obtained as tensor product of
positive operators on component spaces. Some examples also show that such
property could be strictly connected with symmetry properties of the
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
