The recent positron excess observed in the PAMELA satellite experiment
strengthens previous experimental findings. We give here an analysis of this
excess in the framework of the Stueckelberg extension of the standard model
which includes an extra $U(1)_X$ gauge field and matter in the hidden sector.
Such matter can produce the right amount of dark matter consistent with the
WMAP constraints. Assuming the hidden sector matter to be Dirac fermions it is
shown that their annihilation can produce the positron excess with the right
positron energy dependence seen in the HEAT, AMS and the PAMELA experiments.
Further test of the proposed model can come at the Large Hadron Collider. The
predictions of the $\bar p/p$ flux ratio also fit the data.
