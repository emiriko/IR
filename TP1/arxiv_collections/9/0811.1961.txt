The quasiparticle recombination time in superconducting films, consisting of
the standard electron-phonon interaction and a yet to be identified low
temperature process, is studied for different densities of magnetic and
nonmagnetic atoms. For both Ta and Al, implanted with Mn, Ta and Al, we observe
an increase of the recombination rate. We conclude that the enhancement of
recombination is not due to the magnetic moment, but arises from an enhancement
of disorder.
