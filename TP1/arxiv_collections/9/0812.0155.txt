We have investigated the doping and temperature dependences of the
pseudogap/superconducting gap in the single-layer cuprate
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The
results clearly exhibit two distinct energy and temperature scales, namely, the
gap around ($\pi$,0) of magnitude $\Delta^*$ and the gap around the node
characterized by the d-wave order parameter $\Delta_0$, like the double-layer
cuprate Bi2212. In comparison with Bi2212 having higher $T_c$'s, $\Delta_0$ is
smaller, while $\Delta^*$ and $T^*$ are similar. This result suggests that
$\Delta^*$ and $T^*$ are approximately material-independent properties of a
single CuO$_2$ plane, in contrast the material-dependent $\Delta_0$,
representing the pairing strength.
