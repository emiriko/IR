We propose a mathematically concrete way of modelling the suggestion that in
quantum gravity the spacetime disappears, replacing it with a discrete
approximation to the causal path space described as an object in a model
category. One of the versions of our models appears as a thickening of
spacetime, which we interpret as a formulation of relational geometry. Avenues
toward constructing an actual quantum theory of gravity on our models are given
a preliminary exploration.
