We consider a quantum two-dimensional O(N)xO(2)/O(N-2)xO(2) nonlinear sigma
model for frustrated spin systems and formulate its 1/N-expansion which
involves fluctuating scalar and vector fields describing kinematic and dynamic
interactions, respectively. The ground state phase diagram of this model is
obtained within the 1/N-expansion and 2+\epsilon renormalization group
approaches. The temperature dependence of correlation length in the
renormalized classical and quantum critical regimes is discussed. In the region
of the symmetry broken ground state \rho_in<\rho_out, \chi_in<\chi_out
(rho_in,out and chi_in,out are the in- and out-of-plane spin stiffnesses and
susceptibilities), where the mass M_\mu of the vector field can be arbitrarily
small, physical properties at finite temperatures are universal functions of
rho_in,out, chi_in,out, and temperature T. For small M_\mu these properties
show a crossover from low- to high temperature regime at T \sim M_\mu. For
\rho_in>\rho_out or \chi_in>\chi_out finite-temperature properties are
universal functions only at sufficiently large M_\mu. The high-energy behaviour
in the latter regime is similar to the Landau-pole dependence of the physical
charge e in quantum electrodynamics, with mass M_\mu playing a role of e^{-1}.
The application of the results obtained to the triangular-lattice Heisenberg
antiferromagnet is considered.
