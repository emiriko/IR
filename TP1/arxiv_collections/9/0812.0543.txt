We present a general scheme for finding or creating a metastable vacuum in
supersymmetric theories. By using the formalism, we show that there is a
parameter region where a metastable vacuum exists in the Wess-Zumino model
coupled to messenger fields. This model serves as a perturbative renormalizable
model of direct gauge mediation.
