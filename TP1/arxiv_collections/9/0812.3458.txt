We develop a renormalization group (RG) procedure that includes important
system-specific features. The key ingredient is to systematize the coarse
graining procedure that generates the RG flow. The coarse graining technology
comes from control and operator theoretic model reduction. The resulting
"generalized" RG is a consistent generalization of the Wilsonian RG. We derive
the form of the projection operator from the dynamics of a nonlinear wave
equation and renormalize the distribution of initial conditions. The
probability density of the initial conditions is chosen to be the Boltzmann
weight for a standard $\phi^4$-theory. In our calculation, we find that in
contrast to conventional implementations of the RG, na\"ive power counting
breaks down. The RG-equations that we derive are different from those derived
from the conventional RG.
