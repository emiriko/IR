We demonstrate a technique for directly measuring the quadratic Zeeman shift
using stimulated Raman transitions.The quadratic Zeeman shift has been measured
yielding [delta][nju] = 1296.8 +/-3.3 Hz/G^{2} for magnetically insensitive
sublevels (5S1/2, F = 2,mF = 0 -> 5S1/2, F = 3,mF = 0) of ^{85}Rb by
compensating the magnetic eld and cancelling the ac Stark shift. We also
measured the cancellation ratio of the differential ac Stark shift due to the
imbalanced Raman beams by using two pairs of Raman beams ([sigma]^{+},
[sigma]^{+}) and it is 1:3.67 when the one-photon detuning is 1.5 GHz in the
experiment.
