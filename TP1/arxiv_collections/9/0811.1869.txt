We construct density dependent Class $III$ charge symmetry violating (CSV)
potential due to mixing of $\rho$-$\omega$ meson with off-shell corrections.
Here in addition to the usual vacuum contribution, the matter induced mixing of
$\rho$-$\omega$ is also included. It is observed that the contribution of
density dependent CSV potential is comparable to that of the vacuum
contribution.
