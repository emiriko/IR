In the present work, we propose a new set of coherent structures that arise
in nonlinear dynamical lattices with more than one components, namely
interlaced solitons. These are waveforms in which in the relevant
anti-continuum limit, i.e. when the sites are uncoupled, one component has
support where the other component does not. We illustrate systematically how
one can combine dynamically stable unary patterns to create ones such for the
binary case of two-components. In the one-dimensional setting, we provide also
a detailed theoretical analysis of the existence and stability of these
waveforms, while in higher dimensions, where such analytical computations are
far more involved, we resort to corresponding numerical computations. Lastly,
we perform direct numerical simulations to showcase how these structures break
up, when exponentially or oscillatorily unstable, to structures with a smaller
number of participating sites.
