We find a set of exact solutions of coherent bright solitons in the
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped in a harmonic
potential, by using a Gaussian laser well (barrier) with oscillating position
to balance the repulsive (attractive) interatomic interaction. The bright
solitons do not deform in propagation and are controlled accurately by the
laser driving which resonates with the trapping potential. The solitonic motion
is more stable for the repulsive BEC than that of the attractive BEC. The
results reveal a different kind of soliton trains compared to that reported
recently in Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 164102 (2008) and suggest an experimental
scheme for generating and controlling the coherent matter-wave solitons.
