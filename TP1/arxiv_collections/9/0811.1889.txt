Motivated by the possibility of further improving the thermoelectric
properties of skutterudites we investigate charge transfer and bonding in this
class of materials using density functional calculations. Results for the CoP3,
CoSb3, LaFe4P12 and the hypothetical FeP3 compounds are presented using the
procrystal as the non-binding reference. Spherical integration and Bader
analysis are performed to illustrate charge transfer differences between these
compounds. The results are in good qualitative agreement with simple
electronegativity considerations. The calculations confirm that the transition
metal-pnictogen and the pnictogen-pnictogen bonds are covalent, while the
filler atom-pnictogen bond is of a more polar and complex nature. The success
of the "rattling" cage as phonon inhibitor is explained by a unique
semi-correlated bonding scheme between lanthanum and phosphorus. Elongated
bonds along the crystal axes surrounds the lanthanum ion and generate a
dodecahedra grid. Vibrations along the crystal axes are then closely connected
to and scatter from the phosphorus rings. In the other directions, a more
uncorrelated vibration is possible. This duality widens the phonon dampening
possibilities.
