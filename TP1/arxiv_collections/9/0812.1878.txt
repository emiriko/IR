An elementary approach for computing the values at negative integers of the
Riemann zeta function is presented. The approach is based on a new method for
ordering the integers and a new method for summation of divergent series. We
show that the values of the Riemann zeta function can be computed, without
using the theory of analytic continuation and functions of complex variable.
