In this paper the Glauber-Gribov approach for deep-inelastic scattering (DIS)
with nuclei is developed in N=4 SYM. It is shown that the amplitude displays
the same general properties, such as geometrical scaling, as is the case in the
high density QCD approach. We found that the quantum effects leading to the
graviton reggeization, give rise to an imaginary part of the nucleon amplitude,
which makes the DIS in N=4 SYM almost identical to the one expected in high
density QCD. We concluded that the impact parameter dependence of the nucleon
amplitude is very essential for N=4 SYM, and the entire kinematic region can be
divided into three regions which are discussed in the paper. We revisited the
dipole description for DIS and proposed a new renormalized Lagrangian for the
shock wave formalism which reproduces the Glauber-Gribov approach in a certain
kinematic region. However the saturation momentum turns out to be independent
of energy, as it has been discussed by Albacete, Kovchegov and Taliotis. We
discuss the physical meaning of such a saturation momentum $Q_s(A)$ and argue
that one can consider only $Q>Q_s(A)$ within the shock wave approximation.
