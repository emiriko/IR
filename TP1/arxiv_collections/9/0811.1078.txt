A completely analytical and unified approach to the theory of chirped-pulse
oscillators is presented. The approach developed is based on the approximate
integration of the generalized nonlinear complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and
demonstrates that a chirped-pulse oscillator is controlled by only two
parameters. It makes it easy to trace spread of the real-world characteristics
of both solid-state and fiber oscillators operating in the positive dispersion
regime.
