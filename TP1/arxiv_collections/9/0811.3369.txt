We report a magnetic x-ray scattering study of the field-induced multiferroic
GdFe3(BO3)4. Resonant x-ray magnetic scattering at the Gd LII,III edges
indicates that the Gd moments order at TN ~ 37 K. The magnetic structure is
incommensurate below TN, with the incommensurability decreasing monotonically
with decreasing temperature until a transition to a commensurate magnetic phase
is observed at T ~ 10 K. Both the Gd and Fe moments undergo a spin
reorientation transition at TSR ~ 9 K such that the moments are oriented along
the crystallographic c axis at low temperatures. With magnetic field applied
along the a axis, our measurements suggest that the field-induced polarization
phase has a commensurate magnetic structure with Gd moments rotated ~45 degrees
toward the basal plane, which is similar to the magnetic structure of the Gd
subsystem observed in zero field between 9 and 10 K, and the Fe subsystem has a
ferromagnetic component in the basal plane.
