We present excited states density functional theory (DFT) to calculate band
gap for semiconductors and insulators. For the excited states
exchange-correlation functional, we use a simple local density approximation
(LDA) like functional and it gives the result which is very closed to
experimental results. The linear muffin-tin potential is used to solve the self
consistent Kohn-Sham equation
