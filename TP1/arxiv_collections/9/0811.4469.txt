We report on an interferometry-based measurement of the phase and group
velocities of optical Bessel beams, providing confirmation of their
superluminal character in the non-diffractive region. The measurements were
performed in free space with a continuous wave laser and femtosecond pulses for
phase and group velocities respectively. The Bessel beams were produced using a
conical mirror.
