The power spectrum of scalar field and space-time metric perturbations
produced in the process of inflation of universe, have been presented in this
paper by an alternative approach to field quantization namely, Krein space
quantization [1,2]. Auxiliary negative norm states, the modes of which do not
interact with the physical world, have been utilized in this method. Presence
of negative norm states play the role of an automatic renormalization device
for the theory.
