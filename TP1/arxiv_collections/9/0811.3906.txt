In view of controlling finite dimensional open quantum systems, we provide a
unified Lie-semigroup framework describing the structure of completely positive
trace-preserving maps. It allows (i) to identify the Kossakowski-Lindblad
generators as the Lie wedge of a subsemigroup, (ii) to link properties of Lie
semigroups such as divisibility with Markov properties of quantum channels, and
(iii) to characterise reachable sets and controllability in open systems. We
elucidate when time-optimal controls derived for the analogous closed system
already give good fidelities in open systems and when a more detailed knowledge
of the open system (e.g., in terms of the parameters of its
Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation) is actually required for state-of-the-art
optimal-control algorithms. -- As an outlook, we sketch the structure of a new,
potentially more efficient numerical approach explicitly making use of the
corresponding Lie wedge.
