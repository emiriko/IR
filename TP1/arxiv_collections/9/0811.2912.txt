We extend earlier schemes for merging tree-level matrix elements with parton
showers to include also merging with one-loop matrix elements. In this paper we
make a first study on how to include one-loop corrections, not only for events
with a given jet multiplicity, but simultaneously for several different jet
multiplicities. Results are presented for the simplest non-trivial case of
hadronic events at LEP as a proof-of-concept.
