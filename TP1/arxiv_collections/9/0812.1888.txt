Differential cross sections and hyperon polarizations have been measured for
$\bar{K}^0 n$, $\pi^0 \Lambda$, and $\pi^0 \Sigma^0$ production in $K^- p$
interactions at eight $K^-$ momenta between 514 and 750 MeV/$c$. The experiment
detected the multiphoton final states with the Crystal Ball spectrometer using
a $K^-$ beam from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron of BNL. The results
provide significantly greater precision than the existing data, allowing a
detailed reexamination of the excited hyperon states in our energy range.
