We analyze the magnetic and electronic properties of the quantum critical
heavy fermion superconductor beta-YbAlB4, calculating the Fermi surface and the
angular dependence of the extremal orbits relevant to the de Haas--van Alphen
measurements. Using a combination of the realistic materials modeling and
single-ion crystal field analysis, we are led to propose a layered Kondo
lattice model for this system, in which two dimensional boron layers are Kondo
coupled via interlayer Yb moments in a $J_{z}=\pm 5/2$ state. This model fits
the measured single ion magnetic susceptibility and predicts a substantial
change in the electronic anisotropy as the system is pressure-tuned through the
quantum critical point.
