In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), there are numerous
sources of flavour-violation in addition to the usual Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing
matrix of the Standard Model. We reexamine the renormalisation group equations
(RGEs) with a view to investigating flavour effects in a supersymmetric theory
with an arbitrary flavour structure at some high scale. To incorporate
(two-loop sized) threshold effects in the one-loop RGEs, we calculate the
beta-functions using a sequence of (non-supersymmetric) effective theories with
heavy particles decoupled at the scale of their mass, keeping track of the fact
that many couplings (such as gauge and gaugino couplings) which are equal in an
exact supersymmetric theory may no longer be equal once the supersymmetry
(SUSY) is broken. We find that this splitting, which is ignored in the
literature, may be larger than two-loop terms that are included. In addition,
gaugino couplings develop flavour structure that is absent without including
decoupling effects. A program (to be incorporated into ISAJET) has been
developed, which includes flavour-violating couplings of superparticles and
solves the two-loop threshold RGEs subject to specified high scale inputs. The
weak scale flavour structure derived in this way can be applied to the study of
flavour-changing decays of SUSY particles. As an illustration, we revisit the
branching ratio of the flavour-violating decay of the top squark. We find that,
in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) class of models, previous estimates for
the width of this decay have been too large by a factor 10-25. We also analyse
the consequences of introducing non-universality in the high scale soft
SUSY-breaking mass matrices and find that under these conditions the partial
width can be altered by a large amount.
