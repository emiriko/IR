The neutrino dispersion in the charge symmetric magnetized plasma is
investigated. We have studied the plasma contribution into the additional
energy of neutrino and obtained the simple expression for it. We consider in
detail the neutrino self-energy under physical conditions of weak field,
moderate field and strong field limits. It is shown that our result for
neutrino dispersion in moderate magnetic field differ substantially from the
previous one in the literature.
