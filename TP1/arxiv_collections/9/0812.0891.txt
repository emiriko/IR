We investigate the quantum state transfer in a chain of particles satisfying
q-deformed oscillators algebra. This general algebraic setting includes the
spin chain and the bosonic chain as limiting cases. We study conditions for
perfect state transfer depending on the number of sites and excitations on the
chain. They are formulated by means of irreducible representations of a quantum
algebra realized through Jordan-Schwinger maps. Playing with deformation
parameters, we can study the effects of nonlinear perturbations or interpolate
between the spin and bosonic chain.
