BGG-operators form sequences of invariant differential operators and the
first of these is overdetermined. Interesting equations in conformal geometry
described by these operators are those for Einstein scales, conformal Killing
forms and conformal Killing tensors. We present a deformation procedure of the
tractor connection which yields an invariant prolongation of the first
operator. The explicit calculation is presented in the case of conformal
Killing forms.
