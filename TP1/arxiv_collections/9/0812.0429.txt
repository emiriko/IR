Hermann Feshbach predicted fifty years ago that when two atomic nuclei are
scattered within an open entrance channel-- the state observable at infinity,
they may enter an intermediate closed channel -- the locally bounded state of
the nuclei. If the energy of a bound state of in the closed channel is
fine-tuned to match the relative kinetic energy, then the open channel and the
closed channel "resonate", so that the scattering length becomes divergent. We
find that this so-called Feshbach resonance phenomenon not only exists during
the collisions of massive particles, but also emerges during the coherent
transport of massless particles, that is, photons confined in the coupled
resonator arrays \cite{lzhou08}. We implement the open and the closed channels
inside a pair of such arrays, linked by a separated cavity or a tunable qubit.
When a single photon is bounded inside the closed channel by setting the
relevant physical parameters appropriately, the vanishing transmission appears
to display this photonic Feshbach resonance. The general construction can be
implemented through various experimentally feasible solid state systems, such
as the couple defected cavities in photonic crystals. The numerical simulation
based on finite-different time-domain(FDTD) method confirms our conceive about
physical implementation.
