The three new deformed Poincare Hopf algebras are constructed with use of
twist procedure. The corresponding relativistic space-times providing the sum
of canonical and Lie-algebraic type of noncommutativity are proposed. Finally,
the nonrelativistic contraction limits to the corresponding Galilei Hopf
algebras are performed.
