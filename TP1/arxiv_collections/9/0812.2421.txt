In this paper we prove that, given s> 0, if E is a subset of R^m with
positive and bounded s-dimensional Hausdorff measure H^s and the principal
values of the s-dimensional signed Riesz transform of H^s|E exist H^s-almost
everywhere in E, then s is integer. Other more general variants of this result
are also proven.
