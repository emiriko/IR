We consider reversible random walks in random environment obtained from
symmetric long--range jump rates on a random point process. We prove almost
sure transience and recurrence results under suitable assumptions on the point
process and the jump rate function. For recurrent models we obtain almost sure
estimates on effective resistances in finite boxes. For transient models we
construct explicit fluxes with finite energy on the associated electrical
network.
