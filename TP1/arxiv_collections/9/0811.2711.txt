A new investigation is done of the possibility of binding the "dodecatoplet",
a system of six top quarks and six top antiquarks, using the Yukawa potential
mediated by Higgs exchange. A simple variational method gives a upper bound
close to that recently estimated in a mean-field calculation. It is
supplemented by a lower bound provided by identities among the Hamiltonians
describing the system and its subsystems.
