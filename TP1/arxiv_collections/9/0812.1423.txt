Warped braneworld scenario provides an alternative to the usual Kaluza-Klein
compactification of extra dimensions through the so-called localization of
fields. Randall-Sundrum type models do not directly prove, rather, assume that
all standard model fields are localized to the TeV brane. I will provide the
mechanism for addressing the problem and discuss the issue of localization of
fields on the brane for various types of braneworld models available in the
literature.
