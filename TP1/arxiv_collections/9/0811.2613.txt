Single-particle spectrum of the Kondo lattice model is derived with use of
the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method, combined with the dynamical
mean-field theory. Crossover behavior is traced quantitatively either to a
heavy Fermi-liquid state or to a magnetically ordered state from the
local-moment state at high temperatures. The momentum distribution in the
low-temperature limit acquires a discontinuity at the location that involves
the local-spin degrees of freedom. Even without the charge degrees of freedom
for local electrons, the excitation spectra exhibit hybridized bands similar to
those in the Anderson lattice. Temperature dependence in the zero-energy
component of the self-energy is crucial in forming the Fermi-liquid state with
the large Fermi surface.
