The structural properties of the SrFe2As2 and CaFe2As2 compounds have been
extensively analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) from room
temperature down to 20K. The experimental results demonstrate that the SrFe2As2
crystal, in consistence with previous x-ray data, has a tetragonal structure at
room temperature and undergoes a tetragonal (T)-orthorhombic (O) phase
transition at about 210K. Moreover, twinning lamella arising from T-O
transition evidently appears in the orthorhombic phase. On the other hand, TEM
observations of CaFe2As2 reveal the presence of a pseudo-periodic structural
modulation with the periodicity of around 40nm at room temperature. This
modulation is likely in connection with the local structural distortions within
the Ca layer. In-situ cooling TEM observations of CaFe2As2 reveal the presence
of complex domain structures in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase.
