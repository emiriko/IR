Using a density functional approach based on a Skyrme interaction,
thermodynamic properties of finite nuclei are investigated at non-zero
temperture. The role of a momentum dependent isovector term is now studied
besides volume, symmetry, surface and Coulomb effects. Various features
associated with both mechanical and chemical instability and the liquid-gas
coexistence curve are sensitive to the Skyrme interaction. The separated
effects of the isoscalar term and the isovector term of momentum dependent
interaction are studied for a modified SKM($m^*=m$) interaction. The frequently
used Skyrme interaction SLy4 is one of the cases considered and is shown to
have better features for neutron star studies due to a larger symmetry energy.
