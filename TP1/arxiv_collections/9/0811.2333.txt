Configuration mixing calculations performed in terms of the Skyrme/Gogny
Energy Density Functional (EDF) rely on extending the Single-Reference energy
functional into non-diagonal EDF kernels. The standard way to do so, based on
an analogy with the pure Hamiltonian case and the use of the generalized Wick
theorem, is responsible for the recently observed divergences and steps in
Multi-Reference calculations. We summarize here the minimal solution to this
problem recently proposed [Lacroix et al, arXiv:0809.2041] and applied with
success to particle number restoration[Bender et al, arXiv:0809.2045]. Such a
regularization method provides suitable corrections of pathologies for EDF
depending on integer powers of the density. The specific case of fractional
powers of the density[Duguet et al, arXiv:0809.2049] is also discussed.
