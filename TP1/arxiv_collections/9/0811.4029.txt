We address some questions concerning indecomposable polynomials and their
spectrum. How does the spectrum behave via reduction or specialization, or via
a more general ring morphism? Are the indecomposability properties equivalent
over a field and over its algebraic closure? How many polynomials are
decomposable over a finite field?
