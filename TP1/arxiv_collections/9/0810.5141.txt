There is an extensive history of form factor calculations on the lattice,
primarily with ground states for both initial and final states. However, there
have never been any radially excited transition form factor calculations.
Furthermore, the lattice faces difficulty in extracting signal from noise at
large transfer momenta ($Q^2$). These measurements could give important
theoretical input to experiments, such as those of JLab's 12 GeV program and
studies of deformation of the nucleon. In this work, I will present a simple
technique to resolve both of these difficulties and present results from
anisotropic configurations showing improved signals for excited-state
quantities. It should also be possible to apply this technique to isotropic
lattices for calculating large-$Q^2$ form factors.
