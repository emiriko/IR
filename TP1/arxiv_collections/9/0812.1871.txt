The charge distribution of the heaviest fragment detected in the decay of
quasi-projectiles produced in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions has been
observed to be bimodal. This feature is expected as a generic signal of phase
transition in non-extensive systems. In this paper we present new analyses of
experimental data from Au on Au collisions at 60, 80 and 100 MeV/nucleon
showing that bimodality is largely independent of the data selection procedure,
and of entrance channel effects. An estimate of the latent heat of the
transition is extracted.
