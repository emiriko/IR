We show experimentally that in nanometer scaled superconductor/normal metal
hybrid devices and in a small window of contact resistances, crossed Andreev
reflection (CAR) can dominate the nonlocal transport for all energies below the
superconducting gap. Besides CAR, elastic cotunneling (EC) and nonlocal charge
imbalance (CI) can be identified as competing subgap transport mechanisms in
temperature dependent four-terminal nonlocal measurements. We demonstrate a
systematic change of the nonlocal resistance vs. bias characteristics with
increasing contact resistances, which can be varied in the fabrication process.
For samples with higher contact resistances, CAR is weakened relative to EC in
the midgap regime, possibly due to dynamical Coulomb blockade. Gaining control
of CAR is an important step towards the realization of a solid state entangler.
