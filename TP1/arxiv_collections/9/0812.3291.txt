A hybrid meson is a quark-antiquark pair in which, contrary to ordinary
mesons, the gluon field is in an excited state. In the framework of constituent
models, the interaction potential is assumed to be the energy of an excited
string. An approximate, but accurate, analytical solution of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with such a potential is presented. When applied to
hybrid charmonia and bottomonia, towers of states are predicted in which the
masses are a linear function of a harmonic oscillator band number for the
quark-antiquark pair. Such a formula could be a reliable guide for the
experimental detection of heavy hybrid mesons.
