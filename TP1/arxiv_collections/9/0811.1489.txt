We report on a comprehensive study of the transport, specific heat, magnetic
susceptibility and optical spectroscopy on single crystal of Fe$_{1.05}$Te. We
confirm that Fe$_{1.05}$Te undergoes a first-order phase transition near 65 K.
However, its physical properties are considerably different from other parent
compounds of FeAs-based systems, presumably attributed to the presence of
excess Fe ions. The charge transport is rather incoherent above the transition,
and no clear signature of the gap is observed below the transition temperature.
Strong impurity scattering effect exists also in Se-doped superconducting
sample Fe$_{1.03}$Se$_{0.30}$Te$_{0.70}$, leading to a relatively low T$_c$ but
a rather high upper critical field.
