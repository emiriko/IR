We report the synthesis and structural study of mixed oxides in the Ln2ScNbO7
series. New phases with Ln = Pr, Eu, Gd and Dy are obtained. All crystallize in
the cubic pyrochlore structure type, space group F-d3m, with no Sc-Nb ordering
on the B-site. The structures are determined by Rietveld refinement. The
evolution of cell parameters, interatomic distances and angles as a function of
lanthanide cation size is discussed. Magnetic measurements show the absence of
ordering down to 2 K, in agreement with the presence of strong geometric
frustration in the lanthanide sublattice. The europium phase shows a peculiar
magnetic behaviour; its magnetic susceptibility becomes constant below ca 50 K.
This feature confirms the behaviour observed previously on Eu2Ti2O7 and is
ascribed to crystal field effects.
