Metallic behavior of band-insulator/ Mott-insulator interfaces was observed
in artificial perovskite superlattices such as in nanoscale SrTiO3/LaTiO3
multilayers. Applying a semiclassical perspective to the parallel electronic
transport we identify two major ingredients relevant for such systems: i) the
quantum confinement of the conduction electrons (superlattice modulation) leads
to a complex, quasi-two dimensional subband structure with both hole- and
electron-like Fermi surfaces. ii) strong electron-electron interaction requires
a substantial renormalization of the quasi-particle dispersion. We characterize
this renormalization by two sets of parameters, namely, the quasi-particle
weight and the induced particle-hole asymmetry of each partially filled
subband. In our study, the quasi-particle dispersion is calculated
self-consistently as function of microscopic parameters using the slave-boson
mean-field approximation introduced by Kotliar and Ruckenstein. We discuss the
consequences of strong local correlations on the normal-state free-carrier
response in the optical conductivity and on the thermoelectric effects.
