The ALICE experiment, currently in the commissioning phase, will study
nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC). We review the ALICE heavy-flavour physics program and present a
selection of results on the expected performance for the case of proton-proton
collisions.
