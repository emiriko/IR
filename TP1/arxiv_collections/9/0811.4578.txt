Recent progress in the understanding of the effect of electrostatics in soft
matter is presented. A vast amount of materials contains ions ranging from the
molecular scale (e.g., electrolyte) to the meso/macroscopic one (e.g., charged
colloidal particles or polyelectrolytes). Their (micro)structure and
physicochemical properties are especially dictated by the famous and
redoubtable long-ranged Coulomb interaction. In particular theoretical and
simulational aspects, including the experimental motivations, will be
discussed.
