By means of first-principles FLAPW-GGA calculations, we have investigated the
electronic properties of the newly synthesized layered phase -
(Sr3Sc2O5)Fe2As2. The electronic bands, density of states and Fermi surface
have been evaluated. The resembling of our data for (Sr3Sc2O5)Fe2As2 with band
structure pictures of known FeAs superconducting materials may be considered as
the theoretical background specifying the possibility for (Sr3Sc2O5)Fe2As2 to
become a parent phase for new FeAs superconductors.
