This paper is devoted to energy-spectral analysis for the system of a
two-level atom coupled with photons in a cavity. It is shown that the
Dicke-type energy level crossings take place when the atom-cavity interaction
of the system undergoes changes between the weak coupling regime and the strong
one. Using the phenomenon of the crossings we develop the idea of
cavity-induced atom cooling proposed by the group of Ritsch, and we lay
mathematical foundations of a possible mechanism for another superradiant
cooling in addition to that proposed by Domokos and Ritsch. The process of our
superradiant cooling can function well by cavity decay and by control of the
position of the atom, at least in (mathematical) theory, even if there is
neither atomic absorption nor atomic emission of photons.
