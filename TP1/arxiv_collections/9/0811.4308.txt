On the basis of the phenomenological relativistic harmonic models for quarks
we have obtained the masses of P wave mesons. The full Hamiltonian used in the
investigation has Lorentz scalar + vector confinement potential, along with one
gluon exchange potential (OGEP) and the instanton-induced quark-antiquark
interaction (III). A good agreement is obtained with the experimental masses.
The respective role of III and OGEP for the determination of the meson masses
is discussed.
