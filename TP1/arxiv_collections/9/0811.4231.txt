The gravitational energy-momentum within a small region as determined by two
tetrad-teleparallel expressions is evaluated with the aid of an orthonormal
frame adapted to Riemann normal coordinates. We find that the gauge current
"tensor" does enjoy the highly desired and rare property of being a positive
multiple of the Bel-Robinson tensor, whereas M{\o}ller's expression does not.
