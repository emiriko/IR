We consider reshaping a scattering obstacle virtually by using transformation
optics in acoustic and electromagnetic scattering. Among the general virtual
reshaping results, the virtual minification and virtual magnification are
particularly studied. Stability estimates are derived for scattering amplitude
in terms of the diameter of a small obstacle, which implies that the limiting
case for minification corresponds to a perfect cloaking, i.e., the obstacle is
invisible to detection.
