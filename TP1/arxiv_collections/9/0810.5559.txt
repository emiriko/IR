Regluing is a topological operation that helps to construct topological
models for rational functions on the boundaries of certain hyperbolic
components. It also has a holomorphic interpretation, with the flavor of
infinite dimensional Thurston--Teichm\"uller theory. We will discuss a
topological theory of regluing, and trace a direction in which a holomorphic
theory can develop.
