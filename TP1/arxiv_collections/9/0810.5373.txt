In this mostly expository paper we review several known results about the
cohomology of moduli spaces of smooth and stable curves, focusing in particular
on low degree cohomology. We also give a new proof of Harer's theorem
describing the second cohomology group of the moduli space of smooth n-pointed
curves of given genus
