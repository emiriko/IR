A new type of statistical analysis of the science and technical information
(STI) in the Web context is produced. We propose a set of indicators about Web
users, visualized bibliographic records, and e-commercial transactions. In
addition, we introduce two Web usage factors. Finally, we give an overview of
the co-usage analysis. For these tasks, we introduce a computer based system,
called Miri@d, which produces descriptive statistical information about the Web
users' searching behaviour, and what is effectively used from a free access
digital bibliographical database. The system is conceived as a server of
statistical data which are carried out beforehand, and as an interactive server
for online statistical work. The results will be made available to analysts,
who can use this descriptive statistical information as raw data for their
indicator design tasks, and as input for multivariate data analysis, clustering
analysis, and mapping. Managers also can exploit the results in order to
improve management and decision-making.
