It is proven that Gaussian operations are of no use for protecting Gaussian
states against Gaussian errors in quantum communication protocols.
Specifically, we introduce a new quantity characterizing any single-mode
Gaussian channel, called entanglement degradation, and show that it cannot
decrease via Gaussian encoding and decoding operations only. The strength of
this no-go theorem is illustrated with some examples of Gaussian channels.
