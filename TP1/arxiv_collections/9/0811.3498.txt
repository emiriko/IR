In this course, I talk about the source of mathematical constructivism and
its role in the future development of theoretical physics. I describe what
physical constructivism is and why it is necessary for the penetration of exact
methods of theoretical physics to the area of complex systems, which formally
belong to the others natural disciplines. I describe the concrete heuristic for
the creating of models of constructive quantum theory the method of collective
behavior. I represent the constructive viewpoint on the quantum computer, which
treats it as the model object of many particle quantum physics, and the
practical recommendation concerning its building. Due to the known inertia of
the educational system constructive methods in mathematics remains mostly
unknown to the wide physical community, and I hope that this course will
stimulate the interest to the new possibilities, which these methods open.
These possibilities represent interest to natural scientists and for
programmers as well.
