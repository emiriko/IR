We investigate a flat anisotropic (5+1)-dimensional cosmological model in the
presence of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) contribution in addition to usual Einstein
term in the action. We compared it with (4+1)-dimensional case and found a
substantial difference in corresponding cosmological dynamics. This difference
is manifested in the probability of the model to have smooth transition from
GB-term-dominated to Einstein-term-dominated phases--this probability in a
reasonable measure on the initial condition space is almost zero for (4+1) case
and about 60% for (5+1) case. We discuss this difference as well as some
features of the dynamics of the considered model.
