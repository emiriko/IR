We examine W pair production in the Noncommutative Standard Model constructed
with the Seiberg-Witten map. Consideration of partial wave unitarity in the
reactions WW to WW and e+e- to WW shows that the latter process is more
sensitive and that tree-level unitarity is violated when scattering energies
are of order a TeV and the noncommutative scale is below about a TeV. We find
that WW production at the LHC is not sensitive to scales above the unitarity
bounds. WW production in e+e- annihilation, however, provides a good probe of
such effects with noncommutative scales below 300-400 GeV being excluded at
LEP-II, and the ILC being sensitive to scales up to 10-20 TeV. In addition, we
find that the ability to measure the helicity states of the final state W
bosons at the ILC provides a diagnostic tool to determine and disentangle the
different possible noncommutative contributions.
