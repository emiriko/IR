We show theoretically that polariton pairs with a high degree of polarization
entanglement can be produced through parametric scattering. We demonstrate that
it can emerge in coincidence experiments, even at low excitation densities
where the dynamics is dominated by incoherent photoluminesce. Our analysis is
based on a microscopic quantum statistical approach that treats coherent and
incoherent processes on an equal footing, thus allowing for a quantitative
assessment of the amount of entanglement under realistic experimental
conditions. This result puts forward the robustness of pair correlations in
solid-state devices, even when noise dominates one-body correlations.
