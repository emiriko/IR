M1 properties, comprising magnetic moments and radiative capture of thermal
neutron observables, are studied in two- and three-nucleon systems. We utilize
meson exchange current derived up to N$^3$LO using heavy baryon chiral
perturbation theory a la Weinberg. Calculations have been performed for several
qualitatively different realistic nuclear Hamiltonians, which permits us to
analyze model dependence of our results. Our results are found to be strongly
correlated with the effective range parameters such as binding energies and the
scattering lengths. Taking into account such correlation, the results are in
good agreement with the experimental data with small model-dependence.
