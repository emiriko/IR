We present an analytic model to calculate the atomic scattering length near a
Feshbach resonance from data on the molecular binding energy. Our approach
considers finite-range square-well potentials and can be applied near broad,
narrow, or even overlapping Feshbach resonances. We test our model on Cs$_2$
Feshbach molecules. We measure the binding energy using magnetic-field
modulation spectroscopy in a range where one broad and two narrow Feshbach
resonances overlap. From the data we accurately determine the Cs atomic
scattering length and the positions and widths of two particular resonances.
