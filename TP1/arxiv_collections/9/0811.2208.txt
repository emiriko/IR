The origin of the long-wavelength incommensurate magnetic structure of
Ca3Co2O6 is discussed considering possible inter-chains super-superexchange
paths. The experimental value of the propagation vector k=(0,0,$\Delta$) with
$\Delta$ $>$ 1 can be reproduced only if one considers the next nearest
super-superexchange interaction. A spin-dimer analysis using the
Extended-Huckel Tight-Binding method confirms that, despite longer interatomic
Co-Co distances, the latter interaction is indeed much stronger. The stability
of the observed structure with respect to certain commensurate states is
discussed.
