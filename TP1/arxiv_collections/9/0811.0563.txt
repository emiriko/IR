I present a mini-review of the masses and couplings of the bare (unmixed)
light scalar mesons : $\bar qq, (\overline{qq})(qq), (\bar qq)(\bar qq), gg$
from QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) and low-energy theorems (LET) which we
compare with recent lattice calculations when available. Some unbiased comments
on the different scenarios are given. The possiblity for the $\sigma (0.6)$ to
be mostly a gluonium/glueball with a huge violation of the OZI rule in its
decay is discussed. This review complements and updates the ones presented
earlier [1]. Despite some progresses, the internal structure of the light
scalar mesons remain puzzling, and some further efforts are required. It will
be more fun at LHC if the Higgs of the Standard Model is a $\sigma$-like
resonance.
