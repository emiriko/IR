This paper proposes several algorithms and their Cellular Automata Machine
(CAM) for drawing the State Transition Diagram (STD) of an arbitrary Cellular
Automata (CA) Rule (any neighborhood, uniform/ hybrid and null/ periodic
boundary) and length of the CA n. It also discusses the novelty, hardware cost
and the complexities of these algorithms.
