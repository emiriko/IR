Within the framework of either Euclidian (functional-integral) quantum
gravity or canonical general relativity the signature of the manifold is a
priori unconstrained. Furthermore, recent developments in the emergent
spacetime programme have led to a physically feasible implementation of
signature change events. This suggests that it is time to revisit the sometimes
controversial topic of signature change in general relativity. Specifically, we
shall focus on the behaviour of a quantum field subjected to a manifold
containing regions of different signature. We emphasise that, regardless of the
underlying classical theory, there are severe problems associated with any
quantum field theory residing on a signature-changing background. (Such as the
production of what is naively an infinite number of particles, with an infinite
energy density.) From the viewpoint of quantum gravity phenomenology, we
discuss possible consequences of an effective Lorentz symmetry breaking scale.
To more fully understand the physics of quantum fields exposed to finite
regions of Euclidean-signature (Riemannian) geometry, we show its similarities
with the quantum barrier penetration problem, and the super-Hubble horizon
modes encountered in cosmology. Finally we raise the question as to whether
signature change transitions could be fully understood and dynamically
generated within (modified) classical general relativity, or whether they
require the knowledge of a full theory of quantum gravity.
