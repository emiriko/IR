The limiting case of the bosonic part of the standard Electroweak Model,
which correspond to the contracted gauge group $ SU(2;j)\times U(1)$ is
discussed. The Higgs boson, Z-boson and electromagnetic fields become an
external ones with respect to the W-bosons fields. The W-bosons fields do not
effect on these external fields. The masses of the all particles of the
Electroweak Model remain the same under contraction.
