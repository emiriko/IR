We examine the practical feasibility of the experimental realization of the
so-called entangled Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), occurring in an entangled
state of two atoms of different species. We demonstrate that if the energy gap
remains vanishing, the entangled BEC persists as the ground state of the
concerned model in a wide parameter regime. We establish the experimental
accessibility of the isotropic point of the effective parameters, in which the
entangled BEC is the exact ground state, as well as the consistency with the
generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The transition temperature is
estimated. Possible experimental implementations are discussed in detail.
