We review the properties of static, higher dimensional black hole solutions
in theories where non-abelian gauge fields are minimally coupled to gravity. It
is shown that black holes with hyperspherically symmetric horizon topology do
not exist in $d > 4$, but that hyperspherically symmetric black holes can be
constructed numerically in generalized Einstein-Yang-Mills models.
5-dimensional black strings with horizon topology S^2 x S^1 are also discussed.
These are so-called undeformed and deformed non-abelian black strings, which
are translationally invariant and correspond to 4-dimensional non-abelian black
holes trivially extended into one extra dimensions. The fact that black strings
can be deformed, i.e. axially symmetric for constant values of the extra
coordinate is a new feature as compared to black string solutions of Einstein
(-Maxwell) theory. It is argued that these non-abelian black strings are
thermodynamically unstable.
