Recent experimental developments of high-intensity, short-pulse XUV light
sources are enhancing our ability to study electron-electron correlations. We
perform time-dependent calculations to investigate the so-called "sequential"
regime (photon energy above 54.4 eV) in the two-photon double ionization of
helium. We show that attosecond pulses allow to induce and probe angular and
energy correlations of the emitted electrons. The final momentum distribution
reveals regions dominated by the Wannier ridge break-up scenario and by
post-collision interaction.
