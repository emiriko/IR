Generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes form a wide and useful class of linear
codes that includes thoroughly quasi-cyclic codes, finite geometry (FG) low
density parity check (LDPC) codes, and Hermitian codes. Although it is known
that the systematic encoding of GQC codes is equivalent to the division
algorithm in the theory of Grobner basis of modules, there has been no
algorithm that computes Grobner basis for all types of GQC codes. In this
paper, we propose two algorithms to compute Grobner basis for GQC codes from
their parity check matrices: echelon canonical form algorithm and transpose
algorithm. Both algorithms require sufficiently small number of finite-field
operations with the order of the third power of code-length. Each algorithm has
its own characteristic; the first algorithm is composed of elementary methods,
and the second algorithm is based on a novel formula and is faster than the
first one for high-rate codes. Moreover, we show that a serial-in serial-out
encoder architecture for FG LDPC codes is composed of linear feedback shift
registers with the size of the linear order of code-length; to encode a binary
codeword of length n, it takes less than 2n adder and 2n memory elements.
