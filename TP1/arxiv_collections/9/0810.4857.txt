A theory for the dispersion of collective magnetic excitations in
superconducting cuprates is presented with the aim to cover both high and low
doping regimes. Besides of spin fluctuations describable in the random phase
approximation (RPA) we allow for local spin rotations within a mode-coupling
theory. At low temperatures and moderately large correlation lengths we obtain
two branches of excitations which disperse up- and downwards exhibiting the
hourglass behavior observed experimentally at intermediate dopings. At large
and small dopings our theory essentially reduces to the RPA and spin wave
theory, respectively.
