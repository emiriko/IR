The electroweak theory contains too many empirical parameters. Most of them
are related to the flavor part of particle physics. In this paper we discuss a
relevant simple idea: the complicated system of actual dimensionless, small
versus large, quantities in elementary particle flavor phenomenology is small
deviated from an explicitly defined benchmark flavor pattern with no tuning
parameters. One small empirical universal dimensionless parameter measures this
deviation. Its possible physical connections are discussed. As inferences,
quasi-degenerate neutrino type with mass scale m = 0.16-0.18 eV, neutrino and
quark mixing matrices, large neutrino oscillation 3-flavor hierarchy and
quark-neutrino complementarity are predicted.
