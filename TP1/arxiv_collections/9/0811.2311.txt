Anisotropic flow measurements have demonstrated development of partonic
collectivity in $200\mathrm{GeV}$ Au+Au collisions at RHIC. To understand the
partonic EOS, thermalization must be addressed. Collective motion of
heavy-flavor (c,b) quarks can be used to indicate the degree of thermalization
of the light-flavor quarks (u,d,s). Measurement of heavy-flavor quark
collectivity requires direct reconstruction of heavy-flavor hadrons in the low
$\pt$ region. Measurement of open charm spectra to high $\pt$ can be used to
investigate heavy-quark energy loss and medium properties. The Heavy Flavor
Tracker (HFT), a proposed upgrade to the STAR experiment at midrapidity, will
measure $v_{2}$ of open-charm hadrons to very low $\pt$ by reconstructing their
displaced decay vertices. The innermost part of the HFT is the PIXEL detector
(made of two low mass monolithic active pixel sensor layers), which delivers a
high precision position measurement close to the collision vertex. The
Intermediate Silicon Tracker (IST), a 1-layer strip detector, is essential to
improve hit identification in the PIXEL detector when running at full RHIC-II
luminosity. Using a full GEANT simulation, open charm measurement capabilities
of STAR with the HFT will be shown. Its performance in a broad $\pt$ range will
be demonstrated on $v_{2}$ ($\pt > 0.5\mathrm{GeV}/c$) and $R_\mathrm{CP}$
($\pt < 10\mathrm{GeV}/c$) measurements of $\D$ meson. Results of
reconstruction of $\Lc$ baryon in heavy-ion collisions are presented.
