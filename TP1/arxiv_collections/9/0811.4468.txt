Chemotaxis is typically modeled in the context of cellular motion towards a
static, exogenous source of chemoattractant. Here, we propose a time-dependent
mechanism of chemotaxis in which a self-propelled particle ({\it e.g.}, a cell)
releases a chemical that diffuses to fixed particles (targets) and signals the
production of a second chemical by these targets. The particle then moves up
concentration gradients of this second chemical, analogous to diffusive
echolocation. When one target is present, we describe probe release strategies
that optimize travel of the cell to the target. In the presence of multiple
targets, the one selected by the cell depends on the strength and,
interestingly, on the frequency of probe chemical release. Although involving
an additional chemical signaling step, our chemical ``pinging'' hypothesis
allows for greater flexibility in regulating target selection, as seen in a
number of physical or biological realizations.
