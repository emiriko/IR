The skeleton conception of elementary particles is considered in the paper.
Conventional particle dynamics is formulated in an unaccomplished form, which
is adequate only in the continuous space-time geometry. The conventional
differential equations of the particle motion cannot be written in the discrete
space-time geometry. In the discrete space-time geometry the particle world
line is replaced by the world chain. The world chain links has a finite length
(not infinitesimal). The world chain appears to be stochastic. Statistical
description of stochastic world chains leads to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation,
if the elementary length of the geometry is chosen in a proper way. The quantum
principles are founded by existence of the discrete (and multivariant)
space-time geometry and lose the role of prime physical principles. In the
skeleton conception the particle is described by its skeleton (several rigidly
connected space-time points). Skeleton conception of the elementary particles
realizes a proper description of the particle state, which appears to be
adequate in a discrete space-time geometry. The particle dynamics takes the
form of a monistic conception, which is described completely in terms of the
world function of the space-time geometry. The skeleton conception accomplishes
the transition from nonrelativistic physics to the relativistic one and
realizes the total geometrization of particle dynamics.
