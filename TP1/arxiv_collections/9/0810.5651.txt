We show that a static central potential may provide a precise description of
highly excited light unflavoured mesons. Due to string breaking this potential
becomes of chromoelectric type at sufficiently large quark-antiquark distances
giving rise to a coulombian spectrum. The same conclusion can be inferred for
any other meson sector through a straightforward extension of our analysis.
