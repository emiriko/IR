Vortices in superconductors driven at microwave frequencies exhibit a
response related to the interplay between the vortex viscosity, pinning
strength, and flux creep effects. At the same time, the trapping of vortices in
superconducting microwave resonant circuits contributes excess loss and can
result in substantial reductions in the quality factor. Thus, understanding the
microwave vortex response in superconducting thin films is important for the
design of such circuits, including superconducting qubits and photon detectors,
which are typically operated in small, but non-zero, magnetic fields. By
cooling in fields of the order of 100 $\mu$T and below, we have characterized
the magnetic field and frequency dependence of the microwave response of a
small density of vortices in resonators fabricated from thin films of Re and
Al, which are common materials used in superconducting microwave circuits.
Above a certain threshold cooling field, which is different for the Re and Al
films, vortices become trapped in the resonators. Vortices in the Al resonators
contribute greater loss and are influenced more strongly by flux creep effects
than in the Re resonators. This different behavior can be described in the
framework of a general vortex dynamics model.
