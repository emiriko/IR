The properties of supersymmetric gauge theories in the Higgs phase at low
energies can appropriately be studied by means of a non-linear sigma model,
which has the target space being Kahler for N=1 supersymmetric models and
hyperKahler for N=2 models. By construction of the Kahler and hyperKahler
quotients for the gauge theories with SO and USp gauge symmetries, we obtain
the explicit metrics on their respective manifolds. Furthermore, we study the
lumps in the non-linear sigma models and their effective description, using the
Kahler quotients.
