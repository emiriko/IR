The k-means algorithm is a well-known method for partitioning n points that
lie in the d-dimensional space into k clusters. Its main features are
simplicity and speed in practice. Theoretically, however, the best known upper
bound on its running time (i.e. O(n^{kd})) can be exponential in the number of
points. Recently, Arthur and Vassilvitskii [3] showed a super-polynomial
worst-case analysis, improving the best known lower bound from \Omega(n) to
2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})} with a construction in d=\Omega(\sqrt{n}) dimensions. In
[3] they also conjectured the existence of superpolynomial lower bounds for any
d >= 2.
  Our contribution is twofold: we prove this conjecture and we improve the
lower bound, by presenting a simple construction in the plane that leads to the
exponential lower bound 2^{\Omega(n)}.
