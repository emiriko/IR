We review the problem of adatoms in graphene under two complementary points
of view, scattering theory and strong correlations. We show that in both cases
impurity atoms on the graphene surface present effects that are absent in the
physics of impurities in ordinary metals. We discuss how to observe these
unusual effects with standard experimental probes such as scanning tunneling
microscopes, and spin susceptibility.
