The energy spectrum of a one-electron quantum dot doped with a single
magnetic ion is studied in the presence of an external magnetic field. The
allowed cyclotron resonance (CR) transitions are obtained together with their
oscillator strength (OS) as function of the magnetic field, the position of the
magnetic ion, and the quantum dot confinement strength. With increasing
magnetic field a ferromagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition is found that
results in clear signatures in the CR absorption. It leads to discontinuities
in the transition energies and the oscillator strengths and an increase of the
number of allowed transitions.
