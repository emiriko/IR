The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is in the process of designing and
constructing a forward tracking system based on triple GEM technology. This
upgrade is necessary to give STAR the capability to reconstruct and identify
the charge sign of W bosons over an extended rapidity range through their
leptonic decay mode into an electron (positron) and a neutrino. This will allow
a detailed study of the flavor-separated spin structure of the proton in
polarized p + p collisions uniquely available at RHIC. The Forward GEM Tracker
FGT will consist of six triple GEM disks with an outer radius of ~39 cm and an
inner radius of ~10.5 cm, arranged along the beam pipe, covering the
pseudo-rapidity range from 1.0 to 2.0 over a wide range of collision vertices.
The GEM foils will be produced by Tech-Etch, Inc. Beam tests with test
detectors using 10 cm x 10 cm Tech-Etch GEM foils and a two dimensional
orthogonal strip readout have demonstrated a spatial resolution of 70 um or
better and high efficiency.
