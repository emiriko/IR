We study theoretically the anomalous Hall effect due to the vector spin
chirality carried by the local spins in the $s$-$d$ model. We will show that
the vector spin chirality indeed induces local Hall effect in the presence of
the electron spin polarization, while the global Hall effect vanishes if
electron transport is homogeneous. This anomalous Hall effect can be
interpreted in terms of the rotational component of the spin current associated
with the vector chirality.
