We study the transition from fluid at rest to turbulence in a rotating water
cylinder. We show that the energy, injected at a given height, is transported
by inertial wave packets through the fluid volume. These waves propagate at
velocities consistent with those calculated from linearized theory, even when
they possess large amplitudes. A clear "front" in the temporal evolution of the
energy power spectrum is detected, defining a time scale for energy transport
at the linear wave speed in the system. Nonlinear energy transfer between modes
is governed by a different time scale that can be much longer than the linear
one. These observations suggest that the energy distribution and statistics in
rotating turbulent fields that are driven by intermittent energy sources may be
different from those described by the inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional
turbulence.
