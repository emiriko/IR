We discuss the origin of the narrowness of the single peak at mass-symmetric
division in the fragment mass-yield curve for spontaneous fission of
$^{258}$Fm. For this purpose, we employ the macroscopic-microscopic model, and
calculate a potential-energy curve at the mass-symmetric compact scission
configuration, as a function of the fragment mass number, which is obtained
from the single-particle wave-function densities. In the calculations, we
minimize total energies by varying the deformations of the two fragments, with
constraints on the mass quadrupole moment and keeping the neck radius zero, as
a function of mass asymmetry. Using the obtained potential, we solve the
one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with a microscopic coordinate-dependent
inertial mass to calculate the fragment mass-yield curve. The calculated mass
yield, expressed in terms of the microscopic mass density, is consistent with
the extremely narrow experimental mass distribution.
