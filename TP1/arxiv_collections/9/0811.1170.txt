We define and study certain moduli stacks of modules equipped with a
Frobenius semi-linear endomorphism. These stacks can be thought of as
parametrizing the coefficients of a variable Galois representation and are
global variants of the spaces of Kisin-Breuil $\Phi$-modules used by Kisin in
his study of deformation spaces of local Galois representations. We also define
a version of a rigid analytic period map for these spaces, we show how their
local structure can be described in terms of "local models", and we show how
Bruhat-Tits buildings can be used to study their special fibers.
