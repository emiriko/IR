Missing and incomplete information in surveys or databases can be imputed
using different statistical and soft-computing techniques. This paper
comprehensively compares auto-associative neural networks (NN), neuro-fuzzy
(NF) systems and the hybrid combinations the above methods with hot-deck
imputation. The tests are conducted on an eight category antenatal survey and
also under principal component analysis (PCA) conditions. The neural network
outperforms the neuro-fuzzy system for all tests by an average of 5.8%, while
the hybrid method is on average 15.9% more accurate yet 50% less
computationally efficient than the NN or NF systems acting alone. The global
impact assessment of the imputed data is performed by several statistical
tests. It is found that although the imputed accuracy is high, the global
effect of the imputed data causes the PCA inter-relationships between the
dataset to become altered. The standard deviation of the imputed dataset is on
average 36.7% lower than the actual dataset which may cause an incorrect
interpretation of the results.
