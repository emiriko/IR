In this Letter, we propose a novel information-geometric characterization of
chaotic (integrable) energy level statistics of a quantum antiferromagnetic
Ising spin chain in a tilted (transverse) external magnetic field. Finally, we
conjecture our results might find some potential physical applications in
quantum energy level statistics.
