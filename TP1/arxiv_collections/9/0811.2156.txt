We survey interactions between the topology and the combinatorics of complex
hyperplane arrangements. Without claiming to be exhaustive, we examine in this
setting combinatorial aspects of fundamental groups, associated graded Lie
algebras, higher homotopy groups, cohomology rings, twisted homology with rank
1 complex coefficients, and Milnor fibers.
