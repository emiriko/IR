We realize a continuous guided beam of cold deuterated ammonia with a flux of
3e11 ND3 molecules/s and a continuous free-space beam of cold potassium with a
flux of 1e16 K atoms/s. A novel feature of the buffer gas source used to
produce these beams is cold neon, which, due to intermediate Knudsen number
beam dynamics, produces a forward velocity and low-energy tail that is
comparable to much colder helium-based sources. We expect this source to be
trivially generalizable to a very wide range of atomic and molecular species
with significant vapor pressure below 1000 K. This source has properties that
make it a good starting point for laser cooling of molecules or atoms, cold
collision studies, trapping, or nonlinear optics in buffer-gas-cooled atomic or
molecular gases.
