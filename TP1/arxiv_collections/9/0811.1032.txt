We consider the spatial spin correlations around a partially screened spin-1
magnetic moment in a metal exhibiting the underscreened Kondo effect. We find
that the underscreening of the impurity spin results in spatial spin
correlations that are more pronounced as compared to the fully screened Kondo
effect; their power-law decay is weaker because of characteristic logarithmic
corrections at large distances. The spin correlator also changes sign as a
function of distance to the impurity allowing for ferromagnetic correlations
between conduction electron spin density and the local moment. The numerical
findings are shown to be in agreement with the predictions deriving from an
effective ferromagnetic Kondo Hamiltonian.
