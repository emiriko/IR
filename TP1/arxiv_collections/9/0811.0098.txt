In this paper we study a criterion for the viability of stochastic semilinear
control systems on a real, separable Hilbert space. The necessary and
sufficient conditions are given using the notion of stochastic quasi-tangency.
As a consequence, we prove that approximate viability and the viability
property coincide for stochastic linear control systems. We obtain Nagumo's
stochastic theorem and we present a method allowing to provide explicit
criteria for the viability of smooth sets. We analyze the conditions
characterizing the viability of the unit ball. The paper generalizes recent
results from the deterministic framework.
