This note studies feedforward circuits as models for perfect adaptation to
step signals in biological systems. A global convergence theorem is proved in a
general framework, which includes examples from the literature as particular
cases. A notable aspect of these circuits is that they do not adapt to pulse
signals, because they display a memory phenomenon. Estimates are given of the
magnitude of this effect.
