We construct explicit compact supersymmetric solutions with non-zero field
strength, non-flat instanton and constant dilaton to the heterotic string
equations in dimension five. We present a quadratic condition on the curvature
which is necessary and sufficient the heterotic supersymmetry and the anomaly
cancellation to imply the heterotic equations of motion in dimension five. We
supply compact nilmanifold in dimension 5 satisfying the heterotic
supersymmetry equations with non-zero fluxes and constant dilaton which obey
the three-form Bianchi identity and solves the heterotic equations of motion in
dimension five.
