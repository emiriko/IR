Using recently developed numerical method we compute charge stiffness and
optical conductivity of the t-J model coupled to optical phonons. Coherent hole
motion is most strongly influenced by the electron-phonon coupling within the
physically relevant regime of the exchange interaction. We find unusual
non-monotonous dependence of the charge stiffness as a function of the exchange
coupling near the crossover to the strong electron-phonon coupling regime.
Optical conductivity in this regime shows a two-peak structure. The
low-frequency peak represents local magnetic excitation, attached to the hole,
while the higher-frequency peak corresponds to the mid infrared band that
originates from coupling to spin-wave excitations, broadened and renormalized
by phonon excitations. We observe no separate peak at or slightly above the
phonon frequency. This finding suggests that the two peak structure seen in
recent optical measurements is due to magnetic excitations coupled to lattice
degrees of freedom via doped charge carriers.
