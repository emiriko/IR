In this paper we develop network protection schemes against two link failures
in optical networks. The motivation behind this work is the fact that the
majority of all available links in an optical network suffer from single and
double link failures. In the proposed network protection schemes, NPS2-I and
NPS2-II, we deploy network coding and reduced capacity on the working paths to
provide backup protection paths. In addition, we demonstrate the encoding and
decoding aspects of the proposed schemes.
