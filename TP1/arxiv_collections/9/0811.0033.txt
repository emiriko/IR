We analyse stability of the four-dimensional Kitaev model - a candidate for
scalable quantum memory - in finite temperature within the weak coupling
Markovian limit. It is shown that, below a critical temperature, certain
topological qubit observables X and Z possess relaxation times exponentially
long in the size of the system. Their construction involves polynomial in
system's size algorithm which uses as an input the results of measurements
performed on all individual spins. We also discuss the drawbacks of such
candidate for quantum memory and mention the implications of the stability of
qubit for statistical mechanics.
