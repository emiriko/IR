It is known that there is no three-dimensional analog of de Sitter black
holes. I show that the analog does exist when non-Gaussian (i.e., ring-type)
smearings of point matter hairs are considered. This provides a new way of
constructing black hole solutions from hairs. I find that the obtained black
hole solutions are quite different from the usual large black holes in that
there are i) large to small black hole transitions which may be considered as
inverse Hawking-Page transitions and ii) soliton-like (i.e., non-perturbative)
behaviors. For Gaussian smearing, there is no black hole but a gravastar
solution exists.
