In the Standard Model, a group of heavy fermions, e.g. top quarks, can
collectively strongly affect the Higgs field and create relatively long-lived
bound states. If there exist new generations of fermions with masses beyond 1
TeV, strong binding of several of them can make them lighter than even a single
heavy fermion. Using the mean field approximation we find multi-fermion states
with masses M ~ 5 v N^{1/2} ~ 1.2 N^{1/2} TeV, with N=2,3... being the total
number of heavy fermions bound together, and v=246 GeV the Higgs VEV. The
experimental search for multi-fermions within the range of energies 2-3 Tev
would either discover them, or suggest absence of new Standard Model fermions
with larger masses. Possible implications related to multi-top states and
baryonic asymmetry of the Universe are discussed.
