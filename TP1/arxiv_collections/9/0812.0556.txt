Perpetual American options are financial instruments that can be readily
exercised and do not mature. In this paper we study in detail the problem of
pricing this kind of derivatives, for the most popular flavour, within a
framework in which some of the properties |volatility and dividend policy| of
the underlying stock can change at a random instant of time, but in such a way
that we can forecast their final values. Under this assumption we can model
actual market conditions because most relevant facts usually entail sharp
predictable consequences. The effect of this potential risk on perpetual
American vanilla options is remarkable: the very equation that will determine
the fair price depends on the solution to be found. Sound results are found
under the optics both of finance and physics. In particular, a parallelism
among the overall outcome of this problem and a phase transition is
established.
