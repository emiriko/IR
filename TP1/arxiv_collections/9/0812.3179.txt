We consider a generalization of Donkin-Koppinen filtrations for coordinate
superalgebras of general linear supergroups. More precisely, if $G=GL(m|n)$ is
a general linear supergroup of (super)degree $(m|n)$, then its coordinate
superalgebra $K[G]$ is a natural $G\times G$-supermodule. For every finitely
generated ideal $\Gamma\subseteq \Lambda\times\Lambda$, the largest
subsupermodule $O_{\Gamma}(K[G])$ of $K[G]$, which has all composition factors
of the form $L(\lambda)\otimes L(\mu)$ where $(\lambda, \mu)\in\Gamma$, has a
decreasing filtration $O_{\Gamma}(K[G])=V_0\supseteq V_1\supseteq...$ such that
$\bigcap_{t\geq 0}V_t=0$ and $V_t/V_{t+1}\simeq V_-(\lambda_t)^*\otimes
H_-^0(\lambda_t)$ for each $t\geq 0$. Here $H_-^0(\lambda)$ is a costandard
$G$-supermodule, and $V_-(\lambda)$ is a standard $G$-supermodule, both of
highest weight $\lambda\in\Lambda$ (see \cite{z}). We deduce the existence of
such a filtration from more general facts about standard and costandard
filtrations in certain highest weight categories which will be proved in
Section 4. Until now, analogous results were known only for highest weight
categories with finite sets of weights. We believe that the reader will find
the results of Section 4 interesting on its own. Finally, we apply our main
result to describe invariants of (co)adjoint action of $G$.
