Content zoning can be understood as a segmentation of textual documents into
zones. This is inspired by [6] who initially proposed an approach for the
argumentative zoning of textual documents. With the prototypical CoZo+ engine,
we focus on content zoning towards an automatic processing of textual streams
while considering only the actors as the zones. We gain information that can be
used to realize an automatic recognition of content for pre-defined actors. We
understand CoZo+ as a necessary pre-step towards an automatic generation of
summaries and to make intellectual ownership of documents detectable.
