For human beings, the processing of text streams of unknown size leads
generally to problems because e.g. noise must be selected out, information be
tested for its relevance or redundancy, and linguistic phenomenon like
ambiguity or the resolution of pronouns be advanced. Putting this into
simulation by using an artificial mind-map is a challenge, which offers the
gate for a wide field of applications like automatic text summarization or
punctual retrieval. In this work we present a framework that is a first step
towards an automatic intellect. It aims at assembling a mind-map based on
incoming text streams and on a subject-verb-object strategy, having the verb as
an interconnection between the adjacent nouns. The mind-map's performance is
enriched by a pronoun resolution engine that bases on the work of D. Klein, and
C. D. Manning.
