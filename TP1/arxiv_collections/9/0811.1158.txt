Black hole entropy calculations which are based on counting of microstates
and based on modified dispersion relations in the framework of loop quantum
gravity are considered. We suggest that the inconsistency of two approaches can
be explained by different ways. This inconsistency can affect the definition
and constancy of the Immirzi parameter or order of the modification constants
of dispersion relations. Possible results of these effects are discussed.
