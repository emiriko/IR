In this paper, the moduli space of singular unitary Hermitian--Einstein
monopoles on the product of a circle and a Riemann surface is shown to
correspond to a moduli space of stable pairs on the Riemann surface. These
pairs consist of a holomorphic vector bundle on the surface and a meromorphic
automorphism of the bundle. The singularities of this automorphism correspond
to the singularities of the singular monopole. We then consider the complex
geometry of the moduli space; in particular, we compute dimensions, both from
the complex geometric and the gauge theoretic point of view.
