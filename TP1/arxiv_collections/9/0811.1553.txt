We examine genetic statistics used in the study of structured populations. In
a 1999 paper, Wakeley observed that the coalescent process associated with the
finite island model can be decomposed into a scattering phase and a collecting
phase. In this paper, we introduce a class of population structure models,
which we refer to as G/KC models, that obey such a decomposition. In a large
population, large sample limit we derive the distribution of the statistic Fst
for all G/KC models under the assumptions of strong or weak mutation. We show
that in the large population, large sample limit the island and two dimensional
stepping stone models are members of the G/KC class of models, thereby deriving
the distributions of Fst for these two well known models as a special case of a
general formula. We show that our analysis of Fst can be extended to an entire
class of genetic statistics, and we use our approach to examine homozygosity
measures. Our analysis uses coalescent based methods.
