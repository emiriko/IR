The height-height correlation function for a fluctuating interface between
two coexisting bulk phases is derived by means of general equilibrium
properties of the corresponding density-density correlation function. A
wavelength-dependent surface tension $\gamma(\mathbf{q})$ can be defined and
expressed in terms of the direct correlation function
$c(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$, the equilibrium density profile
$\rho_{\circ}(\mathbf{r})$ and an operator which relates density to surface
configurations. Neither the concept of an effective interface Hamiltonian nor
the difference in pressure is needed to determine the general structure of the
height-height correlations or $\gamma(\mathbf{q})$, respectively. This result
generalizes the Mecke/Dietrich surface tension $\gmd$ (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 59},
p. 6766 (1999)) and modifies recently published criticism concerning $\gmd$ (P.
Tarazona, R. Checa and, E.Chac\'{o}n: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, p. 196101
(2007)).
