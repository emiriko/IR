Multi-pronged tracks have been recorded in the polyethylene terephthalate
(C$_{10}$H$_8$O$_4$)$_n$ solid state nuclear track detector by exposure to a
$^{252}$Cf fission source. After chemical etching, two-prong to six-pronged
tracks along with single tracks have been observed under the optical
microscope. We carried out a systematic study to understand the origin of the
prongs. The track detectors were coated with metals (Cu, Ag and Pb) and were
exposed to $^{252}$Cf source. After chemical etching two-prong to four pronged
tracks were observed in each plate. We believe that at this very low energy of
the order of 1 MeV/A, Coulomb fission is the only plausible explanation for the
origin of such multi-pronged tracks.
