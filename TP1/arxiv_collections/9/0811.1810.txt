We give a simple analytic criterion which characterizes linearizable
1-codimensional webs. Then we give an invariant geometrical interpretation of
it, in term of projective connection. We explain then how our approach allows
to study linearization of more general objects than 1-codimensional webs. By
way of illustration, we treat some explicit interesting examples.
