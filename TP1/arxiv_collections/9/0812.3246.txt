The pretzelosity distribution function $h_{1T}^\perp$ is studied in a
covariant the quark-parton model which describes the structure of the nucleon
in terms of 3D quark intrinsic motion. This relativistic model framework
supports the relation between helicity, transversity and pretzelosity observed
in other relativistic models {\sl without} assuming SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry.
Numerical results and predictions for SIDIS experiments are presented.
