A robust, fast and accurate method for solving the Colebrook-like equations
is presented. The algorithm is efficient for the whole range of parameters
involved in the Colebrook equation. The computations are not more demanding
than simplified approximations, but they are much more accurate. The algorithm
is also faster and more robust than the Colebrook solution expressed in term of
the Lambert W-function. Matlab and FORTRAN codes are provided.
