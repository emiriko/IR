The CMS Pixel detector, consisting of three barrel layers and two endcap
disks at each barrel end, was installed in the CMS experiment in summer 2008.
After a preliminary commissioning phase with pulse injections the detector
participated to data taking with cosmic ray trigger and 3.8T field. In this
article, we describe the software for event reconstruction, as well as the
status of the calibration tools. In addition, we report on the first running
experience with CMS and present preliminary results on detector performance.
