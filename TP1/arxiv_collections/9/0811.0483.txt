The thermodynamic consistency of quasiparticle boson system with effective
mass $m^*$ and zero chemical potential is studied. We take the quasiparticle
gluon plasma model as a toy model. The failure of previous treatments based on
traditional partial derivative is addressed. We show that a consistent
thermodynamic treatment can be applied to such boson system provided that a new
degree of freedom $m^*$ is introduced in the partial derivative calculation. A
pressure modification term different from the vacuum contribution is derived
based on the new independent variable $m^*$. A complete and self-consistent
thermodynamic treatment for quasiparticle system, which can be widely applied
to effective mass models, has been constructed.
