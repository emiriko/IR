A number of astrophysical scenarios possess and preserve an overall
cylindrical symmetry also when undergoing a catastrophic and nonlinear
evolution. Exploiting such a symmetry, these processes can be studied through
numerical-relativity simulations at smaller computational costs and at
considerably larger spatial resolutions. We here present a new
flux-conservative formulation of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations in
cylindrical coordinates. By rearranging those terms in the equations which are
the sources of the largest numerical errors, the new formulation yields a
global truncation error which is one or more orders of magnitude smaller than
those of alternative and commonly used formulations. We illustrate this through
a series of numerical tests involving the evolution of oscillating spherical
and rotating stars, as well as shock-tube tests.
