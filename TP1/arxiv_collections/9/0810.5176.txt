Let $N$ be a positive integer and let $f$ be a newform of weight 2 on
$\Gamma_0(N)$. In earlier joint work with K. Ribet and W. Stein, we introduced
the notions of the modular number and the congruence number of the quotient
abelian variety $A_f$ of $J_0(N)$ associated to the newform $f$. These
invariants are analogs of the notions of the modular degree and congruence
primes respectively associated to elliptic curves. We show that if $p$ is a
prime such that every maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra of characteristic $p$
that contains the annihilator ideal of $f$ satisfies multiplicity one, then the
modular number and the congruence number have the same $p$-adic valuation.
