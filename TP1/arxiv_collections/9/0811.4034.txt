We describe the method allowing quantitative interpretation of absorptive
images of mixtures of BEC and thermal atoms which reduces possible systematic
errors associated with evaluation of the contribution of each fraction. By
using known temperature dependence of the BEC fraction, the analysis allows
precise calibration of the fitting results. The developed method is verified in
two different measurements and compares well with theoretical calculations and
with measurements performed by another group.
