We use macroscopic holes drilled in a bulk YBCO superconductor to probe its
magnetic properties in the volume of the sample. The sample is subjected to an
AC magnetic flux with a density ranging from 30mT to 130mT and the flux in the
superconductor is probed by miniature coils inserted in the holes. In a given
hole, three different penetration regimes can be observed: (i) the shielded
regime, where no magnetic flux threads the hole; (ii) the gradual penetration
regime, where the waveform of the magnetic field has a clipped sine shape whose
fundamental component scales with the applied field; and (iii) the flux
concentration regime, where the waveform of the magnetic field is nearly a sine
wave, with an amplitude exceeding that of the applied field by up to a factor
of two. The distribution of the penetration regimes in the holes is compared
with that of the magnetic flux density at the top and bottom surfaces of the
sample, and is interpreted with the help of optical polarized light micrographs
of these surfaces. We show that the measurement of the magnetic field inside
the holes can be used as a local characterization of the bulk magnetic
properties of the sample.
