Under appropriate circumstances the electrons emitted from a superconducting
tip can be entangled. We analyze these nonlocal correlations by studying the
coincidences of the field-emitted electrons and show that electrons emitted in
opposite directions violate Bell's inequality. We scrutinize the interplay
between the bosonic nature of Cooper pairs and the fermionic nature of
electrons. We further discuss the feasibility of our analysis in the light of
present experimental capabilities.
