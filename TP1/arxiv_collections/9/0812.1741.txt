We construct the equation of a state of the classical QGP valid for all
values of Gamma=V/K, the ratio of the mean Coulomb to kinetic energy. By
enforcing the Gibbs relations, we derive the pertinent pressure and entropy
densities for all Gamma. For the case of an SU(2) classical gluonic plasma our
results compare well with lattice simulations. We show that the strongly
coupled component of the classical QGP contributes significantly to the bulk
thermodynamics across T_c.
