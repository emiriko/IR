We report the boron isotope effect on the E2g phonon mode by micro-Raman
spectroscopy on the ternary Mg1-xAlxB2 system, synthesized with pure isotopes
10B and 11B. The isotope coefficient on the phonon frequency is near 0.5 in the
full range decreasing near x = 0. The intraband electron-phonon (e-ph)
coupling, for the electrons in the sigma band, has been extracted from the E2g
line-width and frequency softening. Tuning the Fermi energy near the electronic
topological transition (ETT), where the sigma Fermi surface changes from 2D to
3D topology the E2g mode, shows the known Kohn anomaly on the 2D side of the
ETT and a splitting of the E2g phonon frequency into a hard and soft component
from x = 0 to x = 0.28. The results suggest a minor role of the intraband
phonon mediated pairing in the control of the high critical temperature in
Mg1-xAlxB2. The common physical features of diborides with the novel multigap
FeAs-based superconductors and cuprates is discussed.
