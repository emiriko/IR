Coherent pi^+ and pi^0 production in low energy neutrino reactions is
discussed in the framework of the partially conserved axial vector current
theory (PCAC). The role of lepton mass effects in suppressing the pi^+
production is emphasized. Instead of using models of pion nucleus scattering,
the available data on pion Carbon scattering are implemented for an analysis of
the PCAC prediction. Our results agree well with the published upper limits for
pi^+ production but are much below the recent MiniBooNE result for pi^0
production.
