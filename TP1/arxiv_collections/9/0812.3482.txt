In this paper, we consider the spectrum of a model in quantum electrodynamics
with a spatial cutoff. It is proven that (1) the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint;
  (2) under the infrared regularity condition, the Hamiltonian has a unique
ground state for sufficiently small values of coupling constants. The spectral
scattering theory is studied as well and it is shown that asymptotic fields
exist and the spectral gap is closed.
