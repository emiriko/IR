In this work we present a comparison of multiband k.p-models, the effective
bond-orbital approach, and an empirical tight-binding model to calculate the
electronic structure for the example of a truncated pyramidal GaN/AlN
self-assembled quantum dot with a zincblende structure. For the system under
consideration, we find a very good agreement between the results of the
microscopic models and the 8-band k.p-formalism, in contrast to a 6+2-band
k.p-model, where conduction band and valence band are assumed to be decoupled.
This indicates a surprisingly strong coupling between conduction and valence
band states for the wide band gap materials GaN and AlN. Special attention is
paid to the possible influence of the weak spin-orbit coupling on the localized
single-particle wave functions of the investigated structure.
