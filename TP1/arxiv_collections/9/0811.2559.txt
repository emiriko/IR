Peaks observed by Belle in DD at 3.878 GeV and in D*D* at 4.156 GeV may be
fitted by phase space multiplied by a form factor with an RMS radius of
interaction 0.63 fm. The peak observed in Lambda_C Lambda_C at 4.63 GeV may be
explained by Y(4660), multiplied by a corresponding form factor with RMS radius
0.94 fm.
