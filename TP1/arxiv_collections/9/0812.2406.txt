We describe the equation of motion of two charged spherical shells with
tangential pressure in the field of a central Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) source.
We solve the problem of determining the motion of the two shells \textsl{after}
the intersection by solving the related Einstein-Maxwell equations and by
requiring a physical continuity condition on the shells velocities.
  We consider also four applications: post-Newtonian and ultra-relativistic
approximations, a test-shell case, and the ejection mechanism of one shell.
  This work is a direct generalization of Barkov-Belinski-Bisnovati-Kogan
paper.
