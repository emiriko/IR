We have performed precision electrostatic calibrations in the sphere-plane
geometry and observed anomalous behavior. Namely, the scaling exponent of the
electrostatic signal with distance was found to be smaller than expected on the
basis of the pure Coulombian contribution and the residual potential found to
be distance dependent. We argue that these findings affect the accuracy of the
electrostatic calibrations and invite reanalysis of previous determinations of
the Casimir force.
