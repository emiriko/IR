We show that a large subclass of variograms is closed under products and that
some desirable stability properties, such as the product of special
compositions, can be obtained within the proposed setting. We introduce new
classes of kernels of Schoenberg-L\'{e}vy type and demonstrate some important
properties of rotationally invariant variograms.
