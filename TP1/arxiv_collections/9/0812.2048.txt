We investigate the factuality of the hypothetical magnetic monopole and the
nature of the static magnetic field. It is shown from many aspects that the
concept of the massive magnetic monopoles clearly is physically untrue. We
argue that the static magnetic field of a bar magnet, in fact, is the static
electric field of the periodically quasi-one-dimensional electric-dipole
superlattice, which can be well established in some transition metals with the
localized d-electron. This research may shed light on the perfect unification
of magnetic and electrical phenomena.
