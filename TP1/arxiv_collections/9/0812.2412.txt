This paper presents an impact assessment for the imputation of missing data.
The data set used is HIV Seroprevalence data from an antenatal clinic study
survey performed in 2001. Data imputation is performed through five methods:
Random Forests, Autoassociative Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms,
Autoassociative Neuro-Fuzzy configurations, and two Random Forest and Neural
Network based hybrids. Results indicate that Random Forests are superior in
imputing missing data in terms both of accuracy and of computation time, with
accuracy increases of up to 32% on average for certain variables when compared
with autoassociative networks. While the hybrid systems have significant
promise, they are hindered by their Neural Network components. The imputed data
is used to test for impact in three ways: through statistical analysis, HIV
status classification and through probability prediction with Logistic
Regression. Results indicate that these methods are fairly immune to imputed
data, and that the impact is not highly significant, with linear correlations
of 96% between HIV probability prediction and a set of two imputed variables
using the logistic regression analysis.
