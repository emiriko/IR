We study open charm production at high energies in the framework of the
quasi-multi-Regge-kinematics approach applying the quark-Reggeization
hypothesis implemented with Reggeon-Reggeon-particle and
Reggeon-particle-particle effective vertices. Adopting the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin
unintegrated quark and gluon distribution functions of the proton and photon,
we thus nicely describe the proton structure function F_{2,c} measured at DESY
HERA as well as the transverse-momentum distributions of D mesons created by
photoproduction at HERA and by hadroproduction at the Fermilab Tevatron.
