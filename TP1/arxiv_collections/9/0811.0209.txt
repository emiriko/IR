We construct finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras \mathfrak u_{r,s}(G_2)
(i.e. restricted 2-parameter quantum groups) from the 2-parameter quantum group
U_{r,s}(G_2) defined in \cite{HS}, which turn out to be of Drinfel'd doubles,
where a crucial point is to give a detailed combinatorial construction of the
convex PBW-type Lyndon basis for type G_2 in 2-parameter quantum version. After
furnishing possible commutation relations among quantum root vectors, we show
that the restricted quantum groups are ribbon Hopf algebras under certain
conditions through determining their left and right integrals. Besides these,
we determine all of the Hopf algebra isomorphisms of u_{r,s}(G_2) in terms of
the description of the sets of its left (right) skew-primitive elements.
