This paper deals with the distribution of descent number in standard Young
tableaux of certain shapes. A simple explicit formula is presented for the
number of tableaux of any shape with two rows, with any specified number of
descents. For shapes of three rows with one cell in the third row recursive
formulas are given, and are solved in certain cases.
