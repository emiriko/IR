The main consequences of de Sitter Special Relativity to the Standard
Cosmological Model of Physical Cosmology are examined. The cosmological
constant Lambda appears, in this theory, as a manifestation of the proper
conformal current, which must be added to the usual energy-momentum density. As
that conformal current itself vanishes in absence of sources, Lambda is
ultimately dependent on the matter content, and can in principle be calculated.
A present-day value very close to that given by the crossed supernova/BBR data
is obtained through simple and reasonable approximations. Also a primeval
inflation of polynomial type is found, and the usual notion of co-moving
observer is slightly modified.
