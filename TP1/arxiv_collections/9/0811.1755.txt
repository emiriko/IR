We argue that the resonance-like structures Y(4260)
(arXiv:hep-ex/0506081,arXiv:0707.2541), Y(4360), Y(4660) (arXiv:0707.3699) and
Y(4635) (arXiv:0807.4458), which were recently reported to have been observed
in experiment, are non-resonant manifestations of the Regge zeros that appear
in the production amplitude of the Resonance-Spectrum Expansion. Charmonium
c-cbar states are visible on the slopes of these enhancements.
