In the pyrochlore lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, for large spin length
$S$, the massive classical ground state degeneracy is partly lifted by the
zero-point energy of quantum fluctuations at harmonic order in spin-waves.
However, there remains an infinite manifold of degenerate collinear ground
states, related by a gaugelike symmetry. We have extended the spin-wave
calculation to quartic order, assuming a Gaussian variational wavefunction
(equivalent to Hartree-Fock approximation). Quartic calculations \emph{do}
break the harmonic-order degeneracy of periodic ground states. The form of the
effective Hamiltonian describing this splitting, which depends on loops, was
fitted numerically and also rationalized analytically. We find a family of
states that are still almost degenerate, being split by the term from loops of
length 26. We also calculated the anharmonic terms for the checkerboard
lattice, and discuss why it (as well as the kagom\'e lattice) behave
differently than the pyrochlore at anharmonic orders.
