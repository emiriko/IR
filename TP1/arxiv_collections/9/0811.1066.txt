Using the Ritus eingenfunction method we compute corrections to the electron
mass m_{0} in the presence of a moderate magnetic field eB ~ m_0^2. From this
we obtain an expression for the anomalous magnetic moment near the critic
field. For this we solved numerically the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the
rainbow approximation including all Landau levels without make any assumption
respect to the field strength.
