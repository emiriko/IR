Every driver knows that severe weather conditions cause traffic congestions.
In many cases there is no direct reason for the congestion, and people tend to
attribute it to the slow driving mode. Our computational study shows that the
slow driving cannot account for this phenomenon. It comes out that the reason
is not the decrease in mean velocity, but rather the change in the speed
distribution on the road. Width of the distribution, namely - the number of
"very fast" or "very slow" vehicles, affects both the need and the availability
of lane change and bypassing. Besides providing insight and analyzing the
underlying mechanism of a collective phenomenon, this example sheds light on a
fundamental aspect of computational modeling. Although simple-as-possible
models are desirable and provide better understanding of the real important
component of the modeled system, they can very easily turn into
over-simplifications and miss relevant qualitative phenomena.
