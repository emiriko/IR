We review briefly the quantum fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions
in a pedagogical manner. We try to relate all established but scattered results
on the leading term of the fidelity into a systematic theoretical framework,
which might provide an alternative paradigm for understanding quantum critical
phenomena. The definition of the fidelity and the scaling behavior of its
leading term, as well as their explicit applications to the one-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, are introduced
at the graduate-student level. In addition, we survey also other types of
fidelity approach, such as the fidelity per site, reduced fidelity,
thermal-state fidelity, operator fidelity, etc; as well as relevant works on
the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions occurring in various
many-body systems.
