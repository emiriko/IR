Room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor rutile Ti1-xCoxO2-\delta (101)
epitaxial thin films were grown on r-sapphire substrates by a dc sputtering
method. Ferromagnetic magnetization, magnetic circular dichroism, and anomalous
Hall effect were clearly observed at room temperature in sputter-grown films
for the first time. The magnetization value is nearly as large as 3\mu B/Co
that is consistent with the high spin state Co2+ in this compound recently
established by spectroscopic methods. Consequently, its originally large
magneto-optical response is further enhanced.
