The realization of single-molecule electronic devices, in which a
nanometer-scale molecule is connected to macroscopic leads, requires the
reproducible production of highly ordered nanoscale gaps in which a molecule of
interest is electrostatically coupled to nearby gate electrodes. Understanding
how the molecule-gate coupling depends on key parameters is crucial for the
development of high-performance devices. Here we directly address this,
presenting two- and three-dimensional finite-element electrostatic simulations
of the electrode geometries formed using emerging fabrication techniques. We
quantify the gate coupling intrinsic to these devices, exploring the roles of
parameters believed to be relevant to such devices. These include the thickness
and nature of the dielectric used, and the gate screening due to different
device geometries. On the single-molecule (~1nm) scale, we find that device
geometry plays a greater role in the gate coupling than the dielectric constant
or the thickness of the insulator. Compared to the typical uniform nanogap
electrode geometry envisioned, we find that non-uniform tapered electrodes
yield a significant three orders of magnitude improvement in gate coupling. We
also find that in the tapered geometry the polarizability of a molecular
channel works to enhance the gate coupling.
