Sum frequency generation vibrational spectra of the water molecules at the
NaF and KF aqueous solution surfaces showed significantly different spectral
features and different concentration dependence. This result is the first
direct observation of the cation effects of the simple alkali cations, which
have been believed to be depleted from the aqueous surface, on the hydrogen
bonding structure of the water molecules at the electrolyte solution surfaces.
These observations may provide important clue to understand the fundamental
phenomenon of ions at the air/water interface.
