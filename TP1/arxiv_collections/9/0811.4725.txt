Algebraic scheme for constructing deformations of structure constants for
associative algebras generated by a deformation driving algebras (DDAs) is
discussed. An ideal of left divisors of zero plays a central role in this
construction. Deformations of associative three-dimensional algebras with the
DDA being a three-dimensional Lie algebra and their connection with integrable
systems are studied.
