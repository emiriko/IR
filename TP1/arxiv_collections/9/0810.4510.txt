GammeV is an experiment conducted at Fermilab that employs the light shining
through a wall technique to search for axion-like particles and employs a
particle in a jar technique to search for dilaton-like chameleon particles. We
obtain limits on the coupling of photons to an axion-like particle that extend
previous limits for both scalars and pseudoscalars in the milli-eV mass range.
We are able to exclude the axion-like particle interpretation of the anomalous
PVLAS 2006 result by more than 5 standard deviations. We also present results
on a search for chameleons and set limits on their possible coupling to
photons.
