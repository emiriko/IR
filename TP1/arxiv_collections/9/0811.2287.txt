We review the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition of cold atoms in
optical lattices. The experimental signatures of the transition are discussed
and the RPA theory of the Bose-Hubbard model briefly described. We point out
that the critical behavior at the transition, as well as the prediction by the
RPA theory of a gapped mode (besides the Bogoliubov sound mode) in the
superfluid phase, are difficult to understand from the Bogoliubov theory. On
the other hand, these findings appear to be intimately connected to the
non-trivial infrared behavior of the superfluid phase as recently studied
within the non-perturbative renormalization group.
