We investigate the chiral odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for
non-zero skewness $\zeta$ in transverse and longitudinal position spaces by
taking Fourier transform with respect to the transverse and longitudinal
momentum transfer respectively. We present overlap formulas for the chiral-odd
GPDs in terms of light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the proton both in the
ERBL and DGLAP regions. We calculate them in a field theory inspired model of a
relativistic spin 1/2 composite state with the correct correlation between the
different LFWFs in Fock space, namely that of the quantum fluctuations of an
electron in a generalized form of QED. We show the spin-orbit correlation
effect of the two-particle LFWF as well as the correlation between the
constituent spin and the transverse spin of the target.
