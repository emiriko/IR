We show a relationship between Chern-Simons 1- and 3-forms and harmonic forms
on a principal bundle. Doing so requires one to consider an adiabatic limit.
For the 3-form case, assume that G is simple and the corresponding Chern-Weil
4-form is exact. Then, the Chern-Simons 3-form on the princpal bundle G-bundle,
minus a canonical term from the base, is harmonic in the adiabatic limit.
