Current-induced domain wall (DW) displacements in an array of ultrathin
Pt/Co/AlOx wires with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have been directly
observed by wide field Kerr microscopy. DWs in all wires in the array were
driven simultaneously and their displacement on the micrometer-scale was
controlled by the current pulse amplitude and duration. At the lower current
densities where DW displacements were observed (j less than or equal to 1.5 x
10^12 A/m^2), the DW motion obeys a creep law. At higher current density (j =
1.8 x 10^12 A/m^2), zero-field average DW velocities up to 130 +/- 10 m/s were
recorded.
