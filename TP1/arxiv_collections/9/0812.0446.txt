The short--time self diffusion coefficient of a sphere in a suspension of
rigid rods is calculated in first order in the rod volume fraction. For low rod
concentrations the correction to the Einstein diffusion constant of the sphere
is a linear function of the rod volume fraction with the slope proportional to
the equilibrium averaged mobility diminution trace of the sphere interacting
with a single freely translating and rotating rod. The two--body hydrodynamic
interactions are calculated using the so--called bead model in which the rod is
replaced by a stiff linear chain of touching spheres. The interactions between
spheres are calculated numerically using the multipole method. Also an
analytical expression for the diffusion coefficient as a function of the rod
aspect ratio is derived in the limit of very long rods. We show that in this
limit the correction to the Einstein diffusion constant does not depend on the
size of the tracer sphere. The higher order corrections depending on the
applied model are computed numerically. An approximate expression is provided,
valid for a wide range of aspect ratios.
