Relations between the tunneling rate and the unified first law of
thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of the FRW universe are investigated.
The tunneling rate arises as a consequence of the unified first law of
thermodynamics in such a dynamical system. The analysis shows obviously how the
tunneling is intimately connected with the unified first law of thermodynamics
through the principle of conservation of energy.
