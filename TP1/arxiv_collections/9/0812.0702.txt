We investigate numerically the process of the passage of a radiation pulse
through a wormhole and the subsequent evolution of the wormhole that is caused
by the gravitational action of this pulse. The initial static wormhole is
modeled by the spherically symmetrical Armendariz-Picon solution with zero
mass. The radiation pulses are modeled by spherically symmetrical shells of
self-gravitating massless scalar fields. We demonstrate that the compact signal
propagates through the wormhole and investigate the dynamics of the fields in
this process for both cases: collapse of the wormhole into the black hole and
for the expanding wormhole.
