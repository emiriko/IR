The direct detection of gravitational waves will provide valuable
astrophysical information about many celestial objects. The most promising
sources of gravitational waves are neutron stars and black holes. These objects
emit waves in a very wide spectrum of frequencies determined by their
quasi-normal modes oscillations. In this work we are concerned with the
information we can extract from f and p$_I$-modes when a candidate leaves its
signature in the resonant mass detectors ALLEGRO, EXPLORER, NAUTILUS, MiniGrail
and SCHENBERG. Using the empirical equations, that relate the gravitational
wave frequency and damping time with the mass and radii of the source, we have
calculated the radii of the stars for a given interval of masses $M$ in the
range of frequencies that include the bandwidth of all resonant mass detectors.
With these values we obtain diagrams of mass-radii for different frequencies
that allowed to determine the better candidates to future detection taking in
account the compactness of the source. Finally, to determine which are the
models of compact stars that emit gravitational waves in the frequency band of
the mass resonant detectors, we compare the mass-radii diagrams obtained by
different neutron stars sequences from several relativistic hadronic equations
of state (GM1, GM3, TM1, NL3) and quark matter equations of state (NJL, MTI bag
model). We verify that quark stars obtained from MIT bag model with bag
constant equal to 170 MeV and quark of matter in color-superconductivity phase
are the best candidates for mass resonant detectors.
