We investigate ballistic transport and quantum interference in a nanoscale
quantum wire loop fab-ricated as a GaAs/AlGaAs field-effect heterostructure.
Four-terminal measurements of current and voltage characteristics as a function
of top gate voltages show negative bend resistance as a clear signature of
ballistic transport. In perpendicular magnetic fields phase-coherent transport
leads to Aharonov-Bohm (AB) conductance oscillations which show equal
amplitudes in the local and the non-local measurement at a temperature of 1.5 K
and above. We attribute this novel observation to the symmetry of the
orthogonal cross junctions connecting the four quantum wire leads with the
asymmetric quantum wire ring.
