Electron trapping following exposition to ionising radiations and consequent
electron release during variation of temperature in solids represent processes
happening at the quantum microphysical level. The interesting feature of the
thermally stimulated process, that in fact deserves further investigation, is
that the dynamic of electrons release during, variation of the temperature,
here examined through the so called thermoluminescent Glow Curve, evidences
chaotic and fractal regimes. Phase space reconstruction, Correlation Dimension,
largest Lyapunov exponent, Recurrence Quantification Analysis(RQA) and fractal
dimension analysis, developed by calculation of Hurst exponent, are performed
on three samples. The results unequivocally fix that Glow Curves respond to a
chaotic regime. RQA supports such results revealing the inner structure of Glow
Curve signals in relation to their properties of recurrence, determinism and
intermittency signed from laminarity as well as chaos-chaos and chaos order
transitions.
