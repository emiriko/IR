The classical relativistic wave equations are presented as partial difference
equations in the arena of covariant discrete phase space. These equations are
also expressed as difference-differential equations in discrete phase space and
continuous time. The relativistic invariance and covariance of the equations in
both versions are established. The partial difference and
difference-differential equations are derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations
from the variational principle. The difference and difference-differential
conservation equations are derived. Finally, the total momentum, energy, and
charge of the relativistic classical fields satisfying difference-differential
equations are computed.
