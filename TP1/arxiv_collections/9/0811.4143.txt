The noise spectra associated with correlations of the current through a
single level quantum dot, and with the charge fluctuations on the dot, are
calculated for a finite bias voltage. The results turn out to be sensitive to
the asymmetry of the dot's coupling to the two leads. At zero temperature, both
spectra exhibit two or four steps (as a function of the frequency), depending
on whether the resonant level lies outside or within the range between the
chemical potentials on the two leads. In addition, the low frequency shot-noise
exhibits dips in the charge noise and dips, peaks, and discontinuities in the
derivative of the current noise. In spite of some smearing, several of these
features persist at finite temperatures, where a dip can also turn into a peak.
