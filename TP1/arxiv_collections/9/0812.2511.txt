Results on diffraction from the Fermilab Tevatron collider obtained by the
CDF II Collaboration using data from proton-antiproton collisions at a c.m.s.
energy of 1.96 TeV are reviewed and compared with theoretical expectations.
Implications for predictions of exclusive Higgs boson production rates at the
Large Hadron Collider are discussed.
