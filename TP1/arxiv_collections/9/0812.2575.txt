Recently, Adaboost has been widely used to improve the accuracy of any given
learning algorithm. In this paper we focus on designing an algorithm to employ
combination of Adaboost with Support Vector Machine as weak component
classifiers to be used in Face Detection Task. To obtain a set of effective
SVM-weaklearner Classifier, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the kernel
parameter in SVM instead of using a fixed one. Proposed combination outperforms
in generalization in comparison with SVM on imbalanced classification problem.
The proposed here method is compared, in terms of classification accuracy, to
other commonly used Adaboost methods, such as Decision Trees and Neural
Networks, on CMU+MIT face database. Results indicate that the performance of
the proposed method is overall superior to previous Adaboost approaches.
