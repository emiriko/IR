We compute the spin asymmetry and polarization of the final-state baryon in
its rest frame in two-body meson--baryon low-energy scattering with unpolarized
initial state, to lowest non-trivial order in BChPT. The required absorptive
amplitudes are obtained analytically at one-loop level. We discuss the
polarization results numerically for several meson--baryon processes. Even at
low energies above threshold, where BChPT can reasonably be expected to be
applicable, sizable values of polarization are found for some processes.
