Nucleus-nucleus interaction potentials in heavy-ion fusion reactions are
extracted from the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. When the
center-of-mass energy is much higher than the Coulomb barrier energy, extracted
potentials identify with the frozen density approximation. As the
center-of-mass energy decreases to the Coulomb barrier energy, potentials
become energy dependent. This dependence indicates dynamical reorganization of
internal degrees of freedom and leads to a reduction of the "apparent" barrier.
Including this effect leads to the Coulomb barrier energy very close to
experimental one. Aspects of one-body energy dissipation extracted from the
mean-field theory are discussed.
