New fast estimation methods stemming from control theory lead to a fresh look
at time series, which bears some resemblance to "technical analysis". The
results are applied to a typical object of financial engineering, namely the
forecast of foreign exchange rates, via a "model-free" setting, i.e., via
repeated identifications of low order linear difference equations on sliding
short time windows. Several convincing computer simulations, including the
prediction of the position and of the volatility with respect to the forecasted
trendline, are provided. $\mathcal{Z}$-transform and differential algebra are
the main mathematical tools.
