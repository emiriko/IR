The second $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ parafermionic conformal theories are associated
with the coset construction $\frac{SU(2)_{k}\times SU(2)_{4}}{SU(2)_{k+4}} $.
Solid-on-solid integrable lattice models obtained by fusion of the model based
on level-1 representation of the affine algebra $B_1^{(1)}$ have a critical
point described by these conformal theories. Explicit values for the Boltzmann
weights are derived for these models, and it is shown that the Boltzmann
weights can be made positive for a particular value of the spectral parameter,
opening a way to eventual numerical simulations of these conformal field
theories. Away from criticality, these lattice models describe an integrable,
massive perturbation of the parafermionic conformal theory by the relevant
field $\Psi_{-2/3}^{\dagger}D_{1,3} $.
