Potential steps naturally develop in graphene near metallic contacts. We
investigate the influence of these steps on the transport in graphene Field
Effect Transistors. We give simple expressions to estimate the
voltage-dependent contribution of the contacts to the total resistance and
noise in the diffusive and ballistic regimes.
