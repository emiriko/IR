Although it is believed unlikely that $\NP$-hard problems admit efficient
quantum algorithms, it has been shown that a quantum verifier can solve
$\NP$-complete problems given a "short" quantum proof; more precisely,
$\NP\subseteq \QMA_{\log}(2)$ where $\QMA_{\log}(2)$ denotes the class of
quantum Merlin-Arthur games in which there are two unentangled provers who send
two logarithmic size quantum witnesses to the verifier. The inclusion
$\NP\subseteq \QMA_{\log}(2)$ has been proved by Blier and Tapp by stating a
quantum Merlin-Arthur protocol for 3-coloring with perfect completeness and gap
$\frac{1}{24n^6}$. Moreover, Aaronson {\it et al.} have shown the above
inclusion with a constant gap by considering $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
witnesses of logarithmic size. However, we still do not know if
$\QMA_{\log}(2)$ with a constant gap contains $\NP$. In this paper, we show
that 3-SAT admits a $\QMA_{\log}(2)$ protocol with the gap
$\frac{1}{n^{3+\epsilon}}$ for every constant $\epsilon>0$.
