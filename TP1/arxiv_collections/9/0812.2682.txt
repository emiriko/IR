In this paper we construct integrable three-dimensional quantum-mechanical
systems with magnetic fields, admitting pairs of commuting second-order
integrals of motion. The case of Cartesian coordinates is considered. Most of
the systems obtained are new and not related to the separation of variables in
the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.
