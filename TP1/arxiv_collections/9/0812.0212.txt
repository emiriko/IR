Using spin 1/2 particle elastic scattering on a fixed target, in a 1/|x|
potential on Euclidean metric, a minimum scattering cross section appears from
the spin contribution. Interpreted as semi-classical limit of an earlier
proposed operator formulation of four dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity,
using non-associative complex octonion algebra, this is understood as an area
quantum for the observation: Existence of finite (quantized) charges yields a
minimum area element of interaction. This suggests that models built on the
fundamental assumption of a quantized area element (namely as in Loop Quantum
Gravity) may in principle approximate General Relativity in the non-quantum
limit.
