We study the entanglement content of a class of mesoscopic tunable magnetic
systems. The systems are closed finite spin-1/2 chains with ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor interactions frustrated by antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor interactions. The finite chains display a series of level
crossings reflecting the incommensurate physics of the corresponding
infinite-size chain. We present dramatic entanglement signatures characterizing
these unusual level crossings. We focus on multi-spin and global measures of
entanglement rather than only one-spin or two-spin entanglements. We compare
and contrast the information obtained from these measures to that obtained from
traditional condensed matter measures such as correlation functions.
