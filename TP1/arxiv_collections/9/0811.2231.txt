We study the conductance through Aharonov-Bohm finite ladder rings with
strongly interacting electrons, modelled by the prototypical t-J model. For a
wide range of parameters we observe characteristic dips in the conductance as a
function of magnetic flux, predicted so far only in chains which are a
signature of spin and charge separation. These results open the possibility of
observing this peculiar many-body phenomenon in anisotropic ladder systems and
in real nanoscopic devices.
