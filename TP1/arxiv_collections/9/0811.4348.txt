In the presented study, a numerical model which predicts the flow-induced
collapse within the pharyngeal airway is validated using in vitro measurements.
Theoretical simplifications were considered to limit the computation time.
Systematic comparisons between simulations and measurements were performed on
an in vitro replica, which reflects asymmetries of the geometry and of the
tissue properties at the base of the tongue and in pathological conditions
(strong initial obstruction). First, partial obstruction is observed and
predicted. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of the numerical model is of 4.2%
concerning the deformation (mean quadratic error on the constriction area). It
shows the ability of the assumptions and method to predict accurately and
quickly a fluid-structure interaction.
