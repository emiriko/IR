There is strong evidence from cosmological data that the universe underwent
an epoch of superluminal expansion called inflation. A satisfactory embedding
of inflation in fundamental physics has been an outstanding problem at the
interface of cosmology and high energy physics. We show how inflation can be
realized within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The inflaton
candidates are two specific combinations of supersymmetric partners of quarks
and leptons. MSSM inflation occurs at a low scale and generates perturbations
in the range experimentally allowed by the latest data from Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). The parameter space for inflation is compatible with
supersymmetric dark matter, and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is capable of
discovering the inflaton candidates in the allowed regions of parameter space.
