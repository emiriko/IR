The photon-induced processes at the $LHC$ provide clean experimental
conditions due to absence of the proton remnants, which might produce
complementary and interesting results for tests of the standard model and for
searching of new physics. In the context of the littlest $Higgs$ model with
T-parity, we consider the photon-induced production of the mirror quarks at the
$LHC$. The cross sections for various production channels are calculated and a
simply phenomenology analysis is performed by assuming leptonic decays.
