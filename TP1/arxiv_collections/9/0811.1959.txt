No single information source can be good enough to satisfy the divergent and
dynamic needs of users all the time. Integrating information from divergent
sources can be a solution to deficiencies in information content. We present
how Information from multimedia document can be collected based on associating
a generic database to a federated database. Information collected in this way
is brought into relevance by integrating the parameters of usage and user's
parameter for decision making. We identified seven different classifications of
multimedia document.
