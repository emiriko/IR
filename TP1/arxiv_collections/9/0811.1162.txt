We study the connection between the parameters of the fractional
Fokker-Planck equation, which is associated with the overdamped Langevin
equation driven by noise with heavy-tailed increments, and the transition
probability density of the noise generating process. Explicit expressions for
these parameters are derived both for finite and infinite variance of the
rescaled transition probability density.
