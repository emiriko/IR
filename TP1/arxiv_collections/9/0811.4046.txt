We present an entanglement purification protocol for a mixture of a pure
entangled state and a pure product state, which are orthogonal to each other.
The protocol is combination of bisection method and one-way hashing protocol.
We give recursive formula for the rate of the protocol for different states,
i.e. the number of maximally entangled two-qubit pairs obtained with the
protocol per a single copy of the initial state. We also calculate numerically
the rate for some states.
