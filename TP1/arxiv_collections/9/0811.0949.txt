We study a problem on edge percolation on product graphs $G\times K_2$. Here
$G$ is any finite graph and $K_2$ consists of two vertices $\{0,1\}$ connected
by an edge. Every edge in $G\times K_2$ is present with probability $p$
independent of other edges. The Bunkbed conjecture states that for all $G$ and
$p$ the probability that $(u,0)$ is in the same component as $(v,0)$ is greater
than or equal to the probability that $(u,0)$ is in the same component as
$(v,1)$ for every pair of vertices $u,v\in G$.
  We generalize this conjecture and formulate and prove similar statements for
randomly directed graphs. The methods lead to a proof of the original
conjecture for special classes of graphs $G$, in particular outerplanar graphs.
