We generalize the representation of the real time Green's functions
introduced by Langreth and Nordlander [Phys. Rev. B 43 2541 (1991)] and Meir
and Wingreen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68 2512 (1992)] in stationary quantum transport
in order to study problems with hybrid structures containing normal (N) and
superconducting (S) pieces. We illustrate the treatment in a S-N junction under
a stationary bias and investigate in detail the behavior of the equilibrium
currents in a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux with attached
superconducting wires at equilibrium. We analyze the flux sensitivity of the
Andreev states and we show that their response is equivalent to the one
corresponding to the Cooper pairs with momentum q=0 in an isolated
superconducting ring.
