Strange multi-baryonic clusters are an exiting possibility to explore the
properties of cold dense baryonic matter. Recent results on searches for exotic
narrow resonances with $\Lambda$ hyperon subsystems are reviewed. The
observation of $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^{*+}$(1385) and $K^{*\pm}$(892) well known
resonances from PDG are a good tests of this method. The mean value of mass for
$\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ resonance is shifted till mass of 1370 MeV/$c^2$ and width
is two times larger than same value from PDG. Such of behavior for width and
mass of $\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ resonance interpreted as extensive contribution
from stopping $\Xi^-\to\Lambda\pi^-$ and medium effect with mass of
$\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ resonance.In ($\Lambda\pi^+ \pi^-$) spectrum there are
observed enhancement signals from $\Lambda ^*(1600)$, $\Lambda ^*(1750)$ and
$\Lambda ^*(1850)$ resonances. A number of significant signals were found in
the effective mass spectra of: 1)$\Lambda \gamma$,$p \gamma$ $\Lambda
\pi^{\pm}$,$\Lambda \pi \pi$, $\Lambda p$ and $\Lambda p p$ subsystems.
