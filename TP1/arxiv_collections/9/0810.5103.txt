The response of the QCD vacuum to very large static external magnetic fields
(q B >> Lambda_QCD^2) is studied. In this regime, the magnetization of the QCD
vacuum is naturally described via perturbative QCD. Combining pQCD and the
Schwinger proper time formalism, we calculate the magnetization of the QCD
vacuum due to a strong magnetic field at leading order (one-loop) to be
proportional to B log B. We show that the leading perturbative correction
(two-loop) vanishes.
