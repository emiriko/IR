The goal of this paper is to quantitatively describe some statistical
properties of higher-dimensional determinantal point processes with a primary
focus on the nearest-neighbor distribution functions. Toward this end, we
express these functions as determinants of $N\times N$ matrices and then
extrapolate to $N\to\infty$. This formulation allows for a quick and accurate
numerical evaluation of these quantities for point processes in Euclidean
spaces of dimension $d$. We also implement an algorithm due to Hough \emph{et.
al.} \cite{hough2006dpa} for generating configurations of determinantal point
processes in arbitrary Euclidean spaces, and we utilize this algorithm in
conjunction with the aforementioned numerical results to characterize the
statistical properties of what we call the Fermi-sphere point process for $d =
1$ to 4. This homogeneous, isotropic determinantal point process, discussed
also in a companion paper \cite{ToScZa08}, is the high-dimensional
generalization of the distribution of eigenvalues on the unit circle of a
random matrix from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE). In addition to the
nearest-neighbor probability distribution, we are able to calculate Voronoi
cells and nearest-neighbor extrema statistics for the Fermi-sphere point
process and discuss these as the dimension $d$ is varied. The results in this
paper accompany and complement analytical properties of higher-dimensional
determinantal point processes developed in \cite{ToScZa08}.
