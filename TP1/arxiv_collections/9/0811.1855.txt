Global Climate Models (GCMs) provide forecasts of future climate warming
using a wide variety of highly sophisticated anthropogenic CO2 emissions models
as input, each based on the evolution of four emissions "drivers": population
p, standard of living g, energy productivity (or efficiency) f and energy
carbonization c. The range of scenarios considered is extremely broad, however,
and this is a primary source of forecast uncertainty. Here, it is shown both
theoretically and observationally how the evolution of the human system can be
considered from a surprisingly simple thermodynamic perspective in which it is
unnecessary to explicitly model two of the emissions drivers: population and
standard of living. Specifically, the human system grows through a
self-perpetuating feedback loop in which the consumption rate of primary energy
resources stays tied to the historical accumulation of global economic
production - or p times g - through a time-independent factor of 9.7 +/- 0.3
milliwatts per inflation-adjusted 1990 US dollar. This important constraint,
and the fact that f and c have historically varied rather slowly, points
towards substantially narrowed visions of future emissions scenarios for
implementation in GCMs.
