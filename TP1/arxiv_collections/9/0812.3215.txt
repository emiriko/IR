Theoretical predictions in high energy physics are routinely provided in the
form of Monte Carlo generators. Comparisons of predictions from different
programs and/or different initialization set-ups are often necessary. MC-TESTER
can be used for such tests of decays of intermediate states (particles or
resonances) in a semi-automated way.
  Since 2002 new functionalities were introduced into the package. In
particular, it now works with the HepMC event record, the standard for C++
programs. The complete set-up for benchmarking the interfaces, such as
interface between tau-lepton production and decay, including QED bremsstrahlung
effects is shown. The example is chosen to illustrate the new options
introduced into the program. From the technical perspective, our paper
documents software updates and supplements previous documentation.
  As in the past, our test consists of two steps. Distinct Monte Carlo programs
are run separately; events with decays of a chosen particle are searched, and
information is stored by MC-TESTER. Then, at the analysis step, information
from a pair of runs may be compared and represented in the form of tables and
plots.
  Updates introduced in the progam up to version 1.24.3 are also documented. In
particular, new configuration scripts or script to combine results from
multitude of runs into single information file to be used in analysis step are
explained.
