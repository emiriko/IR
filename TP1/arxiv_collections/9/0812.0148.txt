One of the great successes of quantum physics is the description of the
long-lived Rydberg states of atoms and ions. The Bohr model is equally
applicable to donor impurity atoms in semiconductor physics, where the
conduction band corresponds to the vacuum, and the loosely bound electron
orbiting a singly charged core has a hydrogen-like spectrum according to the
usual Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, shifted to the far-infrared due to the small
effective mass and high dielectric constant. Manipulation of Rydberg states in
free atoms and ions by single and multi-photon processes has been tremendously
productive since the development of pulsed visible laser spectroscopy. The
analogous manipulations have not been conducted for donor impurities in
silicon. Here we use the FELIX pulsed free electron laser to perform
time-domain measurements of the Rydberg state dynamics in phosphorus- and
arsenic-doped silicon and we have obtained lifetimes consistent with frequency
domain linewidths for isotopically purified silicon. This implies that the
dominant decoherence mechanism for excited Rydberg states is lifetime
broadening, just as for atoms in ion traps. The experiments are important
because they represent the first step towards coherent control and manipulation
of atomic-like quantum levels in the most common semiconductor and complement
magnetic resonance experiments in the literature, which show extraordinarily
long spin lattice relaxation times key to many well-known schemes for quantum
computing qubits for the same impurities. Our results, taken together with the
magnetic resonance data and progress in precise placement of single impurities,
suggest that doped silicon, the basis for modern microelectronics, is also a
model ion trap.
