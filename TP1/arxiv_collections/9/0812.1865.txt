We review the main theoretical and experimental results for the transmon, a
superconducting charge qubit derived from the Cooper pair box. The increased
ratio of the Josephson to charging energy results in an exponential suppression
of the transmon's sensitivity to 1/f charge noise. This has been observed
experimentally and yields homogeneous broadening, negligible pure dephasing,
and long coherence times of up to 3 microseconds. Anharmonicity of the energy
spectrum is required for qubit operation, and has been proven to be sufficient
in transmon devices. Transmons have been implemented in a wide array of
experiments, demonstrating consistent and reproducible results in very good
agreement with theory.
