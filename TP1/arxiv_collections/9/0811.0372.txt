In many integer factoring algorithms, one produces a sequence of integers
(created in a pseudo-random way), and wishes to rapidly determine a subsequence
whose product is a square (which we call a square product). In his lecture at
the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians, Pomerance observed that the
following problem encapsulates all of the key issues: Select integers a_1, a_2,
>... at random from the interval [1,x], until some (non-empty) subsequence has
product equal to a square. Find good estimate for the expected stopping time of
this process. A good solution to this problem should help one to determine the
optimal choice of parameters for one's factoring algorithm, and therefore this
is a central question.
  Pomerance (1994), using an idea of Schroeppel (1985), showed that with
probability 1-o(1) the first subsequence whose product equals a square occurs
after at least J_0^{1-o(1)} integers have been selected, but no more than J_0,
for an appropriate (explicitly determined) J_0=J_0(x). Herein we determine this
expected stopping time up to a constant factor, tightening Pomerance's interval
to $$[ (\pi/4)(e^{-\gamma} - o(1))J_0, (e^{-\gamma} + o(1)) J_0],$$ where
$\gamma = 0.577...$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. We will also confirm the
well established belief that, typically, none of the integers in the square
product have large prime factors. We believe the upper of the two bounds to be
asymptotically sharp.
