We report the experimental generation of squeezed light at 852 nm, locked on
the Cesium D2 line. 50% of noise reduction down to 50 kHz has been obtained
with a doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator operating below threshold,
using a periodically-polled KTP crystal. This light is directly utilizable with
Cesium atomic ensembles for quantum networking applications
