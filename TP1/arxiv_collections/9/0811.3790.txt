The initial value problem is considered in the present paper for bipolar
quantum hydrodynamic model for semiconductors (QHD) in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove
that the unique strong solution exists globally in time and tends to the
asymptotical state with an algebraic rate as $t\to+\infty$. And, we show that
the global solution of linearized bipolar QHD system decays in time at an
algebraic decay rate from both above and below. This means in general, we can
not get exponential time-decay rate for bipolar QHD system, which is different
from the case of unipolar QHD model (where global solutions tend to the
equilibrium state at an exponential time-decay rate) and is mainly caused by
the nonlinear coupling and cancelation between two carriers. Moreover, it is
also shown that the nonlinear dispersion does not affect the long time
asymptotic behavior, which by product gives rise to the algebraic time-decay
rate of the solution of the bipolar hydrodynamical model in the semiclassical
limit.
