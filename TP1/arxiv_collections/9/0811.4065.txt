Capacitive devices are customarily used as probes to measure the level of
noble liquids in detectors operated for neutrino studies and dark matter
searches. In this work we describe the use of a high-temperature
superconducting material as an alternative to control the level of a cryogenic
noble liquid. Lab measurements indicate that the superconductor shows a linear
behaviour, a high degree of stability and offers a very accurate determination
of the liquid volume. This device is therefore a competitive instrument and
shows several advantages over conventional level meters.
