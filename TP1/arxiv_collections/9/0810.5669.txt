In Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) the problem of drawing molecules
to the places where surface plasmon resonance enhancements will produce signals
is one of the most basic ones, and the initial obstacle to every application of
the effect. We explore the possibility of using electrostatic forces as a means
to "guide" charged molecules in solution toward SERS active substrates. We also
show explicitly the possibility of selectively enhancing different types of
dyes according to their charge, and we discuss briefly possible extensions for
other applications where "electrostatic guiding" could be an option.
