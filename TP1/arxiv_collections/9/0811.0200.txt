We investigate, which lightest supersymmetric particles can be obtained via a
non-vanishing lepton- or baryon-number violating operator at the grand
unification scale within the R-parity violating minimal supergravity model. We
employ the full one-loop renormalization group equations. We take into account
restrictions from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and b -> s gamma,
as well as collider constraints from LEP and the Tevatron. We also consider
simple deformations of minimal supergravity models.
