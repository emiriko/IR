I investigate the effects of the gluon self-energy in the color-flavor-locked
phase of color superconductivity on the value of the gap. The light plasmon
modes, which appear for energies smaller than twice the gap energy, provide the
largest contribution. They modify the subsubleading term in the solution of the
gap equation.
