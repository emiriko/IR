In this paper, we study the minimal number of elements of maximal order
within a zero-sumfree sequence in a finite Abelian p-group. For this purpose,
in the general context of finite Abelian groups, we introduce a new number, for
which lower and upper bounds are proved in the case of finite Abelian p-groups.
Among other consequences, the method that we use here enables us to show that,
if we denote by exp(G) the exponent of the finite Abelian p-group G which is
considered, then a zero-sumfree sequence S with maximal possible length in G
must contain at least exp(G)-1 elements of maximal order, which improves a
previous result of W. Gao and A. Geroldinger.
