We demonstrate that continuous-variable quantum error correction based on
Gaussian ancilla states and Gaussian operations (for encoding, syndrome
extraction, and recovery) can be very useful to suppress the effect of
non-Gaussian error channels. For a certain class of stochastic error models,
reminiscent of those typically considered in the qubit case, quantum error
correction codes designed for single-channel errors may enhance the transfer
fidelities even when errors occur in every channel employed for transmitting
the encoded state. In fact, in this case, the error-correcting capability of
the continuous-variable scheme turns out to be higher than that of its
discrete-variable analogues.
