It is shown that naive two stage scenario of the soft multiparticle
production in hadronic and nuclear collisions at high energy, when at first
stage the colour strings are formed and at the second stage these strings, or
some other (higher colour) strings formed due to fusion of primary strings, are
decaying, emitting observed particles, encounters some difficulties at the
attempt to analyse the space-time picture of the process. Simple analysis shows
the dominant is the process when the formation and the decay of a string occur
in parallel - a string breaks into two parts already at rather small length
(about 1-2 fm in its c.m. system), then the process repeats in the pieces and
so on. Nevertheless it is proved to be possible to agree the string fusion idea
with the space-time picture of a string decay. In the framework of the
Artru-Mennessier model of a string fragmentation the simple interpretation of
the homogeneity of the rapidity distribution for hadrons produced from the
decay of a single string at high energy is presented and the analytical
estimate for the density of this rapidity distribution is obtained.
