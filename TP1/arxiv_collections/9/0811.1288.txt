We investigate the entanglement between two separated segments in the vacuum
state of a free 1D Klein-Gordon field, where explicit computations are
performed in the continuum limit of the linear harmonic chain. We show that the
entanglement, which we measure by the logarithmic negativity, is finite with no
further need for renormalization. We find that the quantum correlations decay
much faster than the classical correlations as in the critical limit long range
entanglement decays exponentially for separations larger than the size of the
segments. As the segments become closer to each other the entanglement diverges
as a power law. The noncritical regime manifests richer behavior, as the
entanglement depends both on the size of the segments and on their separation.
In correspondence with the von Neumann entropy long-range entanglement also
distinguishes critical from noncritical systems.
