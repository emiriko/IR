Considerable progress has been made in our knowledge of the spin distribution
within the proton. The recently measured limits on polarized gluons in the
proton suggest polarized gluons contribute very modestly to the proton spin. We
will show that a modern, relativistic and chirally symmetric description of the
nucleon structure naturally explain the current proton spin data. Most of the
"missing" spin is carried by confined quark and antiquarks' angular momentum.
