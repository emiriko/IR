Thermalization of a longitudinally expanding color glass condensate with
Bjorken boost invariant geometry is investigated within parton cascade BAMPS.
Our main focus lies on the detailed comparison of thermalization, observed in
BAMPS with that suggested in the Bottom-Up scenario. We demonstrate that the
tremendous production of soft gluons via $gg \to ggg$, which is shown in the
Bottom-Up picture as the dominant process during the early preequilibration,
will not occur in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, because the
back reaction $ggg\to gg$ hinders the absolute particle multiplication.
Moreover, contrary to the Bottom-Up scenario, soft and hard gluons thermalize
at the same time. The time scale of thermal equilibration in BAMPS calculations
is of order $\as^{-2} (\ln \as)^{-2} Q_s^{-1}$. After this time the gluon
system exhibits nearly hydrodynamic behavior. The shear viscosity to entropy
density ratio has a weak dependence on $Q_s$ and lies close to the lower bound
of the AdS/CFT conjecture.
