The authors report that anisotropic confining potentials in laterally-coupled
semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have large impacts in optical transitions and
energies of inter-shell collective electronic excitations. The observed
anisotropies are revealed by inelastic light scattering as a function of the
in-plane direction of light polarization and can be finely controlled by
modifying the geometrical shape of the QDs. These experiments show that the
tuning of the QD confinement potential offers a powerful method to manipulate
electronic states and far-infrared inter-shell optical transitions in quantum
dots.
