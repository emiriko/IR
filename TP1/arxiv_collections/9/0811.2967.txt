We present a study of the local strain effects associated with vacancy
defects in strontium titanate and report the first calculations of elastic
dipole tensors and chemical strains for point defects in perovskites. The
combination of local and long-range results will enable determination of x-ray
scattering signatures that can be compared with experiments. We find that the
oxygen vacancy possesses a special property -- a highly anisotropic elastic
dipole tensor which almost vanishes upon averaging over all possible defect
orientations. Moreover, through direct comparison with experimental
measurements of chemical strain, we place constraints on the possible defects
present in oxygen-poor strontium titanate and introduce a conjecture regarding
the nature of the predominant defect in strontium-poor stoichiometries in
samples grown via pulsed laser deposition. Finally, during the review process,
we learned of recent experimental data, from strontium titanate films deposited
via molecular-beam epitaxy, that show good agreement with our calculated value
of the chemical strain associated with strontium vacancies.
