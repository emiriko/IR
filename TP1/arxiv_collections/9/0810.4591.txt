We investigate the structure of the neutron-rich $\Lambda$-hypernucleus
$_{\Lambda}^{10}$Li by using microscopic shell-model calculations considering a
$\Lambda$-$\Sigma$ coupling effect. The calculated $\Sigma$-mixing probability
in the $_{\Lambda}^{10}$Li ground state is found to be about 0.34 % which is
coherently enhanced by the $\Lambda$-$\Sigma$ coupling configurations, leading
to the energy shift 0.28 MeV which is about 3 times larger than that in
$_{\Lambda}^{7}$Li. The importance of the $\Sigma$ configuration obtained by
the $\Sigma N$ interaction and the potentiality of the neutron-rich environment
are discussed.
