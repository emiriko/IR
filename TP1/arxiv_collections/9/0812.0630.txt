A quantum effect is an operator on a complex Hilbert space $H$ that satisfies
$0\leq A\leq I$. We denote the set of all quantum effects by ${\cal E}(H)$. In
this paper we prove, Theorem 4.3, on the theory of sequential product on ${\cal
E}(H)$ which shows, in fact, that there are sequential products on ${\cal
E}(H)$ which are not of the generalized L\"{u}ders form. This result answers a
Gudder's open problem negatively.
