We present higher loop results for the gluon and ghost propagator in Landau
gauge on the lattice calculated in numerical stochastic perturbation theory. We
make predictions for the perturbative content of those propagators as function
of the lattice momenta for finite lattices. To find out their nonperturbative
contributions, the logarithmic definition of the gauge fields and the
corresponding Faddeev-Popov operator have to be implemented in the Monte Carlo
simulations.
