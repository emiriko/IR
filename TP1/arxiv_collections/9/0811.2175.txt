Efficiency of intrinsic operator techniques (using only products and ranks of
tensor operators) is first evidenced by condensed proofs of already known
$\bigtriangledown$-triangle sum rules of su(2)/su$_q$(2). {\em A new compact}
su$_q$(2)-{\em expression} is found, using a $q$-series $\Phi$, with
$\Phi(n)_{| q=1}=1$. This success comes from an ultimate identification process
over monomials like $(c_0)^p$. For osp(1$|$2), analogous principles of
calculation are transposed, involving a second parameter $d_0$. Ultimate
identification process then must be done over binomials like
${(c_{0}+{d_{0}}^{2})}^{\Omega -m} ({d_{0}}^{2})^{m}$. {\em Unknown}
polynomials ${\cal P}$ are introduced as well as their expansion coefficients,
$x$, over the binomials. It is clearly shown that a hypothetical super-triangle
sum rule requires super-triangles $\bigtriangleup^{S}$, instead of
$\bigtriangledown$ for su(2)/su$_q$(2). Coefficients $x$ are integers ({\em
conjecture 1}). Massive unknown advances are done for intermediate steps of
calculation. Among other, are proved {\em two theorems} on tensor operators,
"zero" by construction. However, the ultimate identification seems to lead to a
dead end, due to analytical apparent complexities. Up today, except for a few
of coefficients $x$, no general formula is really available.
