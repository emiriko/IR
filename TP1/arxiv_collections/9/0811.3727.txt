In this paper, we use various anstazes motivated from our earlier works on
transonic gas flows, boundary layer problems and Navier-Stokes equations to
find new explicit exact solutions with multiple parameter functions for the
equation of geopotential forecast and the equations of nonlinear
magnetohydrodynamics.
