A consistent implementation of quantum gravity is expected to change the
familiar notions of space, time and the propagation of matter in drastic ways.
This will have consequences on very small scales, but also gives rise to
correction terms in evolution equations of modes relevant for observations. In
particular, the evolution of inhomogeneities in the very early universe should
be affected. In this paper consistent evolution equations for gauge-invariant
perturbations in the presence of inverse triad corrections of loop quantum
gravity are derived. Some immediate effects are pointed out, for instance
concerning conservation of power on large scales and non-adiabaticity. It is
also emphasized that several critical corrections can only be seen to arise in
a fully consistent treatment where the gauge freedom of canonical gravity is
not fixed before implementing quantum corrections. In particular, metric modes
must be allowed to be inhomogeneous: it is not consistent to assume only matter
inhomogeneities on a quantum corrected homogeneous background geometry. In this
way, stringent consistency conditions arise for possible quantization
ambiguities which will eventually be further constrained observationally.
