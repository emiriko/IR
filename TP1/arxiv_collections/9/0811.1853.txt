The frequency of occurrence of prime numbers at unit number spacing intervals
exhibits selfsimilar fractal fluctuations concomitant with inverse power law
form for power spectrum generic to dynamical systems in nature such as fluid
flows, stock market fluctuations, population dynamics, etc. The physics of
long-range correlations exhibited by fractals is not yet identified. A recently
developed general systems theory visualises the eddy continuum underlying
fractals to result from the growth of large eddies as the integrated mean of
enclosed small scale eddies, thereby generating a hierarchy of eddy
circulations, or an inter-connected network with associated long-range
correlations. The model predictions are as follows: (i) The probability
distribution and power spectrum of fractals follow the same inverse power law
which is a function of the golden mean. The predicted inverse power law
distribution is very close to the statistical normal distribution for
fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean of the distribution.
(ii) Fractals signify quantumlike chaos since variance spectrum represents
probability density distribution, a characteristic of quantum systems such as
electron or photon. (ii) Fractal fluctuations of frequency distribution of
prime numbers signify spontaneous organisation of underlying continuum number
field into the ordered pattern of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern. The
model predictions are in agreement with the probability distributions and power
spectra for different sets of frequency of occurrence of prime numbers at unit
number interval for successive 1000 numbers. Prime numbers in the first 10
million numbers were used for the study.
