Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, predicts a
transition of the usual matter to a new phase of matter, called Quark-Gluon
Plasma (QGP), at sufficiently high temperatures. The non-perturbative technique
of defining a theory on a space-time lattice has been used to obtain this and
other predictions about the nature of QGP. Heavy ion collisions at the Large
Hadron Collider in CERN can potentially test these predictions and thereby test
our theoretical understanding of confinement. This brief review aims at
providing a glimpse of both these aspects of QGP.
