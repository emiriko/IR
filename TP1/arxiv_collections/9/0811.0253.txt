The Type Indeterminacy model is a theoretical framework that formalizes the
constructive preference perspective suggested by Kahneman and Tversky. In this
paper we explore an extention of the TI-model from simple to strategic
decision-making. A 2X2 game is investigated. We first show that in a one-shot
simultaneaous move setting the TI-model is equivalent to a standard incomplete
information model. We then let the game be preceded by a cheap-talk promise
exchange game. We show in an example that in the TI-model the promise stage can
have impact on next following behavior when the standard classical model
predicts no impact whatsoever. The TI approach differs from other behavioral
approaches in identifying the source of the effect of cheap-talk promises in
the intrinsic indeterminacy of the players' type.
