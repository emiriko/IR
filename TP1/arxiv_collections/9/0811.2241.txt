Low-cost spintronic devices functioning in zero applied magnetic field are
required for bringing the idea of spin-based electronics into the real-world
industrial applications. Here we present first microwave measurements performed
on nanomagnet devices fabricated by electrodeposition inside porous membranes.
In the paper, we discuss in details a microwave resonator consisting of three
nanomagnets, which functions in zero external magnetic field. By applying a
microwave signal at a particular frequency, the magnetization of the middle
nanomagnet experiences the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and the device
outputs a measurable direct current (spin-torque diode effect). Alternatively,
the nanodevice can be used as a microwave oscillator functioning in zero field.
In order to test the resonators at microwave frequencies, we developed a simple
measurement set-up.
