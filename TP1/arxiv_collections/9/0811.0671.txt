We report the realization of quantum degenerate mixed gases of ytterbium (Yb)
isotopes using all-optical methods. We have succeeded in cooling attractively
interacting 176Yb atoms via sympathetic cooling down to below the Bose-Einstein
transition temperature, coexisting with a stable condensate of 174Yb atoms with
a repulsive interaction. We have observed a rapid atom loss in 176Yb atoms
after cooling down below the transition temperature, which indicates the
collapse of a 176Yb condensate. The sympathetic cooling technique has been
applied to cool a 173Yb-174Yb Fermi-Bose mixture to the quantum degenerate
regime.
