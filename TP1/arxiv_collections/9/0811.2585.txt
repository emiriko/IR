We propose a method to spatially confine or corral the movements of a
micropendulum via the optical forces produced by two simultaneously excited
optical modes of a photonic molecule comprising two microspherical cavities. We
discuss how the cavity enhanced optical force generated in the photonic
molecule can create an optomechanical potential of about 10 eV deep and 30 pm
wide, which can be used to trap the pendulum at any given equilibrium position
by a simple choice of laser frequencies. This result presents opportunities for
very precise all-optical self-alignment of microsystems.
