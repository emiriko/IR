We give a general definition for the tunneling time in the Landau-Zener
model. This definition allows us to compute numerically the Landau-Zener
tunneling time at any sweeping rate without ambiguity. We have also obtained
analytical results in both the adiabatic limit and the sudden limit. Whenever
applicable, our results are compared to previous results and they are in good
agreement.
