Viscous fingers in a channel with surface tension anisotropy are numerically
studied. Scaling relations between the tip velocity v, the tip radius and the
pressure gradient are investigated for two kinds of boundary conditions of
pressure, when v is sufficiently large. The power-law relations for the
anisotropic viscous fingers are compared with two-dimensional dendritic growth.
The exponents of the power-law relations are theoretically evaluated.
