Due to the very short life time of the $\Delta$ baryons, a direct measurement
on the electromagnetic moments of these systems is almost impossible in the
experiment and can only be done indirectly. Although only for the magnetic
dipole moments of $\Delta^{++}$ and $\Delta^{+}$ systems there are some
experimental data, the theoretical, phenomenological and lattice calculations
could play crucial role. In present work, the magnetic dipole ($\mu_{\Delta}$)
, electric quadrupole ($Q_{\Delta}$) and magnetic octupole ($O_{\Delta}$)
moments of these baryons are computed within the light cone QCD sum rules. The
results are compared with the predictions of the other phenomenological
approaches, lattice QCD and existing experimental data.
