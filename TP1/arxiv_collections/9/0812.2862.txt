We consider transverse-momentum (q_T) resummation for Drell--Yan lepton pair
production in hadron collisions. At small values of q_T, the
logarithmically-enhanced QCD contributions are resummed up to next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. At intermediate and large values of q_T, resummation is
consistently combined with the fixed-order perturbative result. We present
numerical results for e^+e^- pairs from the decay of Z bosons produced at
Tevatron energies. We perform a detailed study of the scale dependence of the
results to estimate the corresponding perturbative uncertainty. We comment on
the comparison with the available Tevatron data.
