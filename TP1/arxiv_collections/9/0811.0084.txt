Symmetry and reciprocity constraints on polarization state of the field
diffracted by gratings of quasi-planar particles are considered. It is shown
that the optical activity effects observed recently in arrays of quasi-planar
plasmonic particles on a dielectric substrate are due to the reflection of the
field at the air-dielectric slab interface and are proportional to this
reflection coefficient.
