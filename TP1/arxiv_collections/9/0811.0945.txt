We present a systematic study of dynamical heterogeneity in a model for
permanent gels, upon approaching the gelation threshold. We find that the
fluctuations of the self intermediate scattering function are increasing
functions of time, reaching a plateau whose value, at large length scales,
coincides with the mean cluster size and diverges at the percolation threshold.
Another measure of dynamical heterogeneities, i.e. the fluctuations of the
self-overlap, displays instead a peak and decays to zero at long times. The
peak, however, also scales as the mean cluster size. Arguments are given for
this difference in the long time behavior. We also find that non-Gaussian
parameter reaches a plateau in the long time limit. The value of the plateau of
the non-Gaussian parameter, which is connected to the fluctuations of
diffusivity of clusters, increases with the volume fraction and remains finite
at percolation threshold.
