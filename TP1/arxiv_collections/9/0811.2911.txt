We analyse the possibility to get light long-lived charginos within the
framework of the MSSM with gravity mediated SUSY breaking. We find out that
this possibility can be realized in the so-called focus-point region of
parameter space. The mass degeneracy of higgsino-like chargino and two
higgsino-like neutralinos is the necessary condition for a long lifetime. It
requires the fine-tuning of parameters, but being a single additional
constraint in the whole parameter space it can be fulfilled in the Constrained
MSSM along the border line where radiative electroweak symmetry breaking fails.
In a narrow band close to the border line the charginos are long-lived
particles. The cross-sections of their production and co-production at the LHC
via electroweak interaction reach a few tenth of pb.
