A graphene nanoribbon with zigzag edges has a gapped magnetic ground state
with an antiferromagnetic inter-edge superexchange interaction. We present a
theory based on asymptotic properties of the Dirac-model ribbon wavefunction
which predicts $W^{-2}$ and $W^{-1}$ ribbon-width dependencies for the
superexchange interaction strength and the charge gap respectively. We find
that, unlike the case of conventional atomic scale superexchange, opposite
spin-orientations on opposite edges of the ribbon are favored by both kinetic
and interaction energies.
