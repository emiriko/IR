In a quantum revival, a localized wavepacket re-forms or "revives" into a
compact reincarnation of itself long after it has spread in an unruly fashion
over a region restricted only by the potential energy. This is a purely quantum
phenomenon, which has no classical analog. Quantum revival, and Anderson
localization, are members of a small class of subtle interference effects
resulting in a quantum distribution radically different from the classical
after long time evolution under classically nonlinear evolution. However it is
not clear that semiclassical methods, which start with the classical density
and add interference effects, are in fact capable of capturing the revival
phenomenon. Here we investigate two different one dimensional systems, the
infinite square well and Morse potential. In both cases, after a long time the
underlying classical manifolds are spread rather uniformly over phase space and
are correspondingly spread in coordinate space, yet the semiclassical
amplitudes are able to destructively interfere over most of coordinate space
and constructively interfere in a small region, correctly reproducing a quantum
revival. Further implications of this ability are discussed.
