We present a time-dependent Dalitz plot measurement of CP violation
parameters in B0 --> Ks Pi+ Pi- decays. These results are obtained from a large
data sample that contains 657 million BBbar pairs collected at the Y(4S)
resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.
For the CP violation parameters, we obtain two consistent solutions that
describe the data well. The first of these solutions may be preferred by
external information from other measurements. There is no evidence for direct
CP violation in B0 --> rho0(770) Ks, B0 --> f0(980) Ks and B0 --> K*+(892) Pi-,
while measurements of mixing-induced CP violation in B0 --> rho0(770) Ks, B0
--> f0(980) Ks decays are consistent with that of b --> c cbar s decays. We
also measured the phase difference between B0 --> K*+(892) Pi- and B0B -->
K*-(892) Pi+ which may be used to extract phi3.
