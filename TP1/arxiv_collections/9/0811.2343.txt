The total yields of the all well-established light mesonic resonances (up to
the $\phi$(1020) meson) are estimated in neutrinonuclear interactions at < E_nu
> = 10 GeV, using the data obtained with SKAT bubble chamber. For some
resonances, the yields in the forward and backward hemispheres in the hadronic
c.m.s. are also extracted. From the comparison of the obtained and available
higher-energy data, an indication is obtained that the resonance yields rise
almost linearly as a function of the mean mass < W > of the neutrinoproduced
hadronic system. The fractions of pions originating from the light resonance
decays are inferred.
