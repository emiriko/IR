We use the Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi model of the low $x$ gluon distributions to
fit recent HERA data on charm and longitudinal structure functions. Having
checked that this model gives a good description of the data, we use it to
predict $F^c_2$ and $F_L$ to be measured in a future electron-ion collider. The
results interpolate between those obtained with the de Florian-Sassot and
Eskola-Paukkunen-Salgado nuclear gluon distributions. The conclusion of this
exercise is that the KLN model, simple as it is, may still be used as an
auxiliary tool to make estimates both for heavy ion and electron-ion
collisions.
