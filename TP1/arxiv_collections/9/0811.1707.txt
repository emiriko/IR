An iterative proceedure is proposed to compute the classical gauge field
produced in the collision of two heavy nuclei at high energy. The leading order
is obtained by linearizing the Yang-Mills equations in the light-cone gauge,
and provides a simple formula for gluon production in nucleus-nucleus
collisions. At this order $k_t-$factorization breaks down.
