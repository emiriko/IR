We explore the physics of the general CP-conserving MSSM with Minimal Flavor
Violation, the pMSSM. The 19 soft SUSY breaking parameters are chosen so to
satisfy all existing experimental and theoretical constraints assuming that the
WIMP is the lightest neutralino. We scan this parameter space twice using both
flat and log priors and compare the results which yield similar conclusions.
Constraints from both LEP and the Tevatron play an important role in obtaining
our final model samples. Implications for future TeV-scale $e^+e^-$ linear
colliders(LC) are discussed.
