The calculation of the cosmological relic density of the dark matter
candidate within supersymmetric models is an interesting possibility to obtain
additional constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space with respect to
collider, electroweak precision, and low-energy data. Considering future
cosmological precision measurements, radiative corrections can play an
important role in the analysis. We present full QCD and SUSY-QCD corrections to
neutralino pair annihilation into quark-antiquark pairs and analyze their
impact on the neutralino annihilation cross section and the relic density. By
comparing to the relic density obtained from a pure leading order calculation,
we show that the corrections strongly influence the extraction of SUSY mass
parameters from cosmological data.
