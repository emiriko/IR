(A) Bell's theorem rests on a conjunction of three assumptions: realism,
locality and ``free will''. A discussion of these assumptions will be
presented.
  It will be also shown that, if one adds to the assumptions the principle or
rotational symmetry of physical laws, a stronger version of the theorem
emerges. (B) A link between Bell's theorem and communication complexity
problems will be presented. This also includes experimental realizations, which
surprisingly do not involve entanglement. (C) A new sufficient and necessary
criterion for entanglement of general (mixed) states is be presented. It is
derived using the same geometric starting point as the inclusion of the
symmetry in (A). The set of entanglement identifiers (EI's) emerging via this
method contains entanglement witnesses (EW's), but they form only a subset of
all EI's. Thus the method is more powerful than the one based on EW's.
