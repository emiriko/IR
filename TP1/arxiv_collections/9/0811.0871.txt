Models with composite singlet neutrinos can give small Majorana or Dirac
masses to the active neutrinos. The mechanism is based on the fact that
conserved chiral symmetries give massless neutrinos at the renormalizable
level. Thus, they acquire very small masses due to non-renormalizable terms. We
investigate such models in two aspects. First, we find UV completions for them
and then we investigate the possibility of giving leptogenesis. We find that
these models offer new possibilities for leptogenesis. Models with Majorana
masses can exhibit standard leptogenesis. Models with Dirac masses can provide
a realization of Dirac type leptogenesis with mass scale that can be as low as
10 TeV.
