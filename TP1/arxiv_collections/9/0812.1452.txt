The adsorption and dissociation of O$_{2}$ molecules at the Be(0001) surface
is studied by using density-functional theory within the generalized gradient
approximation and a supercell approach. The physi- and chemisorbed molecular
precursor states are identified to be along the parallel and vertical channels,
respectively. It is shown that the HH-Z (see the text for definition) channel
is the most stable channel for the molecular chemisorption of O$_{2}$. The
electronic and magnetic properties of this most stable chemisorbed molecular
state are studied, which shows that the electrons transfer forth and back
between the spin-resolved antibonding $\pi^{\ast}$ molecular orbitals and the
surface Be $sp$ states. A distinct covalent weight in the molecule-metal bond
is also shown. The dissociation of O$_{2}$ is determined by calculating the
adiabatic potential energy surfaces, wherein the T-Y channel is found to be the
most stable and favorable for the dissociative adsorption of O$_{2}$.
Remarkably, we predict that unlike the other simple $sp$ metal surfaces such as
Al(111) and Mg(0001), the \textit{adiabatic} dissociation process of O$_{2}$ at
Be(0001) is an activated type with a sizeable energy barrier.
