We develop an analytical theory to explain the experimentally-observed
morphological transitions of giant vesicles induced by AC electric fields (1).
The model treats the inner and suspending media as lossy dielectrics, while the
membrane as an ion-impermeable flexible incompressible-fluid sheet. The vesicle
shape is obtained by balancing electric, hydrodynamic, and bending stresses
exerted on the membrane. Considering a nearly spherical vesicle, the solution
to the electrohydrodynamic problem is obtained as a regular perturbation
expansion in the excess area.
  The theory predicts that stationary vesicle deformation depends on field
frequency and conductivity conditions. If the inner fluid is more conducting
than the suspending medium, the vesicle always adopts a prolate shape. In the
opposite case, the vesicle undergoes a transition from a prolate to oblate
ellipsoid at a critical frequency, which the theory identifies with the inverse
membrane charging time. At frequencies higher than the inverse Maxwell-Wagner
polarization time, the electrohydrodynamic stresses become too small to alter
the vesicle's quasi-spherical rest shape. The analysis shows that the evolution
towards the stationary vesicle deformation strongly depends on membrane
properties such as viscosity. The model can be applied to rationalize the
transient and steady deformation of biological cells in electric fields.
