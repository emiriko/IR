We study theoretically the nonstationary circuit QED system in which the
artificial atom transition frequency, or the atom-cavity coupling, have a small
periodic time modulation, prescribed externally. The system formed by the atom
coupled to a single cavity mode is described by the Rabi Hamiltonian. We show
that, in the dispersive regime, when the modulation periodicity is tuned to the
`resonances', the system dynamics presents the dynamical Casimir effect,
resonant Jaynes-Cummings or resonant Anti-Jaynes-Cummings behaviors, and it can
be described by the corresponding effective Hamiltonians. In the resonant
atom-cavity regime and under the resonant modulation, the dynamics is similar
to the one occurring for a stationary two-level atom in a vibrating cavity, and
an entangled state with two photons can be created from vacuum. Moreover, we
consider the situation in which the atom-cavity coupling, the atomic frequency,
or both have a small nonperiodic time modulation, and show that photons can be
created from vacuum in the dispersive regime. Therefore, an analog of the
dynamical Casimir effect can be simulated in circuit QED, and several photons,
as well as entangled states, can be generated from vacuum due to the
anti-rotating term in the Rabi Hamiltonian.
