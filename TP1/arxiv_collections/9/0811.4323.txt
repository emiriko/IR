The angle-dependent interlayer magnetoresistance of the layered organic metal
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$KHg(SCN)$_4$ is found to undergo a dramatic change from
the classical conventional behavior at low magnetic fields to an anomalous one
at high fields. This field-induced crossover and its dependence on the sample
purity and temperature imply the existence of two parallel channels in the
interlayer transport: a classical Boltzmann conductivity $\sigma_{c}$ and an
incoherent channel $\sigma_{i}$. We propose a simple model for $\sigma_{i}$
explaining its metallic temperature dependence and low sensitivity to the
inplane field component.
