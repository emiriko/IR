An unconstrained, non-linearly elastic, semi-infinite solid is maintained in
a state of large static plane strain. A power-law relation between the
pre-stretches is assumed and it is shown that this assumption is well-motivated
physically and is likely to describe the state of pre-stretch for a wide class
of materials. A general class of strain-energy functions consistent with this
assumption is derived. For this class of materials, the secular equation for
incremental surface waves and the bifurcation condition for surface instability
are shown to reduce to an equation involving only ordinary derivatives of the
strain-energy equation. A compressible neo-Hookean material is considered as an
example and it is found that finite compressibility has little quantitative
effect on the speed of a surface wave and on the critical ratio of compression
for surface instability.
