A symmetric four-level closed-loop $\diamondsuit$ type (the diamond
structure) atomic system driven by four coherent optical fields is
investigated. The system shows rich quantum interference and coherence
features. When symmetry of the system is broken, interesting phenomena such as
single and double dark resonances appear. As a result, the double
electromagnetically induced transparency effect is generated, which will
facilitate the implementation of quantum phase gate operation.
