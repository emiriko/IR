In 1980's, Thurston established a combinatorial characterization for
post-critically finite rational maps. This criterion was then extended by Cui,
Jiang, and Sullivan to sub-hyperbolic rational maps. The goal of this paper is
to present a new but simpler proof of this result by adapting the argument in
the proof of Thurston's Theorem.
