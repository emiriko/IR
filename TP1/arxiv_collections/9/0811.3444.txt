We prove a no-go theorem for a class of hidden variables theories that
satisfy parameter independence. Specifically, we show that, assuming two
conditions, there are no non-trivial hidden variables models of the quantum
predictions for product measurements on two systems in any maximally entangled
state in a Hilbert space of dimension at least 3x3. The two conditions are
parameter independence and a condition that we call conditional parameter
independence. The result is analogous to the recent no-go theorems based on
Leggett's inequalities and their generalisations.
