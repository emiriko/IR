In the framework of the Bogolyubov approximation and using the Bogolyubov
inequalities we give a simple proof of the coexistence of two non-conventional
Bose-Einstein condensates in the case of some superstable Bose system whose
atoms have an internal two-level structure and their energy operators in the
second quantized form depend on the number operators only.
