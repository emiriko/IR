Computerized touchscreen "Direct Recording Electronic" DRE voting systems
have been used by over 1/3 of American voters in recent elections. In many
places, insufficient DRE numbers in combination with lengthy ballots and high
voter traffic have caused long lines and disenfranchised voters who left
without voting. We have applied computer queuing simulation to the voting
process and conclude that far more DREs, at great expense, would be needed to
keep waiting times low. Alternatively, paper ballot-optical scan systems can be
easily and economically scaled to prevent long lines and meet unexpected
contingencies.
