In this paper we examine sorting on the assumption that we do not know in
advance which way to sort a sequence of numbers and we set at work simple local
comparison and swap operators whose repeating application ends up in sorted
sequences. These are the basic elements of Emerge-Sort, our approach to
self-organizing sorting, which we then validate experimentally across a range
of samples. Observing an O(n2) run-time behaviour, we note that the n/logn
delay coefficient that differentiates Emerge-Sort from the classical comparison
based algorithms is an instantiation of the price of anarchy we pay for not
imposing a sorting order and for letting that order emerge through the local
interactions.
