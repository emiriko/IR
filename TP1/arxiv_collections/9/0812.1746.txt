At the A to C transition, smectic elastomers have recently been observed to
undergo $\sim$35% spontaneous shear strains. We first explicitly describe how
strains of up to twice this value could be mechanically or electrically induced
in Sm-$C$ elastomers by rotation of the director on a cone around the layer
normal at various elastic costs depending on constraints. Secondly, for typical
sample geometries, we give the various microstructures in Sm-$C$ akin to those
seen in nematic elastomers under distortions with constraints. It is possible
to give explicit results for the nature of the textures. Chiral Sm-$C$
elastomers are ferro-electric. We calculate how the polarization could be
mechanically reversed by large, hard or soft strains of the rubber, depending
upon sample geometry.
