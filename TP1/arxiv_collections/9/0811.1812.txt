Based on QCD conformal partial wave expansion to leading order conformal spin
accuracy, we present the light-cone distribution amplitudes (DAs) of $\Sigma$
and $\Lambda$ baryons up to twist 6. It is concluded that fourteen ndependent
DAs are needed to describe the valence three-quark states of the baryons at
small transverse separations. The nonperturbative parameters relevant to the
DAs are determined within the framework of QCD sum rule method. With the
obtained DAs, a simple investigation on the electromagnetic form factors of
these baryons are given. The magnetic moments of the baryons are estimated by
fitting the magnetic form factor with the dipole formula.
