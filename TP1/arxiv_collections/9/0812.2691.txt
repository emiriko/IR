Results from exact diagonalization show that the spin-polarized Coulomb
ground state at nu=5/2 is adiabatically connected with the Moore-Read wave
function for systems with up to Nel = 16 electrons on the surface of a sphere.
Varying the Haldane pseudopotentials v1 and v3, keeping all others at their
value for Coulomb interaction, energy gap and (v1,v3)-dependent ground state
overlap with the Moore-Read state form two ridges whose peak positions and
extent in the (v1,v3)-plane essentially coincide. Thus, the physics of the
Coulomb ground state at nu=5/2 is indeed captured by the Moore-Read state and
that non-Abelian statistics can be expected under experimental conditions. Such
adiabatic connection is not observed at nu=1/2, unless the width of the
interface wave function and/or Landau level mixing effects are sufficiently
large. Varying the width, an excitation gap is found for all system sizes Nel
\le 18 studied. However, its system size dependence casts doubt on the
existence of a Moore-Read-phase at nu=1/2 in the thermodynamic limit.
