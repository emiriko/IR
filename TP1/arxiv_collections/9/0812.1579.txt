Integrable PDEs on the line can be analyzed by the so-called Inverse
Scattering Transform (IST) method. A particularly powerful aspect of the IST is
its ability to predict the large $t$ behavior of the solution. Namely, starting
with initial data $u(x,0)$, IST implies that the solution $u(x,t)$ asymptotes
to a collection of solitons as $t \to \infty$, $x/t = O(1)$; moreover the
shapes and speeds of these solitons can be computed from $u(x,0)$ using only
{\it linear} operations. One of the most important developments in this area
has been the generalization of the IST from initial to initial-boundary value
(IBV) problems formulated on the half-line. It can be shown that again $u(x,t)$
asymptotes into a collection of solitons, where now the shapes and the speeds
of these solitons depend both on $u(x,0)$ and on the given boundary conditions
at $x = 0$. A major complication of IBV problems is that the computation of the
shapes and speeds of the solitons involves the solution of a {\it nonlinear}
Volterra integral equation. However, for a certain class of boundary
conditions, called linearizable, this complication can be bypassed and the
relevant computation is as effective as in the case of the problem on the line.
Here, after reviewing the general theory for KdV, we analyze three different
types of linearizable boundary conditions. For these cases, the initial
conditions are: (a) restrictions of one and two soliton solutions at $t = 0$;
(b) profiles of certain exponential type; (c) box-shaped profiles. For each of
these cases, by computing explicitly the shapes and the speeds of the
asymptotic solitons, we elucidate the influence of the boundary.
