We show that when bulk graphene breaks into n-type and p-type puddles, the
in-plane resistivity becomes strongly field dependent in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field, even if homoge- neous graphene has a
field-independent resistivity. We calculate the longitudinal resistivity
\rho_{xx} and Hall resistivity \rho_{xy} as a function of field for this
system, using the effective-medium approximation. The conductivity tensors of
the individual puddles are calculated using a Boltzmann approach suit- able for
the band structure of graphene near the Dirac points. The resulting resistivity
agrees well with experiment, provided that the relaxation time is weakly
field-dependent. The calculated Hall resistivity has the sign of the majority
carrier and vanishes when there are equal number of n and p type puddles.
