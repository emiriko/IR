We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional S=1
Heisenberg antiferromagnet with single-ion anisotropy. By employing high-order
series expansions and quantum Monte Carlo simulations we obtain accurate
estimates for the critical points separating different phases in the quantum
phase diagram. Additionally, excitation spectra and gaps are obtained.
