Tetragonal FeSe is a superconductor with a transition temperature Tc of 8 K
and shows a huge enhancement of Tc with applying pressure. Tetragonal FeTe has
a structure very analogous to superconducting FeSe, but does not show
superconducting transition. We investigated the pressure effect of resistivity
on FeTe. The resistivity at room temperature decreased with increasing
pressure. An anomaly in resistivity around 80 K shifted towards a lower
temperature with increasing pressure.
