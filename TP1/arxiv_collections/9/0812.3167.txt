New data on the decays of the charmed particles $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s$ to
$PV$ final states consisting of a light pseudoscalar meson $P$ and a light
vector meson $V$ are analyzed. Following the same methods as in a previous
analysis of $D \to PP$ decays, one can test flavor symmetry, extract key key
amplitudes, and obtain information on relative strong phases. Analyses are
performed for Cabibbo-favored decays and then extended to predict properties of
singly- and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed processes.
