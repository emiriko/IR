We study the interplay between discrete quantum symmetries at certain points
in the moduli space of Calabi-Yau compactifications, and the associated
identities that the geometric realization of D-brane monodromies must satisfy.
We show that in a wide class of examples, both local and compact, the monodromy
identities in question always follow from a single mathematical statement. One
of the simplest examples is the Z_5 symmetry at the Gepner point of the
quintic, and the associated D-brane monodromy identity.
