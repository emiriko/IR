We extend the active walker model to address the formation of paths on
gradients, which have been observed to have a zigzag form. Our extension
includes a new rule which prohibits direct descent or ascent on steep inclines,
simulating aversion to falling. Further augmentation of the model stops walkers
from changing direction very rapidly as that would likely lead to a fall. The
extended model predicts paths with qualitatively similar forms to the observed
trails, but only if the terms suppressing sudden direction changes are
included. The need to include terms into the model that stop rapid direction
change when simulating mountain trails indicates that a similar rule should
also be included in the standard active walker model.
