We compute the polarization of the final-state baryon, in its rest frame, in
low-energy meson--baryon scattering with unpolarized initial state, in
Unitarized BChPT. Free parameters are determined by fitting total and
differential cross-section data (and spin-asymmetry or polarization data if
available) for $pK^-$, $pK^+$ and $p\pi^+$ scattering. We also compare our
results with those of leading-order BChPT.
