The chiral phase transition at finite temperature is investigated in the
linear sigma model, which is regarded as a low energy effective theory of QCD
with three momentum cutoff, in the variational method with the Gaussian
approximation in the functional Schroedinger picture. It is shown that the
Goldstone theorem is retained and the meson pair excitations are automatically
included by taking into account the linear response to the external fields. It
is pointed out that the behavior of chiral phase transition depends on the
three-momentum cutoff, which leads to the careful treatment of the problem.
