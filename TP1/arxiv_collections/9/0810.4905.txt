We have performed systematic tight-binding (TB) analyses of the
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra of transition-metal
(TM) oxides A$M$O$_3$ ($M=$ Ti, V, Mn, and Fe) with the perovskite-type
structure and compared the obtained parameters with those obtained from
configuration-interaction (CI) cluster-model analyses of photoemission spectra.
The values of $\epsilon_d-\epsilon_p$ from ARPES are found to be similar to the
charge-transfer energy $\Delta$ from O $2p$ orbitals to empty TM 3d orbitals
and much larger than $\Delta-U/2$ ($U$: on-site Coulomb energy) expected for
Mott-Hubbard-type compounds including SrVO$_3$. $\epsilon_d-\epsilon_p$ values
from {\it ab initio} band-structure calculations show similar behaviors to
those from ARPES. The values of the $p-d$ transfer integrals to describe the
global electronic structure are found to be similar in all the estimates,
whereas additional narrowing beyond the TB description occurs in the ARPES
spectra of the $d$ band.
