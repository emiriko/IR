We report experimental measurements of high-order harmonic spectra generated
in Ar using a carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) stabilized 12 fs, 800nm laser field
and a fraction (less than 10%) of its second harmonic. Additional spectral
peaks are observed between the harmonic peaks, which are due to interferences
between multiple pulses in the train. The position of these peaks varies with
the CEO and their number is directly related to the number of pulses in the
train. An analytical model, as well as numerical simulations, support our
interpretation.
