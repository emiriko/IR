We carried out simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity and
thermal expansion of the heavy-fermion compound URu2Si2 under pressure using a
single crystal. We observed a phase transition anomaly between hidden (HO) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered states at TM in the temperature dependence of
both measurements. For the electrical resistivity, the anomaly at TM was very
small compared with the distinct hump anomaly at the phase transition
temperature T0 between the paramagnetic state (PM) and HO, and exhibited only a
slight increase and decrease for the I // a-axis and c-axis, respectively. We
estimated each excitation gap of HO, Delta_HO, and AFM, Delta_AFM, from the
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity; Delta_HO and Delta_AFM have
different pressure dependences from each other. On the other hand, the
temperature dependence of thermal expansion exhibited a small anomaly at T0 and
a large anomaly at TM. The pressure dependence of the phase boundaries of T0
and TM indicates that there is no critical end point and the two phase
boundaries meet at the critical point.
