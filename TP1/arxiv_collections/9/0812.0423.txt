We consider minimization of functions that are compositions of convex or
prox-regular functions (possibly extended-valued) with smooth vector functions.
A wide variety of important optimization problems fall into this framework. We
describe an algorithmic framework based on a subproblem constructed from a
linearized approximation to the objective and a regularization term. Properties
of local solutions of this subproblem underlie both a global convergence result
and an identification property of the active manifold containing the solution
of the original problem. Preliminary computational results on both convex and
nonconvex examples are promising.
