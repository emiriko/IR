The domain wall nucleation and motion processes in Permalloy nanowires with a
thickness gradient along the nanowire axis have been studied. Nanowires with
widths, w = 250 nm to 3 um and a base thickness of t = 10 nm were fabricated by
electron-beam lithography. The magnetization hysteresis loops measured on
individual nanowires are compared to corresponding nanowires without a
thickness gradient. The Hc vs. t/w curves of wires with and without a thickness
gradient are discussed and compared to micromagnetic simulations. We find a
metastability regime at values of w, where a transformation from transverse to
vortex domain wall type is expected.
