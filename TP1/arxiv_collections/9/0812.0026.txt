We present here temperature-dependent Raman, x-ray diffraction and specific
heat studies between room temperature and 12 K on single crystals of spin-ice
pyrochlore compound $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$ and its non-magnetic analogue $Lu_2Ti_2O_7$.
Raman data show a "new" band not predicted by factor group analysis of
Raman-active modes for the pyrochlore structure in $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$, appearing
below a temperature of $T_c=$110 K with a concomitant contraction of the cubic
unit cell volume as determined from the powder x-ray diffraction analysis. Low
temperature Raman experiments on O$^{18}$-isotope substituted $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$
confirm the phonon origin of the "new" mode. These findings, absent in
$Lu_2Ti_2O_7$, suggest that the room temperature cubic lattice of the
pyrochlore $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$ undergoes a "subtle" structural transformation near
$T_c$. We find anomalous \textit{red-shift} of some of the phonon modes in both
the $Dy_2Ti_2O_7$ and the $Lu_2Ti_2O_7$ as the temperature decreases, which is
attributed to strong phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions.
