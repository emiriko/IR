In this talk some classical and quantum aspects concerning a special kind of
integrable defect - called a jump-defect - will be reviewed. In particular,
recent results obtained in an attempt to incorporate this defect in the affine
Toda field theories, in addition to the sine-Gordon model, will be presented.
