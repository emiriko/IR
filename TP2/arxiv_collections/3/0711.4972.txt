Starting from the complete Mellin representation of Feynman amplitudes for
noncommutative vulcanized scalar quantum field theory, introduced in a previous
publication, we generalize to this theory the study of asymptotic behaviours
under scaling of arbitrary subsets of external invariants of any Feynman
amplitude. This is accomplished for both convergent and renormalized
amplitudes.
