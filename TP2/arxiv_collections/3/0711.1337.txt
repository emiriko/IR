Quantum vacuum experiments are becoming a flexible tool for investigating
fundamental physics. They are particularly powerful for searching for new light
but weakly interacting degrees of freedom and are thus complementary to
accelerator-driven experiments. I review recent developments in this field,
focusing on optical experiments in strong electromagnetic fields. In order to
characterize potential optical signatures, I discuss various low-energy
effective actions which parameterize the interaction of particle-physics
candidates with optical photons and external electromagnetic fields.
Experiments with an electromagnetized quantum vacuum and optical probes do not
only have the potential to collect evidence for new physics, but
special-purpose setups can also distinguish between different particle-physics
scenarios and extract information about underlying microscopic properties.
