We study the effect of separate chemical and kinetic freeze-outs to the ideal
hydrodynamical flow in Au+Au collisions at RHIC (sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV energy).
Unlike in earlier studies we explore how these effects can be counteracted by
changes in the initial state of the hydrodynamical evolution. We conclude that
the reproduction of pion, proton and antiproton yields necessitates a chemical
freeze-out temperature of T = 150 MeV instead of T = 160 - 170 MeV motivated by
thermal models. Unlike previously reported, this lower temperature makes it
possible to reproduce the p_T-spectra of hadrons if one assumes very small
initial time, tau_0 = 0.2 fm/c. However, the p_T-differential elliptic flow,
v_2(p_T) remains badly reproduced. This points to the need to include
dissipative effects (viscosity) or some other refinement to the model.
