We show that the coherence of an electron spin interacting with a bath of
nuclear spins can exhibit a well-defined purely exponential decay for special
(`narrowed') bath initial conditions in the presence of a strong applied
magnetic field. This is in contrast to the typical case, where spin-bath
dynamics have been investigated in the non-Markovian limit, giving
super-exponential or power-law decay of correlation functions. We calculate the
relevant decoherence time T_2 explicitly for free-induction decay and find a
simple expression with dependence on bath polarization, magnetic field, the
shape of the electron wave function, dimensionality, total nuclear spin I, and
isotopic concentration for experimentally relevant heteronuclear spin systems.
