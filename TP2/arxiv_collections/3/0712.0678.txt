A variational principle is introduced which minimizes an action formulated
for configurations of vacuum Dirac seas. The action is analyzed in position and
momentum space. We relate the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations to the
notion of state stability. Examples of numerical minimizers are constructed and
discussed.
