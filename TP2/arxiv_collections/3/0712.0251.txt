By using a dual vortex method, we study phases such as superfluid, solids,
supersolids and quantum phase transitions in a unified scheme in extended boson
Hubbard models at and slightly away from half filling on bipartite optical
lattices such as honeycomb and square lattice. We also map out its global phase
diagram at $ T=0 $ of chemical potential versus the ratio of kinetic energy
over the interaction. We stress the importance of the self-consistence
condition on the saddle point structure of the dual gauge fields in the
translational symmetry breaking insulating sides, especially in the charge
density wave side. We find that in the translational symmetry breaking side,
different kinds of supersolids are generic possible states slightly away from
half filling. We propose a new kind of supersolid: valence bond supersolid
(VB-SS). In this VB-SS, the density fluctuation at any site is very large
indicating its superfluid nature, but the boson kinetic energies on bonds
between two sites are given and break the lattice translational symmetries
indicating its valence bound nature. Implications on possible future QMC
simulations in both bipartite lattices are given. All these phases and phase
transitions can be potentially realized in ultra-cold atoms loaded on optical
bipartite lattices.
