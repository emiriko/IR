Experimental results on beauty production at HERA are reviewed in the context
of similar measurements at other colliders. As a result of a phenomenological
study of the QCD scale dependence of many different NLO and NNLO predictions, a
modification of the ``default'' scale choice is advocated. Experimental
constraints on the photon-quark coupling are also investigated.
