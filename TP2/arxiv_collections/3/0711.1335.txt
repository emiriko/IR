Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on the adsorption of $^4$He in open-ended
single walled (10,10) nanotubes are presented. We have found a first order
phase transition separating a low density liquid phase in which all $^4$He
atoms are adsorbed close to the tube wall and a high density arrangement
characterized by two helium concentric layers. The energy correction due to the
presence of neighboring tubes in a bundle has also been calculated, finding it
negligible in the density range considered.
