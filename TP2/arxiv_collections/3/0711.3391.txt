By relating the ground state of Temperley-Lieb hamiltonians to partition
functions of 2D statistical mechanics systems on a half plane, and using a
boundary Coulomb gas formalism, we obtain in closed form the valence bond
entanglement entropy as well as the valence bond probability distribution in
these ground states. We find in particular that for the XXX spin chain, the
number N_c of valence bonds connecting a subsystem of size L to the outside
goes, in the thermodynamic limit, as <N_c> = (4/pi^2) ln L, disproving a recent
conjecture that this should be related with the von Neumann entropy, and thus
equal to 1/(3 ln 2) ln L. Our results generalize to the Q-state Potts model.
