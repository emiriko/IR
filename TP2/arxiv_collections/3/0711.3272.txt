The virtual effects of unparticle physics on the two-gluon jets production
are explored for CERN LHC. It is found that depending on the scale dimension,
unparticles can give rise to substantial enhancements in the transverse
momentum and pseudo-rapidity distributions of hadronic cross sections, up to a
factor of four-orders of magnitude.
