Two notions of nonclassicality that have been investigated intensively are:
(i) negativity, that is, the need to posit negative values when representing
quantum states by quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner
representation, and (ii) contextuality, that is, the impossibility of a
noncontextual hidden variable model of quantum theory (also known as the
Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem). Although both of these notions were meant to
characterize the conditions under which a classical explanation cannot be
provided, we demonstrate that they prove inadequate to the task and we argue
for a particular way of generalizing and revising them. With the refined
version of each in hand, it becomes apparent that they are in fact one and the
same. We also demonstrate the impossibility of noncontextuality or
nonnegativity in quantum theory with a novel proof that is symmetric in its
treatment of measurements and preparations.
