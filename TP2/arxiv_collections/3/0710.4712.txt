In this paper, we present an accurate but very fast soft error rate (SER)
estimation technique for digital circuits based on error propagation
probability (EPP) computation. Experiments results and comparison of the
results with the random simulation technique show that our proposed method is
on average within 6% of the random simulation method and four to five orders of
magnitude faster.
