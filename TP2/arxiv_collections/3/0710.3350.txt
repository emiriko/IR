We present total cross sections for single and double ionization of helium by
antiproton impact over a wide range of impact energies from 10 keV/amu to 1
MeV/amu. A non-perturbative time-dependent close-coupling method (TDCC) is
applied to fully treat the correlated dynamics of the ionized electrons.
Excellent agreement is obtained between our calculations and experimental
measurements of total single and double ionization cross sections at high
impact energies, whereas for lower impact energies, some discrepancies with
experiment are found. At an impact energy of 1 MeV we also find that the
double-to-single ionization ratio is twice as large for antiproton impact as
for proton impact, confirming a long-standing unexpected experimental
measurement.
