We study the Josephson effect between a conventional s-wave superconductor
and a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
Rashba spin-orbit coupling affects the Josephson pair tunneling in a
characteristic way. The Josephson coupling can be decomposed into two parts, a
`spin-singlet-like' and a `spin-triplet-like' component. The latter component
can lead to shift of the Josephson phase by \pi relative to the former
coupling. This has important implications on interference effects and may
explain some recent experimental results for the Al/CePt3Si junction.
