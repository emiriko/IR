In a previous publication, procedures were proposed for unambiguously
extracting amplitudes for single and double ionization from a time-dependent
wavepacket by effectively propagating for an infinite time following a
radiation pulse. Here we demonstrate the accuracy and utility of those methods
for describing two-photon single and one-photon double ionization of helium. In
particular it is shown how narrow features corresponding to autoionizing states
are easily resolved with these methods.
