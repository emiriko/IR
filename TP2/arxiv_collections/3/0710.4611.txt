Similar to the Berry conjecture of quantum chaos we consider elastic analogue
which incorporates longitudinal and transverse elastic displacements with
corresponding wave vectors. Based on that we derive the correlation functions
for amplitudes and intensities of elastic displacements. Comparison to numerics
in a quarter Bunimovich stadium demonstrates excellent agreement.
