We justify WKB analysis for Hartree equation in space dimension at least
three, in a regime which is supercritical as far as semiclassical analysis is
concerned. The main technical remark is that the nonlinear Hartree term can be
considered as a semilinear perturbation. This is in contrast with the case of
the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a local nonlinearity, where quasilinear
analysis is needed to treat the nonlinearity.
