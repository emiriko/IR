Average-resonance data on the (p,gamma) reaction on 56,58Fe that were taken
at proton energies of Ep=1.5-3.0 MeV are used to determine the absolute values
of the radiative strength functions for energies below 10 MeV. The results
obtained in this way are compared with the results of the calculations that
rely on the statistical approach and which take into account the temperature of
the nucleus and its shell structure. Good agreement with experimental data is
achieved without any variation of parameters.
