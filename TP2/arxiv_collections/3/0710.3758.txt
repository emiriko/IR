Two species of particles in a binary granular system typically do not have
the same mean kinetic energy, in contrast to the equipartition of energy
required in equilibrium. We investigate the role of the heating mechanism in
determining the extent of this non-equipartition of kinetic energy. In most
experiments, different species of particle are unequally heated at the
boundaries. We show by event-driven simulations that this differential heating
at the boundary influences the level of non-equipartition even in the bulk of
the system. This conclusion is fortified by studying a numerical model and a
solvable stochastic model without spatial degrees of freedom. In both cases,
even in the limit where heating events are rare compared to collisions, the
effect of the heating mechanism persists.
