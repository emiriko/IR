Algorithmic Cooling (AC) of Spins is potentially the first near-future
application of quantum computing devices. Straightforward quantum algorithms
combined with novel entropy manipulations can result in a method to improve the
identification of molecules. We introduce here several new exhaustive cooling
algorithms, such as the Tribonacci and k-bonacci algorithms. In particular, we
present the ``all-bonacci'' algorithm, which appears to reach the maximal
degree of cooling obtainable by the optimal AC approach.
