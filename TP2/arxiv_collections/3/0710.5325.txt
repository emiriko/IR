Due to the orthorhombic distortion of the lattice, the electronic hopping
integrals along the $a$ and $b$ diagonals, the orthorhombic directions, are
slightly different. We calculate their difference in the LDA and find
$t_{a}^{\prime}-t_{b}^{\prime}\approx 8 $meV. We argue that electron
correlations in the insulating phase of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, i. e. at
doping $x\leq 0.055,$ dramatically enhance the $(t_{a}^{\prime}-t_{b}^{\prime})
$-splitting between the $a$- and $b$-hole valleys. In particular, we predict
that the intensity of both angle-resolved photoemission and of optical
absorption is very different for the $a$ and $b$ nodal points.
