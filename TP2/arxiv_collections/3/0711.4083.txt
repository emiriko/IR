We discuss the quantum transport of electrons through a resonant tunnel
junction coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator at zero temperature. By using
the Green's function technique we calculate the transport properties of
electrons through a single dot strongly coupled to a single oscillator. We
consider a finite chemical potential difference between the right and left
leads. In addition to the main resonant peak of electrons on the dot, we find
satellite peaks due to the creation of phonons. These satellite peaks become
sharper and more significant with increasing coupling strength between the
electrons and the oscillator. We also consider the energy transferred from the
electrons to the oscillator.
