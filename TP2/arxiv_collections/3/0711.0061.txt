In the past century it was believed that both the main theories (quantum
mechanics and special relativity) predicted the existence of physical processes
that could not be explained in the framework of classical physics. However, it
has been shown recently that the solutions of Schroedinger equation have
described the physical situation practically in full agreement with classical
equations. The given equation represents the combination of classical equations
with the statistical distribution of corresponding parameters and the
properties of microscopic objects may be interpreted on the ontological basis
as it corresponds to our sensual knowledge.
  It will be shown now that also the main experimentally relevant relativistic
phenomenon (i.e., the mass increase with velocity) may be interpreted in the
framework of classical physics. A different prediction for this increase will
be then derived, which gives the possibility to decide on experimental basis
which alternative is more preferable (relativistic or classical).
