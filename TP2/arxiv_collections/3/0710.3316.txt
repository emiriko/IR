We present measurements of the internal state distribution of
electrostatically guided formaldehyde. Upon excitation with continuous tunable
ultraviolet laser light the molecules dissociate, leading to a decrease in the
molecular flux. The population of individual guided states is measured by
addressing transitions originating from them. The measured populations of
selected states show good agreement with theoretical calculations for different
temperatures of the molecule source. The purity of the guided beam as deduced
from the entropy of the guided sample using a source temperature of 150K
corresponds to that of a thermal ensemble with a temperature of about 30 K.
