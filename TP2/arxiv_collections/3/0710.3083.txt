We have calculated the electroweak radiative corrections at the O(alpha)
level to the three channels of the process f_1 bar-f_1 Z A --> 0 and
implemented them into the SANC system. Here A stands for the photon and f_1 for
a first generation fermion whose mass is neglected everywhere except in
arguments of logarithmic functions. The symbol --> 0 means that 4-momenta of
all the external particles flow inwards. We present the complete analytical
results for the covariant and helicity amplitudes for three cross channels: f_1
+ bar-f_1 --> Z + gamma, Z --> f_1 + bar-f_1 + gamma and f_1 + gamma --> f_1 +
Z. The one-loop scalar form factors of these channels are simply related by an
appropriate permutation of their arguments s,t,u. To check the correctness of
our results we first of all observe the independence of the scalar form factors
on the gauge parameters and the validity of the Ward identity, i.e. external
photon transversality, and, secondly, compare our numerical results with the
other independent calculations available to us.
