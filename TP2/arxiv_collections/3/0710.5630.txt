The fully relativistic theory of the g factor of Li-like ions with nonzero
nuclear spin is considered for the (1s)^2 2s state. The magnetic-dipole
hyperfine-interaction correction to the atomic g factor is calculated including
the one-electron contributions as well as the interelectronic-interaction
effects of order 1/Z. This correction is combined with the
interelectronic-interaction, QED, nuclear recoil, and nuclear size corrections
to obtain high-precision theoretical values for the g factor of Li-like ions
with nonzero nuclear spin. The results can be used for a precise determination
of nuclear magnetic moments from g factor experiments.
