The interface states appearing in polyacetylene-polyvinylfluoride and
polyethylene-polyvinylfluoride are determined via an ab initio self consistent
field technique based on Green matrix formalism. Different properties of these
states are explored. Contrary to the results of the second pair, the results of
the first pair showed that the active electronic structure of polyacetylene
leads to new states lying in the energy gap of polyvinylfluoride which enhances
the doping probability in the first pair. The results emphasize the appearance
of bending band phenomenon as a result of the interface of systems considered.
