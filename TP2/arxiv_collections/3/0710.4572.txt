On the basis of recently proposed scenario of the transformation of the
Kolmogorov cascade into the Kelvin-wave cascade, we develop a theory of
low-temperature cutoff. The theory predicts a specific behavior of the
quantized vortex line density, $L$, controlled by the frictional coefficient,
$\alpha(T) \ll 1$, responsible for the cutoff. The curve $\ln L(\ln \alpha)$ is
found to directly reflect the structure of the cascade, revealing four
qualitatively distinct wavenumber regions. Excellent agreement with recent
experiment by Walmsley {\it et al.} [arXiv:0710.1033]--in which $L(T)$ has been
measured down to $T \sim 0.08 $K--implies that the scenario of low-temperature
superfluid turbulence is now experimentally validated, and allows to quantify
the Kelvin-wave cascade spectrum.
