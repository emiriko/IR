We show that the covariant derivative of a spinor for a general affine
connection, not restricted to be metric compatible, is given by the
Fock-Ivanenko coefficients with the antisymmetric part of the Lorentz
connection. The projective invariance of the spinor connection allows to
introduce gauge fields interacting with spinors. We also derive the relation
between the curvature spinor and the curvature tensor for a general connection.
