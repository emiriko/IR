Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) MRI or perfusion-MRI
plays an important role in the non-invasive assessment of tumor vascularity.
However, the large number of images provided by the method makes display and
interpretation of the results challenging. Current practice is to display the
perfusion information as relative cerebral blood volume maps (rCBV). Color
intensity projections (CIPs) provides a simple, intuitive display of the
perfusion-MRI data so that regional perfusion characteristics are intrinsically
integrated into the anatomy structure the T2 images. The ease of use and quick
calculation time of CIPs should allow it to be easily integrated into current
analysis and interpretation pipelines.
