The de Haas - van Alphen (dHvA) effect in the cluster superconductor ZrB12
was studied by magnetic torque measurements in magnetic fields up to 28 T at
temperatures down to 0.35 K. The dHvA oscillations due to orbits from the Neck
sections and "Cubic Box" of the Fermi surface were detected. We measured
cyclotron effective masses of 0.5m_0 for Neck section of the FS. The dHvA
frequencies as well as the cyclotron effective masses were calculated using the
full potential Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital (LMTO) method within the Generalized
Gradient Approximation. Comparison of the angular dependence of the dHvA
frequencies with the band-structure calculations implies overall agreement with
theoretical model, while one section could not be definitely identified.
