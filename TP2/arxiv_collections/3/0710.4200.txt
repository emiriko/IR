In this work, a class of semiclassical Fourier Integral Operators (FIOs) with
complex phase associated to some canonical transformation of the phase space
$T^*\R^d$ is constructed. Upon some general boundedness assumptions on the
symbol and the canonical transformation, their continuity (as operators) from
the Schwartz class into itself and from $L^2$ into itself are proven.
