We describe QWalk, a new computational package capable of performing Quantum
Monte Carlo electronic structure calculations for molecules and solids with
many electrons. We describe the structure of the program and its implementation
of Quantum Monte Carlo methods. It is open-source, licensed under the GPL, and
available at the web site http://www.qwalk.org
