Previous investigations have shown that the canonical approach to simulating
QCD at finite density is promising. The algorithm we used in our earlier work
employs an exact calculation of the fermionic determinant which limits the size
of the lattices we can simulate. Interesting questions can only be answered if
we simulate at larger volume. In this paper we explore an algorithm, Hybrid
Noisy Monte Carlo, that employs a determinant estimator rather than an exact
calculation. We first present the technical aspects of the estimator, check
that the algorithm is correct by comparing it with our previous study, and then
discuss its merits. We will also discuss the challenges faced when simulating
larger lattice volumes.
