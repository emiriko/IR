Flavour will play a crucial role in understanding physics beyond the Standard
Model. Progress in developing a future programme to investigate this central
area of particle physics has recently passed a milestone, with the completion
of the conceptual design report for SuperB, a very high luminosity, asymmetric
e+e- collider. This article summarizes the important role of SuperB in
understanding new physics in the LHC era.
