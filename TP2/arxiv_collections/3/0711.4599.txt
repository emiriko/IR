We derive the macroscopic Fourier's Law of heat conduction from the exact
gain-loss time convolutionless quantum master equation under three assumptions
for the interaction kernel. To second order in the interaction, we show that
the first two assumptions are natural results of the long time limit. The third
assumption can be satisfied by a family of interactions consisting an exchange
effect. The pure exchange model directly leads to energy diffusion in a weakly
coupled spin-1/2 chain.
