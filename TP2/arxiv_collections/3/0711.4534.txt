We present a linear-optical implementation of a class of two-qubit partial
SWAP gates for polarization states of photons. Different gate operations,
including the SWAP and entangling square root of SWAP, can be obtained by
changing a classical control parameter -- namely the path difference in the
interferometer. Reconstruction of output states, full process tomography and
evaluation of entanglement of formation prove very good performance of the
gates.
