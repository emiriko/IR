We use current-current interaction to calculate the fragmentation functions
to describe the production of spin-1/2, spin-1/2$'$ and spin-3/2 baryons with
massive constituents in a relativistic quark-diquark model. Our results are in
their analytic forms and are applicable for singly, doubly and triply heavy
baryons. We discuss the production of $\Omega_{bbc}$, $\Omega_{bcc}$ and
$\Omega_{ccc}$ baryons in some detail. The results are satisfactorily compared
with those obtained for triply heavy baryons calculated in a perturbative
regime within reasonable values of the parameters involved.
