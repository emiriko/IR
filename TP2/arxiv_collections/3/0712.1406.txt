We theoretically demonstrate that a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
  (RIXS) with a sizable momentum transfer can be utilized to study valence band
dispersion for broad band materials. We take RIXS at the Si K edge of 3C-SiC as
a typical example. The RIXS spectra are calculated by systematically changing
the transferred momentum, an incident photon polarization and an incident
photon energy, on the basis of an ab initio calculation. We find that the
spectra depend heavily on both the transferred momentum and the incident photon
polarization, and the peaks in the spectra correspond to the energies of the
valence bands. We conclude that the information on the energy dispersion of
valence bands can be extracted from the transferred momentum dependence of the
RIXS spectra. These findings lead to further application for RIXS when
investigating the band structure of broad band materials.
