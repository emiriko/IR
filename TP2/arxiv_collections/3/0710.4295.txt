In this note, we will compare the Garnier system in two variables with
four-dimensional partial differential system in two variables with
$W(D_6^{(1)})$-symmetry. Both systems are different in each compactification in
the variables $q_1,q_2$, however, has same five holomorphy conditions in the
variables $p_1,p_2$.
