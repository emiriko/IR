We generalize the recent study of random space-filling bearings to a more
realistic situation, where the spacing offset varies randomly during the
space-filling procedure, and show that it reproduces well the
size-distributions observed in recent studies of real fault gouges. In
particular, we show that the fractal dimensions of random polydisperse bearings
sweep predominantly the low range of values in the spectrum of fractal
dimensions observed along real faults, which strengthen the evidence that
polydisperse bearings may explain the occurrence of seismic gaps in nature. In
addition, the influence of different distributions for the offset is studied
and we find that the uniform distribution is the best choice for reproducing
the size-distribution of fault gouges.
