Both scalar and vector light resonances can be generated from the
unitarization of one-loop chiral perturbation theory. This amounts to using in
a dispersion relation the chiral expansion, which incorporates the correct QCD
quark mass dependence. We can thus predict the quark mass dependence of the
poles associated to those light resonances. Our results compare well with some
recent lattice results for the rho(770) mass and can be used as a benchmark for
future lattice results on the rho(770) or the f0(600) also known as the sigma.
