In the present work we discuss baryon asymmetry in the non-thermal
leptogenesis scenario and gravitino cosmology for an unstable gravitino with
inflaton decay. We take into account two production mechanisms for gravitino,
namely thermal production and inflaton decay. We wish to show in plots the
allowed parameter space so that the BBN constraint and the requirement for the
right baryon asymmetry are satisfied at the same time. However our analysis
shows that it is impossible to achieve both goals simultaneously.
