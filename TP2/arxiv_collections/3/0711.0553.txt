Differential cross sections and analyzing powers for elastic scattering from,
and for inelastic proton scattering to a set of $2^+_1$ states in, ${}^{12}$C,
${}^{20}$Ne, ${}^{24}$Mg, ${}^{28}$Si and ${}^{40}$Ca, and for a set of
energies between 35 to 250 MeV, have been analyzed. A $g$-folding model has
been used to determine optical potentials and a microscopic distorted wave
approximation taken to analyze the inelastic data. The effective
nucleon-nucleon interactions used to specify the optical potentials have also
been used as the transition operators in the inelastic scattering processes.
Shell and large space Hartree-Fock models of structure have been used to
describe the nuclear states.
