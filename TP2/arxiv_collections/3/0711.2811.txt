Cooperation between actors in design and construction activities in
architecture is an essential stake nowadays. In professional practices the
actors involved in construction projects use numerous tools. The project is
unique but the "views" that actors manipulate are various and sometimes
fundamentally different. Their common characteristic is that they partially
represent the cooperation context through a specific point of view.
"Bat'iViews" suggests to the actors a multi-view interface of the context and
enables to navigate through the different views. This proposition is based on a
model-driven approach. We distinguish between "context modelling" and modelling
of concepts represented in each "businessview". A model integrative
infrastructure allows us to develop the prototype and to manage user
interaction through the definition of models' transformations.
