Transformation optics offers an unconventional approach to the control of
electromagnetic fields. A transformation optical structure is designed by first
applying a form-invariant coordinate transform to Maxwell's equations, in which
part of free space is distorted in some desired manner. The coordinate
transformation is then applied to the permittivity and permeability tensors to
yield the specification for a complex medium with desired functionality. The
transformation optical structures proposed to date, such as electromagnetic
"invisibility" cloaks and concentrators, are inherently reflectionless and
leave the transmitted wave undisturbed. Here we expand the class of
transformation optical structures by introducing finite, embedded coordinate
transformations, which allow the electromagnetic waves to be steered or
focused. We apply the method to the design of several devices, including a
parallel beam shifter and a beam splitter, both of which exhibit unusual
electromagnetic behavior as confirmed by 2D full-wave simulations. The devices
are designed to be reflectionless, in accordance with a straightforward
topological criterion.
