A new class of twistor string theories were recently constructed by
Abou-Zeid, Hull and Mason. The most interesting one of these theories has the
particle content of N=8 supergravity. Arguments are given for the vanishing of
the (+ - -)-helicity amplitude for gravitons which suggest that this theory
describes a chiral N=8 supergravity rather than Einstein supergravity.
