We investigate the non-uniform structures and the equation of state (EOS) of
nuclear matter in the context of the first-order phase transitions (FOPT) such
as liquid-gas phase transition, kaon condensation, and hadron-quark phase
transition. During FOPT the mixed phases appear, where matter exhibits
non-uniform structures called ``Pasta'' structures due to the balance of the
Coulomb repulsion and the surface tension between two phases. We treat these
effects self-consistently, properly taking into account of the Poisson equation
and the Gibbs conditions. Consequently, they make the EOS of the mixed phase
closer to that of Maxwell construction due to the Debye screening. This is a
general feature of the mixed phase consisting of many species of charged
particles.
