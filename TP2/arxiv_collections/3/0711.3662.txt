The present work reports an experimental observation of thermal entanglement
in a clusterized spin chain formed in the compound Na$_2$Cu$_5$Si$_4$O$_{14}$.
The presence of entanglement was investigated through two measured quantities,
an Entanglement Witness and the Entanglement of Formation, both derived from
the magnetic susceptibility. It was found that pairwise entanglement exists
below $ \sim 200$ K. Tripartite entanglement was also observed below $ \sim
240$ K. A theoretical study of entanglement evolution as a function of applied
field and temperature is also presented.
