We show that a class of multimode optical transformations that employ linear
optics plus two-mode squeezing can be expressed as SU(1,1) operators. These
operations are relevant to state-of-the-art continuous variable quantum
information experiments including quantum state sharing, quantum teleportation,
and multipartite entangled states. Using this SU(1,1) description of these
transformations, we obtain a new basis for such transformations that lies in a
useful representation of this group and lies outside the often-used restriction
to Gaussian states. We analyze this basis, show its application to a class of
transformations, and discuss its extension to more general quantum optical
networks.
