Superfluid-insulator transition in an ultracold Fermi gas in the external
disorder potential of the amplitude $V_0$ is studied as a function of the
concentration of the gas $n$ and magnetic field $B$ in the presence of the
Feshbach resonance. We find the zero temperature phase diagrams in the plane
($B,n$) at a given $V_0$ and in the plane $(V_0, n)$ at a given $B$. Our
results for BEC side of the diagram are also valid for the superfluid-insulator
transition in a Bose gas.
