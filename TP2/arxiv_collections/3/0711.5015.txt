I describe a method for determining the coefficients of scalar integrals for
one-loop amplitudes in quantum field theory. The method is based upon
generalized unitarity and the behavior of amplitudes when the free parameters
of the cut momenta approach infinity. The method works for arbitrary masses of
both external and internal legs of the amplitudes. It therefore applies not
only to QCD but also to the Electroweak theory and to quantum field theory in
general.
