We prove general nonlinear stability and existence theorems for rotating star
solutions which are axi-symmetric steady-state solutions of the compressible
isentropic Euler-Poisson equations in 3 spatial dimensions. We apply our
results to rotating and non-rotating white dwarf, and rotating high density
supermassive (extreme relativistic) stars, stars which are in convective
equilibrium and have uniform chemical composition. This paper is a continuation
of our earlier work ([28]).
