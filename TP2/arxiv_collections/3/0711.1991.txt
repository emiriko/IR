We use a simple a transverse radial boost scenario coupled to PYTHIA events
to illustrate the impact radial flow may have on two- and three-particle
correlation functions measured in heavy-ion collisions. We show that modest
radial velocities can impart strong modifications to the correlation functions,
some of which may be interpreted as same side ridge and away side structure
that can mimic conical emission.
