Mixed type (bright-dark) soliton solutions of the integrable N-coupled
nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger (CNLS) equations with mixed signs of focusing and
defocusing type nonlinearity coefficients are obtained by using Hirota's
bilinearization method. Generally, for the mixed N-CNLS equations the bright
and dark solitons can be split up in $(N-1)$ ways. By analysing the collision
dynamics of these coupled bright and dark solitons systematically we point out
that for $N>2$, if the bright solitons appear in at least two components,
non-trivial effects like onset of intensity redistribution, amplitude dependent
phase-shift and change in relative separation distance take place in the bright
solitons during collision. However their counterparts, the dark solitons,
undergo elastic collision but experience the same amplitude dependent
phase-shift as that of bright solitons. Thus in the mixed CNLS system there
co-exist shape changing collision of bright solitons and elastic collision of
dark solitons with amplitude dependent phase-shift, thereby influencing each
other mutually in an intricate way.
