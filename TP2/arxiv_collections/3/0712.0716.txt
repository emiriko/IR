We study DC and AC transport in low-density $p-$Si/SiGe heterostructures at
low temperatures and in a broad domain of magnetic fields up to 18 T. Complex
AC conductance is determined from simultaneous measurement of velocity and
attenuation of a surface acoustic wave propagating in close vicinity of the 2D
hole layer. The observed behaviors of DC and AC conductance are interpreted as
an evolution from metallic conductance at B=0 through hopping between localized
states in intermediate magnetic fields (close to the plateau of the integer
quantum Hall effect corresponding to the Landau-level filling factor $\nu$=1)
to formation of the Wigner glass in the extreme quantum limit ($B\gtrsim 14$,
$T \lesssim 0.8$ K).
