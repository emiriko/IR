We show that entanglement can be used to detect spacetime curvature. Quantum
fields in the Minkowski vacuum are entangled with respect to local field modes.
This entanglement can be swapped to spatially separated quantum systems using
standard local couplings. A single, inertial field detector in the
exponentially expanding (de Sitter) vacuum responds as if it were bathed in
thermal radiation in a Minkowski universe. We show that using two inertial
detectors, interactions with the field in the thermal case will entangle
certain detector pairs that would not become entangled in the corresponding de
Sitter case. The two universes can thus be distinguished by their entangling
power.
