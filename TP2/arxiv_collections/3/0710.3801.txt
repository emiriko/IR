Let $X$ be a Stein manifold of dimension at least 3. Given a compact
codimension 2 real analytic submanifold $M$ of $X$, that is the boundary of a
compact Levi-flat hypersurface $H$, we study the regularity of $H$. Suppose
that the CR singularities of $M$ are an $\mathcal{O}(X)$-convex set. For
example, suppose $M$ has only finitely many CR singularities, which is a
generic condition. Then $H$ must in fact be a real analytic submanifold. If $M$
is real algebraic, it follows that $H$ is real algebraic and in fact extends
past $M$, even near CR singularities. To prove these results we provide two
variations on a theorem of Malgrange, that a smooth submanifold contained in a
real analytic subvariety of the same dimension is itself real analytic. We
prove a similar theorem for submanifolds with boundary, and another one for
subanalytic sets.
