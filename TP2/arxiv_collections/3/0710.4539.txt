In this work we introduce the use of powerful tools from geometric measure
theory (GMT) to study problems related to the size and structure of sets of
mutual absolute continuity for the inside and outside harmonic measures of
domains in n-dimensional Euclidean space, with n bigger than or equal to 3.
