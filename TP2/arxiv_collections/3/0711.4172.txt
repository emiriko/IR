We report on a tunable all-optical delay line for pulses with optical
frequency within the Rb $D_2$ absorption line. Using frequency tuning between
absorption components from different isotopes, pulses of 10 ns duration are
delayed in a 10 cm hot vapour cell by up to 40 ns while the transmission
remains above 10%. The use of two isotopes allows the delay to be increased or
decreased by optical pumping with a second laser, producing rapid tuning over a
range of more than 40% of the initial delay at 110$^{\circ}$C. We investigate
the frequency and intensity ranges in which this delay line can be realised.
Our observations are in good agreement with a numerical model of the system.
