We elaborate a detailed study of certain aspects of (a version of) the
AdS/CFT correspondence, conjectured by Maldacena and Witten, between quantum
field theories in a gravitational background given by an asymptotically anti-de
Sitter (AAdS) spacetime, and conformally covariant quantum field theories in
the latter's conformal infinity (in the sense of Penrose), aspects such that:
(a) are independent from (the pair of) specific models in Quantum Field Theory,
and (b) susceptible to a recast in a mathematically rigorous mould. We adopt as
a starting point the theorem demonstrated by Rehren in the context of Local
Quantum Physics (also known as Algebraic Quantum Field Theory) in anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, called algebraic holography or Rehren duality. The
main body of the present work consists in extending Rehren's result to a
reasonably general class of d-dimensional AAdS spacetimes (d>3), scrutinizing
how the properties of such an extension are weakened and/or modified as
compared to AdS spacetime, and probing how non-trivial gravitational effects
manifest themselves in the conformal infinity's quantum theory. The language
employed for the quantum theories relevant for our generalization of Rehren
duality follows the functorial formulation of Local Quantum Physics due to
Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch, extended afterwards by Sommer in order to
incorporate boundary conditions.
