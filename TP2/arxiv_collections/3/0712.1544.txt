A systematic study of the flavor group $T^{'}$ is presented in terms of a
specific model which extends the standard model symmetry to $[SU(3) \times
SU(2) \times U(1)]_{(local)} \times [T^{'} \times Z_2 \times Z_2^{'} \times
Z_2^{''}]_{(global)}$. In the model, approximate tribimaximal mixing occurs in
the neutrino sector. There is also one new formula relating a quark mixing
parameter to quark masses. Most exciting are new formulas relating lepton and
quark mixing parameters of the type usually associated with grand unification
but here relying only on the group structure of $T^{'}$. Flavor-changing
neutral currents in the model lead to lower bounds on scalar masses.
