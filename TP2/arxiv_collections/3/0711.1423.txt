We investigate the harmonically trapped interacting Bose gas in a quasi-2D
geometry using the classical field method. The system exhibits quasi-long-range
order and non-classical rotational inertia at temperatures below the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless cross-over to the superfluid state. In
particular, we compute the scissors-mode oscillation frequencies and find that
the irrotational mode changes its frequency as the temperature is sweeped
across the cross-over thus providing microscopic evidence for the emergence of
superfluidity.
