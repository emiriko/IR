In this paper, inspired by the idea that many real networks are composed by
different sorts of communities, we investigate the synchronization property of
oscillators on such networks. We identify the communities by the intrinsic
frequencies probability density $g(\omega)$ of Kuramoto oscillators. That is to
say, communities in different sorts are functional different. For a network
containing two sorts of communities, when the community strength is strong,
only the oscillators in the same community synchronize. With the weakening of
the community strength, an interesting phenomenon, \emph{Community Grouping},
appears: although the global synchronization is not achieved, oscillators in
the same sort of communities will synchronize. Global synchronization will
appear with the further reducing of the community strength, and the oscillators
will rotate around the average frequency.
