We consider a model of transverse momentum production in which
non-perturbative smearing takes place throughout the perturbative evolution, by
a simple modification to an initial state parton shower algorithm. Using this
as the important non-perturbative ingredient, we get a good fit to data over a
wide range of energy. Combining it with the non-perturbative masses and cutoffs
that are a feature of conventional parton showers also leads to a reasonable
fit. We discuss the extrapolation to the LHC.
