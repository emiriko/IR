We show analytically and by numerical simulations that the conductance
through $\pi$-biased chaotic Josephson junctions is enhanced by several orders
of magnitude in the short-wavelength regime. We identify the mechanism behind
this effect as {\it macroscopic resonant tunneling} through a macroscopic
number of low-energy quasi-degenerate Andreev levels.
