We consider a Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Penrose tiling, a
quasiperiodic system having an inhomogeneous Neel-ordered ground state. Spin
wave energies and wavefunctions are studied in the linear spin wave
approximation. A linear dispersion law is found at low energies, as in other
bipartite antiferromagnets, with an effective spin wave velocity lower than in
the square lattice. Spatial properties of eigenmodes are characterized in
several different ways. At low energies, eigenstates are relatively extended,
and show multifractal scaling. At higher energies, states are more localized,
and, depending on the energy, confined to sites of a specified coordination
number. The ground state energy of this antiferromagnet, and local staggered
magnetizations are calculated. Perpendicular space projections are presented in
order to show the underlying simplicity of this "complex" ground state. A
simple analytical model, the two-tier Heisenberg star, is presented to explain
the staggered magnetization distribution in this antiferromagnetic system.
