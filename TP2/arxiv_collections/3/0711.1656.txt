We argue that an understanding of the Arrow of Time is urgently required if
recent string-theoretic ideas about cosmology are to be made to function. In
the string Landscape, the nucleation of baby universes is postulated to
"populate" the multiverse. Here we argue that baby universes can only have an
Arrow if they \emph{inherit} one; the problem of explaining the Arrow is thus
reduced to explaining it in the case of the original universe. Motivated by the
Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde formulation of "creation from nothing" in the context of
string theory, we propose that the original universe was created along a
spacelike surface with the topology of a torus. Using deep results in global
differential geometry, we are able to show that the geometry of this surface
had to be non-generic. This geometric "specialness" is communicated to matter
through the inflaton. Thus we have a theory of the Arrow which is intrinsically
geometric, which incorporates Inflation, and which allows universes in the
Landscape to begin with physically acceptable initial conditions.
