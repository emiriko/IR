We report a study of semileptonic B decays to P-wave D** mesons. Semileptonic
decay to D*_2 meson is observed for the first time and its product branching
ratio is measured to be
  Br(B+ -> anti-D*0_2 l+nu) x Br(anti-D*0_2 -> D- pi+) = 0.22 +- 0.03(stat.) +-
0.04(syst.)%. The result is obtained using the fully reconstructed B tags from
a data sample that contains 657 millions BB-bar pairs collected at the
Upsilon(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+
e- collider.
