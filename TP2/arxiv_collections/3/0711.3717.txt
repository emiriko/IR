Inclusive jet cross sections in Z/gamma^* events, with Z/gamma^* decaying
into an electron-positron pair, are measured as a function of jet transverse
momentum and jet multiplicity in ppbar collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV with
the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab in Run II, based on an integrated
luminosity of 1.7 fb^-1. The measurements cover the rapidity region | yjet | <
2.1 and the transverse momentum range ptjet > 30 GeV/c. Next-to-leading order
perturbative QCD predictions are in good agreement with the measured cross
sections.
