Hospital profiling involves a comparison of a health care provider's
structure, processes of care, or outcomes to a standard, often in the form of a
report card. Given the ubiquity of report cards and similar consumer ratings in
contemporary American culture, it is notable that these are a relatively recent
phenomenon in health care. Prior to the 1986 release of Medicare hospital
outcome data, little such information was publicly available. We review the
historical evolution of hospital profiling with special emphasis on outcomes;
present a detailed history of cardiac surgery report cards, the paradigm for
modern provider profiling; discuss the potential unintended negative
consequences of public report cards; and describe various statistical
methodologies for quantifying the relative performance of cardiac surgery
programs. Outstanding statistical issues are also described.
