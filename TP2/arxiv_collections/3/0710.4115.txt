Introducing a variable cosmological function $\Lambda (t)$ in a geometrical
manner from a 5D Riemann-flat metric, we investigate the possibility of having
a geometrical criterion to choose a suitable cosmological function $\Lambda
(t)$ for every 4D dynamical hypersurface capable of generate phantom
cosmologies.
