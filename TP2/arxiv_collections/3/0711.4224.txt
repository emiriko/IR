In the Schrodinger picture of the Dirac quantum mechanics, defined in charts
with spatially flat Robertson-Walker metrics and Cartesian coordinates the
perturbation theory is applied to the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
operator produced by the minimal coupling with the gravitational field. First
and second order perturbations are computed.
