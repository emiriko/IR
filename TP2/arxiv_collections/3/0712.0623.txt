The production of orbitally entangled electrons in quantum-chaotic dots is
investigated from a statistical point of view. The degree of entanglement is
quantified through the concurrence and the entanglement of formation. We
calculate the complete statistical distributions of the entanglement measures
by using random matrix theory. Simple analytical expressions are provided for
the concurrence distributions. We identify clear signatures of time-reversal
invariance in the production of entanglement at the level of the
entanglement-measure distributions, such as the ability of producing maximally
entangled (Bell) states, which passed unnoticed in previous works where only
the first two moments of the distributions were studied.
