Prospects of measuring polarized photons emitted from a quark-gluon plasma
(QGP) are discussed. In particular, the detection of a possible quark spin
polarization in a QGP using circularly polarized photons emitted from the
plasma is studied. Photons leave the QGP without further interaction and thus
provide a primary probe for quark polarization within the QGP. We find that
photon polarization cannot solely arise due to a possible QGP momentum space
anisotropy, but may be enhanced due to it. In particular, for oblate momentum
distributions and high photon energies, quark polarization is efficiently
transfered to photon polarization. The role of competing sources of polarized
photons in heavy-ion collisions is discussed.
