We discuss two methods by which high porosity silica aerogels can be
engineered to exhibit global anisotropy. First, anisotropy can be introduced
with axial strain. In addition, intrinsic anisotropy can result during growth
and drying stages and, suitably controlled, it can be correlated with
preferential radial shrinkage in cylindrical samples. We have performed small
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterize these two types of anisotropy. We
show that global anisotropy originating from either strain or shrinkage leads
to optical birefringence and that optical cross-polarization studies are a
useful characterization of the uniformity of the imposed global anisotropy.
