Using an optimization variational Monte Carlo method, we study the
half-filled-band Hubbard model on anisotropic triangular lattices, as a
continuation of the preceding study [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn 75, 074707 (2006)]. We
introduce two new trial states: (i) A coexisting state of
(\pi,\pi)-antiferromagnetic (AF) and a d-wave singlet gaps, in which we allow
for a band renormalization effect, and (ii) a state with an AF order of
120^\circ spin structure. In both states, a first-order metal-to-insulator
transition occurs at smaller U/t than that of the pure d-wave state. In
insulating regimes, magnetic orders always exist; an ordinary (\pi,\pi)-AF
order survives up to t'/t\sim 0.9 (U/t=12), and a 120^\circ-AF order becomes
dominant for t'/t \gsim 0.9. The regimes of the robust superconductor and of
the nonmagnetic insulator the preceding study proposed give way to these
magnetic domains.
