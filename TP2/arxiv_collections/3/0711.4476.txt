We present a detailed analysis, based on the Forward Flux Sampling (FFS)
simulation method, of the switching dynamics and stability of two models of
genetic toggle switches, consisting of two mutually-repressing genes encoding
transcription factors (TFs); in one model (the exclusive switch), they mutually
exclude each other's binding, while in the other model (general switch) the two
transcription factors can bind simultaneously to the shared operator region. We
assess the role of two pairs of reactions that influence the stability of these
switches: TF-TF homodimerisation and TF-DNA association/dissociation. We
factorise the flipping rate k into the product of the probability rho(q*) of
finding the system at the dividing surface (separatrix) between the two stable
states, and a kinetic prefactor R. In the case of the exclusive switch, the
rate of TF-operator binding affects both rho(q*) and R, while the rate of TF
dimerisation affects only R. In the case of the general switch both TF-operator
binding and TF dimerisation affect k, R and rho(q*). To elucidate this, we
analyse the transition state ensemble (TSE). For the exclusive switch, varying
the rate of TF-operator binding can drastically change the pathway of
switching, while changing the rate of dimerisation changes the switching rate
without altering the mechanism. The switching pathways of the general switch
are highly robust to changes in the rate constants of both TF-operator and
TF-TF binding, even though these rate constants do affect the flipping rate;
this feature is unique for non-equilibrium systems.
