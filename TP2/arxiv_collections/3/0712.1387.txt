We consider the quantum Hall effect of two-dimensional electrons with a
periodic potential and study the time dependence of the Hall and longitudinal
currents when the electric field is applied abruptly. We find that the currents
oscillate in time with very large frequencies because of quantum fluctuation
and the oscillations eventually vanish, for their amplitudes decay as 1/t.
