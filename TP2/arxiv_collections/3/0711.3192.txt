The two photon exchange amplitude is investigated in frame of analytic
properties of the virtual Compton scattering amplitude as a function of the
invariant mass squared of the intermediate hadronic state. A sum rule is built,
based on arguments from analyticity. It relates the differential cross section
of elastic electron-proton scattering including form factors, and the cross
section of inelastic scattering channel, with a contribution of nucleon
anti-nucleon pair production arising from the Fermi statistics. The last term
is calculated in frame of a simple model of nucleon-pion interaction.
