We reply to the Comment by Achim Rosch [1] (arXiv:0711.3093v1) who challenges
our finding in Ref. [2] (arXiv:0711.0952v1) with regard to the validity of the
Luttinger theorem in the cases of Mott insulating N-particle ground states
(even) when the chemical potential used in applying this theorem coincides with
the zero-temperature limit of the chemical potential satisfying the equation of
state corresponding to N particles. Rosch further argues that the
strong-coupling expression for the single-particle Green function presented in
Ref. [3] (arXiv:cond-mat/0602656v2) and analyzed in Ref. [2] does not imply
destruction of the Mott insulating state at half-filling as a result of an
arbitrary weak hopping contribution that breaks particle-hole symmetry and
therefore suggests that our conclusion in Ref. [2] to the contrary were
incorrect. Here we show the shortcomings of Rosch's arguments.
