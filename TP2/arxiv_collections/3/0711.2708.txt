Predicting which crystalline modifications can be present in a chemical
system requires the global exploration of its energy landscape. Due to the
large computational effort involved, in the past this search for sufficiently
stable minima has been performed employing a variety of empirical potentials
and cost functions followed by a local optimization on the ab initio level.
However, this entails the risk of overlooking important modifications that are
not modeled accurately using empirical potentials. In order to overcome this
critical limitation, we develop an approach to employ ab initio energy
functions during the global optimization phase of the structure prediction. As
an example, we perform a global exploration of the landscape of LiF on the ab
initio level and show that the relevant crystalline modifications are found
during the search.
