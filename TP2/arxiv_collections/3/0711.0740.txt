The ideal gas law of physics and chemistry says that PV = nRT. This law is a
statement of the relationship between four variables (P, V, n, and T) that
reflect properties of a quantity of gas in a container. The law enables us to
make accurate predictions of the value of any one of the four variables from
the values of the other three. The symbol R (called the "molar gas constant")
is the sole parameter or constant of the law. R stands for a fixed number that
has been shown through experiments to equal approximately 8.314472. Eight
methods are available to analyze the data from a relevant experiment to
determine the value of R. These methods are specific instances of eight general
methods that scientists use to determine the value(s) of the parameter(s) of a
model equation of a relationship between variables. Parameter estimation is one
step in the study of a relationship between variables.
