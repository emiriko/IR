The attractive gravitational force between two electrons in superconductors
is deduced from the Eddington-Dirac large number relation, together with Beck
and Mackey electromagnetic model of vacuum energy in superconductors. This
force is estimated to be weaker than the gravitational attraction between two
electrons in the vacuum.
