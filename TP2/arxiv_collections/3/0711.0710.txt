A survey of algebraic approaches to various problems in nuclear physics is
given. Examples are chosen from pairing of many-nucleon systems, nuclear
structure, fusion reactions below the Coulomb barrier, and supernova neutrino
physics to illustrate the utility of group-theoretical and related algebraic
methods in nuclear physics.
