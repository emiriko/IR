The possibility of the existence of a strongly interacting electroweak
symmetry breaking sector, as opposed to the weakly interacting light Higgs of
the Standard Model, is not yet ruled out by experiments. In this paper we make
an extensive study of a deconstructed model (or ``moose'' model) providing a
possible effective description of such a strong symmetry breaking sector, and
show its compatibility with experimental data for a wide portion of the model
parameters space. The model is a direct generalization of the previously
proposed D-BESS model.
