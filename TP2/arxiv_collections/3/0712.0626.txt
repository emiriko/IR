Employing the Hirota's method, a class of soliton solutions for the N=2 super
mKdV equations is proposed in terms of a single Grassmann parameter. Such
solutions are shown to satisfy two copies of N=1 supersymmetric mKdV equations
connected by nontrivial algebraic identities. Using the super Miura
transformation, we obtain solutions of the N=2 super KdV equations. These are
shown to generalize solutions derived previously. By using the mKdV/sinh-Gordon
hierarchy properties we generate the solutions of the N=2 super sinh-Gordon as
well.
