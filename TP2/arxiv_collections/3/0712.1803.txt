In the context of radio distributed networks, we present a generalized
approach for the Medium Access Control (MAC) with fixed congestion window. Our
protocol is quite simple to analyze and can be used in a lot of different
situations. We give mathematical evidence showing that our performance is
tight, in the sense that no protocol with fixed congestion window can do
better. We also place ourselves in the WiFi/WiMAX framework, and show
experimental results enlightening collision reduction of 14% to 21% compared to
the best known other methods. We show channel capacity improvement, and
fairness considerations.
