We investigate the stability and the free expansion of a trapped dipolar
Fermi gas. We show that stabilizing the system relying on tuning the trap
geometry is generally inefficient. We further show that the expanded density
profile always gets stretched along the attractive direction of dipolar
interaction. We also point out that by switching off the dipolar interaction
simultaneously with the trapping potential, the deformation of momentum
distribution can be directly observed.
