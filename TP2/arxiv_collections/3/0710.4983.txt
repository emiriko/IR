We report a selection of the most recent CDF and D0 results on top quark and
W and Z boson properties, based on Tevatron Run 2 data. The large datasets of W
and Z bosons allow a very precise measurement of the W mass and detailed
studies of vector boson production and asymmetries. Associated production of
vector boson pairs has been observed and cross sections have been measured. The
top quark is being studied in great detail, and a precision of 1.1 % in the
measurement of its mass has been achieved. The precise knowledge of top and W
masses are constraining the allowed mass range of a standard model Higgs in an
unprecedented way.
