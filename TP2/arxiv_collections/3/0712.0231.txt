In our earlier work, we have proved a product formula for certain
decomposition numbers of the cyclotomic v-Schur algebra associated to the
Ariki-Koike algebra. It is conjectured by Yvonne that the decomposition numbers
of this algebra can be described in terms of the canonical basis of the higher
level Fock space studied by Uglov. In this paper we prove a product formula
related to the canonical basis of the Fock space. In view of Yvonne's
conjecture, this formula is regarded as a counter-part for the Fock space of
our previous formula.
