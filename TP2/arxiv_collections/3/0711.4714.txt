Estimates of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, for the charged-current
process nu+208Pb-> e+208Bi, are presented. The nuclear structure calculations
have been performed by considering bound, resonant, and continuum states in the
single-particle basis used to construct correlated proton-particle neutron-hole
configurations. The observed features of the spectrum of 208Bi have been
reproduced, as accurately as possible, by diagonalizing a phenomenological
multipole-multipole interaction. Calculations of the cross section, for values
of q 200 $ MeV, were performed, and the dependence of the results upon the
choice of the residual proton-neutron interaction was investigated. It is found
that the inclusion of resonant states in the calculation of the nuclear wave
functions increases the neutrino-nucleus cross section, and that the
contribution of the continuum is negligible.
