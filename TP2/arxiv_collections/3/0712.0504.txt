We study the pairing symmetry of the noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion
superconductors CeRhSi$_3$ and CeIrSi$_3$ under pressures, which are both
antiferromagnets at ambient pressure. We solve the Eliashberg equation by means
of the random phase approximation and find that the mixed state of extended
s-wave and p-wave rather than the $d+f$ wave state could be realized by
enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. It is elucidated that the gap
function has line nodes on the Fermi surface and the resulting density of state
in the superconducting state shows a similar character to that of usual d-wave
superconductors, resulting in the NMR relaxation rate $1/(T_1T)$ that exhibits
no coherence peak and behaves like $1/(T_1T)\propto T^2$ at low temperatures.
