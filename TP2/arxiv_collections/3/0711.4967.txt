Using the techniques of quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory we use a similarity transformation to construct an equivalent Hermitian
Hamiltonian for the Lee model. In the field theory confined to the $V/N\theta$
sector it effectively decouples $V$, replacing the three-point interaction of
the original Lee model by an additional mass term for the $V$ particle and a
four-point interaction between $N$ and $\theta$. While the construction is
originally motivated by the regime where the bare coupling becomes imaginary,
leading to a ghost, it applies equally to the standard Hermitian regime where
the bare coupling is real. In that case the similarity transformation becomes a
unitary transformation.
