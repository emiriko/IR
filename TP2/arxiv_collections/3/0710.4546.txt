The plan for mass and spin measurement of SUSY particles with the ATLAS
detector is presented. The measurements of kinematical distributions, such as
edges in the invariant mass of leptons and jets, could be used to constrain the
model of SUSY that may be discovered at the LHC. Examples from a few points in
the mSUGRA scenario are provided with an emphasis on measurements that can be
conducted within the first few years of data taking.
