Experimental and theoretical clues both suggest that the Higgs boson has a
mass below the LEP2 lower limit of 114.4 GeV. If true, this suggests that the
dominant Higgs decay is nonstandard while the production cross sections remain
unmodified. We consider the possibility of nonstandard Higgs decays in the
language of On-Shell Effective Theories (OSETs), and discuss a little
considered class of Higgs decays, with a topology of both visible and missing
energy. We study existing LEP constraints on such decays, and find that such
decays would in general be allowed experimentally for ~ 100 GeV mass Higgses.
Simple model realizations of these decays exist, which can occur in
supersymmetric models and also in models with additional massive neutrinos.
Some potential searches that can be performed at Tevatron and LHC, contained in
standard supersymmetry topologies of leptons and missing energy, offer the
possibility of discovering such Higgses.
