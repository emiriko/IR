The LHCb Outer Tracker is a straw drift detector with a modular design and a
total of 53760 readout channels distributed over a sensitive area of 12 double
layers of 6x5 m2 each. The main electronics readout requirement is the precise
(0.5 ns) drift time measurement at an occupancy of 4% and 1 MHz readout. A
total of 128 channels are read out by one Front-End box. About half of the
FE-Boxes have been built. Quality Assurance during the production has been
performed on single FE-Box components. The assembled FE-Box is finally
commissioned using a special FE-Tester. The FE-Tester is a programmable pulser
with a time resolution of 150 ps capable to simulate all the functionality of
the readout mimicking the real detector. Consequently, problems have been found
and solved resulting in good overall performance.
