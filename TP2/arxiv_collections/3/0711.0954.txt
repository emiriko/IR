The mass and kinetic energy distribution of nuclear fragments from thermal
neutron-induced fission of 235U have been studied using a Monte-Carlo
simulation. Besides reproducing the pronounced broadening in the standard
deviation of the kinetic energy at the final fragment mass number around m =
109, our simulation also produces a second broadening around m = 125. These
results are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained by Belhafaf
et al. and other results on yield of mass. We conclude that the obtained
results are a consequence of the characteristics of the neutron emission, the
sharp variation in the primary fragment kinetic energy and mass yield curves.
We show that because neutron emission is hazardous to make any conclusion on
primary quantities distribution of fragments from experimental results on final
quantities distributions.
