We describe a resource-based method of morphological annotation of written
Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative language. The output of our system is a
graph of morphemes annotated with accurate linguistic information. The language
resources used by the system can be easily updated, which allows us-ers to
control the evolution of the per-formances of the system. We show that
morphological annotation of Korean text can be performed directly with a
lexicon of words and without morpho-logical rules.
