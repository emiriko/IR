We refine and extend a programme initiated by one of the current authors
[Science 276 (1997) 88; Phys. Rev. D56 (1997) 7578] advocating the use of the
classical energy conditions of general relativity in a cosmological setting to
place very general bounds on various cosmological parameters. We show how the
energy conditions can be used to bound the Hubble parameter H(z), Omega
parameter Omega(z), density rho(z), distance d(z), and lookback time T(z) as
(relatively) simple functions of the redshift z, present-epoch Hubble parameter
H_0, and present-epoch Omega parameter Omega_0. We compare these results with
related observations in the literature, and confront the bounds with the recent
supernova data.
