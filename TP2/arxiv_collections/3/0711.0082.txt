Starting from an N=1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the multiple
product gauge group and the bifundamentals, we apply Seiberg dual to each gauge
group, obtain the N=1 supersymmetric dual magnetic gauge theories with dual
matters including the gauge singlets. Then we describe the intersecting brane
configurations, where there are NS-branes and D4-branes(and anti D4-branes), of
type IIA string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua
of this gauge theory.
  We also discuss the case where the orientifold 4-planes are added into the
above brane configuration. Next, by adding an orientifold 6-plane, we apply to
an N=1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the multiple product gauge
group(where a single symplectic or orthogonal gauge group is present) and the
bifundamentals. Finally, we describe the other cases where the orientifold
6-plane intersects with NS-brane.
