Most organizations today use spreadsheets in some form or another to support
critical business processes. However the financial resources, and developmental
rigor dedicated to them are often minor in comparison to other enterprise
technology. The increasing focus on achieving regulatory and other forms of
compliance over key technology assets has made it clear that organizations must
regard spreadsheets as an enterprise resource and account for them when
developing an overall compliance strategy. This paper provides the reader with
a set of practical strategies for addressing spreadsheet compliance from an
organizational perspective. It then presents capabilities offered in the 2007
Microsoft Office System which can be used to help customers address compliance
challenges.
