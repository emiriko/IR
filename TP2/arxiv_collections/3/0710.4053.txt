A tangled-diagram over $[n]=\{1,...,n\}$ is a graph of degree less than two
whose vertices $1,...,n$ are arranged in a horizontal line and whose arcs are
drawn in the upper halfplane with a particular notion of crossings and
nestings. Generalizing the construction of Chen {\it et.al.} we prove a
bijection between generalized vacillating tableaux with less than $k$ rows and
$k$-noncrossing tangled-diagrams and study their crossings and nestings. We
show that the number of $k$-noncrossing and $k$-nonnesting tangled-diagrams are
equal and enumerate tangled-diagrams.
