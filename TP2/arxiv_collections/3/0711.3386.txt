Given two polynomials, we find a convergence property of the GCD of the
rising factorial and the falling factorial. Based on this property, we present
a unified approach to computing the universal denominators as given by Gosper's
algorithm and Abramov's algorithm for finding rational solutions to linear
difference equations with polynomial coefficients.
