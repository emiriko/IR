We discuss the calculations of quarkonium spectral functions in potential
models and their implications for the interpretation of the lattice data on
quarkonium correlators. In particular, we find that melting of different
quarkonium states does not lead to significant change in the Euclidean time
correlators. The large change of the quarkonium correlators above deconfinement
observed in the scalar and axial-vector channels appears to be due to the zero
mode contribution.
