We investigate a longitudinally loaded elastic nanorod inside a cylindrical
channel and show within the context of classical elasticity theory that the
Euler buckling instability leads to a helical postbuckling form of the rod
within the channel. The local pitch of the confined helix changes along the
channel and so does the longitudinal force transmitted along the rod,
diminishing away from the loaded end. This creates a possibility of jamming of
the nanorod within the channel.
