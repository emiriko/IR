We demonstrate the implications of Efimov physics in the recently measured
recombination rate of Cesium-133 atoms. By employing previously calculated
results for the energy dependence of the recombination rate of Helium-4 atoms,
we obtain three independent scaling functions that are capable of describing
the recombination rates over a large energy range for identical bosons with
large scattering length. We benchmark these and previously obtained scaling
functions by successfully comparing their predictions with full atom-dimer
phase shift calculations with artificial Helium-4 potentials yielding large
scattering lengths. Exploiting universality, we finally use these functions to
determine the 3-body recombination rate of Cesium-133 atoms with large positive
scattering length, compare our results to experimental data obtained by the
Innsbruck group and find excellent agreement.
