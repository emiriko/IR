We have studied the influence of disorder induced by electron irradiation on
the normal state resistivities $\rho(T)$ of optimally and underdoped YBa2CuOx
single crystals, using pulsed magnetic fields up to 60T to completely restore
the normal state. We evidence that point defect disorder induces low T upturns
of rho(T) which saturate in some cases at low T in large applied fields as
would be expected for a Kondo-like magnetic response. Moreover the magnitude of
the upturns is related to the residual resistivity, that is to the
concentration of defects and/or their nanoscale morphology. These upturns are
found quantitatively identical to those reported in lower Tc cuprates, which
establishes the importance of disorder in these supposedly pure compounds. We
therefore propose a realistic phase diagram of the cuprates, including
disorder, in which the superconducting state might reach the antiferromagnetic
phase in the clean limit.
