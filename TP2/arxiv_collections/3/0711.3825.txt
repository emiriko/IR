In this paper, we examine the effects of the gravitational field on the
dynamical evolution of the cavity-field entropy and the creation of the
Schrodinger-cat state in the Jaynes-Cummings model. We consider a moving
two-level atom interacting with a single mode quantized cavity-field in the
presence of a classical homogeneous gravitational field. Based on an su(2)
algebra, as the dynamical symmetry group of the model, we derive the reduced
density operator of the cavity-field which includes the effects of the atomic
motion and the gravitational field. Also, we obtain the exact solution and the
approximate solution for the system-state vector, and examine the atomic
dynamics. By considering the temporal evolution of the cavity-field entropy as
well as the dynamics of the Q-function of the cavity-field we study the effects
of the gravitational field on the generation of the Schrodinger-cat states of
the cavity-field by using the Q-function, field entropy and approximate
solution for the system-state vector. The results show that the gravitational
field destroys the generation of the Schrodinger-cat state of the cavity-field.
