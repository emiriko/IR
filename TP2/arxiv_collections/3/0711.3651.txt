These are the notes from the summer school in G\"ottingen sponsored by NATO
Advanced Study Institute on Higher-Dimensional Geometry over Finite Fields that
took place in 2007. The aim was to give a short introduction on zeta functions
over finite fields, focusing on moment zeta functions and zeta functions of
affine toric hypersurfaces.
