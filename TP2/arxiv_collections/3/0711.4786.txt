The extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation of
gases with attractive 1/r-interaction has a second solution which is born
together with the ground state in a tangent bifurcation. At the bifurcation
point both states coalesce, i.e., the energies and the wave functions are
identical. We investigate the bifurcation point in the context of exceptional
points, a phenomenon known for linear non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We point out
that the mean field energy, the chemical potential, and the wave functions show
the same behavior as an exceptional point in a linear, non-symmetric system.
The analysis of the analytically continued Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveals
complex waves at negative scattering lengths below the tangent bifurcation.
These solutions are interpreted as a decay of the condensate caused by an
absorbing potential.
