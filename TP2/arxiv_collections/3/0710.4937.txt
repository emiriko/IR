The physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider in combination with the
planned International Linear Collider is discussed for a difficult region of
supersymmetry that is characterized by scalar SUSY particles with masses around
2 TeV. Precision measurements of masses, cross sections and forward-backward
asymmetries allow to determine the fundamental supersymmetric parameters even
if only a small part of the spectrum is accessible. No assumptions on a
specific SUSY-breaking mechanism are imposed. Mass contraints for the
kinematically inaccessible particles can be derived.
