Supersymmetry and extra dimensions are the two most promising candidates for
new physics at the TeV scale. Supersymmetric particles or extra-dimensional
effects could soon be observed at the Large Hadron Collider. We propose a
simple but powerful method to discriminate the two models: the analysis of
isolated leptons with high transverse momentum. Black hole events are simulated
with the CATFISH black hole generator. Supersymmetry simulations use a
combination of PYTHIA and ISAJET, the latter providing the mass spectrum. Our
results show the measure of the dilepton invariant mass provides a strong
signature to differentiate supersymmetry and black hole events at the Large
Hadron Collider. Analysis of event-shape variables and multilepton events
complement and strengthen this conclusion.
