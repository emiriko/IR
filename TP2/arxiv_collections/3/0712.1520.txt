In this work we extend and apply a previous proposal to study noncommutative
cosmology to the FRW cosmological background coupled to a scalar field, this is
done in classical and quantum scenarios. In both cases noncommutativity is
introduced in the gravitational field as well as in the scalar field through a
deformation of minisuperspace and are able to find exact solutions. Finally,
the effects of noncommutativity on the classical evolution are analyzed.
