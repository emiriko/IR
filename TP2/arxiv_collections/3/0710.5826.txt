Let $X_1,X_2,...$ be a sequence of random variables satisfying the
distributional recursion $X_1=0$ and $X_n= X_{n-I_n}+1$ for $n=2,3,...$, where
$I_n$ is a random variable with values in $\{1,...,n-1\}$ which is independent
of $X_2,...,X_{n-1}$. The random variable $X_n$ can be interpreted as the
absorption time of a suitable death Markov chain with state space ${\mathbb
N}:=\{1,2,...\}$ and absorbing state 1, conditioned that the chain starts in
the initial state $n$.
  This paper focuses on the asymptotics of $X_n$ as $n$ tends to infinity under
the particular but important assumption that the distribution of $I_n$
satisfies ${\mathbb P}\{I_n=k\}=p_k/(p_1+...+p_{n-1})$ for some given
probability distribution $p_k={\mathbb P}\{\xi=k\}$, $k\in{\mathbb N}$.
Depending on the tail behaviour of the distribution of $\xi$, several scalings
for $X_n$ and corresponding limiting distributions come into play, among them
stable distributions and distributions of exponential integrals of
subordinators. The methods used in this paper are mainly probabilistic. The key
tool is a coupling technique which relates the distribution of $X_n$ to a
random walk, which explains, for example, the appearance of the Mittag-Leffler
distribution in this context. The results are applied to describe the
asymptotics of the number of collisions for certain beta-coalescent processes.
