The problem of Chern-Simons-like term induction via quantum corrections in
four-dimensions is investigated in two different cases. In the first case, we
consider two distinct approaches to deal with the exact fermion propagator of
the extended QED theory up to the first order in the $b$-coefficient. We find
different results for distinct approaches in the same regularization scheme. In
the second case, we show that when we use a modified derivative expansion
method and another regularization scheme, we obtain a result that exactly
coincides with one of the results obtained in the former case. This seems to
imply an ambiguity absence as one treats the fermion propagator and the
self-energy tensor properly.
