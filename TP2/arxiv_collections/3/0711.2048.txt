Recent advances in lattice field theory, in computer technology and in chiral
perturbation theory have enabled lattice QCD to emerge as a powerful
quantitative tool in understanding hadron structure. I describe recent progress
in the computation of the nucleon form factors and moments of parton
distribution functions, before proceeding to describe lattice studies of the
Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). In particular, I show how lattice
studies of GPDs contribute to building a three-dimensional picture of the
proton. I conclude by describing the prospects for studying the structure of
resonances from lattice QCD.
