We report studies of the solution of the Heaviside - Klein - Gordon thermal
equation. As the result it is shown that the solution consists of two
components: the fast thermal wave and slow diffusion for very large (compared
to relaxation time) time period. We argue that the fast thermal wave can be
recognized as the indication of the ballistic heat transport. As an example we
consider the ballistic heat transport in graphene.
