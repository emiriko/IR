We present a method for a complete characterization of a femtosecond
ultraviolet pulse when a fundamental near-infrared beam is also available. Our
approach relies on generation of second harmonic from the pre-characterized
fundamental, which serves as a reference against which an unknown pulse is
measured using spectral interference (SI). The characterization apparatus is a
modified second harmonic frequency resolved optical gating setup which
additionally allows for taking SI spectrum. The presented method is linear in
the unknown field, simple and sensitive. We checked its accuracy using test
pulses generated in a thick nonlinear crystal, demonstrating the ability to
measure the phase in a broad spectral range, down to 0.1% peak spectral
intensity as well as retrieving pi leaps in the spectral phase.
