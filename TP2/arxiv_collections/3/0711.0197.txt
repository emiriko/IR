The discovery potentials of ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) for Supersimmetry (SUSY), Extra Dimensions (ED), new Gauge
Bosons and R-Hadrons are discussed. Beyond Standard-Model (BSM) searches at LHC
require a detailed understanding of the detector performance, reconstruction
algorithms and triggering. Precision measurements of Standard Model (SM)
processes are also mandatory to acquire the necessary knowledge of SM
background. Both ATLAS and CMS efforts are hence addressed to determine the
best calibration candles and to design a realistic plan for the initial period
of data taking.
