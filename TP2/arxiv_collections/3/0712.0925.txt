A reductive structure is associated here with Lagrangian canonically defined
conserved quantities on gauge-natural bundles. Parametrized transformations
defined by the gauge-natural lift of infinitesimal principal automorphisms
induce a variational sequence such that the generalized Jacobi morphism is
naturally self-adjoint. As a consequence, its kernel defines a reductive split
structure on the relevant underlying principal bundle.
