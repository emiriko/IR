On the basis of existing data, we suggest such a mechanism of production for
exotic hadrons that can explain, at least qualitatively, why the Theta+-baryon
is seen in some experiments and not in others. With our hypothesis, production
of exotic hadrons is a new kind of hard processes. We also can propose new
experiments to check (and confirm?) existence of exotics and to provide new
important information about both exotic and conventional hadrons [The talk is
based on the papers by Ya. Azimov, K. Goeke, and I. Strakovsky, Phys Rev D 76,
