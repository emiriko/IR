We use digital holographic microscopy and Mie scattering theory to
simultaneously characterize and track individual colloidal particles. Each
holographic snapshot provides enough information to measure a colloidal
sphere's radius and refractive index to within 1%, and simultaneously to
measure its three-dimensional position with nanometer in-plane precision and 10
nanometer axial resolution.
