We introduce a superstatistical model for the progression statistics of
malignant cancer cells. The metastatic cascade is modeled as a complex
nonequilibrium system with several macroscopic pathways and inverse-chi-square
distributed parameters of the underlying Poisson processes. The predictions of
the model are in excellent agreement with observed survival time probability
distributions of breast cancer patients.
