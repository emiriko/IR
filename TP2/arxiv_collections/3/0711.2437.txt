We have reviewed the Comment of Geyer et al. [arXiv:0708.1548] concerning our
recent work [Phys. Rev. A 75, 060102 (R) (2007)], and while we disagree with
their criticisms, we acknowledge them for giving us the opportunity to add
interesting addition material and a more detailed description of our
experiment. We describe further our calculation and explain why a more
sophisticated model is not warranted. We also present detailed experiments on
the effects of electrostatic forces in our measurements and show that the
contribution due to work function differences is small and that the residual
electrostatic force is dominated by trapped charges and external fields.
Finally, we estimate the effect of double layer interactions. These additional
calculations and measurements support our original conclusion that the
experimental results are consistent with the Lifshitz theory.
