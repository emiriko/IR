Using a controlled analytic treatment, we derive a model that generically
describes cooperative strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in one-band and
two-band Jahn-Teller (JT) systems. The model involves a {\em
next-nearest-neighbor} hopping and a nearest-neighbor repulsion. Rings with odd
number of sites (o-rings) belong to a different universality class compared to
rings with even number (e-rings). The e-rings, upon tuning repulsion, undergo a
dramatic discontinuous transition to a {\em conducting commensurate} charge
density wave (CDW) state with a period independent of filling.
