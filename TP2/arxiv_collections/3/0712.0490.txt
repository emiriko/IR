We study light vector meson electroproduction at small $x$ within the
generalized parton distributions (GPDs) model. The modified perturbative
approach is used, where the quark transverse degrees of freedom in the vector
meson wave function and hard subprocess are considered. Our results on the
cross section and spin observables are in good agreement with experiment
