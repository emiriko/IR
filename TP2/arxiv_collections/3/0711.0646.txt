Non-Gaussian fluctuations of the electrical current can be detected with a
Josephson junction placed on-chip with the noise source. We present preliminary
measurements with an NIS junction as a noise source, and a Josephson junction
in the thermal escape regime as a noise detector. It is shown that the
Josephson junction detects not only the average noise, which manifests itself
as an increased effective temperature, but also the noise asymmetry. A
theoretical description of the thermal escape of a Josephson junction in
presence of noise with a non-zero third cumulant is presented, together with
numerical simulations when the noise source is a tunnel junction with Poisson
noise. Comparison between experiment and theory is discussed.
