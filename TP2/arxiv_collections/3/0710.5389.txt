We report on the optical spectroscopy of a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD)
doped with a single Mn atom in a longitudinal magnetic field of a few Tesla.
Our findings show that the Mn impurity is a neutral acceptor state A^0 whose
effective spin J=1 is significantly perturbed by the QD potential and its
associated strain field. The spin interaction with photo-carriers injected in
the quantum dot is shown to be ferromagnetic for holes, with an effective
coupling constant of a few hundreds of micro-eV, but vanishingly small for
electrons.
