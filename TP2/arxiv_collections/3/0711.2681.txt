It is reported that terahertz radiation from 0.69 THz to 2.54 THz has been
sensitively detected in a device consisting of bundles of metallic carbon
nanotubes, quasi-optically coupled through a lithographically fabricated
antenna, and a silicon lens. The measured data are consistent with a bolometric
process and show promise for operation above 4.2 K.
