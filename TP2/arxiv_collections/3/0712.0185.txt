A qualitative discussion is given of the role electron holes play in
generating fine structure on the electron cyclotron maser radiation. It is
argued that electron holes become deformed in phase space when interacting with
an incomplete ring or horseshoe distribution which occurs in the presence of
strong field aligned electric fields in the upward current region and in the
presence of a loss cone. This interaction is based on momentum balance
considerations. Deformed narrow electron holes cause steep velocity space
gradients on the ring distribution that lead to intense but narrow band
emission from their high speed sides and absorption at slightly higher
frequency from their low speed sides. The twins of banded emission and
absorption move in frequency space due to the average real space displacement
of the deformed electron hole.
