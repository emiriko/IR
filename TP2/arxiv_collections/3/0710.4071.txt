The entanglement entropy of the incompressible states of a realistic quantum
Hall system are studied by direct diagonalization. The subdominant term to the
area law, the topological entanglement entropy, which is believed to carry
information about topologic order in the ground state, was extracted for
filling factors 1/3, 1/5 and 5/2. The results for 1/3 and 1/5 are consistent
with the topological entanglement entropy for the Laughlin wave function. The
5/2 state exhibits a topological entanglement entropy consistent with the
Moore-Read wave function.
