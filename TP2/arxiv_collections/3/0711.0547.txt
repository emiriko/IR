Transverse momentum spectra up to 4.5 GeV/c around midrapidity of pi^{+/-},
p, pbar, K^{+/-} in Pb+Pb reactions were measured at sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3 GeV by
the CERN-NA49 experiment. The nuclear modification factors R_{AA} for pi^{+/-}
and R_{CP} for pi^{+/-},p,pbar,K^{+/-} were extracted and are compared to RHIC
results at sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV. The modification factor R_{AA} shows a rapid
increase with transverse momentum in the covered region. This indicates that
the Cronin effect is the dominating effect in our energy range. The
modification factor R_{CP}, in which the contribution of the Cronin effect is
reduced, shows a saturation well below unity in the pi^{+/-} channel. The
extracted R_{CP} values follow the 200 GeV RHIC results closely in the
available transverse momentum range, except for pi^{+/-} above 2.5 GeV/c
transverse momentum. There the measured suppression is smaller than that
observed at RHIC.
