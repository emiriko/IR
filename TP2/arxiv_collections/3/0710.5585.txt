Magnetization measurements in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 manganite show that the
high-temperature long-range ferromagnetic-metallic phase transforms to
antiferromagnetic-insulating phase, although a fraction of
ferromagnetic-metallic phase undergoes glass-like kinetic arrest and coexists
at low temperature with the equilibrium antiferromagnetic-insulating phase. We
show here through resistivity measurements that the residual arrested
ferromagnetic-metallic fraction can be converted to the equilibrium
antiferromagnetic-insulating phase by successive annealing at higher
temperatures, possibly through heterogeneous nucleation of equilibrium phase.
Significantly, larger fractions of this glassy ferromagnetic-metallic phase can
be obtained by cooling in higher fields and larger conversion to equilibrium
antiferromagnetic-insulating phase results.
