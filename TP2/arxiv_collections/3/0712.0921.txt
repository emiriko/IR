Bell's Theorem proved that one cannot in general reproduce the results of
quantum theory with a classical, deterministic local model. However, Einstein
originally considered the case where one could define an 'element of reality',
namely for the much simpler case where one could predict with certainty a
definite outcome for an experiment. For this simple case, Bell's Theorem says
nothing. But by using a slightly more complicated model than Bell, one can show
that even in this simple case where one can make definite predictions, one
still cannot generally introduce deterministic, local models to explain the
results.
