Cosmological models with two interacting fluids, each satisfying the strong
energy condition, are studied in the framework of classical General Relativity.
If the interactions are phenomenologically described by a power law in the
scale factor, the two initial interacting fluids can be equivalently
substituted by two non interacting effective fluids, where one of them may
violate the strong energy condition and/or have negative energy density.
Analytical solutions of the Friedmann equations of this general setting are
obtained and studied. One may have, depending on the scale where the
interaction becomes important, non singular universes with early accelerated
phase, or singular models with transition from decelerated to accelerated
expansion at large scales. Among the first, there are bouncing models where
contraction is stopped by the interaction. In the second case, one obtains dark
energy expansion rates without dark energy, like $\Lambda$CDM or phantomic
accelerated expansions without cosmological constant or phantoms, respectively.
