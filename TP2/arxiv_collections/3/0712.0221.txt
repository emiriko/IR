We have designed, fabricated and measured high-Q $\lambda/2$ coplanar
waveguide microwave resonators whose resonance frequency is made tunable with
magnetic field by inserting a DC-SQUID array (including 1 or 7 SQUIDs) inside.
Their tunability range is 30% of the zero field frequency. Their quality factor
reaches up to 3$\times10^4$. We present a model based on thermal fluctuations
that accounts for the dependance of the quality factor with magnetic field.
