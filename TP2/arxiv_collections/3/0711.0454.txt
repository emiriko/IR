A two-level medium, described by the Maxwell-Bloch (MB) system, is engraved
by establishing a standing cavity wave with a linearly polarized
electromagnetic field that drives the medium on both ends. A light pulse,
polarized along the other direction, then scatters the medium and couples to
the cavity standing wave by means of the population inversion density
variations. We demonstrate that control of the applied amplitudes of the
grating field allows to stop the light pulse and to make it move backward
(eventually to drive it freely). A simplified limit model of the MB system with
variable boundary driving is obtained as a discrete nonlinear Schroedinger
equation with tunable external potential. It reproduces qualitatively the
dynamics of the driven light pulse.
