We give a field-theoretic proof of the nonequilibrium work relations for a
space dependent field with stochastic dynamics. The path integral
representation and its symmetries allow us to derive Jarzynski's equality. In
addition, we derive a set of exact identities that generalize the
fluctuation-dissipation relations to far-from equilibrium situations. These
identities are prone to experimental verification. Furthermore, we show that
supersymmetry invariance of the Langevin equation, which is broken when the
external potential is time-dependent, is partially restored by adding to the
action a term which is precisely Jarzynski's work. Jarzynski's equality can
also be deduced from this supersymmetry
