Grover's database search algorithm is the optimal algorithm for finding a
desired object from an unsorted collection of items. Although it was discovered
in the context of quantum computation, it is simple and versatile enough to be
implemented using any physical system that allows superposition of states, and
several proposals have been made in the literature. I study a mechanical
realisation of the algorithm using coupled simple harmonic oscillators, and
construct its physical model for the simplest case of four identical
oscillators. The identification oracle is implemented as an elastic reflection
of the desired oscillator, and the overrelaxation operation is realised as
evolution of the system by half an oscillation period. I derive the equations
of motion, and solve them both analytically and by computer simulation. I
extend the ideal case analysis and explore the sensitivity of the algorithm to
changes in the initial conditions, masses of springs and damping. The amplitude
amplification provided by the algorithm enhances the energy of the desired
oscillator, while running the algorithm backwards spreads out the energy of the
perturbed oscillator among its partners. The former (efficient focusing of
energy into a specific oscillator) can have interesting applications in
processes that need crossing of an energy threshold for completion, and can be
useful in nanotechnological devices and catalysis. The latter (efficient
redistribution of energy) can be useful in processes requiring rapid
dissipation of energy, such as shock-absorbers and vibrational shielding. I
present some tentative proposals.
