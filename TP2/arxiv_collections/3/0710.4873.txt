We report the results of a double-slit-like experiment in the infrared range,
which evidence an anomalous behaviour of photon systems under particular
(energy and space) constraints. The statistical analysis of these outcomes
(independently confirmed by crossing photon beam experiments in both the
optical and the microwave range) shows a significant departure from the
predictions of both classical and quantum electrodynamics.
