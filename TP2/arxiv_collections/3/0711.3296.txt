This work presents recent advances in the development and the integration of
an electrochemical (chemicalelectrical energy conversion) micro power generator
used as a high voltage energy source for RF-MEMS powering. Autonomous MEMS
require similarly miniaturized power sources. Up to day, solid state thin film
batteries are realized with mechanical masks. This method doesn't allow
dimensions below a few mm^2 active area, and besides the whole process flow is
done under controlled atmosphere so as to ensure materials chemical stability
(mainly lithiated materials). Within this context, Microelectronics
micro-fabrication procedures (photolithography, Reactive Ion Etching...) are
used to reach both miniaturisation (100x100 $\mu$m^2 targeted unit cell active
area) and Above IC technological compatibility. All process steps developed
here are realized in clean room environment.
