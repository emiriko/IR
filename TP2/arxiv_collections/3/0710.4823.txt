Visual information processing will play an increasingly important role in
future electronics systems. In many applications, e.g. video surveillance
cameras, data throughput of microprocessors is not sufficient and power
consumption is too high. Instruction profiling on a typical test algorithm has
shown that pixel address calculations are the dominant operations to be
optimized. Therefore AddressLib, a structured scheme for pixel addressing was
developed, that can be accelerated by AddressEngine, a coprocessor for visual
information processing. In this paper, the architectural design of
AddressEngine is described, which in the first step supports a subset of the
AddressLib. Dataflow and memory organization are optimized during architectural
design. AddressEngine was implemented in a FPGA and was tested with MPEG-7
Global Motion Estimation algorithm. Results on processing speed and circuit
complexity are given and compared to a pure software implementation. The next
step will be the support for the full AddressLib, including segment addressing.
An outlook on further investigations on dynamic reconfiguration capabilities is
given.
