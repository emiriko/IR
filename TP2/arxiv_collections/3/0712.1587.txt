We report on the realisation of a chip-based multipole ion trap manufactured
using micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. It provides ion
confinement in an almost field-free volume between two planes of radiofrequency
electrodes, deposited on glass substrates, which allows for optical access to
the trap. An analytical model of the effective trapping potential is presented
and compared with numerical calculations. Stable trapping of argon ions is
achieved and a lifetime of 16s is measured. Electrostatic charging of the chip
surfaces is studied and found to agree with a numerical estimate.
