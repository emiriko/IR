Anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB), when implemented in MSSM is
known to suffer from the problem of negative slepton mass squared leading to
breakdown of electric charge conservation. We show however that when MSSM is
extended to explain small neutrino masses by including a pair of superheavy
Higgs triplet superfields (the type II seesaw mechanism), the slepton masses
can be deflected from the pure AMSB trajectory and become positive. In a simple
model we present in this paper, the seesaw scale is about $10^{13}-10^{14}{\rm
GeV}$. Gauge coupling unification can be maintained by embedding the triplet to
SU(5) {\bf 15}-multiplet. In this scenario, bino is the LSP and its mass is
nearly degenerate with NLSP slepton when the triplet mass is right around the
seesaw scale.
