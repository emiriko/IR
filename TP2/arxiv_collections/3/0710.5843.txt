We have combined the idea of renormalization group and quantum information
theory. We have shown how the entanglement or concurrence evolve as the size of
the system being large, i.e. the finite size scaling is obtained. Moreover, It
introduces how the renormalization group approach can be implemented to obtain
the quantum information properties of a many body system. We have obtained the
concurrence as a measure of entanglement, its derivatives and their scaling
behavior versus the size of system for the one dimensional Ising model in
transverse field. We have found that the derivative of concurrence between two
blocks each containing half of the system size diverges at the critical point
with the exponent which is directly associated with the divergence of the
correlation length.
