By means of extensive computer simulations, the authors consider the
entangled coevolution of actions and social structure in a new version of a
spatial Prisoner's Dilemma model that naturally gives way to a process of
social differentiation. Diverse social roles emerge from the dynamics of the
system: leaders are individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a
considerable fraction of the population, conformists are unsatisfied
cooperative agents that keep cooperating, and exploiters are defectors with a
payoff larger than the average one obtained by cooperators. The dynamics
generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network.
The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an
essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime. But
disruptions affecting leaders produce social crises described as dynamical
cascades that propagate through the network.
