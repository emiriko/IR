The fundamental problem is analized, the relation between Bose-Einstein
condensation and spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. This relation is largerly
misunderstood in physics community. Numerous articles and books contain the
statement that, though gauge symmetry breaking helps for describing
Bose-Einstein condensation, but the latter, in principle, does not require any
symmetry breaking. This, however, is not correct. The analysis is based on the
known mathematical theorems. But in order not to overcomplicate the
presentation and to make it accessible to all readers, technical details are
often omitted here. The emphasis is made on the following basic general facts:
Spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry is the necessary and sufficient
condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. Condensate fluctuations, in
thermodynamic limit, are negligible. Their catastrophic behavior can arise only
as a result of incorrect calculations, when a Bose-condensed system is
described without gauge symmetry breaking. It is crucially important to employ
the representative statistical ensembles equipped with all conditions that are
necessary for a unique and mathematically correct description of the given
statistical system. Only then one is able to develop a self-consistent theory,
free of paradoxes.
