Imaging in clinical oncology trials provides a wealth of information that
contributes to the drug development process, especially in early phase studies.
This paper focuses on kinetic modeling in DCE-MRI, inspired by mixed-effects
models that are frequently used in the analysis of clinical trials. Instead of
summarizing each scanning session as a single kinetic parameter -- such as
median $\ktrans$ across all voxels in the tumor ROI -- we propose to analyze
all voxel time courses from all scans and across all subjects simultaneously in
a single model. The kinetic parameters from the usual non-linear regression
model are decomposed into unique components associated with factors from the
longitudinal study; e.g., treatment, patient and voxel effects. A Bayesian
hierarchical model provides the framework in order to construct a data model, a
parameter model, as well as prior distributions. The posterior distribution of
the kinetic parameters is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods. Hypothesis testing at the study level for an overall treatment effect
is straightforward and the patient- and voxel-level parameters capture random
effects that provide additional information at various levels of resolution to
allow a thorough evaluation of the clinical trial. The proposed method is
validated with a breast cancer study, where the subjects were imaged before and
after two cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrating the clinical potential of this
method to longitudinal oncology studies.
