Social network analysis has long been an untiring topic of sociology.
However, until the era of information technology, the availability of data,
mainly collected by the traditional method of personal survey, was highly
limited and prevented large-scale analysis. Recently, the exploding amount of
automatically generated data has completely changed the pattern of research.
For instance, the enormous amount of data from so-called high-throughput
biological experiments has introduced a systematic or network viewpoint to
traditional biology. Then, is "high-throughput" sociological data generation
possible? Google, which has become one of the most influential symbols of the
new Internet paradigm within the last ten years, might provide torrents of data
sources for such study in this (now and forthcoming) digital era. We
investigate social networks between people by extracting information on the Web
and introduce new tools of analysis of such networks in the context of
statistical physics of complex systems or socio-physics. As a concrete and
illustrative example, the members of the 109th United States Senate are
analyzed and it is demonstrated that the methods of construction and analysis
are applicable to various other weighted networks.
