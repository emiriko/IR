The use of chiral perturbation theory in extracting physical K to pi pi
matrix elements from matrix elements calculated at unphysical kinematics is
outlined. In particular, the possibility of utilizing pions with non-zero
momentum in the final state, and of using partial quenching is discussed.
Preliminary (not physically normalized) Delta I=3/2 (27,1) K to pi pi matrix
elements are calculated on the RBC/UKQCD $24^3 \times 64$, $L_s=16$ lattices,
using 2+1 dynamical flavors and domain wall fermions, with an inverse lattice
spacing of $a^{-1}=1.729(28) GeV$. Effective mass plots are presented for a
light sea quark mass of $m_l^{sea}=0.005$, and various valence quark masses.
The plateaux are fit and $E_{\pi\pi}-m_K$ is extracted.
