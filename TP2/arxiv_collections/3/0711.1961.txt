We report the first lattice QCD result of the axial charge of N(1535),
$g_A^{N^*N^*}$. The measurement is performed with two flavors of dynamical
quarks employing the renormalization-group improved gauge action at
$\beta$=1.95 and the mean-field improved clover quark action with the hopping
parameters, $\kappa$=0.1375, 0.1390 and 0.1400. In order to avoid the signal
contaminations by N(1650) lying just 100 MeV above N(1535), we construct
2$\times$2 correlation matrices and diagonalize them so that clear signal
separation can be found. The wraparound contributions in the correlator, which
can be another source of signal contamination, are eliminated by imposing the
Dirichlet boundary condition in the temporal direction. We find that the axial
charge of N(1535) takes small values as $g_A^{N^*N^*}\sim 0.2$, independent of
quark masses, in the pion-mass range of 0.7 to 1.1 GeV.
