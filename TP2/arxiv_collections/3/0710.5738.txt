We study possible factorizations of supersymmetric (SUSY) transformations in
the one-dimensional quantum mechanics into chains of elementary Darboux
transformations with nonsingular coefficients. A classification of irreducible
(almost) isospectral transformations and of related SUSY algebras is presented.
The detailed analysis of SUSY algebras and isospectral operators is performed
for the third-order case.
