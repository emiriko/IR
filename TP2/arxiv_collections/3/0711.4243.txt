The response to a localized force provides a sensitive test for different
models of stress transmission in granular solids. The elasto-plastic models
traditionally used by engineers have been challenged by theoretical and
experimental results which suggest a wave-like (hyperbolic) propagation of the
stress, as opposed to the elliptic equations of static elasticity. Numerical
simulations of two-dimensional granular systems subject to a localized external
force are employed to examine the nature of stress transmission in these
systems as a function of the magnitude of the applied force, the frictional
parameters and the disorder (polydispersity). The results indicate that in
large systems (typically considered by engineers), the response is close to
that predicted by isotropic elasticity whereas the response of small systems
(or when sufficiently large forces are applied) is strongly anisotropic. In the
latter case the applied force induces changes in the contact network
accompanied by frictional sliding. The larger the coefficient of static
friction, the more extended is the range of forces for which the response is
elastic and the smaller the anisotropy. Increasing the degree of polydispersity
(for the range studied, up to 25%) decreases the range of elastic response.
