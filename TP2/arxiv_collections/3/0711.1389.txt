Rota-Baxter algebras were introduced to solve some analytic and combinatorial
problems and have appeared in many fields in mathematics and mathematical
physics. Rota-Baxter algebras provide a construction of pre-Lie algebras from
associative algebras. In this paper, we give all Rota-Baxter operators of
weight 1 on complex associative algebras in dimension $\leq 3$ and their
corresponding pre-Lie algebras.
