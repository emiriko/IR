Based on recent developments by the authors a next-to-leading order
spin(1)-spin(2) Hamiltonian is derived for the first time. The result is
obtained within the canonical formalism of Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner (ADM)
utilizing their generalized isotropic coordinates. A comparison with other
methods is given.
