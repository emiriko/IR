We present a procedure to study the switching and the stability of an array
of magnetic nanoparticles in the dynamical regime. The procedure leads to the
criterion of multi-switching stability to be satisfied in order to have stable
switching. The criterion is used to compare various magnetic-field-induced
switching schemes, either present in the literature or suggested in the present
work. In particular, we perform micromagnetic simulations to study the
magnetization trajectories and the stability of the magnetization after
switching for nanoparticles of elliptical shape. We evaluate the stability of
the switching as a function of the thickness of the particles and the rise and
fall times of the magnetic pulses, both at zero and room temperature.
Furthermore, we investigate the role of the dipolar interaction and its
influence on the various switching schemes. We find that the criterion of
multi-switching stability can be satisfied at room temperature and in the
presence of dipolar interactions for pulses shaped according to CMOS
specifications, for switching rates in the GHz regime.
