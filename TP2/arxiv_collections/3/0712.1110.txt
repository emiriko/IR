A theory is proposed which allows explaining the observed flat galaxy
rotation curves, without needing to invoke dark matter. Whereas other theories
have been proposed in the past which realize the same, the present theory rests
on basic physical principles, in contrast to for instance the MOND theory. The
key to arrive at this new theory is to consider from the start the energy
density of the vacuum. The way to calculate the effect of the corresponding
vacuum pressure on a mass has previously been laid down by Van Nieuwenhove
(1992). We obtain a modification of Newton's law of gravitation with some
peculiar properties such as the occurrence of regions of repulsive gravity.
Based on a newly derived equation of state of the vacuum, the Tully-Fisher
relation is derived. The theory can make detailed predictions about galaxy
rotation curves and is also able to explain to the Pioneer anomaly, the foamy
distribution of galaxies and the observed accelerated expansion of the
universe. A relativistic extension of the theory is included as well.
