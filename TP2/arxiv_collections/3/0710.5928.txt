Spontaneously broken flavor symmetry involving the binary tetrahedral group
$T^{'}$ relates parameters in the standard model. In one example the CP
violating Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata phase $\delta_{PMNS}$ and atmospheric
mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ of neutrinos are related to the Cabibbo mixing angle
$\Theta_C$ for quarks. A second formula relates a ratio of neutrino mass
eigenvalues to the Cabibbo angle.
