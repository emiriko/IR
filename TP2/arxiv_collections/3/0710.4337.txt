An analytical theory is developed for parametric interactions in metamaterial
multilayer structures with simultaneous nonlinear electronic and magnetic
responses and with near-zero refractive-index. We demonstrate theoretically
that electromagnetic fields of certain frequencies can be parametrically
shielded by a nonlinear left-handed material slab, where the permittivity and
permeability are both negative. The skin depth is tunable, and even in the
absence of material absorption, can be much less than the wavelength of the
electromagnetic field being shielded. This exotic behavior is a consequence of
the intricate nonlinear response in the left-handed materials and vanishing
optical refractive-index at the pump frequency.
