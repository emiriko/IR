By using the approach in \cite{XX2006} to Hall algebras arising in
homologically finite triangulated categories, we find an `almost' associative
multiplication structure for indecomposable objects in a 2-periodic
triangulated category. As an application, we give a new proof of the theorem of
Peng and Xiao in \cite{PX2000} which provides a way of realizing symmetrizable
Kac-Moody algebras and elliptic Lie algebras via 2-periodic triangulated
categories.
