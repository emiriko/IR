Vertically aligned mono-domain nematic liquid crystal elastomers contract
when heated. If a temperature gradient is applied across the width of such a
cantilever, inhomogeneous strain distribution leads to bending motion. We
modelled the kinetics of thermally-induced bending in the limit of a long thin
strip and the predicted time-variation of curvature agreed quantitatively with
experimental data from samples with a range of critical indices and
nematic-isotropic transition temperatures. We also deduced a value for the
thermal diffusion coefficient of the elastomer.
