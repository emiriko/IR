The ferromagnetic to nonferromagnetic (&#945;-&#946;) phase transition in
epitaxial MnAs layers on GaAs(100) is studied by x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism photoemission electron microscopy
in order to elucidate the nature of the controversial nonferromagnetic state of
&#946;-MnAs. In the coexistence region of the two phases the &#946; phase shows
a clear XMLD signal characteristic of antiferromagnetism. The nature and the
possible causes of the elusiveness of this magnetic state are discussed.
