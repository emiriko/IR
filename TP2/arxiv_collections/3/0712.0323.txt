A detailed comparison of the expressions for the decay widths obtained within
the semiclassical WKB approximation using different approaches to the tunneling
problem is performed. The differences between the available improved formulae
for tunneling near the top and the bottom of the barrier are investigated.
Though the simple WKB method gives the right order of magnitude of the decay
widths, a small number of parameters are often fitted. The need to perform the
fitting procedure remaining consistently within the WKB framework is emphasized
in the context of the fission model based calculations. Calculations for the
decay widths of some recently found super heavy nuclei using microscopic
alpha-nucleus potentials are presented to demonstrate the importance of a
consistent WKB calculation. The half-lives are found to be sensitive to the
density dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the implementation of
the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition inherent in the WKB approach.
