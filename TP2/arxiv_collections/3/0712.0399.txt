The shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of plastic deformation in
glass-forming materials is reformulated in light of recent progress in
understanding the roles played the effective disorder temperature and entropy
flow in nonequilibrium situations. A distinction between fast and slow internal
state variables reduces the theory to just two coupled equations of motion, one
describing the plastic response to applied stresses, and the other the dynamics
of the effective temperature. The analysis leading to these equations contains,
as a byproduct, a fundamental reinterpretation of the dynamic yield stress in
amorphous materials. In order to put all these concepts together in a realistic
context, the paper concludes with a reexamination of the experimentally
observed rheological behavior of a bulk metallic glass. That reexamination
serves as a test of the STZ dynamics, confirming that system parameters
obtained from steady-state properties such as the viscosity can be used to
predict transient behaviors.
