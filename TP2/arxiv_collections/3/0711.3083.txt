We derive general constraints on supersymmetric extension of axion models, in
particular paying careful attention to the cosmological effects of saxion. It
is found that for every mass range of the saxion from keV to TeV, severe
constraints on the energy density of the saxion are imposed. Together with
constraints from axino we obtain stringent upper bounds on the reheating
temperature.
