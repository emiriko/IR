It is well known that both a particle with spin and a quantum field in a
Bianchi type IX Universe are both related to the quantum mechanical top. In
this paper we will combine these insights to show that the dynamics of a cold
gas of noninteracting atoms with total momentum F=1 may be used to explore the
behavior of quantum matter near a cosmological singularity.
