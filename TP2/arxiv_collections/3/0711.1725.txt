Unexpected features of the BaBar data on e+e- in baryon-antibaryon cross
sections are discussed. These data have been collected, with unprecedented
accuracy, by means of the initial state radiation technique, which is
particularly suitable in giving good acceptance and energy resolution at
threshold. A striking feature observed in the BaBar data is the non-vanishing
cross section at threshold for all these processes. This is the expectation due
to the Coulomb enhancement factor acting on a charged fermion pair. In the case
of e+e- in proton-antiproton it is found that Coulomb final state interactions
largely dominate the cross section and the form factor is |G^p(4M^2_p)|~1,
which could be a general feature for baryons. In the case of neutral baryons an
interpretation of the non-vanishing cross section at threshold is suggested,
based on quark electromagnetic interaction and taking into account the
asymmetry between attractive and repulsive Coulomb factors. Besides strange
baryon cross sections are compared to U-spin invariance predictions.
