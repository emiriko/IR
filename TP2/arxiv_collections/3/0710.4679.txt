On-chip buses are typically designed to meet performance constraints at
worst-case conditions, including process corner, temperature, IR-drop, and
neighboring net switching pattern. This can result in significant performance
slack at more typical operating conditions. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
voltage scaling (DVS) technique for buses, based on a double sampling latch
which can detect and correct for delay errors without the need for
retransmission. The proposed approach recovers the available slack at
non-worst-case operating points through more aggressive voltage scaling and
tracks changing conditions by monitoring the error recovery rate. Voltage
margins needed in traditional designs to accommodate worst-case performance
conditions are therefore eliminated, resulting in a significant improvement in
energy efficiency. The approach was implemented for a 6mm memory read bus
operating at 1.5GHz (0.13 $\mu$m technology node) and was simulated for a
number of benchmark programs. Even at the worst-case process and environment
conditions, energy gains of up to 17% are achieved, with error recovery rates
under 2.3%. At more typical process and environment conditions, energy gains
range from 35% to 45%, with a performance degradation under 2%. An analysis of
optimum interconnect architectures for maximizing energy gains with this
approach shows that the proposed approach performs well with technology
scaling.
