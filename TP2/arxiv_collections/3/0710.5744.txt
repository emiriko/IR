Dirac hamiltonian on the Poincare disk in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm
flux and a uniform magnetic field admits a one-parameter family of self-adjoint
extensions. We determine the spectrum and calculate the resolvent for each
element of this family. Explicit expressions for Green functions are then used
to find Fredholm determinant representations for the tau function of the Dirac
operator with two branch points on the Poincare disk. Isomonodromic deformation
theory for the Dirac equation relates this tau function to a one-parameter
class of solutions of the Painleve VI equation with $\gamma=0$. We analyze long
distance behaviour of the tau function, as well as the asymptotics of the
corresponding Painleve VI transcendents as $s\to 1$. Considering the limit of
flat space, we also obtain a class of solutions of the Painleve V equation with
$\beta=0$.
