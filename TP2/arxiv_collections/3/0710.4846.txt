Recently a lot of multimedia applications are emerging on portable
appliances. They require both the flexibility of upgradeable devices
(traditionally software based) and a powerful computing engine (typically
hardware). In this context, programmable HW and dynamic reconfiguration allow
novel approaches to the migration of algorithms from SW to HW. Thus, in the
frame of the Symbad project, we propose an industrial design flow for
reconfigurable SoC's. The goal of Symbad consists of developing a system level
design platform for hardware and software SoC systems including formal and
semi-formal verification techniques.
