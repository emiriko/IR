The foundations of Wesson's induced matter theory are analyzed. It is shown
that the 5D empty bulk must be regarded rather as a Weylian space than as a
Riemannian one.The framework of a Weyl-Dirac version of Wesson's theory is
elaborated and discussed. The bulk possesses in addition to the metric tensor a
Weylian connection vector as well Dirac's gauge function; there are no sources
(mass, current) in the bulk. On the 4D brane one obtains a geometrically based
unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism with mass, currents and
equations induced by the 5D bulk
