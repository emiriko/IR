We consider a continuous time linear multi inventory system with unknown
demands bounded within ellipsoids and controls bounded within ellipsoids or
polytopes. We address the problem of "-stabilizing the inventory since this
implies some reduction of the inventory costs. The main results are certain
conditions under which "-stabilizability is possible through a saturated linear
state feedback control. All the results are based on a Linear Matrix
Inequalities (LMIs) approach and on some recent techniques for the modeling and
analysis of polytopic systems with saturations.
