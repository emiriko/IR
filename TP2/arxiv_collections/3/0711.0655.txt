We investigate the Casimir energy between two dissipative mirrors in term of
a sum over mode formula which can be interpreted by analogy to a quantum
dissipative oscillator. We also show that metamaterials engineered at scales
between the nanometer and the micron seem a promising way to achieve a
repulsive force.
