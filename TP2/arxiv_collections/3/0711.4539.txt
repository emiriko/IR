Some non-Gaussian aspects of chaotic transport are investigated for a general
class of two-dimensional area-preserving maps. Kurtosis, in particular, is
calculated from the diffusion and the Burnett coefficients, which are obtained
analytically. A characteristic time scale delimiting the onset of the Markovian
regime for the master equation is established. Some explicit examples are
discussed.
