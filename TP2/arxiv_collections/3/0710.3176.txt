An analysis is presented of wave-vector dispersion in elliptically
birefringent stratified magneto-optic media having one-dimensional periodicity.
It is found that local normal-mode polarization-state differences between
adjacent layers lead to mode coupling and impact the wave-vector dispersion and
the character of the Bloch states of the system. This coupling produces extra
terms in the dispersion relation not present in uniform circularly birefringent
magneto-optic stratified media. Normal mode coupling lifts the degeneracy at
frequency band cross-over points under certain conditions and induces a
magnetization-dependent optical band gap. This study examines the conditions
for band gap formation in the system. It shows that such a frequency-split can
be characterized by a simple coupling parameter that depends on the relation
between polarization states of local normal modes in adjacent layers. The
character of the Bloch states and conditions for maximizing the strength of the
band splitting in these systems are analyzed.
