The path integral for randomly forced incompressible fluids is shown to have
an underlying Becchi-Rouet-Stora (BRS) symmetry as a consequence of Galilean
invariance. This symmetry must be respected to have a consistent generating
functional, free from both an overall infinite factor and spurious relations
amongst correlation functions. We present a procedure for respecting this BRS
symmetry, akin to gauge fixing in quantum field theory. Relations are derived
between correlation functions of this gauge fixed, BRS symmetric theory,
analogous to the Slavnov-Taylor identities of quantum field theory.
