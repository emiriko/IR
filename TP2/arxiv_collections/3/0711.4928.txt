We present an exact solution to the $K^{-}$-proton bound state problem
formulated in the momentum space. The 1s level characteristics of the kaonic
hydrogen are computed simultaneously with the available low energy $K^{-}p$
data. In the strong interaction sector the meson-baryon interactions are
described by means of an effective (chirally motivated) separable potential and
its parameters are fitted to the experimental data.
