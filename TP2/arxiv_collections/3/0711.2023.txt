Higher-order tensor decompositions are analogous to the familiar Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), but they transcend the limitations of matrices
(second-order tensors). SVD is a powerful tool that has achieved impressive
results in information retrieval, collaborative filtering, computational
linguistics, computational vision, and other fields. However, SVD is limited to
two-dimensional arrays of data (two modes), and many potential applications
have three or more modes, which require higher-order tensor decompositions.
This paper evaluates four algorithms for higher-order tensor decomposition:
Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HO-SVD), Higher-Order Orthogonal
Iteration (HOOI), Slice Projection (SP), and Multislice Projection (MP). We
measure the time (elapsed run time), space (RAM and disk space requirements),
and fit (tensor reconstruction accuracy) of the four algorithms, under a
variety of conditions. We find that standard implementations of HO-SVD and HOOI
do not scale up to larger tensors, due to increasing RAM requirements. We
recommend HOOI for tensors that are small enough for the available RAM and MP
for larger tensors.
