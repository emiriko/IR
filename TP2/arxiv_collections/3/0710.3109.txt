The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. In
order to analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral
MSSM Higgs bosons, we combine the latest results for the CMS experimental
sensitivities based on full simulation studies with state-of-the-art
theoretical predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson properties. The experimental
analyses are done assuming an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. The
results are interpreted as 5$ \si$ discovery contours in MSSM M_A-tan_beta
benchmark scenarios. Special emphasis is put on the variation of the Higgs
mixing parameter mu. While the variation of mu can shift the prospective
discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by about Delta
tan_beta= 10, the discovery reach is rather stable with respect to the impact
of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the discovery region we analyze the
accuracy with which the masses of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons can be
determined. An accuracy of 1-4% should be achievable, depending on M_A and
tan_beta.
