Demands for implementing original OSs that can achieve high I/O performance
on PC/AT compatible hardware have recently been increasing, but conventional OS
debugging environments have not been able to simultaneously assure their
stability, be easily customized to new OSs and new I/O devices, and assure
efficient execution of I/O operations. We therefore developed a novel OS
debugging method using a lightweight virtual machine. We evaluated this
debugging method experimentally and confirmed that it can transfer data about
5.4 times as fast as the conventional virtual machine monitor.
