This paper deals with a common verification methodology and environment for
SystemC BCA and RTL models. The aim is to save effort by avoiding the same work
done twice by different people and to reuse the same environment for the two
design views. Applying this methodology the verification task starts as soon as
the functional specification is signed off and it runs in parallel to the
models and design development. The verification environment is modeled with the
aid of dedicated verification languages and it is applied to both the models.
The test suite is exactly the same and thus it's possible to verify the
alignment between the two models. In fact the final step is to check the
cycle-by-cycle match of the interface behavior. A regression tool and a bus
analyzer have been developed to help the verification and the alignment
process. The former is used to automate the testbench generation and to run the
two test suites. The latter is used to verify the alignment between the two
models comparing the waveforms obtained in each run. The quality metrics used
to validate the flow are full functional coverage and full alignment at each IP
port.
