It has been long recognized that the task of semiclassical evaluation of
quantum spectra for the classically nonintegrable systems is fundamentally more
complex than for the classically integrable ones. Below it is argued that the
quantum spectra of the chaotic systems can differ among themselves by level of
their complexity.
