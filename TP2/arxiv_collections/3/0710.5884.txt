The Quasi-Elastic (QE) contribution of the nuclear inclusive electron model
developed in Nucl. Phys. A627 543 (1997) is extended to the study of
neutrino/antineutrino Charged Current (CC) and Neutral
  Current (NC) induced nuclear reactions at intermediate energies.
  Long range nuclear (RPA) correlations, Final State Interaction (FSI) and
Coulomb corrections are included within the model. RPA correlations are shown
to play a crucial role in the whole range (100--500 MeV) of studied neutrino
energies. Results for inclusive muon capture for different nuclei through the
Periodic Table are also discussed. In addition, and by means of a Monte Carlo
cascade method to account for the rescattering of the outgoing nucleon, we also
study the CC and NC inclusive one nucleon knockout reactions off nuclei.
