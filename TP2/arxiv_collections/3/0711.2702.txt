An overview of the ab initio no-core shell model is presented. Recent results
for light nuclei obtained with the chiral two-nucleon and three-nucleon
interactions are highlighted. Cross section calculations of capture reactions
important for astrophysics are discussed. The extension of the ab initio
no-core shell model to the description of nuclear reactions by the resonating
group method technique is outlined.
