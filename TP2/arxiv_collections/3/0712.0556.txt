Problem 1.5.7 from Pitman's Saint-Flour lecture notes: Does there exist for
each n a fragmentation process (\Pi_{n,k}, 1 \leq k \leq n) taking values in
the space of partitions of {1,2,...,n} such that \Pi_{n,k} is distributed like
the partition generated by cycles of a uniform random permutation of
{1,2,...,n} conditioned to have k cycles? We show that the answer is yes. We
also give a partial extension to general exchangeable Gibbs partitions.
