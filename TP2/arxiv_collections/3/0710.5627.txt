In this paper the interfering resonances parameters determination ambiguity
is considered. It is shown that there are two solutions for two fixed width
resonances. Analytical relation between different solutions is derived. Numeric
experiments for fixed width three and four resonances, and for model
energy-dependent width two resonances confirm ambiguity of the resonances
parameters determination.
