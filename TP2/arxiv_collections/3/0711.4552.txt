We report on noise measurements in a quantum dot in the presence of Kondo
correlations. Close to the unitary limit, with the conductance reaching
1.8e2/h, we observed an average backscattered charge of e*~5e/3, while weakly
biasing the quantum dot. This result held to bias voltages up to half the Kondo
temperature. Away from the unitary limit, the charge was measured to be e as
expected. These results confirm and extend the prediction by E. Sela et al.
[1], that suggested that two-electron backscattering processes dominate over
single-electron backscattering processes near the unitary limit, with an
average backscattered charge e*~5e/3.
