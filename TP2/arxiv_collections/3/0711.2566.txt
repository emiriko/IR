The best 3-channel projectile-inelastic [H(1s)+Ps(1s,2s,2p)] close-coupling
approximation (CCA) is performed for positronium (Ps) and hydrogen (H)
collision considering both the atoms in ground states at the incident channel.
The s-wave elastic phase shifts and cross sections in the singlet and triplet
channels and the total (or integrated) cross section are studied below
inelastic threshold. Resonances in singlet channel using 2-channel and
3-channel projectile-inelastic CCAs confirm earlier prediction [1]. A resonance
in triplet channel using 3-channel projectile-inelastic CCA is a new addition.
