The relativistic amplitudes of pion photo- and electroproduction are
calculated by dispersion relations at constant t. Several sum rules and
low-energy theorems for the threshold amplitudes are investigated within this
technique. The continuation of the amplitudes to sub-threshold kinematics is
shown to provide a unique framework to derive the low-energy constants of
chiral perturbation theory by global properties of the excitation spectrum.
