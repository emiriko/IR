Estimation of the allele frequency at genetic markers is a key ingredient in
biological and biomedical research, such as studies of human genetic variation
or of the genetic etiology of heritable traits. As genetic data becomes
increasingly available, investigators face a dilemma: when should data from
other studies and population subgroups be pooled with the primary data? Pooling
additional samples will generally reduce the variance of the frequency
estimates; however, used inappropriately, pooled estimates can be severely
biased due to population stratification. Because of this potential bias, most
investigators avoid pooling, even for samples with the same ethnic background
and residing on the same continent. Here, we propose an empirical Bayes
approach for estimating allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
This procedure adaptively incorporates genotypes from related samples, so that
more similar samples have a greater influence on the estimates. In every
example we have considered, our estimator achieves a mean squared error (MSE)
that is smaller than either pooling or not, and sometimes substantially
improves over both extremes. The bias introduced is small, as is shown by a
simulation study that is carefully matched to a real data example. Our method
is particularly useful when small groups of individuals are genotyped at a
large number of markers, a situation we are likely to encounter in a
genome-wide association study.
