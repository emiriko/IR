We discuss a maximally localized Wannier function approach for constructing
lattice models from first-principles electronic structure calculations, where
the effective Coulomb interactions are calculated in the constrained
random-phase-approximation. The method is applied to the 3d transition metals
and a perovskite (SrVO_3). We also optimize the Wannier functions by unitary
transformation so that U is maximized. Such Wannier functions unexpectedly
turned out to be very close to the maximally localized ones.
