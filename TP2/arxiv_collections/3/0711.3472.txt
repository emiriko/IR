The Fermilab KTeV experiment has searched for lepton flavor violating decays
of the KL meson in three decay modes. We observe no events in the signal region
for any of the modes studied, and we set the following upper limits for their
branching ratios at the 90% CL: BR(KL--> pi0 mu e) < 7.56 x 10^(-11); BR(KL-->
pi0 pi0 mu e) < 1.64 x 10^(-10); BR(pi0 --> mu e) < 3.59 x 10^{-10).
