The frequency dependence of the dielectric loss angle for a metal-insulator
composite was shown previously to be an efficient method to experimentally
determine the percolation threshold. The statistical properties of this angle
are found here to be similar to those of the critical links (supporting the
total current) near the percolation threshold close to dc and for very high
frequencies. A further discussion is provided about the way to connect this
angle to the critical links. The second aim of these studies is to connect the
frequency dependence of this angle to the proportion of the conductor or
dielectric phase in this composite.
