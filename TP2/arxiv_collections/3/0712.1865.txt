We prove each embedded, constant mean curvature (CMC) surface in Euclidean
space with genus zero and finitely many coplanar ends is nondegenerate: there
is no nontrivial square-integrable solution to the Jacobi equation, the
linearization of the CMC condition. This implies that the moduli space of such
coplanar surfaces is a real-analytic manifold and that a neighborhood of these
in the full CMC moduli space is itself a manifold. Nondegeneracy further
implies (infinitesimal and local) rigidity in the sense that the asymptotes map
is an analytic immersion on these spaces, and also that the coplanar
classifying map is an analytic diffeomorphism.
