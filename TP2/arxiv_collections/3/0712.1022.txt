We review the salient features of $B$-meson physics, with particular emphasis
on the measurements carried out at the $B$-factories and Tevatron, theoretical
progress in understanding these measurements in the context of the standard
model, and anticipation at the LHC. Topics discussed specifically are the
current status of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, the CP-violating
phases, rare radiative and semileptonic decays, and some selected non-leptonic
two-body decays of the $B$ mesons.
