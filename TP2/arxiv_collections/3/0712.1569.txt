We construct the thermal boundary states from the type IIB Green-Schwarz
superstring in {\em pp}-wave background in the light-cone gauge. The
superstring is treated in the canonical ensemble and in the TFD formalism which
is appropriate to discuss quantum systems in the canonical quantization. The
thermal boundary states are obtained by thermalizing the total boundary states
which are the boundary states of the total system that is composed by the
superstring modes and the corresponding thermal reservoir modes. That analysis
is similar to the one in the flat spacetime case \cite{ivv12}. However, there
are some subtleties concerning the construction of the total string which are
discussed. Next, we compute the entropy of thermal boundary state which is
defined as the expectation value of the superstring entropy operator in the
thermal boundary state.
