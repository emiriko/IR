We describe an invariant of links in the three-sphere which is closely
related to Khovanov's Jones polynomial homology. Our construction replaces the
symmetric algebra appearing in Khovanov's definition with an exterior algebra.
The two invariants have the same reduction modulo 2, but differ over the
rationals. There is a reduced version which is a link invariant whose graded
Euler characteristic is the normalized Jones polynomial.
