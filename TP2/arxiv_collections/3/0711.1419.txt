Two different formulae relating the index of refraction $n$ of gases for atom
waves to the scattering amplitude have been published. We show here that these
two formulae are not consistent with the definition of the total scattering
cross-section while the formula developed by one of us (C.C.) in her thesis is
in agreement with this standard knowledge. We discuss this result, in
particular in the neutron case for which such an index was first introduced. We
finally evaluate the index of refraction as a function of well known quantities
and we discuss the order of magnitude of the ratio of $(n-1)/n_t$, where $n_t$
is the gas density.
