The nucleation of carbon caps on small nickel clusters is studied using a
tight binding model coupled to grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. It
takes place in a well defined carbon chemical potential range, when a critical
concentration of surface carbon atoms is reached. The solubility of carbon in
the outermost Ni layers, that depends on the initial, crystalline or
disordered, state of the catalyst and on the thermodynamic conditions, is
therefore a key quantity to control the nucleation.
