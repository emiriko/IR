These are notes of my lectures at the summer school "Higher-dimensional
geometry over finite fields" in Goettingen, June--July 2007.
  We present a proof of Tate's theorem on homomorphisms of abelian varieties
over finite fields (including the $\ell=p$ case) that is based on a "quaternion
trick". In fact, a a slightly stronger version of those theorems with "finite
coefficients" is proven.
