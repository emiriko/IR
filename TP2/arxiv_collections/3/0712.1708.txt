We have performed a search for Bs-->mu+mu- and Bd-->mu+mu- decays in ppbar
collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96TeV using 2fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected
by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The observed number
of Bs and Bd candidates is consistent with background expectations. The
resulting upper limits on the branching fractions are B(Bs-->mu+mu-) <
5.8X10^-8 and B(Bd-->mu+mu-) < 1.8X10^-8 at 95% C.L.
