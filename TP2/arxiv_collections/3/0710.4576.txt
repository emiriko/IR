The purpose of BRAHMS is to survey the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion (as
well as pp and d-A) collisions over a very wide range of rapidity and
transverse momentum. The sum of these data may give us a glimpse of the initial
state of the system, its transverse and longitudinal evolution and how the
nature of the system changes with time. Here I will concentrate on the origin
and dynamics of the light flavors, i.e. the creation and transport of the up,
down and strange quarks. The results presented here are certainly not the end
of the story. It is my hope that in a few years new detectors will reveal the
rapidity dependence of the charm and bottom quarks.
