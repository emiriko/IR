New varieties of quasi-one-dimensional halogen (X)-bridged transition-metal
(M) complexes, (C_8_H_6_N_4_)[Pt(C_2_H_8_N_2_)X]_2_X(ClO_4_)_3_\cdotH_2_O
(X=Br,Cl) and (C_10_H_8_N_2_)[Pt(C_4_H_13_N_3_)Br]_2_Br_4_\cdot2H_2_O,
comprising two-leg ladders of mixed-valent platinum ions, are described in
terms of a multiband extended Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The polarized
optical conductivity spectra are theoretically reproduced and the ground-state
valence distributions are reasonably determined. The latter variety, whose
interchain valence arrangement is out of phase, is reminiscent of conventional
MX single-chain compounds, while the former variety, whose interchain valence
arrangement is in phase, reveals itself as a novel d-p-\pi-hybridized multiband
ladder material.
