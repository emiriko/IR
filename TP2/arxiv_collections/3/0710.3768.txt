We present a test of the local Lorentz invariance of post-Newtonian gravity
by monitoring Earth's gravity with a Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer that
features a resolution of about 8*10^(-9)g/Hz^(1/2), the highest reported thus
far. Expressed within the standard model extension (SME) or Nordtvedt's
anisotropic universe model, the analysis limits four coefficients describing
anisotropic gravity at the ppb level and three others, for the first time, at
the 10ppm level. Using the SME we explicitly demonstrate how the experiment
actually compares the isotropy of gravity and electromagnetism.
