The main purpose of this article is to provide an alternate proof to a result
of Perelman on gradient shrinking solitons. In dimension three we also
generalize the result by removing the $\kappa$-non-collapsing assumption. In
high dimension this new method allows us to prove a classification result on
gradient shrinking solitons with vanishing Weyl curvature tensor, which
includes the rotationally symmetric ones.
