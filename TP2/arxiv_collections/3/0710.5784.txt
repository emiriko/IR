A recently reported symmetry breaking of density profiles of fluid argon
confined by two parallel solid walls of carbon dioxide is studied. The
calculations are performed in the framework of a nonlocal density functional
theory. It is shown that the existence of such asymmetrical solutions is
restricted to a special choice for the adsorption potential, where the
attraction of the solid-fluid interaction is reduced by the introduction of a
hard-wall repulsion. The behavior as a function of the slit's width is also
discussed. All the results are placed in the context of the current knowledge
on this matter.
