The on-detector optical link of the ATLAS pixel detector contains
radiation-hard receiver chips to decode bi-phase marked signals received on PIN
arrays and data transmitter chips to drive VCSEL arrays. The components are
mounted on hybrid boards (opto-boards). We present results from the irradiation
studies with 24 GeV protons up to 32 Mrad (1.2 x 10^15 p/cm^2) and the
experience from the production.
