The ALICE Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD) is a silicon strip detector
with 51,200 strips arranged in 5 rings, covering the range $-3.4 < \eta < 5.1$.
It is placed around the beam pipe at small angles to extend the charged
particle acceptance of ALICE into the forward regions, not covered by the
central barrel detectors.
