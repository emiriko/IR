A non-Hermitian P$_{\phi}$T$_{\phi}$-symmetrized spherically-separable Dirac
Hamiltonian is considered. It is observed that the descendant Hamiltonians
H$_{r}$, H$_{\theta}$, and H$_{\phi}$ play essential roles and offer some
user-feriendly options as to which one (or ones) of them is (or are)
non-Hermitian. Considering a P$_{\phi}$T$_{\phi}$-symmetrized H$_{\phi}$, we
have shown that the conventional relativistic energy eigenvalues are
recoverable. We have also witnessed an unavoidable change in the azimuthal part
of the general wavefunction. Moreover, setting a possible interaction
$V(\theta)$=0 in the descendant Hamiltonian H$_{\theta}$ would manifest a
change in the angular $\theta$-dependent part of the general solution too.
Whilst some P$_{\phi}$T$_{\phi}$-symmetrized H$_{\phi}$ Hamiltonians are
considered, a recipe to keep the regular magnetic quantum number m, as defined
in the regular traditional Hermitian settings, is suggested. Hamiltonians
possess properties similar to the PT-symmetric ones (here the non-Hermitian
