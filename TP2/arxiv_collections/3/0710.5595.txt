An overview and status report of the new trapping facility for highly charged
ions at the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung is presented. The
construction of this facility started in 2005 and is expected to be completed
in 2008. Once operational, highly charged ions will be loaded from the
experimental storage ring ESR into the HITRAP facility, where they are
decelerated and cooled. The kinetic energy of the initially fast ions is
reduced by more than fourteen orders of magnitude and their thermal energy is
cooled to cryogenic temperatures. The cold ions are then delivered to a broad
range of atomic physics experiments.
