A sketch of a recent approach to quantum gravity is presented which involves
several unconventional aspects. The basic ingredients include: (1) Affine
kinematical variables; (2) Affine coherent states; (3) Projection operator
approach for quantum constraints; (4) Continuous-time regularized functional
integral representation without/with constraints; and (5) Hard core picture of
nonrenormalizability. Emphasis is given to the functional integral expressions.
