NEMO 3 is a double beta decay experiment. A part of low background data was
analysed, preliminary result on bb2nu decay of 130Te obtained: T_{1/2} = 7.6
\+- 1.5(stat) +- 0.8(syst) * 10^{20} y$. No bb0nu signal was observed:
T_{1/2}^{0\nu}(100Mo) > 5.8 *10^{23} y and T_{1/2}^{0\nu}(82Se) > 2.1 * 10^{23}
y (90% C.L.). SuperNEMO project R&D has started.
