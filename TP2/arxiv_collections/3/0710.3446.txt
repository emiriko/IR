Following the approach outlined in [18], convergence to SLE6 of the
Exploration Processes for the correlated bond-triangular type models studied in
[7] is established. This puts the said models in the same universality class as
the standard site percolation model on the triangular lattice [19]. The result
is proven for all domains with boundary (upper) Minkowski dimension less than
two. Moreover, the proof of convergence applies in the general context of
critical 2D percolation models, under the stipulation that Cardy's Formula can
be established.
