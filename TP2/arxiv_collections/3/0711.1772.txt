We report on experiments studying transport properties of an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice of spatial period $\lambda/2n$,
where $n$ is an integer, realized with the dispersion of multiphoton Raman
transitions. We observe Bloch oscillations, as a clear effect of quantum
transport, in the sub-wavelength scale periodicity lattice. The unusually
strong localisation of atoms is evident from the measured effective mass.
Future prospects of the novel lattice structures are expected in the search for
new quantum phases in tailored lattice structures up to quantum computing in
optical nanopotentials.
