We calculate the Hall conductivity for a spin-triplet superconductor, using a
generalized pairing symmetry dependent on an arbitrary phase, $\vphi$. A
promising candidate for such an order parameter is Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, whose
superconducting order parameter symmetry is still subject to investigation. The
value of this phase can be determined through Kerr rotation and DC Hall
conductivity measurements. Our calculations impose significant constraints on
$\vphi$.
