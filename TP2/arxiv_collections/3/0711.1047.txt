The effects of parity and time reversal violating potential, in particular
the tensor-pseudotensor electron nucleus interaction are studied. We establish
that selected terms representing the interplay of these effects and the
residual Coulomb interaction in the coupled-cluster method are equivalent to
the coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock. We have shown that the {\em normal} CPHF
diagrams have a one-one correspondance in the coupled-cluster theory, but the
CPHF pseudo diagrams are present in a subtle way. We have studied the {\em
pseudo} diagrams in great detail and have shown explicitly their origin in
coupled-cluster theory. This is demonstrated by considering the case of the
permanent electric dipole moment of atomic Hg and our results are compared with
the results of an earlier calculation.
