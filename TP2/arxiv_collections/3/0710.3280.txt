We use the generalized entropy four-current of the Muller-Israel-Stewart
(MIS) theory of relativistic dissipative fluids to obtain information about
fluctuations around equilibrium. This allows one to compute the non-classical
coefficients of the entropy 4-flux in terms of the equilibrium distribution
functions. The Green-Kubo formulae are used to compute the classical or
standard transport coefficients from the fluctuations of entropy due to
dissipative fluxes.
