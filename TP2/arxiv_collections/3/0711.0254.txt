At first, we state some results in arXiv: 0707.2639, and then, using a
positive kinetic energy coordinate condition given by arXiv: 0707.2639, we
present an action with positive kinetic energy term for general relativity.
Based on this action, the corresponding theory of canonical quantization is
discussed.
