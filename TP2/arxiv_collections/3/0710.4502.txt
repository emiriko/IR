In this paper the effect of the chemical pressure induced by the Sr
replacement for Ca in the La1.4Sr1.6Mn2O7 lattice is directly probed by means
of neutron diffraction as a function of temperature. The results show a
progressive change of the magnetic coupling from ferromagnetic to
antiferromagnetic by increasing the Ca content,. indicating that the orbital
order of the Mn ions is affected in the same way by the application of an
external pressure and by the chemical pressure.
