Using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we have measured carrier
relaxation times in epitaxial graphene layers grown on SiC wafers. We find two
distinct time scales associated with the relaxation of nonequilibrium
photogenerated carriers. An initial fast relaxation transient in the 70-120 fs
range is followed by a slower relaxation process in the 0.4-1.7 ps range. The
slower relaxation time is found to be inversely proportional to the degree of
crystalline disorder in the graphene layers as measured by Raman spectroscopy.
We relate the measured fast and slow time constants to carrier-carrier and
carrier-phonon intraband and interband scattering processes in graphene.
