This is the second one in our series of papers on indirect quantum control
assisted by quantum accessor. In this paper we propose and study a new class of
indirect quantum control(IDQC) scheme based on the initial states preparation
of the accessor. In the present scheme, after the initial state of the accessor
is properly prepared, the system is controlled by repeatedly switching on and
off the interaction between the system and the accessor. This is different from
the protocol of our first paper, where we manipulate the interaction between
the controlled system and the accessor. We prove the controllability of the
controlled system for the proposed indirect control scheme. Furthermore, we
give an example with two coupled spins qubits to illustrate the scheme, the
concrete control process and the controllability.
