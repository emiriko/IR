We extend the formalism of the thermodynamic two-time Green's functions to
nonextensive quantum statistical mechanics. Working in the optimal Lagrangian
multipliers representation, the $q$-spectral properties and the methods for a
direct calculation of the two-time $q$% -Green's functions and the related
$q$-spectral density ($q$ measures the nonextensivity degree) for two generic
operators are presented in strict analogy with the extensive ($q=1$)
counterpart. Some emphasis is devoted to the nonextensive version of the less
known spectral density method whose effectiveness in exploring equilibrium and
transport properties of a wide variety of systems has been well established in
conventional classical and quantum many-body physics. To check how both the
equations of motion and the spectral density methods work to study the
$q$-induced nonextensivity effects in nontrivial many-body problems, we focus
on the equilibrium properties of a second-quantized model for a high-density
Bose gas with strong attraction between particles for which exact results exist
in extensive conditions. Remarkably, the contributions to several thermodynamic
quantities of the $q$-induced nonextensivity close to the extensive regime are
explicitly calculated in the low-temperature regime by overcoming the
calculation of the $q$ grand-partition function.
