A free electron description of spin-dependent tranport in magnetic tunnel
junctions with non collinear magnetizations is presented. We investigate the
origin of transverse spin density in tunnelling transport and the quantum
interferences which give rise to oscillatory torques on the local
magnetization. Spin transfer torque is also analyzed and an important bias
asymmetry is found as well as a damped oscillatory behaviour. Furthermore, we
investigate the influence of the s-d exchange coupling on torque in particular
in the case of half-metallic MTJ in which the spin transfer torque is due to
interfacial spin-dependent reflections.
