We report through 17O NMR, an unambiguous local determination of the
intrinsic kagome lattice spin susceptibility as well as that created around
non-magnetic defects issued from natural Zn/ Cu exchange in the S=1/2 (Cu2+)
herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 compound. The issue of a singlet-triplet gap is
addressed. The magnetic response around a defect is found to markedly differ
from that observed in non-frustrated antiferromagnetic materials. Finally, we
discuss our relaxation measurements in the light of Cu and Cl NMR data
[cond-mat 070314] and suggest a flat q-dependence of the excitations.
