We argue that fragmentation at hadronisation is likely scenario in
ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. In case of crossover phase transition it
is driven by a singularity of the bulk viscosity. We claim that such a scenario
can explain the ``HBT puzzle'' and can be identified by non-statistical
differences between event-wise rapidity distributions and by proton-proton
rapidity correlations.
