Shi and Tsai (JRSSB, 2002) proposed an interesting residual information
criterion (RIC) for model selection in regression. Their RIC was motivated by
the principle of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the
residual likelihoods of the true and candidate model. We show, however, under
this principle, RIC would always choose the full (saturated) model. The
residual likelihood therefore, is not appropriate as a discrepancy measure in
defining information criterion. We explain why it is so and provide a corrected
residual information criterion as a remedy.
