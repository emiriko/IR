Parity-conserving single-spin asymmetries provide a specific measure of
coherent spin-orbit dynamics in quantum chromodynamics. The origin of these
effects can be traced to the interplay of chiral dynamics and confinement in
the theory. The most elegant display of the relevant mechanisms occurs in the
Collins functions and the polarizing fragmentation functions and fracture
functions for particles with spin. In the nucleon, these same dynamical
mechanisms generate virtual quantum structures leading to the Boer-Mulders
functions and orbital distributions. Two complementary formalisms for these
distributions appear. The familiar gauge-link formalism incorporates oll
nonperturbative dynamics into nonlocal correlators. The constructive formalism
introduced by the author describes distributions normalized to an intrinsic
property of the nucleon, namely, the currents specified in the
Bakker-Leader-Trueman sum rule. The connection between these two approaches can
be explored in the process dependence of single-spin asymmetries in various
hard-scattering processes. The study of the SU(2) Weyl-Dirac equation in
spherical coordinates allows typical Wilson operators that determine this
process dependence to be evaluated in the coordinate gauge.
