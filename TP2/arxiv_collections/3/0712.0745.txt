The reflection of neutrons from a helium surface has been observed for the
first time. The 4He surface is smoother in the superfluid state at 1.54 K than
in the case of the normal liquid at 2.3 K. In the superfluid state we also
observe a surface layer ~200 Angstroms thick which has a subtly different
neutron scattering cross-section, which may be explained by an enhanced
Bose-Einstein condensate fraction close to the helium surface.
