With an increase in the application of ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic
pulses in the communications industry, radar, biotechnology and medicine, comes
an interest in UWB exposure safety standards. Despite an increase of the
scientific research on bioeffects of exposure to non-ionizing UWB pulses,
characterization of those effects is far from complete. A numerical
computational approach, such as a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method,
is required to visualize and understand the complexity of broadband
electromagnetic interactions. The FDTD method has almost no limits in the
description of the geometrical and dispersive properties of the simulated
material, it is numerically robust and appropriate for current computer
technology. In this paper, a complete calculation of exposure of the human eye
to UWB electromagnetic pulses in the frequency range of 3.1-10.6, 22-29, and
57-64 GHz is performed. Computation in this frequency range required a
geometrical resolution of the eye of $\rm 0.1 \: mm$ and an arbitrary precision
in the description of its dielectric properties in terms of the Debye model.
New results show that the interaction of UWB pulses with the eye tissues
exhibits the same properties as the interaction of the continuous
electromagnetic waves (CW) with the frequencies from the pulse's frequency
spectrum. It is also shown that under the same exposure conditions the exposure
to UWB pulses is from one to many orders of magnitude safer than the exposure
to CW.
