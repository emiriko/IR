The physics program at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
includes a strong effort to measure form factors and structure functions to
probe the structure of hadronic matter, reveal the nature of confinement, and
develop an understanding of atomic nuclei using quark-gluon degrees of freedom.
The CLAS detector is a large acceptance device occupying one of the end
stations. We discuss here two programs that use CLAS; measuring the magnetic
form factor of the neutron and the virtual photon asymmetry of the proton. The
form factor has been measured with unprecedented kinematic coverage and
precision up to Q2=4.7 GeV2 and is consistent within 5%-10% of the dipole
parameterization. The proton virtual photon asymmetry has been measured across
a wide range in Bjorken x. The data exceed the SU(6)-symmetric quark prediction
and show evidence of a smooth approach to the scaling limit prescribed by
perturbative QCD.
