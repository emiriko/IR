This article begins the study of irreducible maps involving
finite-dimensional uniserial modules over finite-dimensional associative
algebras. We work on the classification of irreducible maps between two
uniserials over triangular algebras, and give estimates for the number of
middle terms of an almost split sequence with a uniserial end term.
