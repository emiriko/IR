We present an inexpensive apparatus for measuring the speed of sound, with a
time of flight method, using a computer with a stereo sound board. Students
measure the speed of sound by timing the delay between the arrivals of a pulse
to two microphones placed at different distances from the source. It can serve
as a very effective demonstration, providing a quick measurement of the speed
of sound in air; we have used it with great success in Open Days in our
Department. It can also be used for a full fledged laboratory determination of
the speed of sound in air.
