Within the framework of the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables
formalism, we study the connection between scale symmetry breaking and
confinement in three-dimensional gluodynamics. We explicitly show that the
static potential profile contains a linear potential, leading to the
confinement of static charges. Also, we establish a new type of equivalence
among different three-dimensional effective theories.
