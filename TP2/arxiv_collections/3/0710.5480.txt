We analyze conformal field theory 4-point functions of the form A ~ O_1(x_1)
O_2(x_2) O_1(x_3) O_2(x_4), where the operators O_i are scalar primaries. We
show that, in the Lorentzian regime, the limit x_1 -> x_3 is dominated by the
exchange of conformal partial waves of highest spin. When partial waves of
arbitrary spin contribute to A, the behavior of the Lorentzian amplitude for
x_1 -> x_3 must be analyzed using complex-spin techniques, leading to a
generalized Regge theory for CFT's. Whenever the CFT is dual to a string
theory, the string tree-level contribution A_tree to the amplitude A presents a
Regge pole corresponding the a gravi-reggeon exchange. In this case, we apply
the impact parameter representation for CFT amplitudes, previously developed,
to analyze multiple reggeon exchanges in the eikonal limit. As an example, we
apply these general techniques to N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in d=4 in the
limit of large 't Hooft coupling, including the leading string corrections to
pure graviton exchange.
