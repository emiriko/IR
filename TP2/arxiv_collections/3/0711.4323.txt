Periodic quantum oscillations of a rectified dc voltage Vdc(B) vs the
perpendicular magnetic field B were measured near the critical temperature Tc
in a single superconducting aluminum almost symmetric ring (without specially
created circular asymmetry) biased by alternating current with a zero dc
component. With varying bias current and temperature, these Vdc(B) oscillations
behave like the Vdc(B) oscillations observed in a circular-asymmetric ring but
are of smaller amplitude. The Fourier spectra of the Vdc(B) functions exhibit a
fundamental frequency, corresponding to the ring area, and its higher
harmonics. Unexpectedly, satellite frequencies depending on the structure
geometry and external parameters were found next to the fundamental frequency
and around its higher harmonics.
