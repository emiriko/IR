Recent experimental results indicate the possible realization of a bulk
odd-frequency superconducting state in the compounds CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, and
CeRhIn$_5$. Motivated by this, we present a study of the quantum transport
properties of a normal metal/odd-frequency superconductor junctions in a search
for probes to unveil the odd-frequency symmetry. From the Eliashberg equations,
we perform a quasiclassical approximation to account for the transport
formalism of an odd-frequency superconductor with the Keldysh formalism.
Specifically, we consider the tunneling charge conductance and tunneling
thermal conductance. We find qualitatively distinct behaviour in the
odd-frequency case as compared to the conventional even-frequency case, in both
the electrical and thermal current. This serves as a useful tool to identify
the possible existence of a bulk odd-frequency superconducting state.
