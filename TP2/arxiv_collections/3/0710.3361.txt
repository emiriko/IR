The final oscillation analysis of the complete set of data collected by
CHORUS in the years 1994--1997 is presented. Reconstruction algorithms of data
extracted by electronic detectors were improved and the data recorded in the
emulsion target were analysed by new automated scanning systems, allowing the
use of a new method for event reconstruction in emulsion. CHORUS has applied
these new techniques to the sample of 1996--1997 events for which no muons were
observed in the electronic detectors. Combining the new sample with the data
analysed in previous papers, the overall sensitivity of the experiment to the
$\nu_\tau$ appearance is thus improved. In a two-neutrino mixing scheme, a 90%
C.L. upper limit of $\sin^2 2\theta_{\mu\tau} < 4.4 \times 10^{-4}$ is set for
large $\Delta m^2$, improving by a factor 1.5 the previously published CHORUS
result.
