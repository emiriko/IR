We report a comprehensive THz, infrared and optical study of Nb doped SrTiO3
as well as DC conductivity and Hall effect measurements. Our THz spectra at 7K
show the presence of a very narrow (<2 meV) Drude peak, the spectral weight of
which shows approximately a factor of three enhancement of the band mass for
all carrier concentrations. The missing spectral weight is regained in a broad
'mid-infrared' band which originates from electron-phonon coupling. We find no
evidence of a particularly large electron-phonon coupling that would result in
small polaron formation. Analysis of the results yields an electron-phonon
coupling parameter of an intermediate strength, $\alpha \approx 4$.
