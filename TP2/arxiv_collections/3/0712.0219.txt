In this paper, we provide a simplified stellar structure model for ideal
gases, in which the particles are only driven by gravity. According to the
model, the structural information of the star can be roughly solved by the
total mass and radius of a star. To get more accurate results, the model should
be modified by introducing other interaction among particles and rotation of
the star.
