Time-odd densities and their effect on electric giant resonances are
investigated within the self-consistent separable random-phase-approximation
(SRPA) model for various Skyrme forces (SkT6, SkO, SkM*, SIII, SGII, SLy4,
SLy6, SkI3). Time-odd densities restore Galilean invariance of the Skyrme
functional, violated by the effective-mass and spin-orbital terms. In even-even
nuclei these densities do not contribute to the ground state but can affect the
dynamics. As a particular case, we explore the role of the current density in
description of isovector E1 and isoscalar E2 giant resonances in a chain of Nd
spherical and deformed isotopes with A=134-158. Relation of the current to the
effective masses and relevant parameters of the Skyrme functional is analyzed.
It is shown that current contribution to E1 and E2 resonances is generally
essential and fully determined by the values and signs of the isovector and
isoscalar effective-mass parameters of the force. The contribution is the same
for all the isotope chain, i.e. for both standard and exotic nuclei.
