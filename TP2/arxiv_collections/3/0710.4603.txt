In this paper we show that the homology of a certain natural compactification
of the moduli space, introduced by Kontsevich in his study of Witten's
conjectures, can be described completely algebraically as the homology of a
certain differential graded Lie algebra. This two-parameter family is
constructed by using a Lie cobracket on the space of noncommutative 0-forms, a
structure which corresponds to pinching simple closed curves on a Riemann
surface, to deform the noncommutative symplectic geometry described by
Kontsevich in his subsequent papers.
