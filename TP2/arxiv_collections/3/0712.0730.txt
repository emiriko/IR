Reduction is shown to be a possible consequence of the basic principles of
quantum mechanics, involving no branching of the quantum state of the universe.
The key feature of a measurement is attributed to the creation of macroscopic
germs of ionized tracks, bubbles, sparks and so on, in a superposed quantum
state, the main mechanism being a breaking and a restoration of
``classicality'' in nearby macroscopic objects and their small patterns. A new
significance of quantum probabilities, involving no absolute randomness, is
also proposed.
