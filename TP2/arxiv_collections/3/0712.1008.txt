We develop a quantum algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization problems
through quantum simulation of a classical annealing process. Our algorithm
combines techniques from quantum walks, quantum phase estimation, and quantum
Zeno effect. It can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the discrete-time Markov
chain Monte Carlo implementation of classical simulated annealing. Our
implementation scales with the inverse of the square root of the minimum
spectral gap of the stochastic matrix used in the classical simulation. The
quantum algorithm outperforms the classical one, which scales with the inverse
of the gap.
