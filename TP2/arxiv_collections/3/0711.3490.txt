We generalize the natural duality of graphs embedded into a surface to a
duality with respect to a subset of edges. The dual graph might be embedded
into a different surface. We prove a relation between the signed
Bollobas-Riordan polynomials of dual graphs. This relation unifies various
recent results expressing the Jones polynomial of links as specializations of
the Bollobas-Riordan polynomials.
