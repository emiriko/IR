A quantum critical point is approached by applying pressure in a number of
magnetic metals. The observed dependence of Tc on pressure necessarily means
that the magnetic energy is coupled to the lattice. A first order phase
transition occurs if this coupling exceeds a critical value: this is inevitable
if diverges as Tc approaches zero. It is argued that this is the cause of the
first order transition that is observed in many systems. Using Landau theory we
obtain expressions for the boundaries of the region where phase separation
occurs that agree well with experiments done on MnSi and other materials. The
theory can be used to obtain very approximate values for the temperature and
pressure at the tricritical point in terms of quantities measured at ambient
pressure and the measured values of along the second order line. The values of
the tricritical temperature for various materials obtained from Landau theory
are too low but it is shown that the predicted values will rise if the effects
of fluctuations are included.
