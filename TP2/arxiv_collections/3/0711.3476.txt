We study the transfer of color between a heavy quark pair and an unpaired
heavy quark or antiquark moving at a nonrelativistic velocity with respect to
the pair. We find that the open heavy quark or antiquark can catalyze the
transformation of the pair from octet representation at short distances to
singlet at long distances. This process is infrared sensitive in general, and
we exhibit double poles in dimensional regularization at
next-to-next-to-leading order in the transition probability. Because of their
dependence on kinematic variables, these poles cannot be matched to the
non-perturbative matrix elements of effective field theories based on a single
heavy quark pair.
