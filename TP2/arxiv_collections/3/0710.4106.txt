A new class of risk measures called cash sub-additive risk measures is
introduced to assess the risk of future financial, nonfinancial and insurance
positions. The debated cash additive axiom is relaxed into the cash sub
additive axiom to preserve the original difference between the numeraire of the
current reserve amounts and future positions. Consequently, cash sub-additive
risk measures can model stochastic and/or ambiguous interest rates or
defaultable contingent claims. Practical examples are presented and in such
contexts cash additive risk measures cannot be used. Several representations of
the cash sub-additive risk measures are provided. The new risk measures are
characterized by penalty functions defined on a set of sub-linear probability
measures and can be represented using penalty functions associated with cash
additive risk measures defined on some extended spaces. The issue of the
optimal risk transfer is studied in the new framework using inf-convolution
techniques. Examples of dynamic cash sub-additive risk measures are provided
via BSDEs where the generator can locally depend on the level of the cash
sub-additive risk measure.
