Calorimeter-assisted track finding algorithm takes advantage of the finely
segmented electromagnetic calorimeter proposed for the SiD detector concept by
looking for "MIP stubs" produced by charged particles in the calorimeter, and
using them as seeds for pattern recognition in the tracker. The algorithm
allows for efficient reconstruction of tracks that cannot be found using seeds
provided by the vertex detector, even if standalone pattern recognition in the
outer tracker is difficult. The algorithm has been implemented as a package in
the org.lcsim framework. Current status of the package and its performance in
non-prompt tracks reconstruction are described.
