A multitude of measures have been proposed to quantify the similarity between
protein 3-D structure. Among these measures, contact map overlap (CMO)
maximization deserved sustained attention during past decade because it offers
a fine estimation of the natural homology relation between proteins. Despite
this large involvement of the bioinformatics and computer science community,
the performance of known algorithms remains modest. Due to the complexity of
the problem, they got stuck on relatively small instances and are not
applicable for large scale comparison. This paper offers a clear improvement
over past methods in this respect. We present a new integer programming model
for CMO and propose an exact B &B algorithm with bounds computed by solving
Lagrangian relaxation. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a
popular small benchmark (Skolnick set, 40 domains). On this set our algorithm
significantly outperforms the best existing exact algorithms, and yet provides
lower and upper bounds of better quality. Some hard CMO instances have been
solved for the first time and within reasonable time limits. From the values of
the running time and the relative gap (relative difference between upper and
lower bounds), we obtained the right classification for this test. These
encouraging result led us to design a harder benchmark to better assess the
classification capability of our approach. We constructed a large scale set of
300 protein domains (a subset of ASTRAL database) that we have called Proteus
300. Using the relative gap of any of the 44850 couples as a similarity
measure, we obtained a classification in very good agreement with SCOP. Our
algorithm provides thus a powerful classification tool for large structure
databases.
