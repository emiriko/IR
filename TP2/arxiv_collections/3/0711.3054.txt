Generalizing the work of Farahat-Higman on symmetric groups, we describe the
structures of the even centers Z_n of integral spin symmetric group
superalgebras, which lead to universal algebras termed as the spin FH-algebras.
A connection between the odd Jucys-Murphy elements and the Catalan numbers is
developed and then used to determine the algebra generators of the spin
FH-algebras and of the even centers Z_n.
