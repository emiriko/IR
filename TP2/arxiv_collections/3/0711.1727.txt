We study the dynamics of mapping class groups on 2-dimensional character
varieties. We shall show that the dynamics of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes
resembles in many ways the dynamics of H\'enon mappings, and then apply this
idea to answer open questions concerning the geometry of discrete and faithful
representations, Painlev\'e sixth equation, and discrete Schroedinger
operators.
