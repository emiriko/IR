We investigate upper and lower bounds on the entropy of entanglement of a
superposition of bipartite states as a function of the individual states in the
superposition. In particular, we extend the results in [G. Gour,
arxiv.org:0704.1521 (2007)] to superpositions of several states rather than
just two. We then investigate the entanglement in a subspace as a function of
its basis states: we find upper bounds for the largest entanglement in a
subspace and demonstrate that no such lower bound for the smallest entanglement
exists. Finally, we consider entanglement of superpositions using measures of
entanglement other than the entropy of entanglement.
