Can the Large Hadron Collider explain the masses and mixings of the known
fermions? A promising possibility is that these masses and mixings are
determined by flavor symmetries that also govern new particles that will appear
at the LHC. We consider well-motivated examples in supersymmetry with both
gravity- and gauge-mediation. Contrary to spreading belief, new physics need
not be minimally flavor violating. We build non-minimally flavor violating
models that successfully explain all known lepton masses and mixings, but span
a wide range in their predictions for slepton flavor violation. In natural and
favorable cases, these models have metastable sleptons and are characterized by
fully reconstructible events. We outline many flavor measurements that are then
possible and describe their prospects for resolving both the standard model and
new physics flavor puzzles at the Large Hadron Collider.
