We study the effect of electron-electron interactions on the transport in an
inhomogeneous quantum wire. We show that contrary to the well-known Luttinger
liquid result, non-uniform interactions contribute substantially to the
resistance of the wire. In the regime of weakly interacting electrons and
moderately low temperatures we find a linear in T resistivity induced by the
interactions. We then use the bosonization technique to generalize this result
to the case of arbitrarily strong interactions.
