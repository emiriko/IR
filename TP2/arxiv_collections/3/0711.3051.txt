This paper is devoted to establish sufficient conditions under which a
transcendental meromorphic function has no unbounded Fatou components and to
extend some results for entire functions to meromorphic functions. Actually, we
shall mainly discuss non-existence of unbounded wandering domains of a
meromorphic function. The case for a composition of finitely many meromorphic
function with at least one of them being transcendental can be also
investigated in the argument of this paper.
