The Quantum Cosmology can be understand as the theory of an one object that
is the Universe described in terms of fundamental mass groundstate of the free
boson string, that is a tachyon - a hypothetical particle with negative mass
square, which has linear velocity more than the velocity of light c. From this
fact it is clear that whole information about physics of our Universe is
focused on studying of this untypical particle physics. In this paper this
point of view is touched up on. As the general-relativistic model of our
Universe we study the Einstein-Friedmann Spacetime. Firstly, the way of
canonical quantization beginning from first quantization of the Dirac
Hamiltonian constraints up to the second quantization by the Von
Neumann-Araki-Woods quantization in the Fock space is briefly discussed. We
show that using of the Bogoliubov-Heinsenberg static operator basis leads to
formulation of the second quantization of the considered free boson string in
terms of the monodromy in the Fock space. Finally, we propose some specific
model of the Universe - the extremal tachyon mass model, and in frames of its
the Hubble evolution parameter, the equation of state for Dark Matter in the
Universe, and the temperature of our Universe are concluded.
