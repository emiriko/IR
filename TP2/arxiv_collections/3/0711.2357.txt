The faithful exchange of quantum information will soon become one of the
challenges of the emerging quantum information technology. One of the possible
solutions is to transfer a superposition through a chain of properly coupled
spins. Such a system is called a quantum wire. We discuss the transfer in a
quantum wire \cite{christ,niko1,niko2}, when the process of thermalization of
the state takes place together with the free evolution. We investigate which
encoding scheme is more faithful in certain thermal conditions.
