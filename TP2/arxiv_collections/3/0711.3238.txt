We study inelastic processes for ultracold three-body systems in which only
one interaction is resonant. We have found that the decay rates for weakly
bound molecules due to collisions with other atoms can be suppressed not only
without fermionic statistics but also when bosonic statistics applies. In
addition, we show that at ultracold temperatures three-body recombination
involving a single resonant pair of atoms leads mainly to formation of weakly
bound molecules which, in turn, are stable against decay. These results
indicate that recombination in three-component atomic gases can be used as an
efficient mechanism for molecular formation, allowing the achievement of high
molecular densities.
