Thomas Schelling proposed an influential simple spatial model to illustrate
how, even with relatively mild assumptions on each individual's nearest
neighbor preferences, an integrated city would likely unravel to a segregated
city, even if all individuals prefer integration. Aggregation relates to
individuals coming together to form groups and global aggregation corresponds
to segregation. Many authors assumed that the segregation which Schelling
observed in simulations on very small cities persists for larger, realistic
size cities. We devise new measures to quantify the segregation and unlock its
dependence on city size, disparate neighbor comfortability threshold, and
population density. We identify distinct scales of global aggregation, and show
that the striking global aggregation Schelling observed is strictly a small
city phenomenon. We also discover several scaling laws for the aggregation
measures.
