In his fresh "Comment" (arXiv:0711.0137v1), A. Mostafazadeh reacts on my very
recent letter (arXiv:0710.5653v1) where I tried to clarify certain
misunderstandings which occurred in A. M., Phys. Lett. B \textbf{650}, 208
(2007) [arXiv:0706.1872v2, "Paper"]. As long as the "Comment" offers a new
support of the original assertions made in the "Paper", I feel obliged to
re-clarify the matter by extending my argumentation. I insist that it is
possible to escape the main conclusion of the "Paper", indeed. In particular, I
point out a gap in the new calculations in "Comment", add a few remarks on the
notation and reconfirm that the unitarity of the time-evolution DOES NOT
require the time-independence of the metric operator.
