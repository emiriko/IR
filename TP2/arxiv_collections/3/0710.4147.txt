We calculate cosmological and astrophysical bounds on the couplings between
standard model fields and tensor unparticles. The present day density of tensor
unparticles from neutrino-neutrino and photon-photon annihilation is
calculated. Also, the supernovae volume energy loss rates from
electron-positron and photon-photon annihilation to tensor unparticles are
calculated. The constraints from matter density and supernovae volume energy
loss rates from photon-photon annihilation are on the same order of magnitude,
while the bounds from supernovae volume energy loss rates from
electron-positron annihilation are an order of magnitude lower. We find the
couplings between standard model fields and tensor unparticles are at least an
order of magnitude lower than those used for previous studies of tensor
unparticle collider phenomenology.
