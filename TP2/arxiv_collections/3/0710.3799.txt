We summarize the physics case of a high-luminosity e+e- flavour factory
collecting an integrated luminosity of 50-75 ab^(-1). Many New Physics
sensitive measurements involving B and D mesons and tau leptons, unique to a
Super Flavour Factory, can be performed with excellent sensitivity to new
particles with masses up to ~100 (or even ~1000 TeV). Flavour- and CP-violating
couplings of new particles that may be discovered at the LHC can be measured in
most scenarios, even in unfavourable cases assuming minimal flavour violation.
Together with the LHC, a Super Flavour Factory, following either the SuperKEKB
or the SuperB proposal, could be soon starting the project of reconstructing
the New Physics Lagrangian.
