We investigate the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and chemical
potential mismatch for an asymmetric fermion superfluid with double- and
single-species pairings. There is no mixing of these two types of pairings at
fixed chemical potential, but the introduction of the single species pairing
cures the magnetic instability at low temperature.
