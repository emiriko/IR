We show how computational symbolic packages such as FeynArts and FormCalc can
be adopted for the evaluation of one-loop hadronic electroweak radiative
corrections for electron-nucleon scattering and applied to calculations of the
nucleon weak charge. Several numerical results are listed, and found to be in
good agreement with the current experimental data.
