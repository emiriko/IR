Making use of the finite rank separable approach for the quasiparticle random
phase approximation enables one to perform nuclear structure calculations in
very large two-quasiparticle spaces. The approach is extended to take into
account the residual particle-particle interaction. The calculations are
performed by using Skyrme interactions in the particle-hole channel and
density-dependent zero-range interactions in the particle-particle channel. To
illustrate our approach, we study the properties of the lowest quadrupole
states in the even-even nuclei $^{128}$Pd, $^{130}$Cd, $^{124-134}$Sn,
$^{128-136}$Te and $^{136}$Xe.
