We relate the intermittent fluctuations of velocity gradients in turbulence
to a whole range of local dissipation scales generalizing the picture of a
single mean dissipation length. The statistical distribution of these local
dissipation scales as a function of Reynolds number is determined in numerical
simulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence with a spectral
resolution never applied before which exceeds the standard one by at least a
factor of eight. The core of the scale distribution agrees well with a
theoretical prediction. Increasing Reynolds number causes the generation of
ever finer local dissipation scales. This is in line with a less steep decay of
the large-wavenumber energy spectra in the dissipation range. The energy
spectrum for the highest accessible Taylor microscale Reynolds number
R_lambda=107 does not show a bottleneck.
