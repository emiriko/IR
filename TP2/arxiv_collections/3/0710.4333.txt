I report on our construction and analysis of the effective low energy
Lagrangian for the Minimal Walking Technicolor (MWT) model. The parameters of
the effective Lagrangian are constrained by imposing modified Weinberg sum
rules and by imposing a value for the S parameter estimated from the underlying
Technicolor theory. The constrained effective Lagrangian allows for an inverted
vector vs. axial-vector mass spectrum in a large part of the parameter space.
