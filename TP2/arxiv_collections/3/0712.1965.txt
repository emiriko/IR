The bound-state solutions and the su(1,1) description of the $d$-dimensional
radial harmonic oscillator, the Morse and the $D$-dimensional radial Coulomb
Schr\"odinger equations are reviewed in a unified way using the point canonical
transformation method. It is established that the spectrum generating su(1,1)
algebra for the first problem is converted into a potential algebra for the
remaining two. This analysis is then extended to Schr\"odinger equations
containing some position-dependent mass. The deformed su(1,1) construction
recently achieved for a $d$-dimensional radial harmonic oscillator is easily
extended to the Morse and Coulomb potentials. In the last two cases, the
equivalence between the resulting deformed su(1,1) potential algebra approach
and a previous deformed shape invariance one generalizes to a
position-dependent mass background a well-known relationship in the context of
constant mass.
