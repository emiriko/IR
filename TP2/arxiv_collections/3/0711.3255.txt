In \cite{CK2005} and \cite{Hubery2005}, the authors proved the cluster
multiplication theorems for finite type and affine type. We generalize their
results and prove the cluster multiplication theorem for arbitrary type by
using the properties of 2--Calabi--Yau
  (Auslander--Reiten formula) and high order associativity.
