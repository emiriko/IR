The dissipative dynamics of Gaussian squeezed states (GSS) and coherent
superposition states (CSS) are analytically obtained and compared. Time scales
for sustaining different quantum properties such as squeezing, negativity of
the Wigner function or photon number distribution are calculated. Some of these
characteristic times also depend on initial conditions. For example, in the
particular case of squeezing, we find that while the squeezing of CSS is only
visible for small enough values of the field intensity, in GSS it is
independent of this quantity, which may be experimentally advantageous. The
asymptotic dynamics however is quite similar as revealed by the time evolution
of the fidelity between states of the two classes.
