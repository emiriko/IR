We study the photon induced Lambda(1520) production in the effective
Lagrangian method near threshold, E_\gamma^{LAB}<2 GeV, and in the quark-gluon
string model at higher energies 3 GeV < E_\gamma^{LAB} < 5 GeV. In particular,
we study the role of the K^* exchange for the production of Lambda(1520) within
the SU(6) Weinberg-Tomozowa chiral unitary model proposed in Phys. Rev. D74
(2006) 034025. The coupling of the Lambda(1520) resonance to the N \bar K^*
pair, which is dynamically generated, turns out to be relatively small and,
thus, the K exchange mechanism dominates the reaction. In the higher energy
region, where experimental data are available, the quark-gluon string mechanism
with the K Regge trajectory reproduces both the energy and the angular
distribution dependences of the Lambda(1520) photo-production reaction.
