The combined Dirac-Kerr model of electron is suggested, in which electron has
extended space-time structure of Kerr geometry, and the Dirac equation plays
the role of a master equation controlling polarization of the Kerr congruence.
The source contains a spinning disk bounded by a closed singular string of
Compton size. It is conjectured that this Compton structure may be observed for
polarized electrons under a very soft coherent scattering.
