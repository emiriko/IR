We present the analysis of CP-violating effects in non-diagonal chargino pair
production in e+e- collisions. These effects appear only at the one-loop level.
We show that CP-odd asymmetries in chargino production are sensitive to the
phases of mu and A_t parameters and can be of the order of a few %.
