The finite time end of entanglement between two decohering qubits can be
modified by local, unitary actions performed during the decohering process.
Depending on the time when such action is taken, the end can be speeded up or
slowed down, or even averted all together. This phenomenon offers practical
applications for the stabilization of entangled quantum states. Details
concerning hastening or delaying the finite time end of entanglement are
presented for two qubits which decay spontaneously into statistically
independent reservoirs.
