We study the structure of an interface in a three dimensional Ising system
created by an external non-uniform field $H({\bf r},t)$. $H$ changes sign over
a two dimensional plane of arbitrary orientation. When the field is pulled with
velocity ${\bf v}_e$, (i.e. $H({\bf r},t) = H({\bf r - v_e}t)$), the interface
undergoes a several dynamical transitions. For low velocities it is pinned by
the field profile and moves along with it, the distribution of local slopes
undergoing a series of commensurate-incommensurate transitions. For large ${\bf
v}_e$ the interface de-pinns and grows with KPZ exponents.
