In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular
modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved
efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms
traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first
glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious
to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial
is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph
Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral
clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several
different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral
clustering algorithms are discussed.
