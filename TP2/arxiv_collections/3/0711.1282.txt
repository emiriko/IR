We consider the results of modeling of the efficiency of registration of
thermal neutrons by the converters, which are made from natural gadolinium and
its 157 isotope foils. Efficiency for a case of falling of neutrons under
various angles to a plane of converters is calculated. It is shown, that at
small angles of falling of neutrons to a plane of converters it is possible to
receive the efficiency of registration close to a theoretical limit. Efficiency
of the complex converter made of kapton supporting film with gadolinium
converters layered on both its sides is considered. All calculations are
carried out for four fixed neutron energies, which correspond to the
wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 $\AA$.
