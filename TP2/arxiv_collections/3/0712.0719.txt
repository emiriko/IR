The existence and stability of dissipative discrete breathers (DDBs) in rf
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) arrays in both one and two
dimensions is investigated numerically. In an rf SQUID array, the nonlinearity
which is intrinsic to each SQUID due to the presence of the Josephson junction
(on-site nonlinearity), along with the weak coupling of each SQUID to its
nearest neighbors through magnetic forces, result in the appearance of discrete
breathers. We analyze several discrete breather excitations, both in one and
two dimensions, which are subjected to unavoidable losses. These losses,
however, are counter-balanced by an external flux source leading to linearly
stable discrete breather structures up to relatively large coupling parameters.
We show that DDB excitations may locally alter the magnetic response of array
from paramagnetic to diamagnetic or vice versa, and that they are not destroyed
by increasing the dimensionality.
