We derive a universal lower bound of actuating energy $E_{s}$ for broadband
photon switching by using an uncertainty relation between time and the negative
energy density of quantum fields. We find that broadband photon switching
between perfect reflection and perfect transmission over a time $t_s$ should
satisfy $E_{s}\geq\frac{\hbar}{6\pi t_s}$.
