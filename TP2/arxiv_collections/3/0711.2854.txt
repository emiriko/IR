In this paper we present a generating function approach to two counting
problems in elementary quantum mechanics. The first is to find the total ways
of distributing identical particles among different states. The second is to
find the degeneracies of energy levels in a quantum system with multiple
degrees of freedom. Our approach provides an alternative to the methods in
textbooks.
