It is shown that a flux of unpolarized electrons across a symmetric double
barrier quantum well induces a spin polarization inside the well. Besides, the
transmitted current acquires a spin polarized component and the spin-Hall
current flows in the planar direction. These phenomena are due to a combined
effect of Dresselhaus interaction and the spin-orbit interaction induced by
gradients of heterostructure material parameters. In contrast to previous
studies of the spin filtering effect, we predict that it can be observed in
case of an isotropic distribution of incident electrons.
