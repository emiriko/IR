The lowest order contribution of the amplitude of Dirac-Coulomb scattering in
de Sitter spacetime is calculated assuming that the initial and final states of
the Dirac field are described by exact solutions of the free Dirac equation on
de Sitter spacetime with a given energy and helicity. We find that the total
energy is conserved in the scattering process.
