The Finsleroid--Finsler space becomes regular when the norm $||b||=c$ of the
input 1-form $b$ is taken to be an arbitrary positive scalar $c(x) < 1$. By
performing required direct evaluations, the respective spray coefficients have
been obtained in a simple and transparent form. The adequate continuation into
the regular pseudo-Finsleroid domain has been indicated. The Finsleroid-regular
Berwald space is found under the assumptions that the Finsleroid charge is a
constant and the 1-form $b$ is parallel.
  Keywords: Finsler metrics, spray coefficients, curvature tensors.
