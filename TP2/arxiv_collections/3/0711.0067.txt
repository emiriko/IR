We have measured hyperfine structure in the first-excited $P$ state ($D$
lines) of all the naturally-occurring alkali atoms. We use high-resolution
laser spectroscopy to resolve hyperfine transitions, and measure intervals by
locking the frequency shift produced by an acousto-optic modulator to the
difference between two transitions. In most cases, the hyperfine coupling
constants derived from our measurements improve previous values significantly.
