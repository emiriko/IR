[First paragraph] In a recent paper Yamada et al. propose the novel concept
of "pinched flow fractionation" (PFF) for the continuous size separation and
analysis of particles in microfabricated lab-on-a-chip devices. In their
description of the basic principle they claim that especially the width of the
pinched and broadened segments will affect theseparation performance. In the
following we comment on the physics behind this statement.
