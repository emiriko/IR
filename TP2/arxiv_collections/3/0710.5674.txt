Key substitution vulnerable signature schemes are signature schemes that
permit an intruder, given a public verification key and a signed message, to
compute a pair of signature and verification keys such that the message appears
to be signed with the new signature key. A digital signature scheme is said to
be vulnerable to destructive exclusive ownership property (DEO) If it is
computationaly feasible for an intruder, given a public verification key and a
pair of message and its valid signature relatively to the given public key, to
compute a pair of signature and verification keys and a new message such that
the given signature appears to be valid for the new message relatively to the
new verification key. In this paper, we prove decidability of the insecurity
problem of cryptographic protocols where the signature schemes employed in the
concrete realisation have this two properties.
