The self-localized quasi-particle excitation of the electron-positron field
(EPF) is found for the first time in the framework of a standard form of the
quantum electrodynamics. This state is interpreted as the ``physical'' electron
(positron) and it allows one to solve the following problems: i) to express the
``primary'' charge $e_0$ and the mass $m_0$ of the ``bare'' electron in terms
of the observed values of $e$ and $m$ of the ``physical'' electron without any
infinite parameters and by essentially nonperturbative way; ii) to consider
$\mu$-meson as another self-localized EPF state and to estimate the ratio
$m_{\mu}/m$; iii) to prove that the self-localized state is Lorentz-invariant
and its energy spectrum corresponds to the relativistic free particle with the
observed mass $m$; iv) to show that the expansion in a power of the observed
charge $e \ll 1$ corresponds to the strong coupling expansion in a power of the
``primary'' charge $e^{-1}_0 \sim e $ when the interaction between the
``physical'' electron and the transverse electromagnetic field is considered by
means of the perturbation theory and all terms of this series are free from the
ultraviolet divergence.
