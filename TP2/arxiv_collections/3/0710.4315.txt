We observe critical phenomena in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse
of Einstein Cluster. We show analytically that the collapse evolution ends
either in formation of a black hole or in dispersal depending on the values of
initial parameters which characterize initial density and angular momentum of
the collapsing cloud. Near the threshold of black hole formation, we obtain
scaling relation for the mass of the black hole and find the critical exponent
value to be 3/2. We numerically confirm that there exist wide ranges of initial
parameter values around the critical configuration for which the model remains
shell-crossing free.
