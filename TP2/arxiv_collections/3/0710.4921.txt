The generalized Weinberg sum rules containing the difference of isovector
vector and axial-vector spectral functions saturated by both finite and
infinite number of narrow resonances are considered. We summarize the status of
these sum rules and analyze their overall agreement with phenomenological
Lagrangians, low-energy relations, parity doubling, hadron string models, and
experimental data.
