Shifting to a lexicalized grammar reduces the number of parsing errors and
improves application results. However, such an operation affects a syntactic
parser in all its aspects. One of our research objectives is to design a
realistic model for grammar lexicalization. We carried out experiments for
which we used a grammar with a very simple content and formalism, and a very
informative syntactic lexicon, the lexicon-grammar of French elaborated by the
LADL. Lexicalization was performed by applying the parameterized-graph
approach. Our results tend to show that most information in the lexicon-grammar
can be transferred into a grammar and exploited successfully for the syntactic
parsing of sentences.
