Suppose $k+1$ runners having nonzero constant speeds run laps on a
unit-length circular track starting at the same time and place. A runner is
said to be lonely if she is at distance at least $1/(k+1)$ along the track to
every other runner. The lonely runner conjecture states that every runner gets
lonely. The conjecture has been proved up to six runners ($k\le 5$). A
formulation of the problem is related to the regular chromatic number of
distance graphs. We use a new tool developed in this context to solve the first
open case of the conjecture with seven runners.
