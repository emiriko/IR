We discuss how the symmetries of $\kappa$-Minkowski non-commutative spacetime
can be described by the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra. In particular, we
focus on a generalization of the Noether analysis in the $\kappa$-deformed
framework which allows us to introduce Noether charges associated with
translational symmetries and makes possible to overcome the apparent
ambiguities that seemed to be associated with the action of such symmetries.
Moving from the classical to the quantum framework, we will first review past
results on path integral quantization of a scalar self-interacting field. We
will then show how recent work on the symplectic structure of classical
$\kappa$-fields suggests a new approach to the canonical quantization of free
fields and and present some new results.
