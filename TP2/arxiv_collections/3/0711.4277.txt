We review recent advances in the field of full counting statistics (FCS) of
charge transfer through impurities imbedded into strongly correlated
one-dimensional metallic systems, modelled by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids
(TLLs). We concentrate on the exact analytic solutions for the cumulant
generating function (CGF), which became available recently and apply these
methods in order to obtain the FCS of a non-trivial contact between two crossed
TLL.
