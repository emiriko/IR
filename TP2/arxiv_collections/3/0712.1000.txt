Self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot is a new type of artificially
designed and grown function material which exhibits quantum size effect,
quantum interference effect, surface effect, quantum tunneling-Coulumb-blockade
effect and nonlinear optical effect. Due to advantages like less crystal
defects and relatively simpler fabrication technology, that material may be of
important value in future nanoelectronic device researches. In the order of
vertical transport, lateral transport and charge storage, this paper gives a
brief introduction of recent advances in the electronic properties of that
material and an analysis of problems and perspectives.
