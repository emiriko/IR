Recent developments in nuclear theory allow us to make a connection between
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and low-energy nuclear physics. First, chiral
effective field theory (chiEFT) provides a natural hierarchy to define
two-nucleon (NN), three-nucleon (NNN), and even four-nucleon interactions.
Second, ab initio methods have been developed capable to test these
interactions for light nuclei. In this contribution, we discuss ab initio
no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations for s-shell and p-shell nuclei with NN
and NNN interactions derived within chiEFT.
