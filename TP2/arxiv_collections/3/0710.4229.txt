We present a new formulation of the correlated electron-ion dynamics (CEID)
scheme, which systematically improves Ehrenfest dynamics by including quantum
fluctuations around the mean-field atomic trajectories. We show that the method
can simulate models of non-adiabatic electronic transitions, and test it
against exact integration of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. Unlike
previous formulations of CEID, the accuracy of this scheme depends on a single
tunable parameter which sets the level of atomic fluctuations included. The
convergence to the exact dynamics by increasing the tunable parameter is
demonstrated for a model two level system. This algorithm provides a smooth
description of the non-adiabatic electronic transitions which satisfies the
kinematic constraints (energy and momentum conservation) and preserves quantum
coherence. The applicability of this algorithm to more complex atomic systems
is discussed.
