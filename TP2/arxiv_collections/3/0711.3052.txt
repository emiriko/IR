When fragile molecules such as glycine, polyglicine, alkanes, and
alkanethiols are embedded in liquid helium nanodroplets, electron-impact
ionization of the beam leads to fragmentation which is as extensive as that of
isolated gas-phase molecules. However, it turns out that if a few molecules of
water are co-embedded with the peptide and alkane chains, their fragmentation
is drastically reduced or completely eliminated. On the other hand, the
fragmentation of alkanethiols remains unaffected. On the basis of these
observations, it is proposed that the fragmentation "buffering" effect may
correlate with the magnitude of the impurity's electric dipole moment, which
steers the migration of the ionizing He^+ hole in the droplet.
