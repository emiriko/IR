Certain classes of higher dimensional models suggest that the Casimir Effect
is a candidate for the cosmological constant. In this paper we demonstrate that
a sufficiently advanced civilization could, in principal, manipulate the radius
of the extra dimension to locally adjust the value of the cosmological
constant. This adjustment could be tuned to generate an expansion/contraction
of spacetime around a spacecraft creating an exotic form of field-propulsion.
Due to the fact that spacetime expansion itself is not restricted by
relativity, a faster-than-light 'warp drive' could be created. Calculations of
the energy requirements of such a drive are performed and an 'ultimate' speed
limit, based on the Planckian limits on the size of the extra dimensions is
found.
