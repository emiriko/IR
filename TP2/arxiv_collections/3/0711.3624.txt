We report on the construction and performance of a calibration source for
KamLAND using the reaction C-13(alpha,n)O-16 with Po-210 as the alpha
progenitor. The source provides a direct measurement of this background
reaction in our detector, high energy calibration points for the detector
energy scale, and data on quenching of the neutron visible energy in KamLAND
scintillator. We also discuss the possibility of using the reaction
C-13(alpha,n)O-16 as a source of tagged slow neutrons.
