Pulse-shape analysis of the ionization signals from germanium gamma-ray
spectrometers is a method for obtaining information that can characterize an
event beyond just the total energy deposited in the crystal. However, as
typically employed, this method is data-intensive requiring the digitization,
transfer, and recording of electronic signals from the spectrometer. A hardware
realization of a real-time digital signal processor for implementing a
parametric pulse shape is presented. Specifically, a previously developed
method for distinguishing between single-site and multi-site gamma-ray
interactions is demonstrated in an on-line digital signal processor, compared
with the original off-line pulse-shape analysis routine, and shown to have no
significant difference. Reduction of the amount of the recorded information per
event is shown to translate into higher duty-cycle data acquisition rates while
retaining the benefits of additional event characterization from pulse-shape
analysis.
