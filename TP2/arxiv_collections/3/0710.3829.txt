We propose a symmetric version of the multi-scale entanglement
renormalization Ansatz (MERA) in two spatial dimensions (2D) and use this
Ansatz to find an unknown ground state of a 2D quantum system. Results in the
simple 2D quantum Ising model on the $8\times8$ square lattice are found to be
very accurate even with the smallest non-trivial truncation parameter.
