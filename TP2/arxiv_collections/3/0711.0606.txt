We propose to encode quantum information in rotational excitations in a
molecular ensemble. Using a stripline cavity field for quantum state transfer
between the molecular ensemble and a Cooper pair box two-level system, our
proposal offers a linear scaling of the number of qubits in our register with
the number of rotationally excited states available in the molecules.
