The Symmetric Traveling Salesman Polytope $S_n$ for a fixed number $n$ of
cities is a face of the corresponding Graphical Traveling Salesman Polyhedron
$P_n$. This has been used to study facets of $S_n$ using $P_n$ as a tool. In
this paper, we study the operation of "rotating" (or "lifting") valid
inequalities for $S_n$ to obtain a valid inequalities for $P_n$.
  As an application, we describe a surprising relationship between (a) the
parsimonious property of relaxations of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman
Polytope and (b) a connectivity property of the ridge graph of the Graphical
Traveling Salesman Polyhedron.
