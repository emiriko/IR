We consider here a model previously introduced to describe the collective
behavior of an ensemble of cold atoms interacting with a coherent
electromagnetic field. The atomic motion along the self-generated
spatially-periodic force field can be interpreted as the rotation of a phase
oscillator. This suggests a relationship with synchronization transitions
occurring in globally coupled rotators. In fact, we show that whenever the
field dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated, the model reduces to a
self-consistent equation for the probability distribution of the atomic
"phases". In this limit, there exists a formal equivalence with the Kuramoto
model, though with important differences in the self-consistency conditions.
Depending on the field-cavity detuning, we show that the onset of synchronized
behavior may occur through either a first- or second-order phase transition.
Furthermore, we find a secondary threshold, above which a periodic self-pulsing
regime sets in, that is immediately followed by the unlocking of the
forward-field frequency. At yet higher, but still experimentally meaningful,
input intensities, irregular, chaotic oscillations may eventually appear.
Finally, we derive a simpler model, involving only five scalar variables, which
is able to reproduce the entire phenomenology exhibited by the original model.
