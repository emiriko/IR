The physics case of the SuperB facility with design luminosity of 10^36 cm^-2
s^-1 is compelling. Such a facility has a rich and varied potential to probe
physics beyond the Standard Model. These new physics constraints are obtained
through the study of the rare or Standard Model forbidden decays of B_u,d,s, D
and tau particles. The highlights of this wide-ranging physics programme are
discussed in these proceedings.
