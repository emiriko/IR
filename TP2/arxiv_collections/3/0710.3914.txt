We study the exact entanglement dynamics of two atoms in a lossy resonator.
Besides discussing the steady-state entanglement, we show that in the strong
coupling regime the system-reservoir correlations induce entanglement revivals
and oscillations and propose a strategy to fight against the deterioration of
the entanglement using the quantum Zeno effect.
