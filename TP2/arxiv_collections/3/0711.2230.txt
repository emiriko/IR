We analyze a one dimensional quantum system consisting of a test particle
interacting with two harmonic oscillators placed at the positions $a_1$, $a_2$,
with $a_1 >0$, $|a_2|>a_1$, in the two possible situations: $a_2>0$ and $a_2
<0$. At time zero the harmonic oscillators are in their ground state and the
test particle is in a superposition state of two wave packets centered in the
origin with opposite mean momentum. %$\pm M v_0$. Under suitable assumptions on
the physical parameters of the model, we consider the time evolution of the
wave function and we compute the probability $\mathcal{P}^{-}_{n_1 n_2} (t)$
(resp. $\mathcal{P}^{+}_{n_1 n_2} (t)$) that both oscillators are in the
excited states labelled by $n_1$, $n_2 >0$ at time $t > |a_2| v_0^{-1}$ when
$a_2 <0$ (resp. $a_2 >0$). We prove that $\mathcal{P}_{n_1 n_2}^- (t)$ is
negligible with respect to $\mathcal{P}_{n_1 n_2}^+ (t)$, up to second order in
time dependent perturbation theory. The system we consider is a simplified, one
dimensional version of the original model of a cloud chamber introduced by Mott
in \cite{m}, where the result was argued using euristic arguments in the
framework of the time independent perturbation theory for the stationary
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The method of the proof is entirely elementary and it
is essentially based on a stationary phase argument. We also remark that all
the computations refer to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the three-particle
system, with no reference to the wave packet collapse postulate.
