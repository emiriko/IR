We propose a spin polarizer device composed of a quantum dot connected to the
spin polarized leads. The spin control of the current flowing through the
device is entirely due to the Coulomb interactions present inside the dot. We
show that the initial polarization present in the source lead can be reverted
or suppressed just by manipulating the gate voltage acting on the dot, the
presence of the external magnetic field is not required. The influence of the
temperature and finite bias on the efficiency of the current spin switching
effect is also discussed.
