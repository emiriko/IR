We report on measurements of the critical temperature and the temperature
dependence of the condensate fraction for a fermion pair condensate of 6Li
atoms. The Bragg spectroscopy is employed to determine the critical temperature
and the condensate fraction after a fast magnetic field ramp to the molecular
side of the Feshbach resonance. Our measurements reveal the level-off of the
critical temperature and the limiting behavior of condensate fraction near the
unitarity limit.
