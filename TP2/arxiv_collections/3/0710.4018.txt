We show that superheavy threshold corrections in the New Minimal
Supersymmetric GUT based on the SO(10) Higgs system ${\bf{210\oplus 126\oplus
{\bar {126}}\oplus 10 \oplus 120}} $ can comfortably correct the prediction for
the value of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$ from the relatively large value predicted by the
two loop RG equations to the central value determined by the current world
average. The unification scale is raised above the one loop value over almost
all of the viable parameter space.
