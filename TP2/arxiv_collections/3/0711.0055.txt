In this paper, I will discuss the geometrical structures of multipartite
quantum systems based on complex projective schemes. In particular, I will
explicitly construct multi-qubit states in terms of these schemes and also
discuss separability and entanglement of bipartite and multipartite quantum
states. These results give some geometrical insight to the fascinating quantum
mechanical phenomena of entanglement which is fundamentally important and has
many applications in the field of quantum computing.
