The spin polarization of electrons trapped in InAs self-assembled quantum dot
ensembles is investigated. A statistical approach for the population of the
spin levels allows one to infer the spin polarization from the measure values
of the addition energies. From the magneto-capacitance spectroscopy data, the
authors found a fully polarized ensemble of electronic spins above 10 T when
$\mathbf{B}\parallel[001]$ and at 2.8 K. Finally, by including the g-tensor
anisotropy the angular dependence of spin polarization with the magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}$ orientation and strength could be determined.
