We consider branching random walks in $d$-dimensional integer lattice with
time-space i.i.d. offspring distributions. This model is known to exhibit a
phase transition: If $d \ge 3$ and the environment is "not too random", then,
the total population grows as fast as its expectation with strictly positive
probability. If,on the other hand, $d \le 2$, or the environment is ``random
enough", then the total population grows strictly slower than its expectation
almost surely. We show the equivalence between the slow population growth and a
natural localization property in terms of "replica overlap". We also prove a
certain stronger localization property, whenever the total population grows
strictly slower than its expectation almost surely.
