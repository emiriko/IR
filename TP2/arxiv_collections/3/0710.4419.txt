We study collective spin oscillations in a spin-1 Bose gas above the
Bose-Einstein transition temperature. Starting from the Heisenberg equation of
motion, we derive a kinetic equation describing the dynamics of a thermal gas
with the spin-1 degree of freedom. Applying the moment method to the kinetic
equation, we study spin-wave collective modes with dipole symmetry. The dipole
modes in the spin-1 system are found to be classified into the three type of
modes. The frequency and damping rate are obtained as functions of the peak
density. The damping rate is characterized by three relaxation times associated
with collisions.
