Motivated by recent numerical findings [M. Henkel, T. Enss, and M. Pleimling,
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006) L589] we re-examine via Monte Carlo
simulations the linear response function of the two-dimensional Ising model
with Glauber dynamics quenched to the critical point. At variance with the
results of Henkel et al., we detect discrepancies between the actual scaling
behavior of the response function and the prediction of Local Scale Invariance.
Such differences are clearly visible in the impulse autoresponse function,
whereas they are drastically reduced in integrated response functions.
Accordingly, the scaling form predicted on the basis of Local Scale Invariance
simply provides an accurate fitting form for some quantities but cannot be
considered to be exact.
