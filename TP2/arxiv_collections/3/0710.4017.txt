This talk describes the reasons why $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ decays are an
interesting topic of study for both theory and experiment. The main part
discusses the results of the recent calculation of $\eta\to3\pi$ at two-loop
order in ChPT. Some puzzling aspects of the results compared to earlier
dispersive calculations are highlighted. I also like to remind the reader of
the use of $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ decays for studying the anomaly.
