A monolithic integrated tactile sensor array is presented, which is used to
perform non-invasive blood pressure monitoring of a patient. The advantage of
this device compared to a hand cuff based approach is the capability of
recording continuous blood pressure data. The capacitive, membrane-based sensor
device is fabricated in an industrial CMOS-technology combined with post-CMOS
micromachining. The capacitance change is detected by a S?-modulator. The
modulator is operated at a sampling rate of 128kS/s and achieves a resolution
of 12bit with an external decimation filter and an OSR of 128.
