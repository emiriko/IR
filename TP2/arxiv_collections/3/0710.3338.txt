Using 1 fb-1 of data from ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV at the
Fermilab Tevatron collider collected by the D0 detector, we search for decays
of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton in the Randall-Sundrum model of
extra dimensions to e+e- and diphotons. We set 95% confidence level upper
limits on the production cross section times branching fraction which translate
into lower limits on the mass of the lightest excitation between 300 and 900
GeV for values of the coupling k/M(Planck) between 0.01 and 0.1.
