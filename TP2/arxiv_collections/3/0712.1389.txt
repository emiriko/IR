Precise and absolute beam polarization measurements are critical for the RHIC
spin physics program. Because all experimental spin-dependent results are
normalized by beam polarization, the normalization uncertainty contributes
directly to final physics uncertainties. We aimed to perform the beam
polarization measurement to an accuracy of $\Delta P_{beam}/P_{beam} < 5%$.
  The absolute polarimeter consists of Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target
and left-right pairs of silicon strip detectors and was installed in the
RHIC-ring in 2004. This system features \textit{proton-proton} elastic
scattering in the Coulomb nuclear interference (CNI) region. Precise
measurements of the analyzing power $A_N$ of this process has allowed us to
achieve $\Delta P_{beam}/P_{beam} =4.2%$ in 2005 for the first long
spin-physics run.
  In this report, we describe the entire set up and performance of the system.
The procedure of beam polarization measurement and analysis results from
2004-2005 are described. Physics topics of $A_N$ in the CNI region
(four-momentum transfer squared $0.001 < -t < 0.032 ~ ({\rm GeV}/c)^2$) are
also discussed. We point out the current issues and expected optimum accuracy
in 2006 and the future.
