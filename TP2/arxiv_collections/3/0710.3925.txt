Deuteron and proton structure functions are derived from
Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations of
singlet and non-singlet structure functions in next-to-leading order (NLO) at
low-x assuming the Regge behaviour of singlet and non-singlet structure
functions at this limit and results are compared with New Muon Collaboration
(NMC) and E665 collaboration data sets.
