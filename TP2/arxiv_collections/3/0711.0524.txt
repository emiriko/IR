We employ the generalized Chaplygin gas of interacting dark energy to obtain
the equation of state for the generalized Chaplygin gas energy density in
non-flat universe. By choosing a negative value for $B$ we see that $w_{\rm
\Lambda}^{eff}< -1$, that corresponds to a universe dominated by phantom dark
energy.
