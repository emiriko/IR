We investigate the most general "phase space" of configurations, consisting
of all possible ways of assigning elementary attributes, "energies", to
elementary positions, "cells". We discuss how this space possesses structures
that can be approximated by a quantum physics scenario. In particular, we
discuss how the Heisenberg's "Uncertainty Principle" and a "universe" with a
three-dimensional space arise, and what kind of mechanics rules it.
