We consider a class of interaction terms that describes correlated tunneling
of composite fermions between effective Landau levels. Despite being generic
and of similar strength to that of the usual density-density couplings, these
terms are not included in the accepted theory of the edges of fractional
quantum Hall systems. Here we show that they may lead to an instability of the
edge towards a new reconstructed state with additional channels, and thereby
demonstrate the incompleteness of the traditional edge theory.
