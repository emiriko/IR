We demonstrate that a gas of classical particles trapped in an external
asymmetric potential undergoes a quasiperiodic motion, if the temperature of
its initial velocity distribution $T_{ne}$ differs from the equilibrium
temperature, $T_{eq}$. The magnitude of the effect is determined by the value
of $T_{ne}-T_{eq}$, and the direction of the motion is determined by the sign
of this expression. The "loading'' and "unloading'' of the gas particles change
directions of their motion, thereby creating a possibility of shuttle-like
motion. The system works as a Carnot engine where the heat flow between kinetic
and potential parts of the nonequilibrium distribution produces the useful
work.
