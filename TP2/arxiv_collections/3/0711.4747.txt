We investigate AdS/QCD duality for the two-point correlation function of the
lowest dimension scalar glueball operator, in the case of the IR soft wall
model. We point out the role of the boundary conditions for the
bulk-to-boundary propagator in determining the gluon condensates. We show that
a low energy QCD theorem can be obtained within the AdS approach, together with
a gluon condensate close to the commonly accepted value and robust against
perturbation of the background dilaton field.
