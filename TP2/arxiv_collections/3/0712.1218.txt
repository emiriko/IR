We study spectral behavior of the complex Laplacian on forms with values in
the $k^{\text{th}}$ tensor power of a holomorphic line bundle over a smoothly
bounded domain with degenerated boundary in a complex manifold. In particular,
we prove that in the two dimensional case, a pseudoconvex domain is of finite
type if and only if for any positive constant $C$, the number of eigenvalues of
the $\overline\partial$-Neumann Laplacian less than or equal to $Ck$ grows
polynomially as $k$ tends to infinity.
