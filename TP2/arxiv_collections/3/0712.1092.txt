We show that the insecurity claim of the AlphaEta cryptosystem made by C. Ahn
and K. Birnbaum in Phys. Lett. A 370 (2007) 131-135 under heterodyne attack is
based on invalid extrapolations of Shannon's random cipher analysis and on an
invalid statistical independence assumption. We show, both for standard ciphers
and AlphaEta, that expressions of the kind given by Ahn and Birnbaum can at
best be interpreted as security lower bounds.
