We consider the entanglement between quantum field degrees of freedom inside
and outside the horizon as a plausible source of black-hole entropy. We examine
possible deviations of black hole entropy from area proportionality. We show
that while the area law holds when the field is in its ground state, a
correction term proportional to a fractional power of area results when the
field is in a superposition of ground and excited states. We compare our
results with the other approaches in the literature.
