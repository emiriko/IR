This paper intends to review some of the prominent properties of strongly
coupled classical plasmas having in mind the possible link with the quark-gluon
plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. Thermodynamic and transport properties
of classical liquid-state one-component plasmas are described and features of
collective excitations are presented.
