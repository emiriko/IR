In a recent paper, A.Y. Shiekh has discussed an experimental set-up which, in
his opinion, should make possible faster-than-light communication using the
collapse of the quantum wave function. Contrary to the many proposals which
have been presented in the past, he does not resort to an entangled state of
two systems but he works with a single particle in a superposition of two
states - corresponding to its propagation in opposite directions - one of which
goes through an appropriate interferometer. The possibility for an observer
near the interferometer to introduce or not, at his free will, a phase shifter
along one of the paths should allow to change instantaneously the probability
of finding the particle in the far-away region corresponding to the other state
of the superposition and, correspondingly, to change the intensity of a beam of
particles reaching a distant observer. In this paper we show a flaw in the
argument: once more, as it has been proved in full generality a long time ago,
the process of wave packet reduction cannot be used for superluminal
communication.
