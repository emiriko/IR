Chiral additives in the nematic liquid crystal can alter the dynamics of
point defects moving on a disclination line. They exert a constant force on
defects, leading to the bimodal distribution of distances between them at long
times. The evolution of the system of defects in the presence of chiral
additives provides a very direct proof of the existence of repulsive forces
between the defects at large distances. We find that addition of a sufficient
amount of chiral compound removes all point defects from the system. The
process is studied in the system of 8CB (4-n-octyl-4 '-cyanobiphenyl) doped
with the chiral compound S811 (from Merck Co.) and in the computer simulations.
