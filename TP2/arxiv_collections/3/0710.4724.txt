The emerging concept of SoC-AMS leads to research new top-down methodologies
to aid systems designers in sizing analog and mixed devices. This work applies
this idea to the high-level optimization of pipeline ADC. Considering a given
technology, it consists in comparing different configurations according to
their imperfections and their architectures without FFT computation or
time-consuming simulations. The final selection is based on a figure of merit.
