In this paper, we propose a scheme to produce pure and macroscopical
entangled coherent state. When a three-level ''V'' configuration atom interacts
with a doubly reasonant cavity, under the strong classical driven condition,
entangled coherent state can be generated from vacuum fields. An analytical
solution for this system under the presence of cavity losses is also given.
