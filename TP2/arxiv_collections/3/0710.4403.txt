We consider the possibility of using stabilizer states to perform
deterministic dense coding among multiple senders and a single receiver. In the
model we studied, the utilized stabilizer state is partitioned into several
subsystems and then each subsystem is held by a distinct party. We present a
sufficient condition for a stabilizer state to be useful for deterministic
distributed dense coding with respect to a given partition plan. The
corresponding protocol is also constructed. Furthermore, we propose a method to
partially solve a more general problem of finding the set of achievable
alphabet sizes for an arbitrary stabilizer state with respect to an arbitrary
partition plan. Finally, our work provides a new perspective from the
stabilizer formalism to view the standard dense coding protocol and also
unifies several previous results in a single framework.
