We have calculated the atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) induced in 229Pa
and 225Ac by their respective nuclear Schiff moments S. The results are
d(229Pa)= - 9.5 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm= - 1.1 10^{-20} \eta e cm; d(225Ac})=-
8.6 10^{-17} [S/(e fm)] e cm=- 0.8 10^{-21} \eta e cm. EDM of 229 Pa is 3 10^4
times larger than 199Hg EDM and 40 times larger than 225Ra EDM. Possible use of
actinides in solid state experiments is also discussed. The T,P-odd spin-axis
interaction in RaO molecule is 500 times larger than in TlF.
