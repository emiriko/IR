The first clue, in the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force acting on a
particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle, this
orthogonality means that there is some difference between the orthogonality and
the usual statement: the Coulomb's force (or gravitational force) acts along
the line joining a couple of particles (in usual 3D space), so the direction of
4-vector Coulomb's force is carefully investigated, it is found that Maxwell's
equations can be derived from classical Coulomb's force and the orthogonality.
The second clue, a 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the
orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the number of
independent components of the 4-vector force reduces to 3, however we prove
that 4-vector Coulomb's force can merely provide 2 independent components, this
situation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the 4-vector
Coulomb's force, hinting that this missing undefined component is a hidden
variable. The third clue, the best way to study the hidden variable is to
establish a new concept: Z-space, in which the undefined component of 4-vector
Coulomb's force can be clearly defined as the hidden variable for the quantum
mechanics. At the last, the undefined component is regarded as a fluctuating
source that contributes to Lorentz force, so that the quantum wave equation can
be derived out in the ensemble space of particle motion from the relativistic
Newton's second law.
