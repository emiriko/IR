We have measured the charged kaon lifetime using a sample of 15 \times 10^6
tagged kaon decays. Charged kaons were produced in pairs at the DA\PhiNE
\phi-factory, e^+e^- \to \phi \to K^+ K^-. The decay of a K^+ was tagged by the
production of a K^- and viceversa. The lifetime was obtained, for both charges,
from independent measurements of the decay time and decay lenght distributions.
  From fits to the four distributions we find \tau = (12.347\pm0.030) ns.
