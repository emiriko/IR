Parallel least mean square-partial parallel interference cancelation
(PLMS-PPIC) is a partial interference cancelation which employs adaptive
multistage structure. In this algorithm the channel phases for all users are
assumed to be known. Having only their quarters in (0,2\pi), a modified version
of PLMS-PPIC is proposed in this paper to simultaneously estimate the channel
phases and the cancelation weights. Simulation examples are given in the cases
of balanced, unbalanced and time varying channels to show the performance of
the modified PLMS-PPIC method.
