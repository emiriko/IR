A problem of the equivalence of statistical ensembles is critically analyzed.
It is shown, that although different probability distributions of statistical
physics have the same behavior in the thermodynamic limit, there are physical
observables -- semi-intensive variables -- which keep memory of the underlying
ensembles. This property is an universal one and can be observed even in the
simplest case of the grand canonical and canonical ensembles of the classical
statistical physics.
