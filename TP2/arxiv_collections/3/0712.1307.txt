Here we report on two structural studies performed on As-doped gypsum (CaSO4
2H2O) and calcite (CaCO3), using neutron (D20-ILL) and x-ray (ID11-ESRF)
diffraction data and EXAFS (BM8-ESRF). The aim of this study is to determine
whether As gets into the bulk of gypsum and calcite structures or is simply
adsorbed on the surface. Different mechanisms of substitution are used as
hypotheses. The combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and x-ray diffraction
data shows an expansion of the unit cell volume proportional to the As
concentration within the samples. DFT-based simulations confirm the increase of
the unit cell volume proportional to the amount of carbonate or sulphate groups
substituted. Interpolation of the experimental Rietveld data allows us to
distinguish As substituted within the structure from that adsorbed on the
surface of both minerals.
