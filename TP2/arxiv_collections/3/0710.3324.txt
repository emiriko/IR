There can exist topological obstructions to continuously deforming a gapped
Hamiltonian for free fermions into a trivial form without closing the gap.
These topological obstructions are closely related to obstructions to the
existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions. We show that by taking
two copies of a gapped, free fermionic system with complex conjugate
Hamiltonians, it is always possible to overcome these obstructions. This allows
us to write the ground state in matrix product form using Grassman-valued bond
variables, and show insensitivity of the ground state density matrix to
boundary conditions.
