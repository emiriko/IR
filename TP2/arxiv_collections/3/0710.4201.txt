The famous formula for the emission angle of Cherenkov radiation should be
modified when applied to hadronic reactions because of recoil effects. They
impose the upper limit on the energy of the gluon emitted at a given angle.
Also, it leads to essential corrections to the nuclear refractive index value
as determined from the angular position of Cherenkov rings.
