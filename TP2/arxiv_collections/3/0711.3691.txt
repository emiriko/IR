The Outilex software platform, which will be made available to research,
development and industry, comprises software components implementing all the
fundamental operations of written text processing: processing without lexicons,
exploitation of lexicons and grammars, language resource management. All data
are structured in XML formats, and also in more compact formats, either
readable or binary, whenever necessary; the required format converters are
included in the platform; the grammar formats allow for combining statistical
approaches with resource-based approaches. Manually constructed lexicons for
French and English, originating from the LADL, and of substantial coverage,
will be distributed with the platform under LGPL-LR license.
