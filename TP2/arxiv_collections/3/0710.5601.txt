We propose a re-encoder to generate a refreshed parity encoded state from an
existing parity encoded state. This is the simplest case of the scheme by
Gilchrist et al. (Phys. Rev. A 75, 052328). We show that it is possible to
demonstrate with existing technology parity encoded quantum gates and
teleportation.
