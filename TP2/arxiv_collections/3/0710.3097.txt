The mapping between the fermion and spinon compositions of eigenstates in the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX model on a lattice with N sites is used to describe
the spinon interaction from two different perspectives: (i) For finite N the
energy of all eigenstates is expressed as a function of spinon momenta and
spinon spins, which, in turn, are solutions of a set of Bethe ansatz equations.
The latter are the basis of an exact thermodynamic analysis in the spinon
representation of the XX model. (ii) For N -> infinity the energy per site of
spinon configurations involving any number of spinon orbitals is expressed as a
function of reduced variables representing momentum, filling, and magnetization
of each orbital. The spins of spinons in a single orbital are found to be
coupled in a manner well described by an Ising-like equivalent-neighbor
interaction, switching from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic as the filling
exceeds a critical level. Comparisons are made with results for the
Haldane-Shastry model.
