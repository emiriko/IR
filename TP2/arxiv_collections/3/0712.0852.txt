We perform a quantitative study of neutrino phenomenology in the framework of
minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) with grand unified theory (GUT)-scale tri-linear
lepton number violation. We show that only two non-zero GUT scale lepton number
violating parameters and three charged lepton mixing angles are sufficient to
account for current neutrino oscillation data. This allows collider studies to
be performed in a manageable parameter space. We discuss some phenomenological
consequences of the models, including tuning issues.
