The helicity amplitudes of the electroexcitation of the Roper resonance on
proton are extracted at 1.7 < Q2 < 4.2 GeV2 from recent high precision
JLab-CLAS cross sections data and longitudinally polarized beam asymmetry for
pi+ electroproduction on protons. The analysis is made using two approaches,
dispersion relations and unitary isobar model, which give consistent results.
It is found that the transverse helicity amplitude for the gamma* p -->
P11(1440) transition, which is large and negative at Q2=0, becomes large and
positive at Q2 ~ 2 GeV2, and then drops slowly with Q2. Longitudinal helicity
amplitude, that was previously found from CLAS data as large and positive at
Q2=0.4,0.65 GeV2, drops with Q2. These results rule out the presentation of
P11(1440) as a 3qG hybrid state, and provide strong evidence in favor of this
resonance as a first radial excitation of the 3q ground state.
