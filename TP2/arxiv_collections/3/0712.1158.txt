It has recently been predicted that a conical singularity (= Dirac point) in
the band structure of a photonic crystal produces an unusual 1/L scaling of the
photon flux transmitted through a slab of thickness L. This inverse-linear
scaling is unusual, because it is characteristic of radiative transport via
diffusion modes through a disordered medium -- while here it appears for
propagation of Bloch modes in an ideal crystal without any disorder. We present
a quantitative numerical test of the predicted scaling, by calculating the
scattering of transverse-electric (TE) modes by a two-dimensional triangular
lattice of dielectric rods in air. We verify the 1/L scaling and show that the
slope differs by less than 10% from the value predicted for maximal coupling of
the Bloch modes in the photonic crystal to the plane waves in free space.
