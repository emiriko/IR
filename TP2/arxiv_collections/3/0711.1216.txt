We investigate a domain structure of pseudospins, a soliton lattice in the
bilayer quantum Hall state at total Landau level filling factor $\nu =1$, in a
tilted magnetic field, where the pseudospin represents the layer degree of
freedom. An anomalous peak in the magnetoresistance $R_{xx}$ appears at the
transition point between the commensurate and incommensurate phases. The
$R_{xx}$ at the peak is highly anisotropic for the angle between the in-plain
magnetic field $B_\parallel $ and the current, and indicates a formation of the
soliton lattice aligned parallel to $B_\parallel $. Temperature dependence of
the $R_{xx}$ peak reveals that the dissipation is caused by thermal
fluctuations of pseudospin solitons. We construct a phase diagram of the
bilayer $\nu =1$ system as a function of $B_\parallel$ and the total electron
density. We also study effects of density imbalance between the two layers.
