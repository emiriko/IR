Recent experimental results of the Crystal-Barrel/TAPS collaboration at ELSA
are presented. The experiments used a tagged photon beam incident on proton and
neutron targets. Multiple photon final states were detected in the hermetically
closed Crystal-Barrel/TAPS detector setup, enabling the reconstruction of
various neutral meson production channels. In addition to cross sections also
photon beam asymmetries and, in the $K^0_s\Sigma^+$ channel, recoil
polarisations were determined.
