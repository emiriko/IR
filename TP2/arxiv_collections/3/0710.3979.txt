Network data needs to be shared for distributed security analysis.
Anonymization of network data for sharing sets up a fundamental tradeoff
between privacy protection versus security analysis capability. This
privacy/analysis tradeoff has been acknowledged by many researchers but this is
the first paper to provide empirical measurements to characterize the
privacy/analysis tradeoff for an enterprise dataset. Specifically we perform
anonymization options on single-fields within network packet traces and then
make measurements using intrusion detection system alarms as a proxy for
security analysis capability. Our results show: (1) two fields have a zero sum
tradeoff (more privacy lessens security analysis and vice versa) and (2) eight
fields have a more complex tradeoff (that is not zero sum) in which both
privacy and analysis can both be simultaneously accomplished.
