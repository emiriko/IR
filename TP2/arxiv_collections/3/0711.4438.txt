We analyse the influence of pre-stress on the propagation of interfacial
waves along the boundary of an incompressible hyperelastic half-space that is
in contact with a viscous fluid extending to infinity in the adjoining
half-space. One aim is to derive rigorously the incremental boundary conditions
at the interface; this derivation is delicate because of the interplay between
the Lagrangian and the Eulerian descriptions but is crucial for numerous
problems concerned with the interaction between a compliant wall and a viscous
fluid. A second aim of this work is to model the ultrasonic waves used in the
assessment of aortic aneurysms, and here we find that for this purpose the
half-space idealization is justified at high frequencies. A third goal is to
shed some light on the stability behaviour in compression of the solid
half-space, as compared with the situation in the absence of fluid; we find
that the usual technique of seeking standing waves solutions is not appropriate
when the half-space is in contact with a fluid; in fact, a correct analysis
reveals that the presence of a viscous fluid makes a compressed neo-Hookean
half-space slightly more stable. For a wave travelling in a direction of
principal strain, we obtain results for the case of a general (incompressible
isotropic) strain-energy function. For a wave travelling parallel to the
interface and in an arbitrary direction in a plane of principal strain, we
specialize the analysis to the neo-Hookean strain-energy function.
