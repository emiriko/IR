This article presents a cognitively oriented viewpoint on design. It focuses
on cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive
activity implemented by designers during their work on professional design
projects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's
symbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or
some other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we
consider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately
characterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion
of the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This
presentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels
of abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external
representations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.
Designing is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its
strategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different
ways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a
"generic design" stance, we claim that design can take different forms
depending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for
dimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.
We discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive
design research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of
representational structures and activities by an outline of some directions
regarding their functional linkages.
