In this paper, we study the problem when a finitely generated torsionless
module is projective. Let $\Lambda$ be an Artinian local algebra with radical
square zero. Then a finitely generated torsionless $\Lambda$-module $M$ is
projective if ${\rm Ext^1_\Lambda}(M,M)=0$. For a commutative Artinian ring
$\Lambda$, a finitely generated torsionless $\Lambda$-module $M$ is projective
if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) ${\rm
Ext}^i_{\Lambda}(M,\Lambda)=0$ for $i=1,2,3$; and (2) ${\rm
Ext}^i_{\Lambda}(M,M)=0$ for $i=1,2$. As a consequence of this result, we have
that for a commutative Artinian ring $\Lambda$, a finitely generated Gorenstein
projective $\Lambda$-module is projective if and only if it is selforthogonal.
