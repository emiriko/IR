We demonstrate noncontact, high quality surface modification with spatial
resolution of ~20 nm. The nanowriting is based on the interaction between the
surface and the tip of an Atomic force microscope illuminated by a focused
laser beam and hovering 1-4 nanometers above the surface without touching it.
The floating tip nanowriting is compared to mechanical surface scratching, and
is found to be much more reproducible, and of higher quality. In an
Apertureless Scanning Near Field Optical Microscope geometry the tip is
illuminated by a focused femtosecond laser, leading to two different, clearly
identifiable mechanisms for removing material from the surface: when heated by
the laser beam, the hot-tip thermally patterns the surface of low melting
temperature soft materials, and when focused right at the apex of the sharp
tip, the enhanced electric field of the laser beam causes ablation in high
melting temperature metal films.
