The influence of the macroscopic size of the Ni nanowire array system on
their remanence state has been investigated. A simple magnetic phenomenological
model has been developed to obtain the remanence as a function of the
magnetostatic interactions in the array. We observe that, due to the long range
of the dipolar interactions between the wires, the size of the sample strongly
influence the remanence of the array. On the other hand, the magnetic state of
nanowires has been studied by variable field magnetic force microscopy for
different remanent states. The distribution of nanowires with the magnetization
in up or down directions and the subsequent remanent magnetization has been
deduced from the magnetic images. The existence of two short-range magnetic
orderings with similar energies can explain the typical labyrinth pattern
observed in magnetic force microscopy images of the nanowire arrays.
