Holst action containing Immirzi parameter for pure gravity is generalised to
the supergravity theories. Supergravity equations of motion are not modified by
such generalisations, thus preserving supersymmetry. Dependence on the Immirzi
parameter does not emerge in the classical equations of motion. This is in
contrast with the recent observation of Perez and Rovelli for gravity action
containing original Holst term and a minimally coupled Dirac fermion where the
classical equations of motion do develop a dependence on Immirzi parameter.
