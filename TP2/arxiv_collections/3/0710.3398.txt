We show a very simple yet rigorous derivation of the invariance of the
space-time interval (and hence the whole special relativity) just from the
isotropy, homogeneity and a principle of relativity, without the need of the
speed of light axiom. This article is intended as a textbook explanation of the
special relativity.
