We construct a scheme for the preparation, pairwise entanglement via exchange
interaction, manipulation, and measurement of individual group-II-like neutral
atoms (Yb, Sr, etc.). Group-II-like atoms proffer important advantages over
alkali metals, including long-lived optical-transition qubits that enable fast
manipulation and measurement. Our scheme provides a promising approach for
producing weighted graph states, entangled resources for quantum communication,
and possible application to fundamental tests of Bell inequalities that close
both detection and locality loopholes.
