We present visualizations of the diffusion and expulsion of magnetic flux for
thin conducting sheets, both stationary and moving, including representations
of the eddy currents and of the associated magnetic fields. Such visualizations
can play an important role in making the abstract mathematics of eddy current
phenomena more understandable from a physical and conceptual point of view.
