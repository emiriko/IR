During recent years, exact solutions of position-dependent mass Schr\"odinger
equations have inspired intense research activities, based on the use of point
canonical transformations, Lie algebraic methods or supersymmetric quantum
mechanical techniques. Here we highlight the interest of another approach to
such problems, relying on quadratic algebras. We illustrate this point by
constructing spectrum generating algebras for a class of $d$-dimensional radial
harmonic oscillators with $d\ge2$ (including the one-dimensional oscillator on
the line via some minor changes) and a specific mass choice. This provides us
with a counterpart of the well-known su(1,1) Lie algebraic approach to the
constant-mass oscillators.
