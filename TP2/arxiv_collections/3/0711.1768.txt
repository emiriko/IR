The influence of substitutional disorder on the transport properties of
heavy-fermion systems is investigated. We extend the dynamical mean-field
theory treatment of the periodic Anderson model (PAM) to a coherent-potential
approximation for disordered strongly correlated electron systems. Considering
two distinct local environments of a binary alloy $A_c B_{1-c}$ with arbitrary
concentration $c$, we explore two types of disorder: on the f site and on the
ligand sites. We calculate the spectral functions and self-energies for the
disordered PAM as well as the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the
thermoelectric power. The characteristic concentration dependence as well as
the order of magnitude of transport properties are reproduced for metallic
heavy-fermion systems and Kondo insulators. In particular, sign changes of the
Seebeck coefficient as function of temperature and concentration are observed.
