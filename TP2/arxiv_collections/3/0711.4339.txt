The free-electron-like state observed in a scanning tunneling spectroscopy
study of a chiral p(2x4) monolayer of glycinate ions on the Cu(100) surface [K.
Kanazawa et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 740 (2007)] is shown from density
functional theory calculations to originate from a Cu Shockley surface state at
the surface Brillouin zone boundary of the clean surface with highly
anisotropic dispersion. The presence of the glycinate ions on the surface
causes a dramatically enhanced tunneling into this surface state that is
otherwise not observed in tunneling on the bare surface.
