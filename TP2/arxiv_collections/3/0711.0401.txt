We demonstrate Rabi flopping of small numbers of $\rm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms between
ground and Rydberg states with $n\le 43$. Coherent population oscillations are
observed for single atom flopping, while the presence of two or more atoms
decoheres the oscillations. We show that these observations are consistent with
van der Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms.
