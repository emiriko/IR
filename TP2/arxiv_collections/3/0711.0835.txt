The fast Monte Carlo procedure of hadron generation developed in our previous
work is extended to describe noncentral collisions of nuclei. We consider
different possibilities to introduce appropriate asymmetry of the freeze-out
hyper-surface and flow velocity profile. For comparison with other models and
experimental data we demonstrate the results based on the standard
parametrizations of the hadron freeze-out hyper-surface and flow velocity
profile assuming either a common chemical and thermal freeze-out or the
chemically frozen evolution from chemical to thermal freeze-out. The C++
generator code is written under the ROOT framework and is available for public
