From first principles calculations we investigate the electronic structure
and the magnetic properties of EuO under hydrostatic and epitaxial forces.
There is a complex interdependence of the O 2p and Eu 4f and 5d bands on the
magnetism in EuO, and decreasing lattice parameters is an ideal method to
increase the Curie temperature, T_c. Compared to hydrostatic pressure, the
out-of-plane compensation that is available to epitaxial films influences this
increase in T_c, although it is minimized by the small value of poisson's ratio
for EuO. We find the semiconducting gap closes at a 6% in-plane lattice
compression for epitaxy, at which point a significant conceptual change must
occur in the active exchange mechanisms.
