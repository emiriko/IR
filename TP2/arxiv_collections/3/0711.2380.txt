Previously suggested hidden time interpretation of quantum mechanics allows
to reproduce the same predictions as standard quantum mechanics provides, since
it is based on Feynman many - paths formulation of QM. While new experimental
consequences of this interpretation are under investigation, some advantages
can be enumerated. (1) The interpretation is much field theoretic - like in
classical sense, so it is local in mathematical sense, though quantum
(physical) non-locality is preserved. (2) The interpretation is based on one
type of mathematical objects, rather than two different (Hilbert space vectors
and operators). (3) The interpretation, as it was argued, overcomes the problem
of hidden variables in a radically new way, with no conflict to Bell's theorem.
Recently an important argument against hidden variables - like formulations of
quantum theory was risen - "no protocol" argument. It is argued in the paper,
that hidden time interpretation successfully overcomes this argument.
