The two Higgs doublet model for the top (T2HDM) is a 2HDM in which the top
quark receives a special status, which endows it with a naturally large mass,
and also gives rise to unique FC charged and neutral scalar interactions. We
calculate the BR of the t->ch and h->tc rare decays in the T2HDM, at 1-loop and
tree level. We find that the FC scalar interactions play a significant role in
these decays. We find that the BR of these decays at 1-loop level in the T2HDM
can be significantly enhanced over the 2HDM-I,II, reaching up to ~10^-4, and
that the BR(t->ch) in the T2HDM can be detected at the LHC.
