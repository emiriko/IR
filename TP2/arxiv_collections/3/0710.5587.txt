The neutrino pion production off the nucleon is traditionally described in
the literature by means of the weak excitation of the Delta(1232) resonance and
its subsequent decay into N pi. Here, we present results from a model that
includes also some background terms required by chiral symmetry. We show that
the contribution of these terms is sizeable and leads to significant effects in
total and partially integrated pion production cross sections at intermediate
energies of interest for neutrino oscillation experiments. Finally, we discuss
parity-violating contributions to the pion angular differential cross section
induced by the interference of these non-resonant terms with the Delta piece.
