This paper contributes to the understanding of vocal folds oscillation during
phonation. In order to test theoretical models of phonation, a new experimental
set-up using a deformable vocal folds replica is presented. The replica is
shown to be able to produce self sustained oscillations under controlled
experimental conditions. Therefore different parameters, such as those related
to elasticity, to acoustical coupling or to the subglottal pressure can be
quantitatively studied. In this work we focused on the oscillation fundamental
frequency and the upstream pressure in order to start (on-set threshold) either
end (off-set threshold) oscillations in presence of a downstream acoustical
resonator. As an example, it is shown how this data can be used in order to
test the theoretical predictions of a simple one-mass model.
