We extend the Polyakov-loop improved Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model to 2+1
flavor case to study the chiral and deconfinement transitions of strongly
interacting matter at finite temperature and nonzero chemical potential. The
Polyakov-loop, the chiral susceptibility of light quarks (u and d) and the
strange quark number susceptibility as functions of temperature at zero
chemical potential are determined and compared with the recent results of
Lattice QCD simulations. We find that there is always an inflection point in
the curve of strange quark number susceptibility accompanying the appearance of
the deconfinement phase, which is consistent with the result of Lattice QCD
simulations. Predictions for the case at nonzero chemical potential and finite
temperature are made as well. We give the phase diagram in terms of the
chemical potential and temperature and find that the critical endpoint (CEP)
moves down to low temperature and finally disappears with the decrease of the
strength of the 't Hooft flavor-mixing interaction.
