We have performed multicanonical computer simulations of a small system of
short protein-like heteropolymers and found that their aggregation transition
possesses similarities to first-order phase separation processes. Not being a
phase transition in the thermodynamic sense, the observed folding-binding
behavior exhibits fascinating features leading to the conclusion that the
temperature is no suitable control parameter in the transition region. More
formally, for such small systems the microcanonical interpretation is more
favorable than the typically used canonical picture.
