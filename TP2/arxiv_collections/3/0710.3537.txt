We study the pp \to pp\pi^0 reaction near threshold based on heavy-baryon
chiral perturbation theory. We show that the two-pion-exchange diagrams give
much larger contribution than the one-pion-exchange diagram which is of lower
chiral order in Weinberg's counting scheme. We also discuss the relation of our
results to the momentum counting scheme.
