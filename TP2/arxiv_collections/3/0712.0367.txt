Sensitivity analysis is an effective tool for systematically identifying
specific perturbations in parameters that have significant effects on the
behavior of a given biosystem, at the scale investigated. In this work, using a
two-dimensional, multiscale non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model, we
examine the effects of perturbations in system parameters which span both
molecular and cellular levels, i.e. across scales of interest. This is achieved
by first linking molecular and cellular activities and then assessing the
influence of parameters at the molecular level on the tumor's spatio-temporal
expansion rate, which serves as the output behavior at the cellular level.
Overall, the algorithm operated reliably over relatively large variations of
most parameters, hence confirming the robustness of the model. However, three
pathway components (proteins PKC, MEK, and ERK) and eleven reaction steps were
determined to be of critical importance by employing a sensitivity coefficient
as an evaluation index. Each of these sensitive parameters exhibited a similar
changing pattern in that a relatively larger increase or decrease in its value
resulted in a lesser influence on the system's cellular performance. This study
provides a novel cross-scaled approach to analyzing sensitivities of
computational model parameters and proposes its application to
interdisciplinary biomarker studies.
