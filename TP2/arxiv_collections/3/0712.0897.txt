Precisely measuring $\theta_{13}$ is one of the highest priority in neutrino
oscillation study. Reactor experiments can cleanly determine $\theta_{13}$.
Past reactor neutrino experiments are reviewed and status of next precision
$\theta_{13}$ experiments are presented. Daya Bay is designed to measure
$\sin^22\theta_{13}$ to better than 0.01 and Double Chooz and RENO are designed
to measure it to 0.02-0.03. All are heading to full operation in 2010. Recent
improvements in neutrino moment measurement are also briefed.
