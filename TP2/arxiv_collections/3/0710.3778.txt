We propose a resolution of the renormalization group flow for the disordered
Dirac fermion theories describing the quantum Hall transition (QHT) and spin
Quantum Hall transition (SQHT), which previously revealed no perturbative fixed
points at 1-loop and higher. The approach involves carrying out the flow in 2
stages, the first stage utilizing a new form of super spin-charge separation to
flow to gl(1|1)_N and osp(2|2)_{-2N} supercurrent algebra theories, where N is
the number of copies. This leads to the unconventional feature that at the
critical point the exponents depend on the original number of copies N. In the
second stage, additional forms of disorder are incorporated as dimension zero
logarithmic operators, and the resulting actions have explicit forms in terms
of two scalar fields and a symplectic fermion. Under some assumptions, the
multi-fractal exponents are computed with the result q(1-q)/4 and q(1-q)/8 for
the QHT and SQHT respectively, and are within a few percent of numerical
estimates.
