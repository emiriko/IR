We investigated the pressure-dependent optical response of the
low-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulator TiOBr by transmittance and reflectance
measurements in the infrared and visible frequency range. A suppression of the
transmittance above a critical pressure and a concomitant increase of the
reflectance are observed, suggesting a pressure-induced metallization of TiOBr.
The metallic phase of TiOBr at high pressure is confirmed by the presence of
additional excitations extending down to the far-infrared range. The
pressure-induced metallization coincides with a structural phase transition,
according to the results of x-ray powder diffraction experiments under
pressure.
