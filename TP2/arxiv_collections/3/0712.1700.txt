Scattering of light by a random stack of dielectric layers represents a
one-dimensional scattering problem, where the scattered field is a
three-dimensional vector field. We investigate the dependence of the scattering
properties (band gaps and Anderson localization) on the wavelength, strength of
randomness and relative angle of the incident wave. There is a characteristic
angular dependence of Anderson localization for wavelengths close to the
thickness of the layers. In particular, the localization length varies
non-monotonously with the angle. In contrast to Anderson localization,
absorptive layers do not have this characteristic angular dependence.
