We provide an investigation of the P-wave hyperons employing the field
correlator method in QCD. This method allows to derive the Effective
Hamiltonian successfully applied to the meson and ground state baryon spectra.
The hyperon spectrum appears to be expressed through two parameters relevant to
QCD, the string tension \sigma, the strong coupling constant \alpha_s, and the
bare strange quark mass m_s. Using these parameters a unified description of
the ground and excited hyperon states is achieved. We also briefly consider the
nucleon P-wave excitations. In particular, we predict that both the nucleon and
hyperon states have the similar cost (in \Delta L) ~460 MeV.
