A proposal is made by the University College of London Group [1] for
measuring the target-ionization cross sections in Ps and atom scattering. We
calculate the corresponding theoretical data for Ps-H and Ps-He systems
including the effect of exchange on Coulomb-Born approximation for the
projectile-elastic and projectile-inelastic processes and report the total
target-ionization cross sections for the first time.
