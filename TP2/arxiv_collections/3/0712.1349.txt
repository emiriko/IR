Analytic expressions for uniform and staggered magnetizations of a spin
ladder with a staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction along rungs are
obtained in the lowest perturbative orders. The obtained formulas describe
magnetic behavior in two marginal regions related to low ($h\ll h_c$) and high
($h\gg h_s$) magnetic fields.
