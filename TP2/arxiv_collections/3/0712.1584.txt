While the charmonium model has been effective in describing ccbar bound
mesons, there have been many recently discovered charmonium-like states it
cannot accommodate. Here I provide a review of recent results from the
B-factories including the X(3872), three new particles in the mass range near
3.93 GeV, and four new resonances in initial state radiation (ISR) decays.
