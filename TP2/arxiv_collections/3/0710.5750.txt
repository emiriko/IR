We analyze the LHC phenomenology of lambdaSUSY - a version of NMSSM with a
largish SH1H2 coupling. The scalar spectrum of the model contains a 200-300 GeV
Higgs boson h with Standard-Model like properties, and heavy CP-even and CP-odd
Higgs bosons H and A with masses in 500-800 GeV range. We study the discovery
potential of H and A in the decay chains H->hh->4V->2l6j and A->Zh->Z2V->2l4j.
The dominant backgrounds are the diffuse Z6j and Z4j productions, which can be
suppressed by demanding reconstruction of V's and h's in intermediate states.
The excess of signal events allows for a discovery of both H and A with over
5sigma significance for 100 inverse fb of integrated luminosity.
