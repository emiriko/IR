The report describes the research program on the development of
ultra-low-energy germanium detectors, with emphasis on WIMP dark matter
searches. A threshold of 100 eV is achieved with a 20 g detector array,
providing a unique probe to the low-mas WIMP. Present data at a surface
laboratory is expected to give rise to comparable sensitivities with the
existing limits at the $\rm{5 - 10 GeV}$ WIMP-mass range. The projected
parameter space to be probed with a full-scale, kilogram mass-range experiment
is presented. Such a detector would also allow the studies of neutrino-nucleus
coherent scattering and neutrino magnetic moments.
