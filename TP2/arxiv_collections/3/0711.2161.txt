We present scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements at
100mK in the superconducting material 2H-NbSe2 that show well defined features
in the superconducting density of states changing in a pattern closely
following atomic periodicity. Our experiment demonstrates that the intrinsic
superconducting density of states can show atomic size modulations, which
reflect the reciprocal space structure of the superconducting gap. In
particular we obtain that the superconducting gap of 2H-NbSe2 has six fold
modulated components at 0.75 mV and 1.2 mV.Moreover, we also find related
atomic size modulations inside vortices, demonstrating that the much discussed
star shape vortex structure produced by localized states inside the vortex
cores, has a, hitherto undetected, superposed atomic size modulation. The tip
substrate interaction in an anisotropic superconductor has been calculated,
giving position dependent changes related to the observed gap anisotropy.
