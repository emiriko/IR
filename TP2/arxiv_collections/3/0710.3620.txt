A possible nonlinear completion of massive gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type is
proposed. The theory describes a system consisting of a massive tensor field of
the Fierz-Pauli type and an additional massive vector field. Massless limit as
well as flat-spacetime limit can be taken smoothly. Constructing a nonlinear
version of the physical-state condition which drives an extra scalar ghost from
physical states is still unsettled.
