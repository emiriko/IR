We investigate the influence of inhomogeneity in the pairing coupling
constant $U(\vec r)$ on dirty BCS superconductors, focusing on $T_c$, the order
parameter $\Delta(\vec r)$, and the energy gap $E_g(\vec r)$. Within mean-field
theory, we find that when the length-scale of the inhomogeneity is comparable
to, or larger than the coherence length, the ratio $2E_g/T_c$ is significantly
reduced from that of a homogeneous superconductor, while in the opposite limit
this ratio stays unmodified. In two dimensions, when strong phase fluctuations
are included, the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature $T_{KT}$ is also studied. We
find that when the inhomogeneity length scale is much larger than the coherence
length, $2E_g/T_{KT}$ can be larger than the usual BCS value. We use our
results to qualitatively explain recent experimental observation of a
surprisingly low value of $2E_g/T_c$ in thin films.
