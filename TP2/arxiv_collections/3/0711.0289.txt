We study zero-temperature XX chains and transverse Ising chains and join an
initially separate finite piece on one or on both sides to an infinite
remainder. In both critical and non-critical systems we find a typical increase
of the entanglement entropy after the quench, followed by a slow decay towards
the value of the homogeneous chain. In the critical case, the predictions of
conformal field theory are verified for the first phase of the evolution, while
at late times a step structure can be observed.
