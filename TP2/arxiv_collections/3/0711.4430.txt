Torsional oscillations of a free-standing semiconductor beam are shown to
cause spin-dependent oscillating potentials that spin-polarize an applied
charge current in the presence of intentional or disorder scattering
potentials. We propose several realizations of mechanical spin generators and
manipulators based on this piezo-spintronic effect.
