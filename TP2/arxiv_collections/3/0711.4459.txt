Suppose that a group $G$ acts transitively on the points of a
non-Desarguesian plane, $\mathcal{P}$. We prove first that the Sylow
2-subgroups of $G$ are cyclic or generalized quaternion. We also prove that
$\mathcal{P}$ must admit an odd order automorphism group which acts
transitively on the set of points of $\mathcal{P}$.
