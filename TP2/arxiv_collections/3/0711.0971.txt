We construct a class of lattices in three and higher dimensions for which the
number of dimer coverings can be determined exactly using elementary arguments.
These lattices are a generalization of the two-dimensional kagome lattice, and
the method also works for graphs without translational symmetry. The partition
function for dimer coverings on these lattices can be determined also for a
class of assignments of different activities to different edges.
