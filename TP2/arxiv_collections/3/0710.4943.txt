In a previous work we have showed that the ${\cal Z}_{2}^{\prime}$ Symmetry,
imply that the light fermions, the electron and the quarks, $u,d$ and $s$, get
their masses only at one loop level. Here, we considere the more general
hypothesis for flavour mixing in the sfermion sector in the MSSM. Then, we
present our results to the masses of these light fermions and as a final result
we can explain why the $s$ quark is heavier than the $u,d$ quarks. This
mechanism is in agrement with the experimental constraint on the sfermion's
masses values.
