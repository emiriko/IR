The beam spin asymmetries in the hard exclusive electroproduction of photons
on the proton (ep -> epg) were measured over a wide kinematic range and with
high statistical accuracy. These asymmetries result from the interference of
the Bethe-Heitler process and of deeply virtual Compton scattering. Over the
whole kinematic range (x_B from 0.11 to 0.58, Q^2 from 1 to 4.8 GeV^2, -t from
0.09 to 1.8 GeV^2), the azimuthal dependence of the asymmetries is compatible
with expectations from leading-twist dominance, A = a*sin(phi)/[1+c*cos(phi)].
This extensive set of data can thus be used to constrain significantly the
generalized parton distributions of the nucleon in the valence quark sector.
