We present a measurement of the muon neutrino-nucleon inclusive charged
current cross-section, off an isoscalar target, in the neutrino energy range
$2.5 \leq E_\nu \leq 40$ GeV. The significance of this measurement is its
precision, $\pm 4$% in $2.5 \leq E_\nu \leq 10$ GeV, and $\pm 2.6$% in $10 \leq
E_\nu \leq 40$ GeV regions, where significant uncertainties in previous
experiments still exist, and its importance to the current and proposed long
baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.
