In the absence of disorder, the degeneracy of a Landau level (LL) is
$N=BA/\phi_0$, where $B$ is the magnetic field, $A$ is the area of the sample
and $\phi_0=h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum. With disorder, localized states
appear at the top and bottom of the broadened LL, while states in the center of
the LL (the critical region) remain delocalized. This well-known phenomenology
is sufficient to explain most aspects of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE)
[1]. One unnoticed issue is where the new states appear as the magnetic field
is increased. Here we demonstrate that they appear predominantly inside the
critical region. This leads to a certain ``spectral ordering'' of the localized
states that explains the stripes observed in measurements of the local inverse
compressibility [2-3], of two-terminal conductance [4], and of Hall and
longitudinal resistances [5] without invoking interactions as done in previous
work [6-8].
