We discuss calculation of nuclear corrections to the structure functions for
the deep-inelastic scattering of muon and (anti)neutrino. Our approach includes
a QCD description of the nucleon structure functions as well as the treatment
of Fermi motion and nuclear binding, off-shell correction to bound nucleon
structure functions, nuclear pion excess and nuclear shadowing. We emphasize
the dependence of nuclear effects on the type and C-parity of (anti)neutrino
structure functions. We also examine the interplay between different nuclear
effects in the Adler and the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rules for nuclei.
