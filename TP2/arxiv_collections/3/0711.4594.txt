We explore p-wave pairing in a single-channel two-component Fermi system with
unequal population near Feshbach resonance. Our analytical and numerical study
reveal a rich superfluid (SF) ground state structure as a function of
imbalance. In addition to the state $\Delta_{\pm 1} \propto Y_{1\pm 1}$, a
multitude of ``mixed'' SF states formed of linear combinations of $Y_{1m}$'s
give global energy minimum under a phase stability condition; these states
exhibit variation in energy with the relative phase between the constituent gap
amplitudes. States with local energy minimum are also obtained. We provide a
geometric representation of the states. A $T$=0 polarization vs. p-wave
coupling phase diagram is constructed across the BEC-BCS regimes. With
increased polarization, the global minimum SF state may undergo a quantum phase
transition to the local minimum SF state.
