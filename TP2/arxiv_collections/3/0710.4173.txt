Partial feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
systems provides tremendous capacity gain and enables the transmitter to
exploit channel condition and to eliminate channel interference. In the case of
severely limited feedback, constructing a quantized partial feedback is an
important issue. To reduce the computational complexity of the feedback system,
in this paper we introduce an adaptive partial method in which at the
transmitter, an easy to implement least square adaptive algorithm is engaged to
compute the channel state information. In this scheme at the receiver, the time
varying step-size is replied to the transmitter via a reliable feedback
channel. The transmitter iteratively employs this feedback information to
estimate the channel weights. This method is independent of the employed
space-time coding schemes and gives all channel components. Simulation examples
are given to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
