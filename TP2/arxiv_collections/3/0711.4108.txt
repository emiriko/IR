We discuss tachyon-free examples of (Type IIB on) non-compact
non-supersymmetric orbifolds. Tachyons are projected out by discrete torsion
between orbifold twists, while supersymmetry is broken by a Scherk-Schwarz
phase (+1/-1 when acting on space-time bosons/fermions) accompanying some even
order twists. The absence of tachyons is encouraging for constructing
non-supersymmetric D3-brane gauge theories with stable infrared fixed points.
The D3-brane gauge theories in our orbifold backgrounds have chiral N = 1
supersymmetric spectra, but non-supersymmetric interactions.
