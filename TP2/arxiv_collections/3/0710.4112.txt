A direct measurement of the total decay width of the W boson G_W is presented
using 350 pb-1 of data from ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV collected
with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The width is determined by
normalizing predicted signal and background distributions to 230185 W
candidates decaying to enu and munu in the transverse-mass region 50 < M_T < 90
GeV and then fitting the predicted shape to 6055 events in the high-M_T region,
90 < M_T < 200 GeV. The result is G_W = 2032 +/- 45 (stat.) +/- 57 (syst.) MeV,
consistent with the standard model expectation.
