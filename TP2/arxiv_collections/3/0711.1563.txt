We study the zero temperature mean-field phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard
model in the presence of local coupling between the bosons and an external
bath. We consider a coupling that conserves the on-site occupation number,
preserving the robustness of the Mott and superfluid phases. We show that the
coupling to the bath renormalizes the chemical potential and the interaction
between the bosons and reduces the size of the superfluid regions between the
insulating lobes. For strong enough coupling, a finite value of hopping is
required to obtain superfluidity around the degeneracy points where Mott phases
with different occupation numbers coexist. We discuss the role that such a bath
coupling may play in experiments that probe the formation of the
insulator-superfluid shell structure in systems of trapped atoms.
