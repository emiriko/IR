We study the possibility of performing perfect teleportation of unknown
quantum states from multiple senders to a single receiver with a previously
shared stabilizer state. In the model we considered, the utilized stabilizer
state is partitioned into several subsystems and then each subsystem is
distributed to a distinct party. We present two sufficient conditions for a
stabilizer state to achieve a given nonzero teleportation capacity with respect
to a given partition plan. The corresponding teleportation protocols are also
explicitly given. Interestingly, we find that even mixed stabilizer states are
also useful for perfect many-to-one teleportation. Finally, our work provides a
new perspective from stabilizer formalism to view the standard teleportation
protocol and also suggests a new technique for analyzing teleportation
capability of multipartite entangled states.
