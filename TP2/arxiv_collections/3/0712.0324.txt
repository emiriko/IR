After adding a pair of non-minimal fields and performing a similarity
transformation, the BRST operator in the pure spinor formalism is expressed as
a conventional-looking BRST operator involving the Virasoro constraint and
(b,c) ghosts, together with 12 fermionic constraints. This BRST operator can be
obtained by gauge-fixing the Green-Schwarz superstring where the 8 first-class
and 8 second-class Green-Schwarz constraints are combined into 12 first-class
constraints. Alternatively, the pure spinor BRST operator can be obtained from
the RNS formalism by twisting the ten spin-half RNS fermions into five spin-one
and five spin-zero fermions, and using the SO(10)/U(5) pure spinor variables to
parameterize the different ways of twisting. GSO(-) vertex operators in the
pure spinor formalism are constructed using spin fields and picture-changing
operators in a manner analogous to Ramond vertex operators in the RNS
formalism.
