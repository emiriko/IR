We study the local density of states at the surface of a chiral p-wave
superconductor in the presence of a weak magnetic field. As a result, the
formation of low-energy Andreev bound states is either suppressed or enhanced
by an applied magnetic field, depending on its orientation with respect to the
chirality of the p-wave superconductor. Similarly, an Abrikosov vortex, which
is situated not too far from the surface, leads to a zero-energy peak of the
density of states, if its chirality is the same as that of the superconductor,
and to a gap structure for the opposite case. We explain the underlying
principle of this effect and propose a chirality sensitive test on
unconventional superconductors.
