The Weibel instability is analyzed for quantum plasmas described by the
Wigner-Maxwell model. For a suitable class of electromagnetic potentials, the
Wigner-Maxwell system is linearized yielding a general dispersion relation for
transverse electromagnetic waves. For a double Gaussian equilibrium with
temperature anisotropy, the derived dispersion relation generalizes the
classical Weibel instability equation. More detailed analytical results are
obtained for the cases of extreme temperature anisotropy and for a
three-dimensional water bag distribution. In all cases, quantum effects tends
to weaken or suppress the instability. Applications are discussed for dense
astrophysical objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars as well as for
tunnel-ionized plasmas with controllable perpendicular plasma temperature.
