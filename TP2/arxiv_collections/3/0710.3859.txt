Many illnesses are associated with an alteration of the immune system
homeostasis due to any combination of factors, including exogenous bacterial
insult, endogenous breakdown (e.g., development of a disease that results in
immuno suppression), or an exogenous hit like surgery that simultaneously
alters immune responsiveness and provides access to bacteria, or genetic
disorder. We conjecture that, as a consequence of the co-evolution of the
immune system of individuals with the ecology of pathogens, the homeostasis of
the immune system requires the influx of pathogens. This allows the immune
system to keep the ever present pathogens under control and to react and adjust
fast to bursts of infections. We construct the simplest and most general system
of rate equations which describes the dynamics of five compartments: healthy
cells, altered cells, adaptive and innate immune cells, and pathogens. We study
four regimes obtained with or without auto-immune disorder and with or without
spontaneous proliferation of infected cells. Over all regimes, we find that
seven different states are naturally described by the model: (i) strong healthy
immune system, (ii) healthy organism with evanescent immune cells, (iii)
chronic infections, (iv) strong infections, (v) cancer, (vi) critically ill
state and (vii) death. The analysis of stability conditions demonstrates that
these seven states depend on the balance between the robustness of the immune
system and the influx of pathogens.
