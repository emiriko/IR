We consider a simple linear reversible isomerization reaction A <--> B under
subdiffusion described by continuous time random walks (CTRW). The reactants'
transformations take place independently on the motion and are described by
constant rates. We show that the form of the ensuing system of mesoscopic
reaction-subdiffusion is somewhat unusual: the equation giving the time
derivative of one reactant concentration, say A(x,t), contains the terms
depending not only on Laplacian A, but also on Laplacian B, i.e. depends also
on the transport operator of another reactant. Physically this is due to the
fact that several transitions from A to B and back may take place at one site
before the particle jumps.
