The combined Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) in position and momentum
space is introduced, in the form of two coupled integral equations that
describe the evolution of the probability distribution for finding a particle
at a certain position and with a certain momentum as a function of time. The
integral equations are solved numerically with a pseudospectral method that is
based on the expansion of the unknown functions in terms of Chebyshev
polynomials. In parallel, Monte-Carlo simulation are performed. Through the
inclusion of momentum space, the combined CTRW is able to yield results on
density and temperature profile evolution, on particle and heat fluxes and
diffusivities, and on kinetic energy distributions. Depending on the choice of
the probability distributions of the particle displacements in position and
momentum space, the combined CTRW is able to model phenomena of anomalous
transport in position as well as in momentum (or energy or velocity) space. An
application is made to a toroidally confined plasma that undergoes off-center
injection of cold plasma (off-axis fueling), using two variants of the model,
the mixed model and the critical gradient model. The phenomenon of profile
stiffness is addressed, both for the density and for the temperature profile,
respectively, and the particle and energy confinement times are determined. The
analysis of the particle and heat fluxes shows that the dynamics realized in
the combined CTRW is incompatible with the classical approach of Fick's or
Fourier's law for particle and heat transport, respectively.
