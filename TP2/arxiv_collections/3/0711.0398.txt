We report applications of analytical formalisms and Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations to the calculation of redox entropy of plastocyanin metalloprotein
in aqueous solution. The goal of our analysis is to establish critical
components of the theory required to describe polar solvation at the mesoscopic
scale. The analytical techniques include a microscopic formalism based on
structure factors of the solvent dipolar orientations and density and continuum
dielectric theories. The microscopic theory employs the atomistic structure of
the protein with force-field atomic charges and solvent structure factors
obtained from separate MD simulations of the homogeneous solvent. The MD
simulations provide linear response solvation free energies and reorganization
energies of electron transfer in the temperature range 280--310 K. We found
that continuum models universally underestimate solvation entropies, and a more
favorable agreement is reported between the microscopic calculations and MD
simulations. The analysis of simulations also suggests that difficulties of
extending standard formalisms to protein solvation are related to the
inhomogeneous structure of the solvation shell at the protein-water interface
combining islands of highly structured water around ionized residues along with
partial dewetting of hydrophobic patches. Quantitative theories of
electrostatic protein hydration need to incorporate realistic density profile
of water at the protein-water interface.
