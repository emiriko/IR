We present the fabrication of metallic magnetic nanowires using a low
temperature chemical process. We show that pressed powders and magnetically
oriented samples exhibit a very high coercivity (6.5 kOe at 140 K and 4.8 kOe
at 300 K). We discuss the magnetic properties of these metamaterials and show
that they have the suitable properties to realize "high temperature magnets"
competitive with AlNiCo or SmCo permanent magnets. They could also be used as
recording media for high density magnetic recording.
