First realistic estimate of the usefulness of the Photon Linear Collider with
linearly polarized photons as analyzer of the CP-parity of Higgs bosons is
presented. MSSM Higgs bosons H and A with 300 GeV mass, for the model
parameters corresponding to the so called "LHC wedge" region, are considered.
When switching from circular to linear photon polarization a significant
increase in heavy quark production background, which is no longer suppressed by
helicity conservation, and decrease of the Higgs boson production cross
sections by a factor of two is expected. Nevertheless, after three years of
Photon Linear Collider running heavy scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons in
MSSM can be distinguished at a 4.5 sigma level.
