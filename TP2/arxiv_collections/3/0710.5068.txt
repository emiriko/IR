At the Yang-Lee edge singularity, finite-size scaling behavior is used to
measure the low-lying excitation spectrum of the Ising quantum spin chain for
free boundary conditions. The measured spectrum is used to identify the CFT
that describes the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the 2D Ising model for free
boundary conditions.
