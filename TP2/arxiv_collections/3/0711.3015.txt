Magnetic insulators have proved to be fertile ground for studying new types
of quantum many body states, and I survey recent experimental and theoretical
examples. The insights and methods transfer also to novel superconducting and
metallic states. Of particular interest are critical quantum states, sometimes
found at quantum phase transitions, which have gapless excitations with no
particle- or wave-like interpretation, and control a significant portion of the
finite temperature phase diagram. Remarkably, their theory is connected to
holographic descriptions of Hawking radiation from black holes.
