In talk I will review the theoretical results that have been obtained for
spin glasses, paying a particular attention to finite dimensional spin glasses.
I will concentrate my attention on the formulation of the mean field approach
and on its numerical and experimental verifications. I will mainly considered
equilibrium properties at zero magnetic field, where the situation is clear and
it should be not controversial. I will present the various hypothesis at the
basis of the theory and I will discuss their physical status.
