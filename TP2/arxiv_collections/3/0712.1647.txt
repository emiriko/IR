It is shown that the supersymmetric quantum mechanics has an octonionic
generalization. The generalization is based on the inclusion of quaternions
into octonions. The elements from the coset octonions/quaternions are
unobservables bacause they cannot be considered as quantum operators as a
consequence of their non-associative properties. The idea that the octonionic
generalization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics describes an observable
particle formed with unobservable ``particles'' is presented.
