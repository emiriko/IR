The confinement of silver selenide was investigated using mesoporous silica.
Results from x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy show that the confined
material still exhibits a \beta to \alpha transition similar to the one that
takes place in the bulk crystalline state but with a transition temperature
that depends significantly on the confinement conditions. Decreasing the pore
size leads to an increase of the transition temperature, opposite to the
behavior of the melting point observed in several metallic and organic
materials. In the free particles, on the other hand, no size dependence is
observed with particle sizes down to 4 nm.
