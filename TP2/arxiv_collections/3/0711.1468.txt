It is well known that, in nuclear collisions, a sizable fraction of the
available energy is carried away by baryons. As the baryon number is conserved,
the net-baryon $B-\bar{B}$ retains information on the energy-momentum carried
by the incoming nuclei. A simple but consistent model for net-baryon production
in high energy hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions is
presented. The basic ingredients of the model are valence string formation
based on standard PDFs with QCD evolution and string fragmentation via the
Schwinger mechanism. The results of the model are presented and compared with
both data and existing models. These results show that a good description of
the main features of net-baryon data is possible on the framework of a
simplistic model, with the advantage of making the fundamental production
mechanisms manifest.
