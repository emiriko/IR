We develop a pairing mean-field theory to describe the quantum dynamics of
the dissociation of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates into their constituent
bosonic or fermionic atoms. We apply the theory to one, two, and
three-dimensional geometries and analyze the role of dimensionality on the atom
production rate as a function of the dissociation energy. As well as
determining the populations and coherences of the atoms, we calculate the
correlations that exist between atoms of opposite momenta, including the column
density correlations in 3D systems. We compare the results with those of the
undepleted molecular field approximation and argue that the latter is most
reliable in fermionic systems and in lower dimensions. In the bosonic case we
compare the pairing mean-field results with exact calculations using the
positive-$P$ stochastic method and estimate the range of validity of the
pairing mean-field theory. Comparisons with similar first-principle simulations
in the fermionic case are currently not available, however, we argue that the
range of validity of the present approach should be broader for fermions than
for bosons in the regime where Pauli blocking prevents complete depletion of
the molecular condensate.
