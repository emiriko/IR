Decoupling via the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) of low-energy
nuclear physics from high-energy details of the nucleon-nucleon interaction is
examined for two-body observables and few-body binding energies. The universal
nature of this decoupling is illustrated and errors from suppressing
high-momentum modes above the decoupling scale are shown to be perturbatively
small.
