The signal to noise ratio, which plays such an important role in information
theory, is shown to become pointless in digital communications where - symbols
are modulating carriers, which are solutions of linear differential equations
with polynomial coefficients, - demodulations is achieved thanks to new
algebraic estimation techniques. Operational calculus, differential algebra and
nonstandard analysis are the main mathematical tools.
