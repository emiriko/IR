This paper presents the effectiveness of various stress conditions (mainly
voltage and frequency) on detecting the resistive shorts and open defects in
deep sub-micron embedded memories in an industrial environment. Simulation
studies on very-low voltage, high voltage and at-speed testing show the need of
the stress conditions for high quality products; i.e., low defect-per-million
(DPM) level, which is driving the semiconductor market today. The above test
conditions have been validated to screen out bad devices on real silicon (a
test-chip) built on CMOS 0.18 um technology. IFA (inductive fault analysis)
based simulation technique leads to an efficient fault coverage and DPM
estimator, which helps the customers upfront to make decisions on test
algorithm implementations under different stress conditions in order to reduce
the number of test escapes.
