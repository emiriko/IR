The effect of cationic size mismatch at the A site at constant manganese
valence on the structural and magnetic properties of a perovskite-type
rare-earth manganate was investigated in the Pr0.9(Na1-xKx)0.1MnO3 solid
solution system (0 <= x < 1). All members of this solid solution series are
orthorhombic at room temperature, space group Pbnm. Structural refinements
using the Rietveld method show that the cell volume increases and the static
Jahn-Teller distortion decreases with increasing potassium content x. Magnetic
properties are characterized by strong positive \theta p values, and are
ascribed to a canted ferromagnetic arrangement. The high Curie constant values
in the paramagnetic regime can be explained by a magnetic cluster model of 2-3
Mn ions.
