Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format
derived from SGML. Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale
electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in
the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. XPath language
is the result of an effort to provide address parts of an XML document. In
support of this primary purpose, it becomes in a query language against an XML
document. In this paper we present a proposal for the implementation of the
XPath language in logic programming. With this aim we will describe the
representation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts
can be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself.
In particular, we will present how to index XML documents in logic programs:
rules are supposed to be stored in main memory, however facts are stored in
secondary memory by using two kind of indexes: one for each XML tag, and other
for each group of terminal items. In addition, we will study how to query by
means of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML
document. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the
XPath expression. Finally, we will also explain how to combine the indexing and
the top-down evaluation of the logic program. To appear in Theory and Practice
