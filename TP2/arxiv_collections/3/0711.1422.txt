The asymptotic mean number of distinct sites visited by a subdiffusive
continuous time random walker in two dimensions seems not to have been
explicitly calculated anywhere in the literature. This number has been
calculated for other dimensions for only one specific asymptotic behavior of
the waiting time distribution between steps. We present an explicit derivation
for two cases in all integer dimensions so as to formally complete a tableaux
of results. In this tableaux we include the dominant as well as subdominant
contributions in all integer dimensions. Other quantities that can be
calculated from the mean number of distinct sites visited are also discussed.
