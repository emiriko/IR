SN 1987A observations have been used to place constraints on the interactions
between standard model particles and unparticles. In this study we calculate
the energy loss from the supernovae core through scalar, pseudo scalar, vector,
pseudo vector unparticle emission from nuclear bremsstrahlung for degenerate
nuclear matter interacting through one pion exchange. In order to examine the
constraints on $d_{\cal U}=1$ we considered the emission of scalar, pseudo
scalar, vector, pseudo vector and tensor through the pair annihilation process
$e^+e^-\to {\cal U} \gamma $. In addition we have re-examined other pair
annihilation processes. The most stringent bounds on the dimensionless coupling
constants for $d_{\cal U} =1$ and $\Lambda_{\cal U}= m_Z$ are obtained from
nuclear bremsstrahlung process for the pseudo scalar and pseudo-vector
couplings $\bigl|\lambda^{\cal P}_{0,1}\bigr|\leq 4\times 10^{-11}$ and for
tensor interaction, the best limit on dimensionless coupling is obtained from
$e^+ e^-\to {\cal U} \gamma$ and we get $\bigl|\lambda^{\cal T}\bigr| \leq
6\times 10^{-6}$.
