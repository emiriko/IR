Based on a microscopic many-particle theory we investigate the amplification
of polaritons in planar semiconductor microcavities. We study a spatially
perfectly isotropic microcavity system and excitation geometry. For this
system, our analysis shows that a pump-induced vectorial polarization
anisotropy can lead to a spatial anisotropy in the stimulated amplification of
polaritons. This effect is brought about by the interplay of the
longitudinal-transverse cavity mode splitting (TE-TM splitting) and the
spin-dependence of the polariton-polariton scattering processes.
