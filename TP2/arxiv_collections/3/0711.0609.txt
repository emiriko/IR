Using the recent formulation of Noether's theorem for the problems of the
calculus of variations with fractional derivatives, the Lagrange multiplier
technique, and the fractional Euler-Lagrange equations, we prove a Noether-like
theorem to the more general context of the fractional optimal control. As a
corollary, it follows that in the fractional case the autonomous Hamiltonian
does not define anymore a conservation law. Instead, it is proved that the
fractional conservation law adds to the Hamiltonian a new term which depends on
the fractional-order of differentiation, the generalized momentum, and the
fractional derivative of the state variable.
