Numerous exact solutions to the nonlinear mean-field equations of motion are
constructed for multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates on one, two, and three
dimensional optical lattices. We find both stationary and nonstationary
solutions, which are given in closed form. Among these solutions are a
vortex-anti-vortex array on the square optical lattice and modes in which two
or more components slosh back and forth between neighboring potential wells. We
obtain a variety of solutions for multicomponent condensates on the simple
cubic lattice, including a solution in which one condensate is at rest and the
other flows in a complex three-dimensional array of intersecting vortex lines.
A number of physically important solutions are stable for a range of parameter
values, as we show by direct numerical integration of the equations of motion.
