This paper presents an innovative application of EDAA - European design and
Automation Association 1149.4 and the Integrated Diagnostic Reconfiguration
(IDR) as tools for the implementation of an embedded test solution for an
Automotive Electronic Control Unit implemented as a fully integrated mixed
signal system. The paper described how the test architecture can be used for
fault avoidance with results from a hardware prototype presented. The paper
concludes that fault avoidance can be integrated into mixed signal electronic
systems to handle key failure modes.
