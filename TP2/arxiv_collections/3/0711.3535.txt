Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC) represent a unique tool to probe the in-medium
nuclear interaction in regions away from saturation. In this work we present a
selection of reaction observables in dissipative collisions particularly
sensitive to the isovector part of the interaction, i.e. to the symmetry term
of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS). At low energies the behavior of the
symmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and fragment
production mechanisms. We will first discuss the recently observed Dynamical
Dipole Radiation, due to a collective neutron-proton oscillation during the
charge equilibration in fusion and deep-inelastic collisions. We will review in
detail all the main properties, yield, spectrum, damping and angular
distributions, revealing important isospin effects. Reactions induced by
unstable 132Sn beams appear to be very promising tools to test the
sub-saturation Isovector EoS. Predictions are also presented for deep-inelastic
and fragmentation collisions induced by neutron rich projectiles. The
importance of studying violent collisions with radioactive beams at low and
Fermi energies is finally stressed.
