In this paper we discuss Internal Relativity, a recent program to address the
problem of quantum gravity. In our approach we change the relationship between
spacetime and matter. Currently we view matter as propagating on spacetime.
Einstein's equations encode how spacetime curves due to the presence of matter
and how spacetime, in turn, tells matter how to propagate. In internal
realtivity matter and spacetime cease to exist as distinct entities, rather,
they arise simultaneously from an underlying quantum system. It is through the
emergent matter degrees of freedom that geometry is inferred. We have termed
our program Internal Relativity to stress the importance of looking at the
system from the point of view of an internal observer. We argue that special
relativity is then a natural consequence of this viewpoint. The most important
new aspect of Internal Relativity involves how gravity appears. It is not just
a new quantum theory of gravity but a new theory of gravity. We also argue that
the presence of a massive object implies curvature. In particular we show that
Newtonian gravity arises in the appropriate limit. Our argument implies that
there is no propagation without gravitation.
