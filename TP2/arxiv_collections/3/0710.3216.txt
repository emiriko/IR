Using derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves we construct a knot
homology theory which categorifies the quantum sl(m) knot polynomial. Our knot
homology naturally satisfies the categorified MOY relations and is
conjecturally isomorphic to Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Our construction is
motivated by the geometric Satake correspondence and is related to Manolescu's
by homological mirror symmetry.
