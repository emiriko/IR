In the study of transport in inhomogeneous systems it is common to construct
transport equations invoking the inhomogeneous Fick law. The validity of this
approach requires that at least two ingredients be present in the system.
First, finite characteristic length and time scales associated to the dominant
transport process must exist. Secondly, the transport mechanism must satisfy a
microscopic symmetry: global reversibility. Global reversibility is often
satisfied in nature. However, many complex systems exhibit a lack of finite
characteristic scales. In this Letter we show how to construct a generalization
of the inhomogeneous Fick law that does not require the existence of
characteristic scales while still satisfying global reversibility.
