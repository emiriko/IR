We study the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and the $d$-orbital Hall
conductivity (OHC) in metallic $d$-electron systems based on the multiorbital
tight-binding model. The obtained Hall conductivities are much larger than that
in $p$-type semiconductors. The origin of these huge Hall effects is the
"effective Aharonov-Bohm phase" induced by the signs of inter-orbital hopping
integrals as well as atomic spin-orbit interaction. Huge SHC and OHC due to
this mecahnism is ubiquitous in multiorbital transition metals.
