In a distance learning context, providing usual communication tools (forum,
chat, ...) is not always enough to create efficient interactions between
learners and to favour collective knowledge building. A solution consists in
setting-up collective activities which encourage learners to communicate. But,
even in that case, tools can sometimes become a barrier to communication. We
present in this paper examples of specific tools that are designed in order to
favour and to guide communications in an educational context, but also to
foster interactions during learning activities that are not inherently
collaborative. We describe synchronous communication tools (semi-structured
chat), asynchronous tools (temporally structured forum, contextual forum) and a
system which promotes mutual aid between learners.
