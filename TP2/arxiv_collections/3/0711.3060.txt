We study the bimodule structure of the quantum function algebra at roots of 1
and prove that it admits an increasing filtration with factors isomorphic to
the tensor products of the dual of Weyl modules $V_\lambda^* \otimes V_{-
\omega_0 \lambda}^*$. As an application we compute the 0-th Hochschild
cohomology of the function algebra at roots of 1.
