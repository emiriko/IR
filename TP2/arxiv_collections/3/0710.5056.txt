Rare loop-induced decays are sensitive to New Physics in many Standard Model
extensions. In this paper we discuss the potential of the LHCb experiment to
very rare $\mathrm{B_s} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays, radiative penguin $\mathrm{b
\to s}\gamma$ decays and electroweak penguin $\mathrm{b \to s\ell\ell}$ decays.
The experimental strategies and the expected sensitivities are presented.
