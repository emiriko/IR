It has been recently shown that the quantum Boltzmann equations may be
relevant for the leptogenesis scenario. In particular, they lead to a
time-dependent CP asymmetry which depends upon the previous dynamics of the
system. This memory effect in the CP asymmetry is particularly important in
resonant leptogenesis where the asymmetry is generated by the decays of nearly
mass-degenerate right-handed neutrinos. We study the impact of the non-trivial
time evolution of the CP asymmetry in the so-called Minimal Lepton Flavour
Violation framework where the charged-lepton and the neutrino Yukawa couplings
are the only irreducible sources of lepton-flavour symmetry breaking and
resonant leptogenesis is achieved. We show that significant quantitative
differences arise with respect to the case in which the time dependence of the
CP asymmetry is neglected.
