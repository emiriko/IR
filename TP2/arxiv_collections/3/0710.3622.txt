We calculate $p\Xi^0$ potentials from the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter amplitude
measured in the quenched QCD simulation with the spatial lattice volume, (4.4
fm)$^3$. The standard Wilson gauge action with the gauge coupling $\beta=5.7$
on $32^4$ lattice together with the standard Wilson quark action are used. The
hopping parameter $\kappa_{ud}=0.1678$ is chosen for $u$ and $d$ quarks, which
corresponds to $m_{\pi}\simeq 0.37$ GeV. The physical strange quark mass is
used by taking the parameter $\kappa_s=0.1643$ which is deduced from the
physical $K$ meson mass. The lattice spacing $a=0.1420$ fm is determined by the
physical $\rho$ meson mass. We find that the $p\Xi^0$ potential has strong spin
dependence. Strong repulsive core is found in $^1S_0$ channel while the
effective central potential in the $^3S_1$ channel has relatively weak
repulsive core. The potentials also have weak attractive parts in the medium to
long distance region (0.6 fm $\lsim r \lsim 1.2$ fm) in both of the $^1S_0$ and
$^3S_1$ channels.
