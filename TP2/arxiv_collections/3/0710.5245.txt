We introduce a variety of four-dimensional N = 2 matter multiplets which have
not previously appeared explicitly in the literature. Using these, we develop a
class of supersymmetric actions supplying a context for a systematic
exploration of N = 2 matter theories, some of which include Hypermultiplet
sectors in novel ways. We construct an N = 2 supersymmetric field theory in
which the propagating fields are realized off-shell exclusively as Lorentz
scalars and Weyl spinors and which involves a sector with precisely the
R-charge assignments characteristic of Hypermultiplets.
