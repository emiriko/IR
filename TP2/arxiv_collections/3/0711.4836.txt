This work discusses combinatorial and arithmetic aspects of cohomology
vanishing for divisorial sheaves on toric varieties. We obtain a refined
variant of the Kawamata-Viehweg theorem which is slightly stronger. Moreover,
we prove a new vanishing theorem related to divisors whose inverse is nef and
has small Kodaira dimension. Finally, we give a new criterion for divisorial
sheaves for being maximal Cohen-Macaulay.
