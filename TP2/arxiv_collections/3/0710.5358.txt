We evaluate vacuum energy density of Schnabl's solution using the level
truncation calculation and the total action including interaction terms. The
level truncated solution provides vacuum energy density expected both for
tachyon vacuum and trivial pure gauge. We discuss the role of the phantom term
to reproduce correct vacuum energy.
