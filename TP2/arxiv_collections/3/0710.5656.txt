We discuss a solution describing a rotating wormhole in the theory of gravity
with a scalar field with negative kinetic energy. To solve the problem we use
the assumption about slow rotation. The role of a small dimensionless parameter
plays the ratio of the linear velocity of rotation of the wormhole's throat and
the velocity of light. The rotating wormhole solution is constructed in the
framework of the first order approximation with respect to the small parameter.
We analyze the obtained solution and study the motion of test particles and the
propagation of light in the spacetime of rotating wormhole.
