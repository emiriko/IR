We solve Dirac equation in the presence of a constant magnetic field in
(3+1)- and (2+1)-dimensions. Quantizing the fermion field, we calculate
$\bar{\psi} \psi$-condensate from first principles for parity conserving and
violating Lagrangians for arbitrary field strength. We make comparison with the
results already known in the literature for some particular cases and point out
the relevance of our work for possible physical applications.
