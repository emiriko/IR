The Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with the small curvature is studied. In such a
scheme the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons is similar to that in a
model with one extra flat dimension. The gravity effects in the Bhabha
scattering at the energy 1 TeV are estimated. The calculations are based on the
analytical formula which describes virtual graviton contributions. It takes
into account both a discrete character of the mass spectrum and nonzero widths
of the KK gravitons.
