Developing observation made in \cite{commut} we show that simple identity of
the commutator type on an associative algebra is in one-to-one correspondence
to 2D (infinite) Toda chain. We introduce representation of elements of
associative algebra that, under some generic conditions, enables derivation of
the Toda chain equation and its Lax pair from the given commutator identity.
