Dynamical mean-field theory is generalized to solve the nonequilibrium
Keldysh boundary problem: a system is started in equilibrium at a temperature
T=0.1, a uniform electric field is turned on at t=0, and the system is
monitored as it approaches the steady state. The focus here is on the Bloch
oscillations of the current and how they decay after their initial appearance
near t=0. The system is evolved out to the longest time allowed by our
computational resources--in most cases we are unable to reach the steady state.
The strongly correlated material is modeled by the spinless Falicov-Kimball
model at half-filling on a hypercubic lattice in d=oo dimensions, which has a
Mott-like metal-insulator transition at U=sqrt{2}. The computational algorithm
employed is highly efficient, parallelizes well, and scales to thousands of
processors. For strong fields, we find beats develop with a period of 2 pi/U,
while for strong interactions, the Bloch oscillations are sharply damped and
become quite irregular in time.
