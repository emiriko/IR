In paper [1] (Avotina et al. Phys. Rev. B,74, 085411 (2006)) the effect of
Fermi surface anisotropy to the conductance of a tunnel point contact, in the
vicinity of which a single point-like defect is situated, has been investigated
theoretically. The oscillatory dependence of the conductance on the distance
between the contact and the defect has been found for a general Fermi surface
geometry. In this paper we apply the method developed in [1] to the calculation
of the conductance of noble metal contacts. An original algorithm, which
enables the computation of the conductance for any parametrically given Fermi
surface, is proposed. On this basis a pattern of the conductance oscillations,
which can be observed by the method of scanning tunneling microscopy, is
obtained for different orientations of the surface for the noble metals.
