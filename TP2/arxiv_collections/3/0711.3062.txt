We present several conjectures on the behavior and clustering properties of
Jack polynomials at \emph{negative} parameter $\alpha=-\frac{k+1}{r-1}$, of
partitions that violate the $(k,r,N)$ admissibility rule of Feigin \emph{et.
al.} [\onlinecite{feigin2002}]. We find that "highest weight" Jack polynomials
of specific partitions represent the minimum degree polynomials in $N$
variables that vanish when $s$ distinct clusters of $k+1$ particles are formed,
with $s$ and $k$ positive integers. Explicit counting formulas are conjectured.
The generalized clustering conditions are useful in a forthcoming description
of fractional quantum Hall quasiparticles.
