The construction of massless Majorana fermions with chiral Yukawa couplings
on the lattice is considered. We find topological obstructions tightly linked
to those underlying the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem. In contradistinction to
chiral fermions the obstructions originate only from the combination of the
Dirac action and the Yukawa term. These findings are used to construct a
chirally invariant lattice action. We also show that the path intgral of this
theory is given by the Pfaffian of the corresponding Dirac operator.
