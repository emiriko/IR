The B Factories have generated a large amount of new results on the tau
lepton. The present status of some selected topics on tau physics is presented:
charged-current universality tests, bounds on lepton-flavour violation, the
determination of alpha_s from the inclusive tau hadronic width, and the
measurement of |V_{us}| through the Cabibbo-suppressed decays of the tau
lepton.
