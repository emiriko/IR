We report on a study of exotic nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn in terms of
the shell model employing a realistic effective interaction derived from the
CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. The short-range repulsion of the bare
potential is renormalized by constructing a smooth low-momentum potential,
V-low-k, that is used directly as input for the calculation of the effective
interaction. In this paper we focus attention on the nuclei 134Sn and 135Sb
which, with an N/Z ratio of 1.68 and 1.65, respectively, are at present the
most exotic nuclei beyond 132Sn for which information exists on excited states.
Comparison shows that the calculated results for both nuclei are in very good
agreement with the experimental data. We present our predictions of the
hitherto unknown spectrum of 136Sn.
