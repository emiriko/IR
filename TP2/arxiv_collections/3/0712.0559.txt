We have studied the coherent spin dynamics in an oblique magnetic field of
electrons localized on donors and placed in the middle of a single CdTe quantum
well, by using a time-resolved optical technique: the photo-induced Faraday
rotation. We showed that this dynamics is affected by a weak Overhauser field
created via the hyperfine interaction of optically spin-polarized donor-bound
electrons with the surrounding nuclear isotopes carrying non-zero spins. We
have measured this nuclear field, which is on the order of a few mT and can
reach a maximum experimental value of 9.4 mT. This value represents 13 % of the
maximal nuclear polarization, and corresponds also to 13 % of maximal
electronic polarization.
