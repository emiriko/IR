We demonstrate how to obtain from the Schwinger-Dyson equations of QCD an
infrared finite ghost propagator in the Feynman gauge. The key ingredient in
this construction is the longitudinal form factor of the non-perturbative
gluon-ghost vertex, which, contrary to what happens in the Landau gauge,
contributes non-trivially to the gap equation of the ghost. The detailed study
of the corresponding vertex equation reveals that in the presence of a
dynamical infrared cutoff this form factor remains finite in the limit of
vanishing ghost momentum. This, in turn, allows the ghost self-energy to reach
a finite value in the infrared, without having to assume any additional
properties for the gluon-ghost vertex, such as the presence of massless poles.
The implications of this result and possible future directions are briefly
outlined.
