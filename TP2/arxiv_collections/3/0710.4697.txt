The increased dominance of intra-die process variations has motivated the
field of Statistical Static Timing Analysis (SSTA) and has raised the need for
SSTA-based circuit optimization. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity
based, statistical gate sizing method. Since brute-force computation of the
change in circuit delay distribution to gate size change is computationally
expensive, we propose an efficient and exact pruning algorithm. The pruning
algorithm is based on a novel theory of perturbation bounds which are shown to
decrease as they propagate through the circuit. This allows pruning of gate
sensitivities without complete propagation of their perturbations. We apply our
proposed optimization algorithm to ISCAS benchmark circuits and demonstrate the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Our results show an improvement
of up to 10.5% in the 99-percentile circuit delay for the same circuit area,
using the proposed statistical optimizer and a run time improvement of up to
56x compared to the brute-force approach.
