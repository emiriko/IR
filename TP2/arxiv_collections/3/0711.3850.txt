We report a fundamental effect of the electromagnetic field induced
modification of the branching ratios for emission into several final states.
The modifications are especially significant if the vacuum into which the atom
is radiating has a finite spectral width comparable with the separation of the
final states. This is easily realizable in cavity QED. Further our results are
quite generic and are applicable to any system interacting with a structured
reservoir.
