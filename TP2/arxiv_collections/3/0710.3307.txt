The phenomenology of the "0.7 anomaly" in quantum point contacts is fully
explained in terms of a quasi-localized state, which forms as the point contact
opens up. Detailed numerical calculations within spin-density functional theory
indeed con rm the emergence of such a state. Quantitative calculations of the
conductance and the noise are obtained using a model based on these
observations, and are in excellent agreement with existing experimental
observations.
