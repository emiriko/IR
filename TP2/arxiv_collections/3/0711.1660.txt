We consider the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Hamiltonian Mean Field
(HMF) model, by focusing in particular on the properties of single-particle
diffusion. As we shall here demonstrate analytically, if the autocorrelation of
momenta in the so-called quasi-stationary states can be fitted by a
q-exponential, then diffusion ought to be normal for q<2, at variance with the
interpretation of the numerical experiments proposed in Refs. A. Pluchino, A.
