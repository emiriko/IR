We present the first measurements of the Berry phase in a superconducting
Cooper pair pump. A fixed amount of Berry phase is accumulated to the
quantum-mechanical ground state in each adiabatic pumping cycle, which is
determined by measuring the charge passing through the device. The dynamic and
geometric phases are identified and measured quantitatively from their
different response when pumping in opposite directions. Our observations, in
particular, the dependencies of the dynamic and geometric effects on the
superconducting phase bias across the pump, agree with the basic theoretical
model of coherent Cooper pair pumping.
