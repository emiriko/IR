To properly discover a charged Higgs Boson ($H^\pm$) requires its spin and
couplings to be determined. We investigate how to utilize $\ttbar$ spin
correlations to analyze the $H^\pm$ couplings in the decay $t\to bH^+\to
b\tau^+\nu_\tau$. Within the framework of a general Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, we
obtain results on the spin analyzing coefficients for this decay and study in
detail its spin phenomenology, focusing on the limits of large and small values
for $\tan\beta$. Using a Monte Carlo approach to simulate full hadron-level
events, we evaluate systematically how the $H^\pm\to\tau^\pm\nu_\tau$ decay
mode can be used for spin analysis. The most promising observables are obtained
from azimuthal angle correlations in the transverse rest frames of
$t(\bar{t})$. This method is particularly useful for determining the coupling
structure of $H^\pm$ in the large $\tan\beta$ limit, where differences from the
SM are most significant.
