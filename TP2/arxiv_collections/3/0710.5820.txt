The C-quadrilateral lattice (CQL), called also the symmetric lattice,
provides geometric interpretation of the discrete CKP equation within the
quadrilateral lattice (QL) theory. We discuss affine-geometric properties of
the lattice emphasizing the role of the Gallucci theorem in the
multidimensional consistency of the CQL. Then we give the algebro-geometric
construction of the lattice. We also present the reduction of the vectorial
fundamental transformation of the QL to the CQL case. In the Appendix we show a
relation between the QL and the so called Darboux maps.
