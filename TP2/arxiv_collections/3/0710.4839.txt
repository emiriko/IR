A 12 bit Pipeline ADC fabricated in a 0.18 $\mu$m pure digital CMOS
technology is presented. Its nominal conversion rate is 110MS/s and the nominal
supply voltage is 1.8V. The effective number of bits is 10.4 when a 10MHz input
signal with 2V_{P-P} signal swing is applied. The occupied silicon area is
0.86mm^2 and the power consumption equals 97mW. A switched capacitor bias
current circuit scale the bias current automatically with the conversion rate,
which gives scaleable power consumption and full performance of the ADC from 20
to 140MS/s.
