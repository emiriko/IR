We firstly propose two kinds of new multi-component BKP (mcBKP) hierarchy
based on the eigenfunction symmetry reduction and nonstandard reduction,
respectively. The first one contains two types of BKP equation with
self-consistent sources which Lax representations are presented. The two mcBKP
hierarchies both admit reductions to the $k-$constrained BKP hierarchy and to
integrable (1+1)-dimensional hierarchy with self-consistent sources, which
include two types of SK equation with self-consistent sources and of
bi-directional SK equations with self-consistent sources.
