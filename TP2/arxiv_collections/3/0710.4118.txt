An approach is presented for identifying separatrices in phase space
generated from noisy time series data sets representative of measured
experimental data. These separatrices are identified as ridges in the phase
space distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, i.e., Lagrangian coherent
structures (LCS). As opposed to previous approaches, the LCS is identified
using only trajectories since no analytical or data-defined vector field is
available. The method is applied to a biological simulation in which the
separatrix reveals a basin of stability. These results suggest that the method
will be a fruitful approach to time series analysis, particularly in cases
where a limited number of trajectories are available as might be encountered in
experiments.
