Viscous corrections to relativistic hydrodynamics, which are usually
formulated for small velocity g radients, have recently been extended from
Navier-Stokes formulations to a class of treatments based on Israel-Stewart
equations. Israel-Stewart treatments, which treat the spatial components of the
s tress-energy tensor tau_ij as dynamical objects, introduce new parameters,
such as the relaxati on times describing non-equilibrium behavior of the
elements tau_ij. By considering linear resp onse theory and entropy
constraints, we show how the additional parameters are related to fluctuatio ns
of tau_ij. Furthermore, the Israel-Stewart parameters are analyzed for their
ability to prov ide stable and physical solutions for sound waves. Finally, it
is shown how these parameters, which are naturally described by correlation
functions in real time, might be constrained by lattice calcu lations, which
are based on path-integral formulations in imaginary time.
