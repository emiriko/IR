Spin-polarized transport is investigated in normal metal-superconductor (NS)
junctions as a function of interface transmissivity as well as temperature when
the density of states of a superconductor is Zeeman-split in response to an
exchange field (h_exc). Similarly to the "absolute spin-valve effect" predicted
by D. Huertas-Hernando et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 047003 (2002)] in
superconducting proximity structures, we show that NS junctions can be used to
generate highly spin-polarized currents, in alternative to half-metallic
ferromagnets. In particular, the spin-polarized current obtained is largely
tunable in magnitude and sign by acting on bias voltage and h_exc. While for
tunnel contacts the current polarization can be as high as 100%, for
transparent junctions it is dominated by the minority spin species. The effect
can be enhanced by electron "cooling" provided by the superconducting gap.
