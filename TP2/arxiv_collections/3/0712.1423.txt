In line with the studies presented in the parts I and II of this paper, the
structure of a laminar rich premixed methane flame doped with cyclopentene has
been investigated. The gases of this flame contains 15.3% (molar) of methane,
26.7% of oxygen and 2.4% cyclopentene corresponding to an equivalence ratio of
1.79 and a ratio C5H8 / CH4 of 16 %. The flame has been stabilized on a burner
at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the
burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The temperature ranged from 627 K close to the
burner up to 2027 K. Quantified species included usual methane C0-C2 combustion
products, but also propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene,
1,2-butadiene, vinylacetylene, diacetylene, cyclopentadiene, 1,3-pentadiene,
benzene and toluene. A new mechanism for the oxidation of cyclopentene has been
proposed. The main reaction pathways of consumption of cyclopentene and of
formation of benzene and toluene have been derived from flow rate analyses.
