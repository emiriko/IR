We study nuclear effects in charged current deep inelastic neutrino-iron
scattering in the frame-work of a chi^2 analysis of parton distribution
functions. We extract a set of iron PDFs and show that under reasonable
assumptions it is possible to constrain the valence, light sea and strange
quark distributions. Our iron PDFs are used to compute x_{Bj}-dependent and
Q^2-dependent nuclear correction factors for iron structure functions which are
required in global analyses of free nucleon PDFs. We compare our results with
nuclear correction factors from neutrino-nucleus scattering models and
correction factors for charged lepton-iron scattering. We find that, except for
very high x_{Bj}, our correction factors differ in both shape and magnitude
from the correction factors of the models and charged-lepton scattering.
