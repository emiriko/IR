The diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method is extended to solve the old
theoretical physics problem of many-electron atoms and ions in intense magnetic
fields. The feature of our approach is the use of adiabatic approximation wave
functions augmented by a Jastrow factor as guiding functions to initialize the
quantum Monte Carlo prodecure. We calcula te the ground state energies of atoms
and ions with nuclear charges from Z= 2, 3, 4, ..., 26 for magnetic field
strengths relevant for neutron stars.
