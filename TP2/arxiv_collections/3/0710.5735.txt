Using large-scale Monte Carlo calculations, we consider strongly disordered
Heisenberg models on a cubic lattice with missing sites (as in diluted magnetic
semiconductors such as Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As). For disorder ranging from weak to
strong levels of dilution, we identify Curie temperatures and calculate the
critical exponents nu, gamma, eta, and beta finding, per the Harris criterion,
good agreement with critical indices for the pure Heisenberg model where there
is no disorder component. Moreover, we find that thermodynamic quantities (e.g.
the second moment of the magnetization per spin) self average at the
ferromagnetic transition temperature with relative fluctuations tending to zero
with increasing system size. We directly calculate effective critical exponents
for T > T_{c}, yielding values which may differ significantly from the critical
indices for the pure system, especially in the presence of strong disorder.
Ultimately, the difference is only apparent, and eventually disappears when T
is very close to T_{c}.
