In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 207001 (2006)], Doiron-Leyraud et
al. reported a study of low-temperature thermal conductivity of underdoped
YBa2Cu3Oy across the superconductor-insulator boundary and argued for a novel
bosonic mode as well as charge-neutral fermions. In this Comment, we show that
both of these claims are dubious.
