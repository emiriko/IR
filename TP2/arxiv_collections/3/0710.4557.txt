We discuss the structure of topological solitons in a general non-Heisenberg
model of isotropic two-dimensional magnet with spin S=1, in the vicinity of a
special point where the model symmetry is enhanced to SU(3). It is shown that
upon perturbing the SU(3) symmetry, solitons with odd topological charge become
unstable and bind into pairs.
