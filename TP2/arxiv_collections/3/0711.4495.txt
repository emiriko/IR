We revisit the scaling properties of a model for non-equilibrium wetting
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 2710 (1997)], correcting previous estimates of the
critical exponents and providing a complete scaling scheme. Moreover, we
investigate a special point in the phase diagram, where the model exhibits a
roughening transition related to directed percolation. We argue that in the
vicinity of this point evaporation from the middle of plateaus can be
interpreted as an external field in the language of directed percolation. This
analogy allows us to compute the crossover exponent and to predict the form of
the phase transition line close to its terminal point.
