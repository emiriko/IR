We predict the branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating radion decays
r -> e^{\pm} \mu^{\pm}, r -> e^{\pm} \tau^{\pm} and r ->\mu^{\pm} \tau^{\pm} in
the framework of the Randall-Sundrum scenario that the lepton flavor violation
is carried by the scalar unparticle mediation. We observe that their BRs are
strongly sensitive to the unparticle scaling dimension and, for its small
values, the branching ratios can reach to the values of the order of 10^{-8},
for the heavy lepton flavor case.
