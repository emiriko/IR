New high statistics Belle data on the $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-$ reaction
cross section measured in the range of pion-pair invariant masses $\sqrt{s}$
between 0.8 GeV and 1.5 GeV are analyzed to clarify the current situation
around the $\sigma(600)$, $f_0(980)$, and $f_2(1270)$ resonances in
$\gamma\gamma$ collisions. The present analysis shows that the direct coupling
constants of the $\sigma(600)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances to $\gamma\gamma$ are
small, and the $\sigma(600)\to\gamma\gamma$ and $f_0(980)\to\gamma\gamma$
decays are four-quark transitions caused by the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+K^-$ loop
mechanisms, respectively. The chiral shielding of the $\sigma(600)$ resonance
takes place in the reactions $\gamma\gamma\to\pi\pi$ as well as in $\pi\pi$
scattering. Some results of a simultaneous description of the
$\gamma\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\gamma\gamma\to\pi^0\pi^0$ Belle data are also
presented. In particular, the following tentative estimate of the
$f_2(1270)\to\gamma\gamma$ decay width is obtained:
$\Gamma_{f_2\to\gamma\gamma}(m^2_{f_2})\approx 3.68$ keV.
