The SuperNEMO project studies the feasibility of employing a technique of
tracking plus calorimetry to search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 100
kg of enriched isotopes. It aims to reach an effective neutrino mass
sensitivity of 50 meV. The current status of the SuperNEMO R&D programme is
described, focusing on the main areas of improvement.
