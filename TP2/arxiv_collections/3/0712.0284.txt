We demonstrate for the first time the strong temporal hysteresis effects in
the kinetics of the pumped and scattered polariton populations in a planar
semiconductor microcavity under a nano-second-long pulsed resonant (by
frequency and angle) excitation above the lower polariton branch. The
hysteresis effects are explained in the model of multi-mode scattering when the
bistability of the nonlinear pumped polariton is accompanied by the explosive
growth of the scattered polaritons population. Subsequent self-organization
process in the nonlinear polariton system results in a new -- dynamically
self-organized -- type of optical parametric oscillator.
