Some novel quasi-planar chiral inclusions, feasible from standard
photo-etching techniques, are proposed. It is shown that such inclusions can be
designed in order to present balanced electric, magnetic and magneto-electric
polarizabilities. Using these inclusions, random and periodic bi-isotropic
artificial metamaterials exhibiting a balanced positive/negative refractive
index can be build up. These metamaterials would exhibit reasonable bandwidths
and excellent matching to free space.
