We considered the thermodynamics in spaces with deformed commutation relation
leading to existence of the minimal length. We developed a classical method of
the partition function evaluation. We calculated the partition function and
heat capacity for ideal gas and harmonic oscillators using this method. The
obtained results are in good agreement with the exact quantum ones. We also
showed that the minimal length introduction reduces degrees of freedom of an
arbitrary system in the high temperature limit significantly.
