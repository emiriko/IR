We show that quantum dots and quantum wires are formed underneath metal
electrodes deposited on a planar semiconductor heterostructure containing a
quantum well. The confinement is due to the self-focusing mechanism of an
electron wave packet interacting with the charge induced on the metal surface.
Induced quantum wires guide the transfer of electrons along metal paths and
induced quantum dots store the electrons in specific locations of the
nanostructure. Induced dots and wires can be useful for devices operating on
the electron spin.
