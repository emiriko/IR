We model the impact of final state interactions on the radio frequency
spectrum of a strongly interacting two-component superfluid Fermi gas. In
addition to a broad asymmetric peak coming from the break-up of Cooper pairs we
find that, for appropriate parameters, one can observe a sharp symmetric
"bound-bound" spectral line coming from the conversion of Cooper pairs in one
channels to pairs/molecules in another.
