We investigate the chiral odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for the
quantum fluctuations of an electron in QED. The light-front wave function
(LFWF) of this system gives a template for the quark spin-one diquark structure
of the valence LFWF of the proton. We express the GPDs in terms of overlaps of
LFWFs and obtain their representation in impact parameter space when the
momentum transfer is purely transverse. We show the spin-orbit correlation
effect of the two-particle LFWF as well as the correlation between the
constituent spin and the transverse spin of the target.
