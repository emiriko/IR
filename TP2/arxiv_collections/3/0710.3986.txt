Microwave band on-chip microcoils are developed for the application to single
electron spin resonance measurement with a single quantum dot. Basic properties
such as characteristic impedance and electromagnetic field distribution are
examined for various coil designs by means of experiment and simulation. The
combined setup operates relevantly in the experiment at dilution temperature.
The frequency responses of the return loss and Coulomb blockade current are
examined. Capacitive coupling between a coil and a quantum dot causes photon
assisted tunneling, whose signal can greatly overlap the electron spin
resonance signal. To suppress the photon assisted tunneling effect, a technique
for compensating for the microwave electric field is developed. Good
performance of this technique is confirmed from measurement of Coulomb blockade
oscillations.
