We study the $B$ meson spectroscopy allowing the mixture of conventional $P$
wave quark-antiquark states and four-quark components. A similar picture was
used to describe the new $D_J$ and $D_{sJ}$ open charm mesons. The four-quark
components shift the masses of some positive parity $B_{sJ}$ states below their
corresponding isospin preserving two-meson threshold and therefore they are
expected to be narrow. Electromagnetic decay widths are analyzed.
