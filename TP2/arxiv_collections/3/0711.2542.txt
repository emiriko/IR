It is shown that SU(2) QCD admits an dual Abelian-Higgs phase, with a Higgs
vacuum type of type-II superconductor. This is done by using connection
decomposition for the gluon field and the random-direction approximation. Using
bag picture with soft wall, we presented a calculational procedure for glueball
energy based on the recent proof for wall-vortices [Nucl. Phys. B 741(2006)1].
