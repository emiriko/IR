Infrared finite solutions for the gluon propagator of pure QCD are obtained
from the gauge-invariant non-linear Schwinger-Dyson equation formulated in the
Feynman gauge of the background field method. These solutions may be fitted
using a massive propagator, with the special characteristic that the effective
mass employed drops asymptotically as the inverse square of the momentum
transfer, in agreement with general operator-product expansion arguments. Due
to the presence of the dynamical gluon mass the strong effective charge
extracted from these solutions freezes at a finite value, giving rise to an
infrared fixed point for QCD.
