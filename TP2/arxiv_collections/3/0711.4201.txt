In this review, we propose a summary of the most recent advances in the
first-principles study of ferroelectric oxide epitaxial thin films and
multilayers. We discuss in detail the key roles of mechanical and electrical
boundary conditions, providing to the reader the basic background for a simple
and intuitive understanding of the evolution of the ferroelectric properties in
many nanostructures. Going further we also highlight promising new avenues and
future challenges within this exciting field or researches.
