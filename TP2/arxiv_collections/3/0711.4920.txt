Using the COLTRIMStechnique, scattering angle differential cross sections for
single and double electron capture in collisions of protons and $He\sp{1,2+}$
projectiles with helium atoms for incident energies of $60-630 keV/u$ are
measured. We also report new theoretical results obtained by means of four-body
one-channel distorted wave models (CDW-BFS, CDW-BIS and BDW), and find mixed
agreement with the measured data.
