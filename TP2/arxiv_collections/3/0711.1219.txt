We describe an extension of multi-speckle diffusing wave spectroscopy adapted
to follow the non-stationary microscopic dynamics in drying films and coatings
in a very reactive way and with a high dynamic range. We call this technique
"Adaptive Speckle Imaging Interferometry". We introduce an efficient tool, the
inter-image distance, to evaluate the speckle dynamics, and the concept of
"speckle rate" (SR, in Hz) to quantify this dynamics. The adaptive algorithm
plots a simple kinetics, the time evolution of the SR, providing a non-invasive
characterization of drying phenomena. A new commercial instrument, called
HORUS(R), based on ASII and specialized in the analysis of film formation and
drying processes is presented.
