Masses of fermions in the SO(10) 16-plet are constructed using only the 10,
120 and 126 scalar multiplets. The mass matrices are restricted to be hermitian
and the theory is constructed to have certain assumed quark masses, charged
lepton masses and CKM matrix in accord with data. The remaining free parameters
are found by fitting to light neutrino masses and MSN matrices result as
predictions.
