We calculate mesonic two-point functions in the epsilon-regime of two-flavor
QCD on the lattice with exact chiral symmetry. We use gauge configurations of
size 16^3 32 at the lattice spacing a \sim 0.11 fm generated with dynamical
overlap fermions. The sea quark mass is fixed at \sim 3 MeV and the valence
quark mass is varied in the range 1-4 MeV, both of which are in the
epsilon-regime. We find a good consistency with the expectations from the
next-to-leading order calculation in the epsilon-expansion of (partially
quenched) chiral perturbation theory. From a fit we obtain the pion decay
constant F=87.3(5.6) MeV and the chiral condensate Sigma^{MS}=[239.8(4.0) MeV
]^3 up to next-to-next-to-leading order contributions.
