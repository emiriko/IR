Light storage in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate is one of the most
practical usage of these coherent atom-optical systems. In order to make them
even more practical, it is necessary to enhance our ability to inject multiple
pulses into the condensate. In this paper, we report that dispersion of pulses
injected into the condensate can be compensated by optical nonlinearity. In
addition, we will present a brief review of our earlier results in which
enhancement of light storage capacity is accomplished by utilizing multi-mode
light propagation or choosing an optimal set of experimental parameters.
