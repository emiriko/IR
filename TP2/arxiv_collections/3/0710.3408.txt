In the present work we study numerical solution of the radial Dirac equation
in a specific case - ab-initio pseudopotential generating process - which is
needed within the electronic structure calculations using a Density Functional
Theory (DFT) combined with a pseudopotential method. We give a brief
introduction to DFT, derive the radial Dirac and Schrodinger equations, show
how to solve them both for a given energy and as an eigenvalue problem using a
known asymptotic behavior of the solution. Next we compare the nonrelativistic
and relativistic eigenvalues for one electron atom. Finally we state a few
words about the computer implementation.
