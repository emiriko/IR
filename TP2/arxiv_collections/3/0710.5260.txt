In the presence of spin-orbit interactions, the steady state established for
spin distributions in an electric field is qualitatively different from the
steady state for charge distributions. This is primarily because the steady
state established for spin distributions involves spin precession due to
spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate in this work that the spin density matrix
in an external electric field acquires two corrections with different
dependencies on the characteristic momentum scattering time. One part is
associated with conserved spins, diverges in the clean limit and is responsible
for the establishment of a steady-state spin density in electric fields.
Another part is associated with precessing spins, is finite in the clean limit
and is responsible for the establishment of spin currents in electric fields.
Scattering between these distributions has important consequences for spin
dynamics and spin-related effects in general, and explains some recent puzzling
observations, which are captured by our unified theory.
