We write explicit and self-contained asymptotic expressions for the tensorial
B, C and D Passarino-Veltman functions. These include quadratic and linear
logarithmic terms, as well as subleading constant terms. Only mass-suppressed
O(m^2/s) contributions are neglected. We discuss the usefulness of such
expressions, particularly for studying one-loop effects in 2-to-2 body
processes at high energy.
