We make a simple ansatz for the supersymmetric lepton-number violating Yukawa
couplings, by relating them to the corresponding Higgs Yukawa couplings. This
reduces the free B$_3$ parameters from 36 to 6. We fit these parameters to
solve the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies in terms of neutrino
oscillations. The resulting couplings are consistent with the stringent
low-energy bounds. We investigate the resulting LHC collider signals for a stau
LSP scenario.
