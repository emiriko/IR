We report on preliminary results on the measurement of variations of the
Casimir energy in rigid cavities through its influence on the superconducting
transition of in-cavity aluminium (Al) thin films. After a description of the
experimental apparatus we report on a measurement made with thermal photons,
discussing its implications for the zero-point photons case. Finally we show
the preliminary results for the zero-point case.
