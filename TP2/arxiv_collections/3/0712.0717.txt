We show an all-optical method of making 7Li condensate using tunability of
the scattering length in the proximity of a Feshbach resonance. We report the
observation of two new Feshbach resonances on |F = 1;mF = 0> state. The narrow
(broad) resonance of 7 G (34 G) width is detected at 831 +- 4 G (884 +4 -13 G).
Position of the scattering length zero crossing between the resonances is found
at 836 +- 4 G. The broad resonance is shown to be favorable for run away
evaporation which we perform in a crossed-beam optical dipole trap. Starting
directly form the phase space density of a magneto-optical trap we observe a
Bose-Einstein condensation threshold in less than 3 s of forced evaporation.
