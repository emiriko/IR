Combining the recent progress in semiconductor nanostructures along with the
versatility of photonic crystals in confining and manipulating light, quantum
networks allow for the prospect of an integrated and low power quantum
technology. Within quantum networks, which consist of a system of waveguides
and nanocavities with embedded quantum dots, it has been demonstrated in theory
that many-qubit states stored in electron spins could be teleported from one
quantum dot to another via a single photon using the Single Photon Faraday
Effect. However, in addition to being able to transfer quantum information from
one location to another, quantum networks need added functionality such as (1)
controlling the flow of the quantum information and (2) performing specific
operations on qubits that can be easily integrated. In this paper, we show how
in principle a single photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which uses the
concept of the single photon Faraday Effect to manipulate the geometrical phase
of a single photon, can be operated both as a switch to control the flow of
quantum information inside the quantum network and as various single qubit
quantum gates to perform operations on a single photon. Our proposed
Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be fully integrated as part of a quantum
network on a chip. Given that the X gate, the Z gate, and the XZ gate are
essential for the implementation of quantum teleportation, we show explicitly
their implementation by means of our proposed single photon Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. We also show explicitly the implementation of the Hadamard gate
and the single-qubit phase gate, which are needed to complete the universal set
of quantum gates for integrated quantum computing in a quantum network.
