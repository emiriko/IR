We present a study of the photoluminescence (PL) properties of heavily Be
delta-doped GaAs/AlAs multiple quantum wells measured at room and liquid
nitrogen temperatures. Possible mechanisms for photocarriers recombination are
discussed, with a particular focus on the peculiarities of the excitonic and
free carriers-acceptors PL emissions occurring below and above the Mott
metal-insulator transition. Moreover, based on a simple theoretical model, it
is found that the critical impurities concentration to observe the Mott
transition in the MQW samples exhibiting 15 nm wells width and 5 nm-thick
barrier layers is about 3 10E12 cm-2.
