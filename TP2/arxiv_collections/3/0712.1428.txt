A new type of singularity theorem, based on spatial averages of physical
quantities, is presented and discussed. Alternatively, the results inform us of
when a spacetime can be singularity-free. This theorem provides a decisive
observational difference between singular and non-singular, globally
hyperbolic, open cosmological models.
