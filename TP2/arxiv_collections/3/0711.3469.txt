Diamondoids are a unique form of carbon nanostructure best described as
hydrogen-terminated diamond molecules. Their diamond-cage structures and
tetrahedral sp3 hybrid bonding create new possibilities for tuning electronic
band gaps, optical properties, thermal transport, and mechanical strength at
the nanoscale. The recently-discovered higher diamondoids (each containing more
than three diamond cells) have thus generated much excitement in regards to
their potential versatility as nanoscale devices. Despite this excitement,
however, very little is known about the properties of isolated diamondoids on
metal surfaces, a very relevant system for molecular electronics. Here we
report the first molecular scale study of individual tetramantane diamondoids
on Au(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that
both the diamondoid electronic structure and electron-vibrational coupling
exhibit unique spatial distributions characterized by pronounced line nodes
across the molecular surfaces. Ab-initio pseudopotential density functional
calculations reveal that the observed dominant electronic and vibronic
properties of diamondoids are determined by surface hydrogen terminations, a
feature having important implications for designing diamondoid-based molecular
devices.
