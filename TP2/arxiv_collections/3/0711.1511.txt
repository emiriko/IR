Sensitivities to neutrino oscillation parameters for possible very long
baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are discussed. The reach for
observing a non-zero mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, establishing CP violation and
determining the mass hierarchy are compared between various experimental
options. Different possibilities for neutrino beams are briefly described, as
well as the assumptions about the performance of a large water Cherenkov and
liquid Argon detector.
