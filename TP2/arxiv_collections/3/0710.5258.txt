In this paper, we review the low energy electronic structure of the kinetic
energy driven d-wave cuprate superconductors. We give a general description of
the charge-spin separation fermion-spin theory, where the constrained electron
is decoupled as the gauge invariant dressed holon and spin. In particular, we
show that under the decoupling scheme, the charge-spin separation fermion-spin
representation is a natural representation of the constrained electron defined
in a restricted Hilbert space without double electron occupancy. Based on the
charge-spin separation fermion-spin theory, we have developed the kinetic
energy driven superconducting mechanism, where the superconducting state is
controlled by both superconducting gap parameter and quasiparticle coherence.
Within this kinetic energy driven superconductivity, we have discussed the low
energy electronic structure of the single layer and bilayer cuprate
superconductors in both superconducting and normal states, and qualitatively
reproduced all main features of the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
measurements on the single layer and bilayer cuprate superconductors. We show
that the superconducting state in cuprate superconductors is the conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer like with the d-wave symmetry, so that the basic
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer formalism with the d-wave gap function is still valid
in discussions of the low energy electronic structure of cuprate
superconductors, although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy
by exchanging spin excitations. We also show that the well pronounced
peak-dip-hump structure of the bilayer cuprate superconductors in the
superconducting state and double-peak structure in the normal state are mainly
caused by the bilayer splitting.
