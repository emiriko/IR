We present a simple numerical method for the discrete breather construction
based on the idea of the pair synchronization of the particles involved in the
breather vibration. It can be used for obtaining exact breather solutions in
nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices of different types. We illustrate the above
method using chains of the coupled Duffng oscillators. With some additional
approximation, the pair synchronization method leads to a very simple physical
interpretation of the existence of the exact breathers as strictly
time-periodic and spatially localized dynamical objects.
