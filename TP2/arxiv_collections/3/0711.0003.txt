A Drude-Boltzmann theory is used to calculate the transport properties of
bilayer graphene. We find that for typical carrier densities accessible in
graphene experiments, the dominant scattering mechanism is overscreened Coulomb
impurities that behave like short-range scatterers. We anticipate that the
conductivity $\sigma(n)$ is linear in $n$ at high density and has a plateau at
low density corresponding to a residual density of $n^* = \sqrt{n_{\rm imp}
{\tilde n}}$, where ${\tilde n}$ is a constant which we estimate using a
self-consistent Thomas-Fermi screening approximation to be ${\tilde n} \approx
0.01 ~q_{\rm TF}^2 \approx 140 \times 10^{10} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Analytic results
are derived for the conductivity as a function of the charged impurity density.
We also comment on the temperature dependence of the bilayer conductivity.
