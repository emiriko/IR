We consider the EPR experiment in the energy-based stochastic reduction
framework. A gedanken set up is constructed to model the interaction of the
particles with the measurement devices. The evolution of particles' density
matrix is analytically derived. We compute the dependence of the
disentanglement rate on the parameters of the model, and study the dependence
of the outcome probabilities on the noise trajectories. Finally, we argue that
these trajectories can be regarded as non-local hidden variables.
