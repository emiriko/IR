The Bose-Fermi Kondo model captures the physics of the destruction of Kondo
screening, which is of extensive current interest to the understanding of
quantum critical heavy fermion metals. There are presently limited theoretical
methods to study the finite temperature properties of the Bose-Fermi Kondo
model. Here we provide some of the consistency checks on the cluster-Monte
Carlo method, which we have recently applied to the Ising-anisotropic
Bose-Fermi Kondo model. We show that the method correctly captures the scaling
properties of the Kondo phase, as well as those on approach to the
Kondo-destroying quantum critical point. We establish that comparable results
are obtained when the Kondo couplings are placed at or away from a Toulouse
point.
