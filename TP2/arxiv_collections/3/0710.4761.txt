This paper describes two research projects that develop new low-cost
techniques for testing devices with multiple high-speed (2 to 5 Gbps) signals.
Each project uses commercially available components to keep costs low, yet
achieves performance characteristics comparable to (and in some ways exceeding)
more expensive ATE. A common CMOS FPGA-based logic core provides flexibility,
adaptability, and communication with controlling computers while customized
positive emitter-coupled logic (PECL) achieves multi-gigahertz data rates with
about $\pm$25ps timing accuracy.
