We study the amounts of fine-tuning of the parameters of the MSSM with
non-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses
(the NUHM) that would be required for the relic neutralino density to lie
within the range favoured by WMAP and other astrophysical and cosmological
observations. Such dark matter fine-tuning is analogous to the commonly studied
electroweak fine-tuning associated with satisfying the electroweak symmetry
breaking conditions, which we also study for completeness. We identify several
distinct regions of the NUHM parameter space: a bulk region, a $\stau-\neut$
coannihilation region, a pseudoscalar Higgs funnel region, a focus-point
bino/higgsino region and a $\sneut-\neut$ coannihilation region. Within each
region, we analyse specific representative points for which we provide
breakdowns of the contributions to the dark matter fine-tuning associated with
the different NUHM parameters. In general, the NUHM offers points with both
both smaller and larger amounts of dark matter fine-tuning than points in the
corresponding regions of the CMSSM. Lower amounts of dark matter fine-tuning
typically arise at points where several different (co)annihilation processes
contribute, e.g., at junctions between regions with different dominant
processes. We comment on the prospects for using collider measurements to
estimate the likely dark matter density within the NUHM framework.
