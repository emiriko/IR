Optical emission from type-II ZnTe/ZnSe quantum dots demonstrates large and
persistent oscillations in both the peak energy and intensity indicating the
formation of coherently rotating states. Furthermore, the Aharanov-Bohm (AB)
effect is shown to be remarkably robust and persists until 180K. This is at
least one order of magnitude greater than the typical temperatures in
lithographically defined rings. To our knowledge this is the highest
temperature at which the AB effect has been observed in semiconductor
structures.
