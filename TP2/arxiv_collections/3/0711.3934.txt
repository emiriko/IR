Numerical results for the local field distributions of a family of Ising
spin-glass models are presented. In particular, the Edwards-Anderson model in
dimensions two, three, and four is considered, as well as spin glasses with
long-range power-law-modulated interactions that interpolate between a
nearest-neighbour Edwards-Anderson system in one dimension and the
infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Remarkably, the local field
distributions only depend weakly on the range of the interactions and the
dimensionality, and show strong similarities except for near zero local field.
