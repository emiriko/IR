We consider two neuronal networks coupled by long-range excitatory
interactions. Oscillations in the gamma frequency band are generated within
each network by local inhibition. When long-range excitation is weak, these
oscillations phase-lock with a phase-shift dependent on the strength of local
inhibition. Increasing the strength of long-range excitation induces a
transition to chaos via period-doubling or quasi-periodic scenarios. In the
chaotic regime oscillatory activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation. The
generality of these dynamical properties is assessed in firing-rate models as
well as in large networks of conductance-based neurons.
