A synchrotron x-ray diffraction study of the crystallographic structure of
PrO2 in the Jahn-Teller distorted phase is reported. The distortion of the
oxygen sublattice, which was previously ambiguous, is shown to be a chiral
structure in which neighbouring oxygen chains have opposite chiralities. A
temperature dependent study of the magnetic excitation spectrum, probed by
neutron inelastic scattering, is also reported. Changes in the energies and
relative intensities of the crystal field transitions provide an insight into
the interplay between the static and dynamic Jahn-Teller effects.
