We have recently constructed a photon position operator with commuting
components. This was long thought to be impossible, but our position
eigenvectors have a vortex structure like twisted light. Thus they are not
spherically symmetric and the position operator does not transform as a vector,
so that previous non-existence arguments do not apply. We find two classes of
position eigenvectors and obtain photon wave functions by projection onto the
bases of position eigenkets that they define, following the usual rules of
quantum mechanics. The hermitian position operator, r0, leads to a
Landau-Peierls wave function, while field-like eigenvectors of the nonhermitian
position operator and its adjoint lead to a biorthonormal basis. These two
bases are equivalent in the sense that they are related by a similarity
transformation. The eigenvectors of the nonhermitian position operators lead to
a field-potential wave function pair. These field-like positive frequency wave
functions satisfy Maxwell's equations, and thus justify the supposition that
MEs describe single photon wave mechanics. The expectation value of the number
operator is photon density with undetected photons integrated over, consistent
with Feynman's conclusion that the density of non-interacting particles can be
interpreted as probability density.
