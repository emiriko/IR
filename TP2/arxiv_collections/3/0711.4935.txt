We propose Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as a means for recognising event-by-event
fluctuations of rapidity distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
Such fluctuations may be induced by the spinodal decomposition of the rapidly
expanding system during the 1st order quark-hadron phase transition.
