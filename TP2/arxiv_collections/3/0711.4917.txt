We show that from the R^{2} high order gravity theory it is possible to
produce, in the linearized approch, particles which can be seen like massive
modes of gravitational waves (GWs). The presence of the mass generates a
longitudinal force in addition of the transverse one which is proper of the
massless gravitational waves and the response an interferometer to the effect
is computed. This could be, in principle, important to discriminate among the
gravity theories. The presence of the mass could also have important
applications in cosmology because the fact that gravitational waves can have
mass could give a contribution to the dark matter of the Universe.
