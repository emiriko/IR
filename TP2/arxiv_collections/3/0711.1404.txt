Many experiments have shown that locality-realism theory is at variance with
quantum mechanics predictions. Although locality and realism, which are two
different conceptions, are given respective definition, the descriptions of the
both are a little of abstract when they are applied to real experimental
situations. The abstract descriptions result in difficulty for one to judge
whether the variance come from locality or realism or both. Here we provide
more detailed descriptions of locality and realism, and show that any system
being in a pure state or a non-maximally mixed state has property of
non-realism. We also present experimental schemes feasible under current
technologies to test the non-locality realsim. The connections between
non-locality and entanglement and correlation are also discussed.
