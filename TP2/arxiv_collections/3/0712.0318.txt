A dynamical theory which accounts for all microscopic one-electron processes
is used to study the spectral function of the 1D Hubbard model for the whole
$(k, \omega)$-plane, beyond previous studies which focused on the weight
distribution in the vicinity of the singular branch lines only. While our
predictions agree with those of the latter studies concerning the
tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) related singular features in photoemission of
the organic compound tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ)
metallic phase, the generalized theory also leads to quantitative agreement
concerning the tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) related finite-energy spectral
features, which are found to correspond to a value of the on-site repulsion $U$
larger than for TCNQ. Our study reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the
unusual spectral features of TTF-TCNQ and provides a good overall description
of those features for the whole $(k, \omega)$-plane.
