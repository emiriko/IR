We present sensitive measurements of the Hall effect and magnetoresistance in
CeIrIn${_5}$ down to temperatures of 50 mK and magnetic fields up to 15 T. The
presence of a low temperature coherent Kondo state is established. Deviations
from Kohler's rule and a quadratic temperature dependence of the cotangent of
the Hall angle are reminiscent of properties observed in the high temperature
superconducting cuprates. The most striking observation pertains to the
presence of a \textit{precursor} state--characterized by a change in the Hall
mobility--that appears to precede the superconductivity in this material, in
similarity to the pseudogap in the cuprate high $T_c$ superconductors.
