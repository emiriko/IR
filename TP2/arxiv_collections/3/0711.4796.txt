The physics at the event horizon resembles the behavior of waves in moving
media. Horizons are formed where the local speed of the medium exceeds the wave
velocity. We use ultrashort pulses in microstructured optical fibers to
demonstrate the formation of an artificial event horizon in optics. We observed
a classical optical effect, the blue-shifting of light at a white-hole horizon.
We also show by theoretical calculations that such a system is capable of
probing the quantum effects of horizons, in particular Hawking radiation.
