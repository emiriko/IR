CP-violating effects in the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model with complex parameters (cMSSM) are induced by potentially large
higher-order corrections. As a consequence, all three neutral Higgs bosons can
mix with each other. Recent results for loop corrections in the Higgs sector of
the cMSSM are reviewed. Results for propagator-type corrections of O(alpha_t
alpha_s) and complete one-loop results for Higgs cascade decays of the kind h_a
-> h_b h_c are summarised, and the proper treatment of external Higgs bosons in
Higgs-boson production and decay processes is discussed.
