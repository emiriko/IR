We argue that when the number of spins $N$ in the SK model is finite, the
Parisi scheme can be terminated after $K$ replica-symmetry breaking steps,
where $K(N) \propto N^{1/6}$. We have checked this idea by Monte Carlo
simulations: we expect the typical number of peaks and features $R$ in the
(non-bond averaged) Parisi overlap function $P_J(q)$ to be of order $2K(N)$,
and our counting (for samples of size $N$ up to 4096 spins) gives results which
are consistent with our arguments. We can estimate the leading finite size
correction for any thermodynamic quantity by finding its $K$ dependence in the
Parisi scheme and then replacing $K$ by K(N). Our predictions of how the
Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the internal energy of the system approach
their thermodynamic limit compare well with the results of our Monte Carlo
simulations. The $N$-dependence of the sample-to-sample fluctuations of
thermodynamic quantities can also be obtained; the total internal energy should
have sample-to-sample fluctuations of order $N^{1/6}$, which is again
consistent with the results of our numerical simulations.
