We introduce a 3D multiscale kinematic velocity field as a model to simulate
Lagrangian turbulent dispersion. The incompressible velocity field is a
nonlinear deterministic function, periodic in space and time, that generates
chaotic mixing of Lagrangian trajectories. Relative dispersion properties, e.g.
the Richardson's law, are correctly reproduced under two basic conditions: 1)
the velocity amplitudes of the spatial modes must be related to the
corresponding wavelengths through the Kolmogorov scaling; 2) the problem of the
lack of "sweeping effect" of the small eddies by the large eddies, common to
kinematic simulations, has to be taken into account. We show that, as far as
Lagrangian dispersion is concerned, our model can be successfully applied as
additional sub-grid contribution for Large Eddy Simulations of the planetary
boundary layer flow.
