After revisiting some high points of particle physics and QFT of the two
decades from 1960 to 1980, I comment on the work by Jorge Andre Swieca. I
explain how it fits into the quantum field theory during these two decades and
draw attention to its relevance to the ongoing particle physics research. A
particular aim of this article is to direct thr readers mindfulness to the
relevance of what at the time of Swieca was called "the Schwinger Higgs
screening mechanism". which, together with recent ideas which generalize the
concept of gauge theories, has all the ingredients to revolutionize the issue
of gauge theories and the standard model.
