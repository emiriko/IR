Quantum observables can be identified with vector fields on the sphere of
normalized states. Consequently, the uncertainty relations for quantum
observables become geometric statements. In the Letter the familiar uncertainty
relation follows from the following stronger statement: Of all parallelograms
with given sides the rectangle has the largest area.
