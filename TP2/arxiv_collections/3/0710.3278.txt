The coexistence between different types of templates has been the choice
solution to the information crisis of prebiotic evolution, triggered by the
finding that a single RNA-like template cannot carry enough information to code
for any useful replicase. In principle, confining $d$ distinct templates of
length $L$ in a package or protocell, whose survival depends on the coexistence
of the templates it holds in, could resolve this crisis provided that $d$ is
made sufficiently large. Here we review the prototypical package model of
Niesert et al. 1981 which guarantees the greatest possible region of viability
of the protocell population, and show that this model, and hence the entire
package approach, does not resolve the information crisis. This is so because
to secure survival the total information content of the protocell, $Ld$, must
tend to a constant value that depends only on the spontaneous error rate per
nucleotide of the template replication mechanism. As a result, an increase of
$d$ must be followed by a decrease of $L$ to ensure the protocell viability, so
that the net information gain is null.
