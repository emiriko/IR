A correlated random walk approach to diffusion is applied to the disordered
nonoverlapping Lorentz gas. By invoking the Lu-Torquato theory for chord-length
distributions in random media [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 6472 (1993)], an analytic
expression for the diffusion constant in arbitrary number of dimensions d is
obtained. The result corresponds to an Enskog-like correction to the Boltzmann
prediction, being exact in the dilute limit, and better or nearly exact in
comparison to renormalized kinetic theory predictions for all allowed densities
in d=2,3. Extensive numerical simulations were also performed to elucidate the
role of the approximations involved.
