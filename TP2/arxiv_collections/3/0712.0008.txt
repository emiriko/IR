By studying the BPS equations for electrostatic and spherically symmetric
configurations in N=2, d=5 gauged supergravity with vector multiplets and
hypermultiplets coupled, we demonstrate that no regular supersymmetric
black-hole solutions of this kind exist. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is
not possible to construct supersymmetric regular solitons that have the above
symmetries. As a consequence the scalar flow associated to the BPS solutions is
always unbounded.
