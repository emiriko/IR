Inclusive neutrino-nucleus cross sections are calculated using a consistent
relativistic mean-field theoretical framework. The weak lepton-hadron
interaction is expressed in the standard current-current form, the nuclear
ground state is described with the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model, and
the relevant transitions to excited nuclear states are calculated in the
relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation. Illustrative test
calculations are performed for charged-current neutrino reactions on $^{12}$C,
$^{16}$O, $^{56}$Fe, and $^{208}$Pb, and results compared with previous studies
and available data. Using the experimental neutrino fluxes, the averaged cross
sections are evaluated for nuclei of interest for neutrino detectors. We
analyze the total neutrino-nucleus cross sections, and the evolution of the
contribution of the different multipole excitations as a function of neutrino
energy. The cross sections for reactions of supernova neutrinos on $^{16}$O and
$^{208}$Pb target nuclei are analyzed as functions of the temperature and
chemical potential.
