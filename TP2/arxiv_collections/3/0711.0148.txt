We calculate the two form-factors for the four Kaon to pion transitions via a
vector current to order $p^6$ in Chiral Perturbation Theory to first order in
isospin breaking via the quark masses. In addition we derive relations between
these form-factors valid to first order in the up-down quark-mass difference
but to all orders in Chiral Perturbation Theory.
  We present numerical results for all eight form-factors at $t=0$ and for
varying $t$ and for the scalar form-factors at the Callan-Treiman point.
