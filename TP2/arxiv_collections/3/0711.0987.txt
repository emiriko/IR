Concentration bounds for non-product, non-Haar measures are fairly recent:
the first such result was obtained for contracting Markov chains by Marton in
1996 via the coupling method. The work that followed, with few exceptions, also
used coupling. Although this technique is of unquestionable utility as a
theoretical tool, it is not always simple to apply. As an alternative to
coupling, we use the elementary Markov contraction lemma to obtain simple,
useful, and apparently novel concentration results for various Markov-type
processes. Our technique consists of expressing probabilities as matrix
products and applying Markov contraction to these expressions; thus it is
fairly general and holds the potential to yield further results in this vein.
