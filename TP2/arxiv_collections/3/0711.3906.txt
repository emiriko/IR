We propose and test a renormalization procedure which acts in Hilbert space.
We test its efficiency on strongly correlated quantum spin systems by working
out and analyzing the low-energy spectral properties of frustrated quantum spin
systems in different parts of the phase diagram and in the neighbourhood of
quantum critical points.
