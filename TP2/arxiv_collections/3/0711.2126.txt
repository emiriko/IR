We propose and demonstrate a direct method to observe higher-order
whispering-gallery modes in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) at
room temperature. Instead of introducing any defect mode, we show that
suppression of lower-order cavity modes can be achieved by destroying vertical
reflectors with a surface micro-structure. Up to the 23rd azimuthal order
whispering-gallery mode confined laterally by the native oxide layers is
observed in experiments through collecting near-field radiation patterns.
Various vertical emission transverse modes are identified by the spectrum in
experiments as well as numerical simulations.
