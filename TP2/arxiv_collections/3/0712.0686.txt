We have considered a two-particle Bell experiment to visualize the conflict
between rotational invariance of physical laws and a specific local realistic
theory. The experiment is reproducible by using a local realistic theory
obtained in a two-setting Bell experiment. The generalized Bell inequality {[J.
Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 40}, 13101 (2007)]}, which is derived under the
assumption that there exists a rotationally invariant local realistic theory,
turns out to disprove such a local realistic model existing with a two-setting
experiment. This implies that such a model is not rotationally invariant and
should, therefore, be ruled out in some situations.
