If gravity respects quantum mechanics, it is important to identify the
essential postulates of a quantum framework capable of incorporating
gravitational phenomena. Such a construct likely requires elimination or
modification of some of the "standard" postulates of quantum mechanics, in
particular those involving time and measurement. This paper proposes a
framework that appears sufficiently general to incorporate some expected
features of quantum gravity. These include the statement that space and time
may only emerge approximately and relationally. One perspective on such a
framework is as a sort of generalization of the S-matrix approach to dynamics.
Within this framework, more dynamical structure is required to fully specify a
theory; this structure is expected to lack some of the elements of local
quantum field theory. Some aspects of this structure are discussed, both in the
context of scattering of perturbations about a flat background, and in the
context of cosmology.
