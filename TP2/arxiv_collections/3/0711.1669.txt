Applying software defect esimation techniques and presenting this information
in a compact and impactful decision table can clearly illustrate to
collaborative groups how critical this position is in the overall development
cycle. The Test Risk Matrix described here has proven to be a valuable addition
to the management tools and approaches used in developing large scale software
on several releases. Use of this matrix in development planning meetings can
clarify the attendant risks and possible consequences of carrying out or
bypassing specific test activities.
