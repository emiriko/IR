We study entanglement generation between two charge qubits due to the strong
coupling with a common bosonic environment (Ohmic bath). The coupling to the
boson bath is a source of both quantum noise (leading to decoherence) and an
indirect interaction between qubits. As a result, two effects compete as a
function of the coupling strength with the bath: entanglement generation and
charge localization induced by the bath. These two competing effects lead to a
non-monotonic behavior of the concurrence as a function of the coupling
strength with the bath. As an application, we present results for charge qubits
based on double quantum dots.
