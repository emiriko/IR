We evaluate Generalized Parton Distributions of the pion in two chiral quark
models: the Spectral Quark Model and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with a
Pauli-Villars regularization. We proceed by the evaluation of double
distributions through the use of a manifestly covariant calculation based on
the alpha representation of propagators. As a result polynomiality is
incorporated automatically and calculations become simple. In addition,
positivity and normalization constraints, sum rules and soft pion theorems are
fulfilled. We obtain explicit formulas, holding at the low-energy quark-model
scale. The expressions exhibit no factorization in the t-dependence. The QCD
evolution of those parton distributions is carried out to experimentally or
lattice accessible scales. We argue for the need of evolution by comparing the
Parton Distribution Function and the Parton Distribution Amplitude of the pion
to the available experimental and lattice data, and confirm that the
quark-model scale is low, about 320 MeV.
