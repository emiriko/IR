We present a new way of nano-engineering graphene using defect domains. These
regions have ring structures that depart from the usual honeycomb lattice,
though each carbon atom still has three nearest neighbors. A set of stable
domain structures is identified using density functional theory (DFT),
including blisters, ridges, ribbons, and metacrystals. All such structures are
made solely out of carbon; the smallest encompasses just 16 atoms. Blisters,
ridges and metacrystals rise up out of the sheet, while ribbons remain flat. In
the vicinity of vacancies, the reaction barriers to formation are sufficiently
low that such defects could be synthesized through the thermally activated
restructuring of coalesced adatoms.
