An n dimensional monomial dynamical system over a finite field K is a
nonlinear deterministic time discrete dynamical system with the property that
each of the n component functions is a monic nonzero monomial function in n
variables. In this paper we provide an algebraic and graph theoretic framework
to study the dynamic properties of monomial dynamical systems over a finite
field. Within this framework, characterization theorems for fixed point systems
(systems in which all trajectories end in steady states) are proved. In
particular, we present an algorithm of polynomial complexity to test whether a
given monomial dynamical system over a finite field is a fixed point system.
Furthermore, theorems that complement previous work are presented and
alternative proofs to previous results are supplied.
