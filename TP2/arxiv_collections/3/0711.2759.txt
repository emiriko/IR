We calculate Lorentz-invariant and gauge-invariant quantities characterizing
the product $\sum_a D_R(T^a) F^a_{\mu\nu}$, where $D_R(T^a)$ denotes the matrix
for the generator $T^a$ in the representation $R=$ fundamental and adjoint, for
color SU(3). We also present analogous results for an SU(2) gauge theory.
