Two-dimensional superintegrable systems with one third order and one lower
order integral of motion are reviewed. The fact that Hamiltonian systems with
higher order integrals of motion are not the same in classical and quantum
mechanics is stressed. New results on the use of classical and quantum third
order integrals are presented in Section 5 and 6.
