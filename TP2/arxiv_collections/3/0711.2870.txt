I give a short overview on some of the favorite particle Cold Dark Matter
candidates today, focusing on those having detectable interactions: the axion,
the KK-photon in Universal Extra Dimensions, the heavy photon in Little Higgs
and the neutralino in Supersymmetry. The neutralino is still the most popular,
and today is available in different flavours: SUGRA, nuSUGRA, sub-GUT, Mirage
mediation, NMSSM, effective MSSM, scenarios with CP violation. Some of these
scenarios are already at the level of present sensitivities for direct DM
searches.
