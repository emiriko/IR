We present some results about spontaneous breaking of global symmetries for
four-flavor, three color QCD on compact spaces with two short directions. When
the two short directions have equal length and identical boundary conditions,
there is a single transition. When the two short directions have boundary
conditions of opposite parity and are of roughly equal extent, the C-breaking
and deconfinement transitions separate. When the two short dimensions are of
different length, the transitions are modified in qualitative agreement with
expectations from dimensional reduction. These features resemble the situation
in pure gauge simulations at small and large number of colors.
