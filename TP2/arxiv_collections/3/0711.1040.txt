We study the average density of resonances (DOR) for a semi-infinite
disordered chain, coupled to the outside world by a (semi-infinite) perfect
lead. A set of equations is derived, which provides the general framework for
calculating the average DOR, for an arbitrary disorder and coupling strength.
These general equations are applied to the case of weak coupling and an
asymptotically exact expression for the averaged DOR is derived, in the limit
of small resonance width. This expression is universal, in the sense that it
holds for any degree of disorder and everywhere in the (unperturbed) energy
band.
