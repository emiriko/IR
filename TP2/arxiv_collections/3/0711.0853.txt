Starting with a Gaussian variational ansatz, we predict anisotropic bright
solitons in quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensates consisting of atoms with dipole
moments polarized \emph{perpendicular} to the confinement direction. Unlike
isotropic solitons predicted for the moments aligned with the confinement axis
[Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{95}, 200404 (2005)], no sign reversal of the
dipole-dipole interaction is necessary to support the solitons. Direct 3D
simulations confirm their stability.
