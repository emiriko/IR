Every fraction is a union of points, which are trivial regular fractions. To
characterize non trivial decomposition, we derive a condition for the inclusion
of a regular fraction as follows. Let $F = \sum_\alpha b_\alpha X^\alpha$ be
the indicator polynomial of a generic fraction, see Fontana et al, JSPI 2000,
149-172. Regular fractions are characterized by $R = \frac 1l \sum_{\alpha \in
\mathcal L} e_\alpha X^\alpha$, where $\alpha \mapsto e_\alpha$ is an group
homeomorphism from $\mathcal L \subset \mathbb Z_2^d$ into $\{-1,+1\}$. The
regular $R$ is a subset of the fraction $F$ if $FR = R$, which in turn is
equivalent to $\sum_t F(t)R(t) = \sum_t R(t)$. If $\mathcal H = \{\alpha_1 >...
\alpha_k\}$ is a generating set of $\mathcal L$, and $R = \frac1{2^k}(1 +
e_1X^{\alpha_1}) ... (1 + e_kX^{\alpha_k})$, $e_j = \pm 1$, $j=1 ... k$, the
inclusion condition in term of the $b_\alpha$'s is % \begin{equation}b_0 + e_1
b_{\alpha_1} + >... + e_1 ... e_k b_{\alpha_1 + ... + \alpha_k} = 1.
\tag{*}\end{equation} % The last part of the paper will discuss some examples
to investigate the practical applicability of the previous condition (*).
