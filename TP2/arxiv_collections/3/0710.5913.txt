The large energy-scale behaviour of the parity and time-reversal violating
(PTV) pion-nucleon coupling constant is analyzed in a model combining
renormalization-group techniques and the dressing of the PTV vertex with a pion
loop. With the strong $\pi N N$ vertex as a mixture of the pseudovector and
pseudoscalar couplings, we show that depending on the admixture parameter, two
qualitatively distinct types of behaviour are obtained for the PTV coupling
constant at high energy scales: an asymptotic freedom or a fixed-point. We find
a critical value of the admixture parameter which delineates these two
scenarios. Several examples of the high-energy scale behaviour of the PTV $\pi
N N$ constant are considered, corresponding to realistic hadronic models of the
strong pion-nucleon interaction.
