The effects of absence of inversion symmetry on superconducting states are
investigated theoretically. In particular we focus on the noncentrosymmetric
compounds which have the cubic symmetry $O$ like Li$_2$Pt$_3$B. An appropriate
and isotropic spin-orbital interaction is added in the Hamiltonian and it acts
like a magnetic monopole in the momentum space. The consequent pairing
wavefunction has an additional triplet component in the pseudospin space, and a
Zeeman magnetic field $\bf{B}$ can induce a collinear supercurrent $\bf{J}$
with a coefficient $\kappa(T)$. The effects of anisotropy embedded in the cubic
symmetry and the nodal superconducting gap function on $\kappa(T)$ are also
considered. From the macroscopic perspectives, the pair of mutually induced
$\bf{J}$ and magnetization ${\bf{M}}$ can affect the distribution of magnetic
field in such noncentrosymmetric superconductors, which is studied through
solving the Maxwell equation in the Meissner geometry as well as the case of a
single vortex line. In both cases, magnetic fields perpendicular to the
external ones emerge as a signature of the broken symmetry.
