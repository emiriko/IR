We derive the renormalization group equations for dimensionless couplings and
soft supersymmetry breaking (SSB) parameters given arbitrary high scale inputs,
incorporating 1-loop thresholds. A program (to be incorporated into ISAJET) has
been developed, which includes flavour violating couplings of superparticles
based on an arbitrary framework for the high scale flavour structure of SSB
parameters. The weak scale flavour structure derived in this way can be applied
to the study of SUSY flavour changing decays. As an illustration, we
recalculate the branching ratio of the flavour-violating decay of the top
squark.
