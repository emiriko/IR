This paper is a natural continuation of the study of skew power series rings
A initiated in [P. Schneider and O. Venjakob, On the codimension of modules
over skew power series rings with applications to Iwasawa algebras, J. Pure
Appl. Algebra 204 (2005), 349 - 367.]. We construct skew Laurent series rings B
and show the existence of some canonical Ore sets S for the skew power series
rings A such that a certain completion of the localisation A_S is isomorphic to
B. This is applied to certain Iwasawa algebras. Finally we introduce subrings
of overconvergent skew Laurent series rings.
