Univoque numbers are real numbers $\lambda > 1$ such that the number 1 admits
a unique expansion in base $\lambda$, i.e., a unique expansion $1 = \sum_{j
\geq 0} a_j \lambda^{-(j+1)}$, with $a_j \in \{0, 1, ..., \lceil \lambda \rceil
-1\}$ for every $j \geq 0$. A variation of this definition was studied in 2002
by Komornik and Loreti, together with sequences called {\em admissible
sequences}. We show how a 1983 study of the first author gives both a result of
Komornik and Loreti on the smallest admissible sequence on the set $\{0, 1,
>..., b\}$, and a result of de Vries and Komornik (2007) on the smallest
univoque number belonging to the interval $(b, b+1)$, where $b$ is any positive
integer. We also prove that this last number is transcendental. An avatar of
the Thue-Morse sequence, namely the fixed point beginning in 3 of the morphism
$3 \to 31$, $2 \to 30$, $1 \to 03$, $0 \to 02$, occurs in a "universal" manner.
