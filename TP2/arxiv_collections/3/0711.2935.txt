Quark and lepton flavor signals are studied in four supersymmetric models,
namely the minimal supergravity model, the minimal supersymmetric standard
model with right-handed neutrinos, SU(5) supersymmetric grand unified theory
with right-handed neutrinos and the minimal supersymmetric standard model with
U(2) flavor symmetry. We calculate b --> s(d) transition observables in B_d and
B_s decays, taking the constraint from the B_s--B_s-bar mixing recently
observed at Tevatron into account. We also calculate lepton flavor violating
processes mu --> e gamma, tau --> mu gamma and tau --> e gamma for the models
with right-handed neutrinos. We investigate possibilities to distinguish the
flavor structure of the supersymmetry breaking sector with use of patterns of
various flavor signals which are expected to be measured in experiments such as
MEG, LHCb and a future Super B Factory.
