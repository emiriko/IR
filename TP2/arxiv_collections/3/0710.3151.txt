We report the first results from our comprehensive lattice tool set to
explore non-perturbative aspects of Higgs physics in the Standard Model. We
demonstrate in Higgs-Yukawa models that Higgs mass lower bounds and upper
bounds can be determined in lattice simulations when triviality requires the
necessity of a finite cutoff to maintain non-zero interactions. The vacuum
instability problem is investigated and the lattice approach is compared with
the traditional renormalization group procedure which sets similar goals to
correlate lower and upper Higgs mass bounds with the scale of new physics. A
novel feature of our lattice simulations is the use of Ginsparg-Wilson fermions
to represent the effects of Top quark loops in Higgs dynamics. The need for
chiral lattice fermions is discussed and the approach is extended to full
Top-Higgs-QCD dynamics. We also report results from our large $N_F$ analysis of
Top-Higgs Yukawa models to gain analytic insight and to verify our new lattice
tool set which is deployed in the simulations. The role of non-perturbative
lattice studies to investigate heavy Higgs particle scenarios is illustrated in
extensions of the Standard Model.
