We consider the covariant quantization of generalized abelian gauge theories
on a closed and compact n-dimensional manifold whose space of gauge invariant
fields is the abelian group of Cheeger-Simons differential characters. The
space of gauge fields is shown to be a non-trivial bundle over the orbits of
the subgroup of smooth Cheeger-Simons differential characters. Furthermore each
orbit itself has the structure of a bundle over a multi-dimensional torus. As a
consequence there is a topological obstruction to the existence of a global
gauge fixing condition. A functional integral measure is proposed on the space
of gauge fields which takes this problem into account and provides a
regularization of the gauge degrees of freedom. For the generalized p-form
Maxwell theory closed expressions for all physical observables are obtained.
The Greens functions are shown to be affected by the non-trivial bundle
structure. Finally the vacuum expectation values of circle-valued
homomorphisms, including the Wilson operator for singular p-cycles of the
manifold, are computed and selection rules are derived.
