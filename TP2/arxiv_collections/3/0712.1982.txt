In this work we discuss the emission of low mass dilepton radiation from a
hydrodynamic evolution model of Au-Au collisions and make comparisons with
recent PHENIX measurements. The dilepton emission rates from the hadronic phase
are treated at finite temperature and baryon density and are completely
constrained by broken chiral symmetry in a density expansion. The rates are
expressed in terms of vacuum correlators which are measured in $e^+e^-$
annihilation, $\tau$ decays and photo-reactions on nucleons and nuclei. We
consider two possibilities for the hadronic phase: A chemical equilibrated an
off equilibrium hadronic gas. We find that while chemical off-equilibrium helps
explain part of the low mass (0.15 $\leq$ M GeV $\leq$ 0.7) enhancement seen in
the data there is still a large discrepancy.
