By using a parametrization of the non-linear Walecka model which takes into
account the binding energy of different hyperons, we present a study of
particle production yields measured in central Au-Au collision at RHIC. Two
sets of different hyperon-meson coupling constants are employed in obtaining
the hadron production and chemical freeze-out parameters. These quantities show
a weak dependence on the used hyperon-meson couplings. Results are in good
overall accordance with experimental data. We have found that the repulsion
among the baryons is quite small and, through a preliminary analysis of the
effective mesonic masses, we suggest a way to improve the fittings.
