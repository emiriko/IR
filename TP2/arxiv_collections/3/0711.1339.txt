A pion-quark pairing temperature is defined by a BCS-like relation identified
from a quark-level Goldberger-Treiman relation with a Nambu scalar mass "gap
parameter" taken in the low-mass limit. This intuitive relation predicts the
associated "experimental" lattice-gauge pairing temperature. The opposite
high-mass limit predicts the sigma mass, and notably has a predictive analog in
high-Tc superconductivity in the stable nondispersive energy gap as defined by
Thornber-Feynman polaron dynamics.
