We point out that the phase reduction of stochastic limit cycle oscillators
has been done incorrectly in the literature. We present a correct phase
reduction method for oscillators driven by weak external white Gaussian noises.
Numerical evidence demonstrates that the present phase equation properly
approximates the dynamics of the original full oscillator system.
