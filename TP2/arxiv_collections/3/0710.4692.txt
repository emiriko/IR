Single-chip CMOS-based biosensors that feature microcantilevers as transducer
elements are presented. The cantilevers are functionalized for the capturing of
specific analytes, e.g., proteins or DNA. The binding of the analyte changes
the mechanical properties of the cantilevers such as surface stress and
resonant frequency, which can be detected by an integrated Wheatstone bridge.
The monolithic integrated readout allows for a high signal-to-noise ratio,
lowers the sensitivity to external interference and enables autonomous device
operation.
