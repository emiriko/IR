We show that generic $ {\bf{10\oplus 120\oplus {\bar {126}}}}$ fits of
fermion masses and mixings, using real superpotential couplings but with
complex `Higgs fractions' leading to complex yukawa couplings in the effective
MSSM, \emph{overdetermine}(by one extra constraint) the superpotential
parameters of the New Minimal Supersymmetric SO(10) GUT\cite{nmsgut}. Therefore
fits should properly be done by generating the 24 generic fit parameters from
the 23 parameters of the NMSGUT superpotential, given $\tan\beta$ as input.
Each numerical fit then \emph{fully specifies} the parameters of the NMSGUT. An
analysis of all its implications, modulo only the residual uncertainty of
supersymmetry breaking parameters, is now feasible. Thus the NMSGUT offers the
possibility of a confrontation between the scale of gauge unification and the
fit to fermion masses due to their extractable common dependence on the NMSGUT
parameters. If and when `smoking gun' discoveries of Supersymmetry and Proton
decay occur they will find the NMSGUT fully vulnerable to falsification.
