We consider two parallel corrugated plates and show that a Casimir torque
arises when the corrugation directions are not aligned. We follow the
scattering approach and calculate the Casimir energy up to second order in the
corrugation amplitudes, taking into account nonspecular reflections,
polarization mixing and the finite conductivity of the metals. We compare our
results with the proximity force approximation, which overestimates the torque
by a factor 2 when taking the conditions that optimize the effect. We argue
that the Casimir torque could be measured for separation distances as large as
1 $\mu{\rm m}.$
