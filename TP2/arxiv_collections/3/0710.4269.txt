The concept of robustness of regulatory networks has been closely related to
the nature of the interactions among genes, and the capability of pattern
maintenance or reproducibility. Defining this robustness property is a
challenging task, but mathematical models have often associated it to the
volume of the space of admissible parameters. Not only the volume of the space
but also its topology and geometry contain information on essential aspects of
the network, including feasible pathways, switching between two parallel
pathways or distinct/disconnected active regions of parameters. A general
method is presented here to characterize the space of admissible parameters, by
writing it as a semi-algebraic set, and then theoretically analyzing its
topology and geometry, as well as volume. This method provides a more objective
and complete measure of the robustness of a developmental module. As an
illustration, the segment polarity gene network is analyzed.
