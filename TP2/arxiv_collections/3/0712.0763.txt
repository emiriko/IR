We investigate both theoretically and experimentally the rotational dynamics
of micrometric droplets of dye-doped and pure liquid crystal induced by
circularly and elliptically polarized laser light. The droplets are dispersed
in water and trapped in the focus of the laser beam. Since the optical torque
acting on the molecular director is known to be strongly enhanced in
light-absorbing dye-doped materials, the question arises whether a similar
enhancement takes place also for the overall optical torque acting on the whole
droplets. We searched for such enhancement by measuring and comparing the
rotation speed of dye-doped droplets induced by a laser beam having a
wavelength either inside or outside the dye absorption band, and also comparing
it with the rotation of pure liquid crystal droplets. No enhancement was found,
confirming that photoinduced dye effects are only associated with an internal
exchange of angular momentum between orientational and translational degrees of
freedom of matter. Our result provides also the first direct experimental proof
of the existence of a photoinduced stress tensor in the illuminated dye-doped
liquid crystal. Finally, peculiar photoinduced dynamical effects are predicted
to occur in droplets in which the molecular director is not rigidly locked to
the flow, but so far they could not be observed.
