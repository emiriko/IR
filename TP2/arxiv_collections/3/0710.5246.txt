We have measured periodic oscillations of rectified dc voltage versus
magnetic field V_{dc}(B) in a superconducting aluminum thin-film
circular-asymmetric figure-of-eight microstructure threaded by a magnetic flux
and biased with a sinusoidal alternating current (without a dc component) near
the critical temperature. The Fourier spectra of these V_{dc}(B) functions
contain fundamental frequencies representing periodic responses of the larger
and smaller asymmetric circular loops, composing the microstructure, to the
magnetic field. The higher harmonics of the obtained fundamental frequencies
result from the non-sinusoidal character of loop circulating currents. The
presence of the difference and summation frequencies in these spectra points to
the interaction between the quantum states of both loops. Magnitudes of the
loop responses to the bias ac and magnetic field vary with temperature and the
bias current amplitude, both in absolute values and with respect to each other.
The strongest loop response appears when the average resistive state of the
loop corresponds to the midpoint of the superconducting-normal phase
transition.
