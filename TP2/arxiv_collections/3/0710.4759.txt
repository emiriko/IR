As technology scales down, the static power is expected to become a
significant fraction of the total power. The exponential dependence of static
power with the operating temperature makes the thermal profile estimation of
high-performance ICs a key issue to compute the total power dissipated in
next-generations. In this paper we present accurate and compact analytical
models to estimate the static power dissipation and the temperature of
operation of CMOS gates. The models are the fundamentals of a performance
estimation tool in which numerical procedures are avoided for any computation
to set a faster estimation and optimization. The models developed are compared
to measurements and SPICE simulations for a 0.12mm technology showing excellent
results.
