In this paper the equations governing the deformations of infinitesimal
(incremental) disturbances superimposed on finite static deformation fields
involving magnetic and elastic interactions are presented. The coupling between
the equations of mechanical equilibrium and Maxwell's equations complicates the
incremental formulation and particular attention is therefore paid to the
derivation of the incremental equations, of the tensors of magnetoelastic
moduli and of the incremental boundary conditions at a magnetoelastic/vacuum
interface. The problem of surface stability for a solid half-space under plane
strain with a magnetic field normal to its surface is used to illustrate the
general results. The analysis involved leads to the simultaneous resolution of
a bicubic and vanishing of a 7x7 determinant. In order to provide specific
demonstration of the effect of the magnetic field, the material model is
specialized to that of a "magnetoelastic Mooney-Rivlin solid". Depending on the
magnitudes of the magnetic field and the magnetoelastic coupling parameters,
this shows that the half-space may become either more stable or less stable
than in the absence of a magnetic field.
