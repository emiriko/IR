This paper deals with some classical problems about the projective geometry
of complex algebraic curves. We call \textit{locally toric} a projective curve
that in a neighbourhood of every point has a local analytical parametrization
of type $(t^{a_1},...,t^{a_n})$, with $a_1,..., a_n$ relatively prime positive
integers. In this paper we prove that the general tangent line to a locally
toric curve in $\bP^3$ meets the curve only at the point of tangency. This
result extends and simplifies those of the paper \cite{kaji} by H.Kaji where
the same result is proven for any curve in $\bP^3$ such that every branch is
smooth. More generally, under mild hypotesis, up to a finite number of
anomalous parametrizations $(t^{a_1},...,t^{a_n})$, the general osculating
2-space to a locally toric curve of genus $g<2$ in $\bP^4$ does not meet the
curve again. The arithmetic part of the proof of this result relies on the
Appendix \cite{cz:rk} to this paper. By means of the same methods we give some
applications and we propose possible further developments.
