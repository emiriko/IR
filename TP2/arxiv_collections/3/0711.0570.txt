We establish the Lagrangian nature of the discrete isospectral and
isomonodromic dynamical systems corresponding to the re-factorization
transformations of the rational matrix functions on the Riemann sphere.
Specifically, in the isospectral case we generalize the Moser-Veselov approach
to integrability of discrete systems via the re-factorization of matrix
polynomials to a more general class of matrix rational functions that have a
simple divisor and, in the quadratic case, explicitly write the Lagrangian
function for such systems. Next we show that if we let certain parameters in
this Lagrangian to be time-dependent, the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations
describe the isomonodromic transformations of systems of linear difference
equations. It is known that in some special cases such equations reduce to the
difference Painlev\'e equation. As an example, we show how to obtain the
difference Painlev\`e V equation in this way, and hence we establish that this
equation can be written in the Lagrangian form.
