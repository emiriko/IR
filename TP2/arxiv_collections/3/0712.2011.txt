In random matrix theory, the spacing distribution functions $p^{(n)}(s)$ are
well fitted by the Wigner surmise and its generalizations. In this
approximation the spacing functions are completely described by the behavior of
the exact functions in the limits s->0 and s->infinity. Most non equilibrium
systems do not have analytical solutions for the spacing distribution and
correlation functions. Because of that, we explore the possibility to use the
Wigner surmise approximation in these systems. We found that this approximation
provides a first approach to the statistical behavior of complex systems, in
particular we use it to find an analytical approximation to the nearest
neighbor distribution of the annihilation random walk.
