We study two non-equilibrium work fluctuation theorems, the Crooks' theorem
and the Jarzynski equality, for a test system coupled to a spatially extended
heat reservoir whose degrees of freedom are explicitly modeled. The sufficient
conditions for the validity of the theorems are discussed in detail and
compared to the case of classical Hamiltonian dynamics. When the conditions are
met the fluctuation theorems are shown to hold despite the fact that the
immediate vicinity of the test system goes out of equilibrium during an
irreversible process. We also study the effect of the coupling to the heat
reservoir on the convergence of $<\exp(-\beta W)>$ to its theoretical mean
value, where $W$ is the work done on the test system and $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature. It is shown that the larger the local heating, the slower the
convergence.
