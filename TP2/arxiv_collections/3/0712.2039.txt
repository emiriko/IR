We propose a new solution to the supersymmetric flavor problem without
flavor-blind mediation. Our proposal is to enforce a continuous or a suitably
large discrete R-symmetry on weak scale supersymmetry, so that Majorana gaugino
masses, trilinear A-terms, and the mu-term are forbidden. We find that
replacing the MSSM with an R-symmetric supersymmetric model allows order one
flavor-violating soft masses, even for squarks of order a few hundred GeV. The
minimal R-symmetric supersymmetric model contains Dirac gaugino masses and
R-symmetric Higgsino masses with no left-right mixing in the squark or slepton
sector. Dirac gaugino masses of order a few TeV with vanishing A-terms solve
most flavor problems, while the R-symmetric Higgs sector becomes important at
large tan(beta). epsilon_K can be accommodated if CP is preserved in the SUSY
breaking sector, or if there is a moderate flavor degeneracy, which can arise
naturally. epsilon'/epsilon, as well as neutron and electron EDMs are easily
within experimental bounds. The most striking phenomenological distinction of
this model is the order one flavor violation in the squark and slepton sector,
while the Dirac gaugino masses tend to be significantly heavier than the
corresponding squark and slepton masses.
