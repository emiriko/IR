The low energy behavior of the Adler function D(Q^2) is studied by employing
recently derived integral representation for the latter. This representation
embodies the nonperturbative constraints on D(Q^2), in particular, it retains
the effects due to the nonvanishing pion mass. The Adler function is calculated
within the developed approach by making use of its perturbative approximation
as the only additional input. The obtained result agrees with the experimental
prediction for the Adler function in the entire energy range and possesses
remarkable stability with respect to the higher loop corrections.
