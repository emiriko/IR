We report on recent measurements of the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing and $CP$
violation parameters performed by the Belle experiment. The evidence for the
mixing phenomena in the system of neutral $D$ mesons, arising in the study of
$D^0\to K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-$ decays is presented first. Using a time dependent
Dalitz analysis of $D^0\to K_S\pi^+\pi^-$ decays we also obtained the most
precise up-to-date determination of the mass difference of the two $D$ meson
mass eigenstates. The presented results are based on 540 fb$^{-1}$ of data
recorded by the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. We conclude with
short prospects for the future measurements.
