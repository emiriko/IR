We attract attention to an interesting family of quantum systems where the
generator $H_{(gen)}$ of time-evolution of wave functions is not equal to the
Hamiltonian $H$. We describe the origin of the difference $H_{(gen)}-H$ and
interpret it as a carrier of a compressed information about the other relevant
observables.
