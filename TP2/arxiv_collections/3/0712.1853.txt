Quantum mechanical superexchange interactions form the basis of quantum
magnetism in strongly correlated electronic media. We report on the direct
measurement of superexchange interactions with ultracold atoms in optical
lattices. After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an
antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measure a coherent
superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 Hz up to 1
kHz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice
sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be
controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic
or ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a
two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to
identify corrections which can be explained by the inclusion of direct
nearest-neighbor interactions.
