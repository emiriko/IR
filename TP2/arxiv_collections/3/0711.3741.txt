We study prediction-assimilation systems, which have become routine in
meteorology and oceanography and are rapidly spreading to other areas of the
geosciences and of continuum physics. The long-term, nonlinear stability of
such a system leads to the uniqueness of its sequentially estimated solutions
and is required for the convergence of these solutions to the system's true,
chaotic evolution. The key ideas of our approach are illustrated for a
linearized Lorenz system. Stability of two nonlinear prediction-assimilation
systems from dynamic meteorology is studied next via the complete spectrum of
their Lyapunov exponents; these two systems are governed by a large set of
ordinary and of partial differential equations, respectively. The degree of
data-induced stabilization is crucial for the performance of such a system.
This degree, in turn, depends on two key ingredients: (i) the observational
network, either fixed or data-adaptive; and (ii) the assimilation method.
