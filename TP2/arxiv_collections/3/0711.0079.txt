Recently developed Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) is studied as an
unified model of dark matter and dark energy. To explain the recent
accelerating phase, the Universe is assumed to have a mixture of radiation and
GCCG. The mixture is considered for without or with interaction. Solutions are
obtained for various choices of the parameters and trajectories in the plane of
the statefinder parameters and presented graphically. For particular choice of
interaction parameter, we have shown the role of statefinder parameters in
various cases for the evolution of the Universe.
