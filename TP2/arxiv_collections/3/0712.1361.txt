We present a simple solution to the crossing equation for an open string
worldsheet reflection matrix, with boundaries preserving a SU(1|2)^2 residual
symmetry, which constrains the boundary dressing factor. In addition, we also
propose an analogous crossing equation for the dressing factor where extra
boundary degrees of freedom preserve a SU(2|2)^2 residual symmetry.
