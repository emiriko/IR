It has been shown experimentally a long time ago that the magnetic ordering
causes an anomalous behavior of the electron resistivity in ferromagnetic
crystals. Phenomenological explanations based on the interaction between
itinerant electron spins and lattice spins have been suggested to explain these
observations. We show by extensive Monte Carlo simulation that this behavior is
also observed for the resistivity of the spin current calculated as a function
of temperature ($T$) from low-$T$ ordered phase to high-$T$ paramagnetic phase
in a ferromagnet. We show in particular that across the critical region, the
spin resistivity undergoes a huge peak. The origin of this peak is shown to
stem from the formation of magnetic domains near the phase transition. The
behavior of the resistivity obtained here is compared to experiments and
theories. A good agreement is observed.
