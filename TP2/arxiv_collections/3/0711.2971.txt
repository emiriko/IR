In the Architecture Engineering and Construction sector (AEC) cooperation
between actors is essential for project success. The configuration of actors'
organization takes different forms like the associated coordination mechanisms.
Our approach consists in analyzing these coordination mechanisms through the
identification of the "base practices" realized by the actors of a construction
project to cooperate. We also try with practitioners to highlight the "best
practices" of cooperation. Then we suggest here two prototypes of IT services
aiming to demonstrate the value added of IT to support cooperation. These
prototype tools allow us to sensitize the actors through terrain experiments
and then to bring inch by inch the Luxembourgish AEC sector towards electronic
cooperation.
