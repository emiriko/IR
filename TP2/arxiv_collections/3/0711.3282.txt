With heavy quark limit and hierarchy approximation $\lambda_{QCD}\ll m_D\ll
m_B$, we analyze the $B\to D^0\bar D^0$ and $B_s\to D^0\bar D^0$ decays, which
occur purely via annihilation type diagrams. As a roughly estimation, we
calculate their branching ratios and CP asymmetries in Perturbative QCD
approach. The branching ratio of $B\to D^0\bar D^0$ is about $3.8\times10^{-5}$
that is just below the latest experimental upper limit. The branching ratio of
$B_s\to D^0\bar D^0$ is about $6.8\times10^{-4}$, which could be measured in
LHC-b. From the calculation, it could be found that this branching ratio is not
sensitive to the weak phase angle $\gamma$. In these two decay modes, there
exist CP asymmetries because of interference between weak and strong
interaction. However, these asymmetries are too small to be measured easily.
