We consider an extension of Kuramoto's model of coupled phase oscillators
where oscillator pairs interact with different strengths. When the coupling
coefficient of each pair can be separated into two different factors, each one
associated to an oscillator, Kuramoto's theory for the transition to
synchronization can be explicitly generalized, and the effects of coupling
heterogeneity on synchronized states can be analytically studied. The two
factors are respectively interpreted as the weight of the contribution of each
oscillator to the mean field, and the coupling of each oscillator to that
field. We explicitly analyze the effects of correlations between those weights
and couplings, and show that synchronization can be completely inhibited when
they are strongly anti-correlated. Numerical results validate the theory, but
suggest that finite-size effect are relevant to the collective dynamics close
to the synchronization transition, where oscillators become entrained in
synchronized frequency clusters.
