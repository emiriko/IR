We have measured pulsed microwave transmission through quasi-1D samples with
lengths up to three localization lengths. For times approaching four times the
diffusion time \tau_D, transmission is diffusive in accord with the
self-consistent theory of localization for the renormalized diffusion
coefficient in space and frequency, D(z,\Omega). For longer times, the
transmission decay rate first agrees with and later falls increasingly below
the self-consistent theory. Beyond the Heisenberg time, the decay rate
approaches the predictions of a dynamic single parameter scaling model which
reflects the decay of long-lived localized modes and converges to the results
of 1D simulations.
