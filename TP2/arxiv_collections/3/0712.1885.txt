We calculate the optical sum associated with the in-plane conductivity of a
graphene bilayer. A bilayer asymmetry gap generated in a field-effect device
can split apart valence and conduction bands, which otherwise would meet at two
K points in the Brillouin zone. In this way one can go from a compensated
semimetal to a semiconductor with a tunable gap. However, the sum rule turns
out to be 'protected' against the opening of this semiconducting gap, in
contrast to the large variations observed in other systems where the gap is
induced by strong correlation effects.
