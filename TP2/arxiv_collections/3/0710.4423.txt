We present preliminary numerical studies in Lattice QCD related to the
intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of partons in the nucleon. We employ
non-local operators, consisting of spatially separated quark creation and
annihilation operators connected by a straight Wilson line. A clear signal is
already obtained from a small number of configurations at a pion mass of about
600 MeV. As an example, we demonstrate that we can obtain the first x-moment of
the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function f_1^{n=1}(k_T)
from our data. Our results, which are not renormalized, show a Gaussian-like
distribution. The root mean squared transverse momentum is about 560 MeV for a
Gaussian fit, close to phenomenological values.
