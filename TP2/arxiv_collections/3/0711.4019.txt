Rigourous calculations of the imaging properties of metamaterials consisting
of metal-coated semiconductor nanoparticles are presented. In particular, it is
shown that under proper choice of geometric and materials parameters, arrays of
such particles exhibit negative refractive index within the region of the
excitonic resonance of the semiconductor. The occurrence of negative refractive
index is predicted by the extended Maxwell-Garnett theory and confirmed by a
layer-multiple scattering method for electromagnetic waves. By using the same
method it is shown that within the negative refractive-index band, arrays of
such nanoparticles amplify the transmitted near-field emitted while
simultaneously narrow down its spatial profile leading to subwavelength
resolution. The effect of material losses to the imaging properties of the
arrays is also addressed.
