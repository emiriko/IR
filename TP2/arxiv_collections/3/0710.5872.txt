Pricing exotic multi-asset path-dependent options requires extensive Monte
Carlo simulations. In the recent years the interest to the Quasi-monte Carlo
technique has been renewed and several results have been proposed in order to
improve its efficiency with the notion of effective dimension. To this aim,
Imai and Tan introduced a general variance reduction technique in order to
minimize the nominal dimension of the Monte Carlo method. Taking into account
these advantages, we investigate this approach in detail in order to make it
faster from the computational point of view. Indeed, we realize the linear
transformation decomposition relying on a fast ad hoc QR decomposition that
considerably reduces the computational burden. This setting makes the linear
transformation method even more convenient from the computational point of
view. We implement a high-dimensional (2500) Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation
combined with the linear transformation in order to price Asian basket options
with same set of parameters published by Imai and Tan. For the simulation of
the high-dimensional random sample, we use a 50-dimensional scrambled Sobol
sequence for the first 50 components, determined by the linear transformation
method, and pad the remaining ones out by the Latin Hypercube Sampling. The aim
of this numerical setting is to investigate the accuracy of the estimation by
giving a higher convergence rate only to those components selected by the
linear transformation technique. We launch our simulation experiment also using
the standard Cholesky and the principal component decomposition methods with
pseudo-random and Latin Hypercube sampling generators. Finally, we compare our
results and computational times, with those presented in Imai and Tan.
