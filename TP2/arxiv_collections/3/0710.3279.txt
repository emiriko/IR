Most existing work on adaptive allocation of subcarriers and power in
multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems has focused
on homogeneous traffic consisting solely of either delay-constrained data
(guaranteed service) or non-delay-constrained data (best-effort service). In
this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in a heterogeneous
multiuser OFDM system with both delay-constrained (DC) and
non-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic. The objective is to maximize the sum-rate
of all the users with NDC traffic while maintaining guaranteed rates for the
users with DC traffic under a total transmit power constraint. Through our
analysis we show that the optimal power allocation over subcarriers follows a
multi-level water-filling principle; moreover, the valid candidates competing
for each subcarrier include only one NDC user but all DC users. By converting
this combinatorial problem with exponential complexity into a convex problem or
showing that it can be solved in the dual domain, efficient iterative
algorithms are proposed to find the optimal solutions. To further reduce the
computational cost, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is also developed.
Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance the proposed
algorithms in terms of service outage probability, achievable transmission rate
pairs for DC and NDC traffic, and multiuser diversity.
