We have carried out a comprehensive investigation of magnetic properties of
LuFe$_2$O$_4$, using AC susceptibility, DC magnetization and specific heat. A
magnetic phase transition around $\sim$236 K was observed with DC magnetization
and specific heat measurements, which is identified as a paramagnetic to
ferrimagnetic transition based on the nonlinear susceptibility data. Upon
further cooling below this temperature, we also observed highly relaxational
magnetic behavior: the DC magnetization exhibits history and time dependence,
and the real and imaginary part of the AC susceptibility shows large frequency
dependence. Dynamic scaling of the AC susceptibility data suggests that this
low temperature phase can be described as a reentrant spin glass phase. We also
discuss magnetic field dependence of the spin glass transition and aging,
memory and rejuvenation effect below the glass transition temperature around
228 K.
