This paper investigates the singular curves in the joint space of a family of
planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special points, referred to as cusp
points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp points play an important role in
the kinematic behavior of parallel manipulators since they make possible a
nonsingular change of assembly mode. The purpose of this study is twofold.
First, it exposes a method to compute joint space singular curves of 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulators. Second, it presents an algorithm for detecting
and computing all cusp points in the joint space of these same manipulators.
