We study the limiting behavior of the solutions to a class of conservation
laws with vanishing nonlinear diffusion and dispersion terms. We prove the
convergence to the entropy solution of the first order problem under a
condition on the relative size of the diffusion and the dispersion terms. This
work is motivated by the pseudo-viscosity approximation introduced by Von
Neumann in the 50's.
