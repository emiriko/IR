In this paper we study synchronized motions in complex networks in which
there are distinct groups of nodes where the dynamical systems on each node
within a group are the same but are different for nodes in different groups.
Both continuous time and discrete time systems are considered. We initially
focus on the case where two groups are present and the network has bipartite
topology (i.e., links exist between nodes in different groups but not between
nodes in the same group). We also show that group synchronous motions are
compatible with more general network topologies, where there are also
connections within the groups.
