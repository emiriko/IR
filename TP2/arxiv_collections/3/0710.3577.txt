We analyze the determination of volume effects for correlation functions that
depend on an external momentum. As a specific example, we consider finite
volume nucleon current correlators, and focus on the nucleon magnetic moment.
Because the multipole decomposition relies on SO(3) rotational invariance, the
structure of such finite volume corrections is unrelated to infinite volume
multipole form factors. One can deduce volume corrections to the magnetic
moment only when a zero-mode photon coupling vanishes, as occurs at
next-to-leading order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. To deduce
such finite volume corrections, however, one must assume continuous momentum
transfer. In practice, volume corrections with momentum transfer dependence are
required to address the extraction of the magnetic moment, or other observables
that arise in momentum dependent correlation functions. Additionally we shed
some light on a puzzle concerning differences in lattice form factor data at
equal values of momentum transfer squared.
