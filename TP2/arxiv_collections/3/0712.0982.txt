We employ a mesoscopic model for studying aggregation processes of
protein-like hydrophobic-polar heteropolymers. By means of multicanonical Monte
Carlo computer simulations, we find strong indications that peptide aggregation
is a phase separation process, in which the microcanonical entropy exhibits a
convex intruder due to nonnegligible surface effects of the small systems. We
analyze thermodynamic properties of the conformational transitions accompanying
the aggregation process from the multicanonical, canonical, and microcanonical
perspective. It turns out that the microcanonical description is particularly
advantageous as it allows for unraveling details of the phase-separation
transition in the thermodynamic region, where the temperature is not a suitable
external control parameter anymore.
