We explore the joint behavior of a finite number of multi-overlaps in the
high temperature phase of the SK model. Extending work by M. Talagrand, we show
that, when these objects are scaled to have non-trivial limiting distributions,
the joint behavior is described by a Gaussian process with an explicit
covariance structure.
