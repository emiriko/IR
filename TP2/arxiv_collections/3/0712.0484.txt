In a recent publication (Bertulani et al., PLB 650 (2007) 233 and
arXiv:0704.0060v2) the validity of analysis methods used for
intermediate-energy Coulomb excitation experiments was called into question.
Applying a refined theory large corrections of results in the literature seemed
needed. We show that this is not the case and that the large deviations
observed are due to the use of the wrong experimental parameters. We
furthermore show that an approximate expression derived by Bertulani et al. is
in fact equivalent to the theory of Winther and Alder (NPA 319 (1979) 518), an
analysis method often used in the literature.
