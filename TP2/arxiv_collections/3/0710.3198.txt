In order to evaluate qualitatively the space-time evolution of hot and dense
nuclear matter the underlying equation of state and transport coefficients must
be known. In this study a specific equation of state is studied: the pion gas.
The classical or standard transport coefficients, namely the bulk viscosity,
shear viscsoity and thermal conductivity are devided by the relaxation times
for the corresponding dissipative fluxes and then studied as functions of mass
to temperature ratio.
