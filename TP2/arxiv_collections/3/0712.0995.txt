We calculate the skin thickness, binding energy, surface energy and density
profiles within the Dirac solution of a density dependent hadronic model and
compare with the NL3 parametrization results of the non-linear Wallecka model.
The asymmetry for polarized electron scattering is also obtained using a
partial wave expansion calculation. Results for 208Pb, 40Ca, 48Ca, 66Ni and
90Zr are shown and discussed.
