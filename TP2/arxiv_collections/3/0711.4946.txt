We follow the dynamics of an ensemble of interacting self-propelled motorized
particles in contact with an equilibrated thermal bath. We find that the
fluctuation-dissipation relation allows for the definition of an effective
temperature that is compatible with the results obtained using a tracer
particle as a thermometer. The effective temperature takes a value which is
higher than the temperature of the bath and it is continuously controlled by
the motor intensity.
