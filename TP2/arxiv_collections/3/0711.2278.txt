On the basis of our recent modifications of the Dirac formalism we generalize
the Bargmann-Wigner formalism for higher spins to be compatible with other
formalisms for bosons. Relations with dual electrodynamics, with the
Ogievetskii-Polubarinov notoph and the Weinberg 2(2J+1) theory are found. Next,
we introduce the dual analogues of the Riemann tensor and derive corresponding
dynamical equations in the Minkowski space. Relations with the Marques-Spehler
chiral gravity theory are discussed. The problem of indefinite metrics,
particularly, in quantization of 4-vector fields is clarified.
