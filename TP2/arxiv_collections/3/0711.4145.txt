Thermal photons can provide information on the temperature of the new state
of matter created at RHIC. In the p_T region of 1--3 GeV/c thermal photons are
expected to be the dominant direct photon source. Therefore, a possible excess
compared to a pure decay photon signal due to a thermal photon contribution
should be seen in the double ratio
(gamma/gamma(pi^0))_{Measured}/(gamma/gamma(pi^0))_{Simulated}, if sufficient
accuracy can be reached. We present a method to reconstruct direct photons by
measuring e^+e^- pairs from external photon conversions.
