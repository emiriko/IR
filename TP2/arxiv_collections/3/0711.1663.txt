Surface waves can propagate on the planar interface of a linear electro-optic
(EO) material and an isotropic dielectric material, for restricted ranges of
the orientation angles of the EO material and the refractive index of the
isotropic material. These ranges can be controlled by the application of a dc
electric field, and depend on both the magnitude and the direction of the dc
field. Thus, surface-wave propagation can be electrically controlled by
exploiting the Pockels effect.
