The aim of this review is to provide an overview of a recent work concerning
``leaky'' quantum graphs described by Hamiltonians given formally by the
expression $-\Delta -\alpha \delta (x-\Gamma)$ with a singular attractive
interaction supported by a graph-like set in $\mathbb{R}^\nu,\: \nu=2,3$. We
will explain how such singular Schr\"odinger operators can be properly defined
for different codimensions of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, we are going to discuss
their properties, in particular, the way in which the geometry of $\Gamma$
influences their spectra and the scattering, strong-coupling asymptotic
behavior, and a discrete counterpart to leaky-graph Hamiltonians using point
interactions. The subject cannot be regarded as closed at present, and we will
add a list of open problems hoping that the reader will take some of them as a
challenge.
