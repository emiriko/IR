When a few tens of charged particles are trapped in a spherical electrostatic
potential at low temperature they form concentric shells resembling atoms.
These ``artificial atoms'' can be easily controlled by varying the confinement
strength. We analyze such systems for the case that the particles are bosons
and find superfluid behavior which even persists in the solid state. This novel
state of matter is a mesoscopic supersolid.
