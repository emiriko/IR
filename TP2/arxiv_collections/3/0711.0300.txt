We study hadronization of the final state in a particle-antiparticle
annihilation using a holographic gravity dual description of QCD. At the point
of hadronization we match the events to a simple (Gaussian) energy distribution
in the five dimensional theory. The final state multiplicities are then
modelled by calculating the overlap between the Gaussian and a set of functions
in the fifth dimension which represent each hadron. We compare our results to
those measured in e+e- collisions at LEP and PEP-PETRA. Hadron production
numbers, which differ in range by four orders of magnitude, are reproduced to
well within a factor of two.
