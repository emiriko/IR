As device sizes shrink and current densities increase, the probability of
device failures due to gate oxide breakdown (OBD) also increases. To provide
designs that are tolerant to such failures, we must investigate and understand
the manifestations of this physical phenomenon at the circuit and system level.
In this paper, we develop a model for operational OBD defects, and we explore
how to test for faults due to OBD. For a NAND gate, we derive the necessary
input conditions that excite and detect errors due to OBD defects at the gate
level. We show that traditional pattern generators fail to exercise all of
these defects. Finally, we show that these test patterns can be propagated and
justified for a combinational circuit in a manner similar to traditional ATPG.
