We present a measurement of the cross section for W-boson production in
association with jets in pbar-p collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. The analysis
uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 320 pb^-1
collected with the CDF II detector. W bosons are identified in their electron
decay channel and jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm. For each W+>=
n-jet sample (n= 1 - 4) we measure dsigma(ppbar =>W+>=n-jet)/dE_T^(nth-jet) x
BR(W => e nu) with respect to the transverse energy E_T of the n^th-highest E_T
jet above 20 GeV, and the total cross section sigma(ppbar =>W+>=n-jet;
E_T^(nth-jet)>25 GeV) x BR(W => e nu), for a restricted W => e nu decay phase
space. The cross sections, corrected for all detector effects, can be directly
compared to particle level W+ jet(s) predictions. We present here comparisons
to leading order and next-to-leading order predictions.
