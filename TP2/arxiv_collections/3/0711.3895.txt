Transition from baryonic matter to color-flavor-locked quark matter is
described in terms of skyrmion matter changing into half-skyrmion matter. The
intermediate phase between the density $n_p$ at which a skyrmion turns into two
half skyrmions and the chiral transition density $n_c^{\chi SR}$ at which
hadronic matter changes over to quark matter corresponds to a chiral symmetry
restored phase characterized by a vanishing quark condensate and a {\em
non-vanishing} pion decay constant. When hidden local fields are incorporated,
the vector manifestation of Harada-Yamawaki HLS theory implies that as density
approaches $n_c^{\chi SR}$, the gauge coupling $g$ goes to zero (in the chiral
limit) and the symmetry "swells" to $SU(N_f)^4$ as proposed by Georgi for the
"vector limit." This enhanced symmetry, not present in QCD, can be interpreted
as "emergent" in medium due to collective excitations. The fractionization of
skyrmions into half-skyrmions resembles closely the magnetic N\'eel--to-valence
bond solid (VBS) paramagnet transition where "baby" half-skyrmions enter as
relevant degrees of freedom in the intermediate phase. It is suggested that the
half-skyrmion phase in dense matter corresponds to the "hadronic freedom"
regime that plays a singularly important role in inducing kaon condensation
that leads to the collapse of massive compact stars into black holes..
