A notion of stochastic deformation is introduced and the corresponding
algebraic deformation procedure is developed. This procedure is analogous to
the deformation of an algebra of observables like deformation quantization, but
for an imaginary deformation parameter (the Planck constant). This method is
demonstrated on diverse relativistic and nonrelativistic models with finite and
infinite degrees of freedom. It is shown that under stochastic deformation the
model of a nonrelativistic particle interacting with the electromagnetic field
on a curved background passes into the stochastic model described by the
Fokker-Planck equation with the diffusion tensor being the inverse metric
tensor. The first stochastic correction to the Newton equations for this system
is found. The Klein-Kramers equation is also derived as the stochastic
deformation of a certain classical model. Relativistic generalizations of the
Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations are obtained by applying the
procedure of stochastic deformation to appropriate relativistic classical
models. The analog of the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the stochastic
Lorentz-Dirac equation is derived too. The stochastic deformation of the models
of a free scalar field and an electromagnetic field is investigated. It turns
out that in the latter case the obtained stochastic model describes a
fluctuating electromagnetic field in a transparent medium.
