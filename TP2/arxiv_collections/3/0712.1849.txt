We determine the strength of the weak nuclear force which holds the lattices
of the elementary particles together. We also determine the strength of the
strong nuclear force which emanates from the sides of the nuclear lattices. The
strong force is the sum of the unsaturated weak forces at the surface of the
nuclear lattices. The strong force is then about ten to the power of 6 times
stronger than the weak force between two lattice points.
