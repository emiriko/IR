We show that some types of sudden singularities admit a natural explanation
in terms of regular changes of signature on brane-worlds in AdS$_{5}$. The
present accelerated expansion of the Universe and its possible ending at a
sudden singularity may therefore simply be an indication that our braneworld is
about to change its Lorentzian signature to an Euclidean one, while remaining
fully regular. An explicit example of this behaviour satisfying the weak and
strong energy conditions is presented.
