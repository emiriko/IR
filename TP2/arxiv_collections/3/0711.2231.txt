The differential cross-sections are calculated for proton-proton and
proton-antiproton elastic scattering using the phenomenological model based on
the analytic parameterizations for global scattering parameters (total
cross-section and $\rho$ - parameter), crossing symmetry and derivative
relations. We confront our model predictions with experimental data in wide
range of energy and momentum transfer. The suggested method may be useful for
PAX Program (GSI) as well as for high-energy experiments at RHIC and LHC.
