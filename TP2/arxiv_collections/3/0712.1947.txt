The Dirac and Pauli form factors of the proton and neutron are obtained in
the framework of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with some simple
momentum transfer dependence. It is shown that both sets of the existing
experimental data of the form factors, obtained by the Rosenbluth and
polarization transfer, can be described by changing only the slope of the GPDs
$E$. The description of neutron form factors is substantially better when the
proton data obtained by the studies of polarization transfer are used.
