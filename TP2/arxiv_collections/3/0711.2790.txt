The derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation starting from the Liouville
equation using projection techniques yields a friction term which is nonlinear
in the velocity. Using the results of multilinear mode-coupling technique for
calculating equlibrium correlation functions, it is shown that the second-order
part of the term is non-zero, thus leading to an incorrect formula for the
equation.
