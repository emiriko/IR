Folding channels and free-energy landscapes of hydrophobic-polar
heteropolymers are discussed on the basis of a minimalistic off-lattice
coarse-grained model. We investigate how rearrangements of hydrophobic and
polar monomers in a heteropolymer sequence lead to completely different folding
behaviors. Studying three exemplified sequences with the same content of
hydrophobic and polar residues, we can reproduce within this simple model
two-state folding, folding through intermediates, as well as metastability.
