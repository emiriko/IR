This paper introduces a simple index that helps to assess the degree of aging
or rejuvenation of a (non)repairable system. The index ranges from -1 to 1 and
is negative for the class of decreasing failure rate distributions (or
deteriorating point processes) and is positive for the increasing failure rate
distributions (or improving point processes). The introduced index is
distribution free.
