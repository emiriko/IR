We consider two-particle correlations, which appear in relativistic nuclear
collisions due to the quantum statistics of identical particles, in the frame
of two formalisms: wave-function and current. The first one is based on
solution of the Cauchy problem, whereas the second one is a so-called current
parametrization of the source of secondary particles. We argue that these two
parameterizations of the source coincide when the wave function at freeze-out
times is put in a specific correspondence with a current. Then, the
single-particle Wigner density evaluated in both approaches gives the same
result.
