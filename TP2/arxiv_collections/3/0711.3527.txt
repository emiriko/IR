I discuss the symmetry of fullerenes, viruses and geodesic domes within a
unified framework of icosadeltahedral representation of these objects. The
icosadeltahedral symmetry is explained in details by examination of all of
these structures. Using Euler's theorem on polyhedra, it is shown how to
calculate the number of vertices, edges, and faces in domes, and number of
atoms, bonds and pentagonal and hexagonal rings in fullerenes. Caspar-Klug
classification of viruses is elaborated as a specific case of icosadeltahedral
geometry.
