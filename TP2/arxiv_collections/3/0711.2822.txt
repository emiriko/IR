We are discussing a universal non-unitary map M subsequent to a generic
unitary map U, whose von Neumann entropy gain coincides with the calculated
thermodynamic entropy production. For many-body quantum reservoirs we prove
that M can be the averaging over all translations of the spatial frame.
Assuming the coincidence of microscopic and macroscopic entropy productions
leads to a novel equation between entropy gain of frame averaging and relative
entropy. Our map M turns out to coincide with the older one called twirl, used
recently in the theory of quantum reference frames. Related results to ours
have been obtained and we discuss some of them briefly. Possible relevance of
frame averaging (twirling) for real world irreversibility is mentioned.
