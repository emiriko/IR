In quantum field theory, the Green function is usually calculated as the
expectation value of the time-ordered product of fields over the vacuum. In
some cases, especially in degenerate systems, expectation values over general
states are required. The corresponding Green functions are essentially more
complex than in the vacuum, because they cannot be written in terms of standard
Feynman diagrams. Here, a method is proposed to determine the structure of
these Green functions and to derive nonperturbative equations for them. The
main idea is to transform the cumulants describing correlations into
interaction terms.
