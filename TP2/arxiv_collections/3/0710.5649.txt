We outline the twist-two analysis of deeply virtual Compton scattering
(DVCS)within the conformal partial wave expansion of the amplitude, represented
as a Mellin--Barnes integral. The complete next-to-leading order results,
including evolution, are obtained in the MS and a conformal factorization
scheme. Within the latter, exploiting conformal symmetry, the radiative
corrections are evaluated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Using a new
proposed parameterization for GPDs, we study the convergence of perturbation
theory and demonstrate for H1 and ZEUS measurements that our formalism is
suitable for a fitting procedure of DVCS observables. We comment on a recent
claim of a breakdown of collinear factorization and show that a Regge-inspired
Q^2 scaling law is ruled out by small x_Bj DVCS data.
