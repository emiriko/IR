We examine diquark fluctuations and chiral soft modes existing in the
precritical region of color superconductivity and chiral transition,
respectively, at finite temperature and density. We evaluate how they
contribute to anomalous di-lepton production; although there appear peaks in
the spectral function owing to the existence of the soft modes, the enhancement
of the production rate may not be so prominent to be a clear signal of the
phsase transitions.
