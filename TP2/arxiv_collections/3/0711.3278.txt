We investigated the magnetotransport in high quality ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As
films and wires. At low temperature the conductivity decreases with decreasing
temperature without saturation down to 20 mK. Here we show, that the
conductivity decrease follows a ln($T/T_0$) dependency in 2D films and a
$-1/\sqrt{T}$ dependency in 1D wires and is independent of an applied magnetic
field. This behavior can be explained by the theory of electron-electron
interaction.
