Third-order results for the structure functions of charged-current
deep-inelastic scattering are discussed. New results for 11'th Mellin moment
for F_2,L^(nu P - nubar P) structure functions and 12'th moment for F_3^(nu P -
nubar P) are presented as well as corresponding higher Mellin moments of
differences between the respective crossing-even and -odd coefficient
functions. Approximations in Bjorken-x space for these differences obtained
with lowest five moments as well as consistency of new results with these
approximations are discussed. The 1/N_c suppression of the differences is shown
and the correction to the Paschos-Wolfenstein relation is discussed.
