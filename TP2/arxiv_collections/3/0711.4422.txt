We present a new class of slowly rotating black hole solutions in
$(n+1)$-dimensional $(n\geq3)$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity in the presence
of Liouville-type potential for the dilaton field and an arbitrary value of the
dilaton coupling constant. Because of the presence of the dilaton field, the
asymptotic behaviour of these solutions are neither flat nor (A)dS. In the
absence of a dilaton field, our solution reduces to the $(n+1)$-dimensional
Kerr-Newman modification thereof for small rotation parameter \cite{Aliev2}. We
also compute the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of these rotating
dilaton black holes.
