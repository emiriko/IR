Temperature dependence of the London penetration depth $\lambda$ measured in
single crystals of CeCoIn$_5$ is interpreted as caused by a strong
pair-breaking scattering that makes the superconductivity in this compound
gapless. For a gapless d-wave superconductor, we derive
$\lambda=\lambda_0/\sqrt{1-(T/T_c)^2}$ caused by combined effect of magnetic
and non-magnetic scattering in excellent agreement with the data in the full
temperature range and with the gapless s-wave case of Abrikosov and Gor'kov. We
also obtain the slope of the upper critical field at $T_c$ that compares well
with the measured slope.
