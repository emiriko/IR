The differential cross section of the process gamma gamma -> pi^0 pi^0 has
been measured in the kinematical range 0.6 GeV < W < 4.0 GeV and |cos
theta*|<0.8 in energy and pion scattering angle, respectively, in the gamma
gamma center-of-mass system. We find at least four resonant structures
including a peak from f_0(980). In addition, there is evidence for chi_{c0}
production. We also make a preliminary discussion of the angular dependence and
cross section ratio to gamma gamma -> pi^+ pi^-.
