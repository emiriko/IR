In this paper we will develop a methodology for obtaining pricing expressions
for financial instruments whose underlying asset can be described through a
simple continuous-time random walk (CTRW) market model. Our approach is very
natural to the issue because it is based in the use of renewal equations, and
therefore it enhances the potential use of CTRW techniques in finance. We solve
these equations for typical contract specifications, in a particular but
exemplifying case. We also show how a formal general solution can be found for
more exotic derivatives, and we compare prices for alternative models of the
underlying. Finally, we recover the celebrated results for the Wiener process
under certain limits.
