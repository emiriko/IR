Energy and momentum lost by hard jets propagating through hot and dense
nuclear matter have to be redistributed in the medium. It has been conjectured
that collective sound modes are excited. Those lead to Mach cone nuclear shock
waves in the nuclear medium that are shown to account for three and four
particle angular correlation structures of hadrons with a (semi-)hard trigger
hadron in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC.
