Investigations of emergent symmetry breaking phenomena occurring in small
finite-size systems are reviewed, with a focus on the strongly correlated
regime of electrons in two-dimensional semicoductor quantum dots and trapped
ultracold bosonic atoms in harmonic traps. Throughout the review we emphasize
universal aspects and similarities of symmetry breaking found in these systems,
as well as in more traditional fields like nuclear physics and quantum
chemistry, which are characterized by very different interparticle forces. A
unified description of strongly correlated phenomena in finite systems of
repelling particles (whether fermions or bosons) is presented through the
development of a two-step method of symmetry breaking at the unrestricted
Hartree-Fock level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post Hartree-Fock
projection techniques. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the two-step
method are treated and validated by exact diagonalization calculations.
  Strongly-correlated phenomena emerging from symmetry breaking include: (I)
Chemical bonding, dissociation, and entanglement (at zero and finite magnetic
fields) in quantum dot molecules and in pinned electron molecular dimers formed
within a single anisotropic quantum dot. (II) Electron crystallization, with
particle localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal rings, and
formation of rotating electron molecules (REMs) in circular quantum dots. (III)
At high magnetic fields, the REMs are described by parameter-free analytic wave
functions, which are an alternative to the Laughlin and composite-fermion
approaches. (IV) Crystalline phases of strongly repelling bosons. In rotating
traps and in analogy with the REMs, such repelling bosons form rotating boson
molecules (RBMs).
