We investigate the stability of the recently discovered room temperature
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of magnons in Ytrrium Iron Garnet (YIG) films.
We show that magnon-magnon interactions depend strongly on the external field
orientation, and that the BEC in current experiments is actually metastable -
it only survives because of finite size effects, and because the BEC density is
very low. On the other hand a strong field applied perpendicular to the sample
plane leads to a repulsive magnon-magnon interaction; we predict that a
high-density magnon BEC can then be formed in this perpendicular field
geometry.
