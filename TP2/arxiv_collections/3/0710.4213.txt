Starting from the lattice $A_3$ realization of the Ising model defined on a
strip with integrable boundary conditions, the exact spectrum (including
excited states) of all the local integrals of motion is derived in the
continuum limit by means of TBA techniques. It is also possible to follow the
massive flow of this spectrum between the UV $c=1/2$ conformal fixed point and
the massive IR theory. The UV expression of the eigenstates of such integrals
of motion in terms of Virasoro modes is found to have only rational
coefficients and their fermionic representation turns out to be simply related
to the quantum numbers describing the spectrum.
