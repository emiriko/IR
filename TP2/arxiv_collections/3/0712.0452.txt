In this review, I describe a recent approach based on the representation
theory of the $q-$Onsager algebra which is used to derive exact results for the
XXZ open spin chain. The complete spectrum and eigenstates are obtained as
rational functions of a single variable which discrete values correspond to the
roots of a certain characteristic polynomial. Comments and open problems are
also presented.
