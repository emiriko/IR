We compute the spectrum of the classical and quantum mechanical
coarse-grained propagators for a piecewise linear discontinuous map. We analyze
the quantum - classical correspondence and the evolution of the spectrum with
increasing resolution. Our results are compared to the ones obtained for a
mixed system.
