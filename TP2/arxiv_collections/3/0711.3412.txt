This article describes an exclusively resource-based method of morphological
annotation of written Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative language. Our
annotator is designed to process text before the operation of a syntactic
parser. In its present state, it annotates one-stem words only. The output is a
graph of morphemes annotated with accurate linguistic information. The
granularity of the tagset is 3 to 5 times higher than usual tagsets. A
comparison with a reference annotated corpus showed that it achieves 89% recall
without any corpus training. The language resources used by the system are
lexicons of stems, transducers of suffixes and transducers of generation of
allomorphs. All can be easily updated, which allows users to control the
evolution of the performances of the system. It has been claimed that
morphological annotation of Korean text could only be performed by a
morphological analysis module accessing a lexicon of morphemes. We show that it
can also be performed directly with a lexicon of words and without applying
morphological rules at annotation time, which speeds up annotation to 1,210
word/s. The lexicon of words is obtained from the maintainable language
resources through a fully automated compilation process.
