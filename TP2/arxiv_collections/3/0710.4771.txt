Entropy production for a system not in the thermodynamic limit is formulated
using Hill's nanothermodynamics, in which a macroscopic ensemble of such
systems is considered. External influence of the environment on the average
nanosystem is connected to irreversible work with an explicit formula based on
Jarzynsky equality. Entropy production retains its usual form as a sum of
products of fluxes and forces and Onsager's symmetry principle is proven to
hold for the average nanosystem if it is valid for the macroscopic ensemble, by
two methods. The first one provides expressions that relate the coefficients of
the two systems. The second gives a general condition for a system under a
external force to preserve Onsager's symmetry.
