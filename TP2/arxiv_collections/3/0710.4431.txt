Vapor condensation on nanoparticle with radius smaller than the Kelvin radius
is considered as fluctuation or as the heterogeneous nucleation. The expression
for steady-state heterogeneous nucleation rate is obtained. Nucleation on
negatively charged nanoparticles is discussed. The report was made at 17th
International Nucleation and Atmospheric Conferences, Galway, Ireland, 2007.
