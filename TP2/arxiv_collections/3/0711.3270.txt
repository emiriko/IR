We propose an optical lattice scheme which would permit the experimental
observation of Zitterbewegung (ZB) with ultracold, neutral atoms. A four-level
"tripod" variant of the usual setup for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) has been proposed for generating non-Abelian gauge fields [1].
Dirac-like Hamiltonians, which exhibit ZB, are simple examples of such
non-Abelian gauge fields; we show how a variety of them can arise, and how ZB
can be observed, in a tripod system. We predict that the ZB should occur at
experimentally accessible frequencies and amplitudes.
