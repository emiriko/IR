DNA torsion dynamics is essential in the transcription process; simple models
for it have been proposed by several authors, in particular Yakushevich (Y
model). These are strongly related to models of DNA separation dynamics such as
the one first proposed by Peyrard and Bishop (and developed by Dauxois, Barbi,
Cocco and Monasson among others), but support topological solitons. We recently
developed a ``composite'' version of the Y model, in which the sugar-phosphate
group and the base are described by separate degrees of freedom. This at the
same time fits experimental data better than the simple Y model, and shows
dynamical phenomena, which are of interest beyond DNA dynamics. Of particular
relevance are the mechanism for selecting the speed of solitons by tuning the
physical parameters of the non linear medium and the hierarchal separation of
the relevant degrees of freedom in ``master'' and ``slave''. These mechanisms
apply not only do DNA, but also to more general macromolecules, as we show
concretely by considering polyethylene.
