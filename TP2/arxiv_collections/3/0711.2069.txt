The quantum Yang-Baxter equation admits generalisations to systems of
Yang-Baxter type equations called Yang-Baxter systems. Starting from algebra
structures, we propose new constructions of some constant as well as the
spectral-parameter dependent Yang-Baxter systems. Besides, we also present
explicitly the commutation algebra structure associated to the constant type in
dimension two.
