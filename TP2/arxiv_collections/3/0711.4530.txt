temperature measurements were performed with a Scanning Thermal Microscope
mounted with a thermoresistive wire probe of micrometric size. A CMOS device
was designed with arrays of resistive lines 0.35$\mu$m in width. The array
periods are 0.8micron and 10micron to study the spatial resolution of the SThM.
Integrated Circuits with passivation layers of micrometric and nanometric
thicknesses were tested. To enhance signal-to-noise ratio, the resistive lines
were heated with an AC current. The passivation layer of nanometric thickness
allows us to distinguish the lines when the array period is 10micron. The
results raise the difficulties of the SThM measurement due to the design and
the topography of ICs on one hand and the size of the thermal probe on the
other hand.ic size. A CMOS device was designed with arrays of resistive lines
