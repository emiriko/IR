This paper reviews the present understanding of the origin of ferromagnetic
response of diluted magnetic semiconductors and diluted magnetic oxides as well
as in some nominally magnetically undoped materials. It is argued that these
systems can be grouped into four classes. To the first belong composite
materials in which precipitations of a known ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic or
antiferromagnetic compound account for magnetic characteristics at high
temperatures. The second class forms alloys showing chemical nano-scale phase
separation into the regions with small and large concentrations of the magnetic
constituent. To the third class belong (Ga,Mn)As, heavily doped p-(Zn,Mn)Te,
and related semiconductors. In these solid solutions the theory built on p-d
Zener's model of hole-mediated ferromagnetism and on either the Kohn-Luttinger
kp theory or the multi-orbital tight-binding approach describes qualitatively,
and often quantitatively many relevant properties. Finally, in a number of
carrier-doped DMS and DMO a competition between long-range ferromagnetic and
short-range antiferromagnetic interactions and/or the proximity of the
localisation boundary lead to an electronic nano-scale phase separation.
