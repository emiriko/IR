Spin Hall effect can be induced both by the extrinsic impurity scattering and
by the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the electronic structure. The HgTe/CdTe
quantum well has a quantum phase transition where the electronic structure
changes from normal to inverted. We show that the intrinsic spin Hall effect of
the conduction band vanishes on the normal side, while it is finite on the
inverted side. This difference gives a direct mechanism to experimentally
distinguish the intrinsic spin Hall effect from the extrinsic one.
