RuSr2(Nd,Y,Ce)2Cu2O10-d ruthenocuprates have been studied by neutron
diffraction, magnetotransport and magnetisation measurements and the electronic
phase diagram is reported. Separate Ru and Cu spin ordering transitions are
observed, with spontaneous Cu antiferromagnetic order for low hole doping
levels p, and a distinct, induced-antiferromagnetic Cu spin phase in the 0.02 <
p < 0.06 pseudogap region. This ordering gives rise to large negative
magnetoresistances which vary systematically with p in the
RuSr2Nd1.8-xY0.2CexCu2O10-d series. A collapse of the magnetoresistance (MR)
and magnetisation in the pre-superconducting region may signify the onset of
superconducting fluctuations.
