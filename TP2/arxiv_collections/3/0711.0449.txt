Sinusoidal wave solutions are obtained for reduced Maxwell-Duffing equations
describing the wave propagation in a non-resonant atomic medium. These
continuous wave excitations exist when the medium is initially polarized by an
electric field. Other obtained solutions include both mono-frequency and
cnoidal waves.
