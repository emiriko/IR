Causal continuity is usually defined by imposing the conditions (i)
distinction and (ii) reflectivity. It is proved here that a new causality
property which stays between weak distinction and causality, called feeble
distinction, can actually replace distinction in the definition of causal
continuity. An intermediate proof shows that feeble distinction and future
(past) reflectivity implies past (resp. future) distinction. Some new
characterizations of weak distinction and reflectivity are given.
