We report measurements of spin-dependent scattering of conduction electrons
by neutral donors in an accumulation-mode field-effect transistor formed in
isotopically enriched silicon. Spin-dependent scattering was detected using
electrically detected magnetic resonance where the spectra show resonant
changes in the source-drain voltage for conduction electrons and electrons
bound to donors. We discuss the utilization of spin-dependent scattering as a
mechanism for the readout of donor spin-states in silicon based quantum
computers.
