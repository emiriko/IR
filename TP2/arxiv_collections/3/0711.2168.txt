We present numerical renormalization group calculations for the zero-bias
conductance of quantum dots made from semiconducting carbon nanotubes. These
explain and reproduce the thermal evolution of the conductance for different
groups of orbitals, as the dot-lead tunnel coupling is varied and the system
evolves from correlated Kondo behavior to more weakly correlated regimes. For
integer fillings $N=1,2,3$ of an SU(4) model, we find universal scaling
behavior of the conductance that is distinct from the standard SU(2) universal
conductance, and concurs quantitatively with experiment. Our results also agree
qualitatively with experimental differential conductance maps.
