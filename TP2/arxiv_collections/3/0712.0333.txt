As a step toward analyzing second-harmonic generation (SHG) from crystalline
Si nanospheres in glass, we develop an anisotropic bond model (ABM) that
expresses SHG in terms of physically meaningful parameters and provides a
detailed understanding of the basic physics of SHG on the atomic scale.
Nonlinear-optical (NLO) responses are calculated classically via the four
fundamental steps of optics: evaluate the local field at a given bond site,
solve the force equation for the acceleration of the charge, calculate the
resulting radiation, then superpose the radiation from all charges. The ABM
goes beyond previous bond models by including the complete set of underlying
contributions: retardation (RD), spatial-dispersion (SD), and magnetic (MG)
effects, in addition to the anharmonic restoring force acting on the bond
charge. We apply the ABM to obtain analytic expressions for SHG from amorphous
materials under Gaussian-beam excitation. These materials represent an
interesting test case not only because they are ubiquitous but also because the
anharmonic-force contribution that dominates the SHG response of crystalline
materials and ordered interfaces vanishes by symmetry. Using the paraxial-ray
approximation, we reduce the results to the isotropic case in two limits, that
where the linear restoring force dominates (glasses), and that where it is
absent (metals). Both forward- and backscattering geometries are discussed.
Estimated signal strengths and conversion efficiencies for fused silica appear
to be in general agreement with data, where available. Predictions are made
that allow additional critical tests of these results.
