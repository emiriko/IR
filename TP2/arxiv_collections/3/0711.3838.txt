Because the nucleon may be excited and transformed into a virtual $\Delta$
resonance easily, we consider the decuplet contribution to the parity-violating
(PV) nucleon-nucleon interaction in the chiral effective field theory. The
effective PV nucleon-nucleon potential is derived without introducing any
unknown coupling constants.
