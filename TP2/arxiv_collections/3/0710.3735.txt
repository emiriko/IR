A Brownian particle moving in the vicinity of a generic potential minimum
under the influence of dissipation and thermal noise from two different heat
baths is shown to act as a minimal heat engine, generating a systematic torque
onto the physical object at the origin of the potential and an opposite torque
onto the medium generating the dissipation.
