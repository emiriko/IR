Review for exotic strange multibaryon states were obseved in the effective
mass spectra of: 1)$\Lambda \pi^+$, $\Lambda \pi^-$, $\Lambda p$, $\Lambda p
p$, and $\Lambda K^0_S$, $K^0_S\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^0_Sp$ subsystems.The invariant
mass of $\Lambda \pi^+$ and $K^0_S\pi^{\pm}$ spectra has observed well known
$\Sigma^{*+}$(1385) and $K^{*\pm}$(892) resonances. The width of
$\Sigma^{*-}(1385)$ for p+A reaction is two time larger than that presented in
PDG. The cross section of $\Xi^-\to \Lambda \pi^-$ is 7-8 times larger than
expected geometrical cross section in p+propane interaction. A few events
detected on the photographs of the propane bubble chamber, were interpreted as
S=-2 light and heavy $H^{0,+}$ dibaryons.
