The spectral distribution of electron-positron pair created by photon and the
spectral distribution of photons radiated from high-energy electron in an
oriented single crystal is calculated using the method which permits
inseparable consideration both of the coherent and incoherent mechanisms of two
relevant processes. The method includes the action of field of axis (or plane)
as well as the multiple scattering of radiating electron or particles of the
created pair (the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect). The influence of
scattering on the coherent mechanism and the influence of field on the
incoherent mechanism are analyzed. In tungsten, axis $<111>$ for the pair
creation process at temperature T= 100 K the LPM effect attains 8 % at photon
energy 5 GeV and for the radiation process at T= 293 K the LPM effect reaches 6
% at electron energy 10 GeV.
