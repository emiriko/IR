The phenomenon of the spontaneous phase-coherent precession of magnetization
in superfluid 3He and the related effects of spin superfluidity are based on
the true Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons. Several different magnon BEC
states have been observed: homogeneously precessing domain (HPD); BEC
condensation in the spin-orbit potential trap (Q-balls); coherent precession
with fractional magnetization; and two modes of the coherent precession in
squeezed aerogel. The spin superfluidity effects, like spin Josephson
phenomena, spin current vortices, spin phase slippage, long distance
magnetization transport by spin supercurrents have been observed.
