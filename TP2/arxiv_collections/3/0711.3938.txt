We present preliminary results of the PACS-CS project which simulates 2+1
flavor lattice QCD toward the physical point with the nonperturbatively
O(a)-improved Wilson quark action and the Iwasaki gauge action. Calculations
are carried out at beta=1.9 on a 32^3x64 lattice with the use of the
domain-decomposed HMC algorithm to reduce the up-down quark mass. The resulting
pseudoscalar meson masses range from 730 MeV down to 210 MeV. We discuss the
physical results including the chiral analysis in the pseudoscalar meson sector
and the hadron spectrum. Some algorithmic issues are also discussed.
