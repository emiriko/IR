In gravitational Higgs mechanism graviton components acquire mass via
spontaneous diffeomorphism breaking by scalar vacuum expectation values. We
point out that in the massless limit the resulting theory is not
Einstein-Hilbert gravity (EHG) but constrained gravity (CG). Consequently,
massive solutions in the massless limit must be compared to those in CG (as
opposed to EHG). We discuss spherically symmetric solutions in this context.
The Schwarzschild solution in EHG can be coordinate-transformed such that it is
also a solution in CG. The resulting solutions are non-perturbative in the
asymptotic regime, and are reproduced in the massless limit of asymptotic
massive solutions, hence no van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity. We point
out that higher curvature terms must be included to obtain non-singular
spherically symmetric massive solutions and discuss a suitable framework.
