Mode-coupling theory (MCT) of sheared dense granular liquids %in the vicinity
of jamming transition is formulated. Starting from the Liouville equation of
granular particles, the generalized Langevin equation is derived with the aid
of the projection operator technique. The MCT equation for the density
correlation function obtained from the generalized Langevin equation is almost
equivalent to MCT equation for elastic particles under the shear. It is found
that there should be the plateau in the density correlation function.
