We utilize lattice simulations of the dimensionally reduced effective field
theory (EQCD) to determine the quark number susceptibility of QCD at high
temperature ($T>2T_c$). We also use analytic continuation to obtain results at
finite density. The results extrapolate well from known perturbative expansion
(accurate in extremely high temperatures) to 4d lower temperature lattice data
