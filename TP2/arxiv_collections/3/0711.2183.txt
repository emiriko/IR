We study a statistical mechanics model of a solid. Neighboring atoms are
connected by Hookian springs. If the energy is larger than a threshold the
"spring" is more likely to fail, while if the energy is lower than the
threshold the spring is more likely to be alive. The phase diagram and
thermodynamic quantities, such as free energy, numbers of bonds and clusters,
and their fluctuations, are determined using renormalization-group and
Monte-Carlo techniques.
