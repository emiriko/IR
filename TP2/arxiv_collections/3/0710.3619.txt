Intersecting spacelike braneworld cosmologies are investigated. The time axis
is set on the scale parameter of extra space, which may include more than one
timelike metric. Obtained are eternally inflating (i.e. undergoing late-time
inflation) Robertson-Walker spacetime and extra space with a constant scale
factor. In the case of multibrane solutions, some dimensions are static or
shrink. The fact that the largest supersymmetry algebra contains 32
supercharges in 4 dimensions imposes a restriction on the geometry of extra
space.
