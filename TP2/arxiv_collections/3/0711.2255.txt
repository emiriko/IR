The GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA, is designed for the search for
``neutrinoless double beta decay'' (0-nu-2-beta) with germanium detectors
enriched in Ge76. An 18-fold segmented prototype detector for GERDA Phase II
was exposed to an AmBe neutron source to improve the understanding of neutron
induced backgrounds. Neutron interactions with the germanium isotopes
themselves and in the surrounding materials were studied. Segment information
is used to identify neutron induced peaks in the recorded energy spectra. The
Geant4 based simulation package MaGe is used to simulate the experiment. Though
many photon peaks from germanium isotopes excited by neutrons are correctly
described by Geant4, some physics processes were identified as being
incorrectly treated or even missing.
