We investigate the prospects for the discovery at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider or at the Fermilab Tevatron of neutral Higgs bosons through the
channel where the Higgs are produced together with a single bottom quark and
the Higgs decays into a pair of tau leptons, $bg \to b\phi^0 \to b\tau^+\tau^-,
\phi^0 = h^0, H^0, A^0$. We work within the framework of the minimal
supersymmetric model. The dominant physics background from the production of
$b\tau^+\tau^-$, $j\tau^+\tau^-$ ($j = g, u, d, s, c$), $b\bar{b}W^+W^-$,
$W+2j$ and $Wbj$ is calculated with realistic acceptance cuts and efficiencies.
Promising results are found for the CP-odd pseudoscalar ($A^0$) and the heavier
CP-even scalar ($H^0$) Higgs bosons with masses up to one TeV.
