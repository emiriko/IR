The idea of design domain specific Mother Model of IP block family as a base
of modeling of system integration is presented here. A common reconfigurable
Mother Model for ten different standardized digital OFDM transmitters has been
developed. By means of a set of parameters, the mother model can be
reconfigured to any of the ten selected standards. So far the applicability of
the proposed reconfiguration and analog-digital co-modeling methods have been
proved by modeling the function of the digital parts of three, 802.11a, ADSL
and DRM, transmitters in an RF system simulator. The model is intended to be
used as signal source template in RF system simulations. The concept is not
restricted to signal sources, it can be applied to any IP block development.
The idea of the Mother Model will be applied in other design domains to prove
that in certain application areas, OFDM transceivers in this case, the design
process can progress simultaneously in different design domains - mixed signal,
system and RTL-architectural - without the need of high-level synthesis. Only
the Mother Models of three design domains are needed to be formally proved to
function as specified.
