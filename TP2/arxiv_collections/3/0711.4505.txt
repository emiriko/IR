Stark transitions and induced annihilation of antiproton in the collisions of
antiprotonic helium ions (\bar{p}He^{+2})_{nl} with He atoms at very low energy
(~ 10 K) are considered in the framework of quantum coupled-channels method
taking into account all the states with different l at given n~30, including
the annihilating ns and np-states. Elastic scattering, Stark transitions and
induced annihilation during collisions are produced by scalar and dipole terms
in the interaction. It is shown that the most important contribution to the
processes comes from the long-range polarization interaction. Admixtures of the
ns and np-states to the states with higher l during collisions induce the
effective annihilation cross sections for the initial l up to 15, but don't
affect the Stark cross sections for the initial states nearly to circular
orbits. Total rates of the Stark transitions from the circular orbits with n=28
- 32, averaged over the thermal motion, are compatible with the recent ASACUSA
data. Isotope effect as well as the dependence on n are also qualitatively
agree with the experiment.
