The latest PHENIX results for particle production are presented in this
paper. A suppression of the yield of high p_t (transverse momentum) hadrons in
central Au+Au collisions is found. In contrast, direct photons are not
suppressed in central Au+Au collisions and no suppression of high p_t particles
can be seen in d+Au collisions. This leads to the conclusion that the dense
medium formed in central Au+Au collisions is responsible for the suppression.
It is as well found, that the properties of this medium are similar to the one
of a liquid. Further measurements provide information about the chiral dynamics
of the system.
