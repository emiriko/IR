Experimental results on the density of states and on the acoustic modes of
glasses in the THz region are compared to the predictions of two categories of
models. A recent one, solely based on an elastic instability, does not account
for most observations. Good agreement without adjustable parameters is obtained
with models including the existence of non-acoustic vibrational modes at THz
frequency, providing in many cases a comprehensive picture for a range of glass
anomalies.
