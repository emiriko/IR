We show how translational invariance can be broken by the vacuum that drives
the spontaneous symmetry breaking of extra-dimensional extensions of the
Standard Model, when delta-like interactions between brane and bulk scalar
fields are present. We explicitly build some examples of vacuum configurations,
which induce the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and have non trivial profile in
the extra coordinate.
