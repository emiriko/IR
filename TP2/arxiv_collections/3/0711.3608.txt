We provide a quantum benchmark for teleportation and storage of single-mode
squeezed states with zero displacement and a completely unknown degree of
squeezing along a given direction. For pure squeezed input states, a fidelity
higher than 81.5% has to be attained in order to outperform any classical
strategy based on an estimation of the unknown squeezing and repreparation of
squeezed states. For squeezed thermal input states, we derive an upper and a
lower bound on the classical average fidelity which tighten for moderate degree
of mixedness. These results enable a critical discussion of recent experiments
with squeezed light.
