The Kerr-Newman spinning particle displays some remarkable relations to the
Dirac electron and has a reach spinor structure which is based on a twistorial
description of the Kerr congruence determined by the Kerr theorem. We consider
the relation between this spinor-twistorial structure and spinors of the Dirac
equation, and show that the Dirac equation may naturally be incorporated into
Kerr-Schild formalism as a master equation controlling the twistorial structure
of Kerr geometry. As a result, the Dirac electron acquires an extended
space-time structure having clear coordinate description with natural
incorporation of a gravitational field. The relation between the Dirac wave
function and Kerr geometry is realized via a chain of links: {\it Dirac wave
function $ \Rightarrow $ Complex Kerr-Newman Source $ \Rightarrow $ Kerr
Theorem $ \Rightarrow $ Real Kerr geometry.} As a result, the wave function
acquires the role of an ``order parameter'' which controls spin, dynamics, and
twistorial polarization of Kerr-Newman space-time.
