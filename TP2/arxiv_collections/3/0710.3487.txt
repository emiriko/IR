We study decoherence of nuclear spins in a GaAs quantum well structure using
resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonance. The transverse decoherence
time T2 of 75As nuclei is estimated from Rabi-type coherent oscillations as
well as by using spin-echo techniques. By analyzing T2 obtained by decoupling
techniques, we extract the role of dipole-dipole interactions as sources of
decoherence in GaAs. Under the condition that the device is tilted in an
external magnetic field, we exhibit enhanced decoherence induced by the change
in strength of the direct dipole-dipole interactions between first
nearest-neighbor nuclei. The results agree well with simple numerical
calculations.
