We derive new duality relations that link the energy of configurations
associated with a class of soft pair potentials to the corresponding energy of
the dual (Fourier-transformed) potential. We apply them by showing how
information about the classical ground states of short-ranged potentials can be
used to draw new conclusions about the nature of the ground states of
long-ranged potentials and vice versa. They also lead to bounds on the T=0
system energies in density intervals of phase coexistence, the identification
of a one-dimensional system that exhibits an infinite number of ``phase
transitions," and a conjecture regarding the ground states of purely repulsive
monotonic potentials.
