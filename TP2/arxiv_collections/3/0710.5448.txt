We study the effect of defects in the Mott insulator phase of ultracold atoms
in an optical lattice on the dynamics of resonant excitations. Defects, which
can either be empty sites in a Mott insulator state with one atom per site or a
singly occupied site for a filling factor two, change the dynamics of Frenkel
excitons and cavity polaritons. While the vacancies in first case behave like
hard sphere scatters for excitons, singly occupied sites in the latter case can
lead to attractive or repulsive scattering potentials. We suggest cavity
polaritons as observation tool of such defects, and show how the scattering can
be controlled in changing the exciton-photon detuning. In the case of
asymmetric optical lattice sites we present how the scattering effective
potential can be detuned by the cavity photon polarization direction, with the
possibility of a crossover from a repulsive into an attractive potential.
