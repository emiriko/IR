Until presently, most approaches for understanding physiological or
pathological phenomena have been based on the assumption that these processes
start from individual cells, a concept introduced primarily by Virchow in the
19th century. Yet, it has also been increasingly recognized that this
perception is insufficient, at least when it comes to grasping the mechanisms
underlying largely incurable diseases such as metastatic cancer or rheumatoid
arthritis. Despite this insight, even recently founded disciplines such as
systems biology are still locked in this century-old mind-set of cellular
building blocks and thus predictably of limited usefulness. Other studies
conducted over the past years, however, suggest that there is something more
fundamental to life and its various conditions than the cell: peptide strings.
Here, I review the origin and nature of these sub- and trans-cellular elements
as well as their potential to provide the long-sought answers hitherto
inaccessible to cell biology.
