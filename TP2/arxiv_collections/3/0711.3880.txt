We investigate systematically how to extract new physics contributions in B
--> K pi l^+ l^- decay by using the angular decomposition. The decomposition
will enable us to define not only several CP averaged forward-backward (FB)
asymmetries but also the direct CP asymmetry and the time-dependent mixing
induced CP asymmetry for each FB asymmetry newly defined in the general 4 body
angular space. The decay process involves several intermediate vector and
scalar resonances as sources of strong phase difference through interference,
therefore, one can expect largely enhanced CP asymmetries, if there exists any
new physics with weak CP phases. The combined analysis of the FB and CP
asymmetries will give us fruitful information about new physics contributions
in detail.
