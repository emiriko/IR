We consider the extended 2D $t-t'-t''-J$ model at zero temperature.
Parameters of the model corresponds to doping by holes. Using the low doping
effective action we demonstrate that the system can 1) preserve the long range
collinear antiferromagnetic order, 2) lead to a spin spiral state (static or
dynamic), 3) lead to the phase separation instability. We show that at
parameters of the effective action corresponding to the single layer cuprate
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ the spin spiral ground state is realized. We derive
properties of magnetic excitations and calculate quantum fluctuations. Quantum
fluctuations destroy the static spin spiral at the critical doping $x_c\approx
0.11$. This is the point of the quantum phase transition to the spin-liquid
state (dynamic spin spiral). The state is still double degenerate with respect
to the direction of the dynamic spiral, so this is a ``directional nematic''.
The superconducting pairing exists throughout the phase diagram and is not
sensitive to the quantum phase transition. We also compare the calculated
neutron scattering spectra with experimental data.
