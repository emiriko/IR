On unitary compact groups the decomposition of a generic element into product
of reflections induces a decomposition of the characteristic polynomial into a
product of factors. When the group is equipped with the Haar probability
measure, these factors become independent random variables with explicit
distributions. Beyond the known results on the orthogonal and unitary groups
(O(n) and U(n)), we treat the symplectic case. In U(n), this induces a family
of probability changes analogous to the biassing in the Ewens sampling formula
known for the symmetric group. Then we study the spectral properties of these
measures, connected to the pure Fisher-Hartvig symbol on the unit circle. The
associated orthogonal polynomials give rise, as $n$ tends to infinity to a
limit kernel at the singularity.
