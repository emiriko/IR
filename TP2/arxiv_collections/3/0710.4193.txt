We systematically study total reaction cross sections of carbon isotopes with
N=6-16 on a proton target for wide range of incident energies, putting an
emphasis on the difference from the case of a carbon target. The analysis
includes the reaction cross sections of ^{19,20,22}C at 40 AMeV, the data of
which have recently been measured at RIKEN. The Glauber theory is used to
calculate the reaction cross sections. To describe the intrinsic structure of
the carbon isotopes, we use a Slater determinant generated from a
phenomenological mean-field potential, and construct the density distributions.
To go beyond the simple mean-field model, we adopt two types of dynamical
models: One is a core+n model for odd-neutron nuclei, and the other is a
core+n+n model for 16C and 22C. We propose empirical formulas which are useful
in predicting unknown cross sections.
