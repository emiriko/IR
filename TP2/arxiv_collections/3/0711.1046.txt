Probability waves in the configuration space are associated with coherent
solutions of the classical Liouville or Fokker-Planck equations. Distributions
localized in the momentum space provide action waves, specified by the
probability density and the generating function of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.
It is shown that by introducing a minimum distance in the coordinate space, the
action distributions aquire the energy dispersion specific to the quantum
objects. At finite temperature, probability density waves propagating with the
sound velocity are obtained as nonstationary solutions of the classical
Fokker-Planck equation. The results suggest that in a system of quantum
Brownian particles, a transition from complex to real probability waves could
be observed.
