The Little Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) belongs to the non-minimal flavour
violating model. This model has new sources of flavour and CP violation both in
quark and leptonic sectors. These new sources of flavour violation originates
by the interaction of Standard Model (SM) fermions with heavy gauge bosons and
heavy (or mirror) fermions. In this work we will present the impact of the new
flavour structure of T-parity models on flavour violations in leptonic sector.
