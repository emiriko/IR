The Monte Carlo simulation of $N$ point vortices with square periodic
boundary conditions is performed where $N$ is order of 100. The clustering
property is examined by computing the $L$ function familiar in the field of
spatial ecology. The case of a positive value of $L$ corresponds to the state
of clustering and the Onsager's negative temperature.
