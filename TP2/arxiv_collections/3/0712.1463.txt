We consider a system made up of N electrons interacting with a neutralizing
positive background within a cubic box of volume V. After dividing the box into
N (or N/2) cubic cells for the polarized (unpolarized) case, we average the
creation field operator over each cell with a suitable weight function and we
consider the quantum crystalline states obtained by letting all the average
operators act on the vacuum state. These states exclude the possibility that
each cell may momentarily contain more than one or two electrons in the
polarized or unpolarized case. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian over
this class of states is evaluated in the thermodynamic limit and the weight
function is chosen in such a way to minimize the expectation value. The
involved numerical analysis is explicitly performed with a weight function
having a generalized Gaussian shape depending on a parameter. It turns out that
the unpolarized and polarized quantum crystalline states yield an energy per
particle smaller than the homogeneous Hartree-Fock ones for r_s>90 and r_s>28,
respectively. Moreover, for the polarized case, the energy per particle at
r_s=100 is -0.01448ryd close {to -0.0153530(8)ryd, the best quantum Monte Carlo
value [Drummond et al., Phys. Rev.B {\bf 69}, 085116, (2004)] and this
discrepancy measures the correlation contribution neglected in our
approximation.
