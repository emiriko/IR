In this letter we continue the calculation of master integrals for massless
three-loop form factors by giving analytical results for those integrals which
are relevant for the fermionic contributions proportional to N_F^2, N_F*N, and
N_F/N. Working in dimensional regularisation, we express one of the integrals
in a closed form which is exact to all orders in epsilon, containing
Gamma-functions and hypergeometric functions of unit argument. In all other
cases we derive multiple Mellin-Barnes representations from which the
coefficients of the Laurent expansion in epsilon are extracted in an analytical
form. To obtain the finite part of the three-loop quark and gluon form factors,
all coefficients through transcendentality six in the Riemann zeta-function
have to be included.
