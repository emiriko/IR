Modifications of spatial distributions of dynamic magnetization corresponding
to spinwave eigenmodes of magnetic squares subjected to a strong microwave
excitation field have been studied experimentally and theoretically. We show
that an increase of the excitation power leads to a nonlinear generation of
long-wavelength spatial harmonics caused by the nonlinear cross coupling
between the eigenmodes. The analysis of the experimental data shows that this
process is mainly governed by the action of the nonlinear spin-wave damping.
This conclusion is further supported by the numerical calculations based on the
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation phenomenologically taking into account the
nonlinear damping.
