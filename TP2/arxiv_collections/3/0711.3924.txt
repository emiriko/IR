In this paper we derive the moderate deviation principle for stationary
sequences of bounded random variables under martingale-type conditions.
Applications to functions of $\phi$-mixing sequences, contracting Markov
chains, expanding maps of the interval, and symmetric random walks on the
circle are given.
