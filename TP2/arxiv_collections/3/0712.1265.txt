We analyze the results of a recent experiment with bosonic rubidium atoms
harmonically confined in a quasi-two-dimensional geometry. In this experiment a
well defined critical point was identified, which separates the
high-temperature normal state characterized by a single component density
distribution, and the low-temperature state characterized by a bimodal density
distribution and the emergence of high-contrast interference between
independent two-dimensional clouds. We first show that this transition cannot
be explained in terms of conventional Bose-Einstein condensation of the trapped
ideal Bose gas. Using the local density approximation, we then combine the
mean-field (MF) Hartree-Fock theory with the prediction for the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in an infinite uniform system. If
the gas is treated as a strictly 2D system, the MF predictions for the spatial
density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent Quantum
Monte-Carlo (QMC) analysis. However when the residual thermal excitation of the
strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, an excellent
agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction
strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the
critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor $\sim 2$). A
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the
critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature
calibration.
