We investigate stochastic extinction in an epidemic model and the impact of
random vaccinations in large populations formulated in terms of an optimal
escape path. We find that different random vaccination strategies can have
widely different results in decreasing expected time till extinction, for the
same total amount of vaccines used. Vaccination strategies are considered in
terms of two parameters: average frequency of vaccinations, given by $\gamma$,
and the amplitude of the vaccinations, $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon \ll 1$
refers to the proportion of the population being vaccinated at some particular
instant. It is found that while the average number of individuals vaccinated
per unit time, $\gamma \epsilon$, is kept constant, the particular values of
$\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ can play a highly significant role in increasing the
chance of epidemic extinction. The findings suggest that expected time till
extinction can be significantly shortened if less frequent vaccinations occur
in larger groups, corresponding to low $\gamma$, high $\epsilon$ strategy.
