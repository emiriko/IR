Induced thermal scattering power thresholds have been calculated as a
function of size and laser pump frequency. The thermal coupling coefficients of
morphology dependent resonances were estimated by asymptotic methods. The
resulting power threshold is comparable with experimental observations of
thresholds of Raman lasing and thermal instability in spherical silica
resonators. Applications may include the remote measurement of the temperature
of aerosol droplets and the stabilization of microcavity lasers against thermal
oscillations and temperature deviations on microcavity. A silica resonator can
be used as an IR sensor, as well as an additional tool for precisely measuring
the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of a target in a microsphere by
calculating of the thermal shifts of eigenfrequencies in spectra of nonlinear
scattering.
