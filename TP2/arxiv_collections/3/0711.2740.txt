We make predictions for the diffractive longitudinal structure function F_L^D
to be measured at HERA, based on DGLAP fits of diffractive parton distributions
with twist--4 contribution. This contribution describes diffractive qqbar
production from longitudinal photons and significantly changes predictions for
F_L^D obtained in pure DGLAP analyses.
