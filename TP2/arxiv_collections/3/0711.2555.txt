We compute the chains associated to the left-invariant CR structures on the
three-sphere. These structures are characterized by a single real modulus $a$.
For the standard structure $a=1$, the chains are well-known and are closed
curves. We show that for almost all other values of the modulus $a$ either two
or three types of chains are simultaneously present : (I) closed curves, (II)
quasi-periodic curves dense on two-torii, or (III) chains homoclinic between
closed curves. For $1 < a < \sqrt{3}$ no curves of the last type occur.
  A bifurcation occurs at $a = \sqrt{3}$ and from that point on all three types
of chains are guaranteed to exist, and exhaust all chains. The method of proof
is to use the Fefferman metric characterization of chains, combined with tools
from geometric mechanics. The key to the computation is a reduced Hamiltonian
system, similar to Euler's rigid body system, and depending on $a$, which is
integrable.
