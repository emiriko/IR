We use a generalised Kummer construction to realise all but one known weight
four newforms with complex multiplication and rational Fourier coefficients in
smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds defined over the rational numbers. The Calabi-Yau
manifolds are smooth models of quotients of the Weil restrictions of elliptic
curves with CM of class number three.
