This paper presents the methodology and the modeling constructs we have
developed to capture the real time aspects of RTOS simulation models in a
System Level Design Language (SLDL) like SystemC. We describe these constructs
and show how they are used to build a simulation model of an RTOS kernel
targeting the $\mu$-ITRON OS specification standard.
