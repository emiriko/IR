We present very simple method for constructing indecomposable entanglement
witnesses out of a given pair -- an entanglement witness W and the
corresponding state detected by W. This method may be used to produce new
classes of atomic witnesses which are able to detect the `weakest' quantum
entanglement. Actually, it works perfectly in the multipartite case, too.
Moreover, this method provides a powerful tool for constructing new examples of
bound entangled states.
