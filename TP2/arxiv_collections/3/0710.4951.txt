We develop a finite-state automata approach, implemented in a Maple package
{\tt ToadsAndFrogs} available from our websites, for conjecturing, and then
rigorously proving, values for large families of positions in Richard Guy's
combinatorial game ``Toads and Frogs''. In particular, we prove a conjecture of
Jeff Erickson.
