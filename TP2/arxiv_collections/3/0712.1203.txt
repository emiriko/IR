Radiation hydrodynamics simulations were used to study the effect of plastic
ablators in laser-driven shock experiments. The sensitivity to composition and
equation of state was found to be 5-10% in ablation pressure. As was found for
metals, a laser pulse of constant irradiance gave a pressure history which
decreased by several percent per nanosecond. The pressure history could be made
more constant by adjusting the irradiance history. The impedance mismatch with
the sample gave an increase o(100%) in the pressure transmitted into the
sample, for a reduction of several tens of percent in the duration of the peak
load applied to the sample, and structured the release history by adding a
release step to a pressure close to the ablation pressure. Algebraic relations
were found between the laser pulse duration, the ablator thickness, and the
duration of the peak pressure applied to the sample, involving quantities
calculated from the equations of state of the ablator and sample using shock
dynamics.
