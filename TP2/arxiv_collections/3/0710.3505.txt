Studies of the effect of high pressure on superconductivity began in 1925
with the seminal work of Sizoo and Onnes on Sn to 0.03 GPa and have continued
up to the present day to pressures in the 200 - 300 GPa range. Such enormous
pressures cause profound changes in all condensed matter properties, including
superconductivity. In high pressure experiments metallic elements, Tc values
have been elevated to temperatures as high as 20 K for Y at 115 GPa and 25 K
for Ca at 160 GPa. These pressures are sufficient to turn many insulators into
metals and magnetics into superconductors. The changes will be particularly
dramatic when the pressure is sufficient to break up one or more atomic shells.
Recent results in superconductivity to Mbar pressures wll be discussed which
exemplify the progress made in this field over the past 82 years.
