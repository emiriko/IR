A technique based on the sensitivity of the output to input waveform is
presented for accurate propagation of delay information through a gate for the
purpose of static timing analysis (STA) in the presence of noise. Conventional
STA tools represent a waveform by its arrival time and slope. However, this is
not an accurate way of modeling the waveform for the purpose of noise analysis.
The key contribution of our work is the development of a method that allows
efficient propagation of equivalent waveforms throughout the circuit.
Experimental results demonstrate higher accuracy of the proposed
sensitivity-based gate delay propagation technique, SGDP, compared to the best
of existing approaches. SGDP is compatible with the current level of gate
characterization in conventional ASIC cell libraries, and as a result, it can
be easily incorporated into commercial STA tools to improve their accuracy.
