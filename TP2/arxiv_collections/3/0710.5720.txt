We have studied the validity of the spin polaron picture in the frustrated
J1-J2 Heisenberg model. For this purpose, we have computed the hole spectral
functions for the Neel, collinear, and disordered phases of this model, by
means of the self-consistent Born approximation and Lanczos exact
diagonalization on finite-size clusters. We have found that the spin polaron
quasiparticle excitation is always well defined for the magnetically ordered
Neel and collinear phases, even in the vicinity of the magnetic quantum
critical points, where the local magnetization vanishes. As a general feature,
the effect of frustration is to increase the amplitude of the multimagnon
states that build up the spin polaron wave function, leading to the reduction
of the quasiparticle coherence. Based on Lanczos results, we discuss the
validity of the spin polaron picture in the disordered phase.
