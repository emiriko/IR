New actions in D=2 and D=3 are proposed that are dual equivalent to known
theories displaying well defined chirality and helicity, respectively, along
with a new interpolating action that maps continuously through the original
dualities. The new chiral action in D=2 is a second-order theory displaying the
chiral constraint dynamically while in D=3 the helicity constraint is imposed a
la Siegel. The resulting theories introduce new versions of the Hull noton to
take care of the symmetry aspects of the original models. The new interpolating
formulation is then re-examined as a condensed phase for the discussion of
duality under the light of the dual mechanisms -- Julia-Toulouse and Higgs --
establishing new interpolating actions in the dilute phase, according to these
mechanisms.
