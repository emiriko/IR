I discuss motivations for introducing Hopf algebra symmetries in
noncommutative field theories and briefly describe twisting of main symmetry
transformations. New results include an extended list of twisted gauge
invariants (which may help to overcome the problem of inconsistency of
equations of motion) and a gauge-covariant twist operator (leading to a
gauge-covariant star product).
