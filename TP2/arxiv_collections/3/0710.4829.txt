This paper describes first results from the AutoMoDe (Automotive Model-Based
Development) project. The overall goal of the project is to develop an
integrated methodology for model-based development of automotive control
software, based on problem-specific design notations with an explicit formal
foundation. Based on the existing AutoFOCUS framework, a tool prototype is
being developed in order to illustrate and validate the key elements of our
approach.
