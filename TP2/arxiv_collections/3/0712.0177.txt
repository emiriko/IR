This talk presents the results of our study of systematic errors of the
ground-state parameters obtained by Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum
rules. We use the harmonic-oscillator potential model as an example: in this
case we know the exact solution for the polarization operator, which allows us
to obtain both the OPE to any order and the parameters (masses and decay
constants) of the bound states. We extract the parameters of the ground state
by making use of the standard procedures of the method of QCD sum rules, and
compare the obtained results with their known exact values. We show that if the
continuum contribution to the polarization operator is not known and is
modelled by some effective continuum threshold, the standard procedures adopted
in sum rules do not allow one to gain control over the systematic errors of the
extracted ground-state parameters.
