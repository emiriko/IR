These proceedings describe the physics goals and initial design for a new
experiment: NuSOnG -- Neutrino Scattering On Glass. The design will yield about
two orders of magnitude higher statistics than previous high energy neutrino
experiments, observed in a detector optimized for low hadronic energy and
electromagnetic events. As a result, the purely weak processes $\nu_{\mu}+e^-
\to \nu_{\mu}+ e^-$ and $\nu_{\mu}+ e^- \to \nu_e + \mu^-$ (inverse muon decay)
can be measured with high accuracy for the first time. This allows important
precision electroweak tests and well as direct searches for new physics. The
high statistics also will yield the world's largest sample of Deep Inelastic
(DIS) events for precision parton distribution studies.
