We present and analyse a three-dimensional model for a quantum dot
semiconductor laser with optical injection. This model describes recent
experimental single and double excitable intensity pulses, which are related to
a central saddle-node homoclinic bifurcation as in the Adler equation. Double
pulses are related to a period doubling bifurcation and occur on the same
homoclinic curve as single pulses. The bifurcation scenario consolidating
single and double excitable pulses is described in detail.
