The Semantic Web drives towards the use of the Web for interacting with
logically interconnected data. Through knowledge models such as Resource
Description Framework (RDF), the Semantic Web provides a unifying
representation of richly structured data. Adding logic to the Web implies the
use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer
questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of
objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to
consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to
problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that
inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert
anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web
environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified
variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the
Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of
N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same
language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and
illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.
