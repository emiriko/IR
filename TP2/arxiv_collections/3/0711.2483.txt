We study the decoherence of two coupled spins that interact with a spin-bath
environment. It is shown that the connectivity and the coupling strength
between the spins in the environment are of crucial importance for the
decoherence of the central system. Changing the connectivity or coupling
strenghts changes the decoherence of the central system from Gaussian to
exponential decay law.
