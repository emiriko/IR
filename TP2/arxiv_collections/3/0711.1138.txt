Evidence is reported for the existence of a parity doublet of Delta
resonances with total angular momentum J=3/2 from photoproduction of the p pi^0
eta final state. The two parity partners Delta(1920)P_{33} and
Delta(1940)D_{33} make significant contributions to the reaction. Cascades of
resonances into Delta(1232) eta, N(1535) pi, and N a_0(980) are clearly
observed.
