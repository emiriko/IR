Solid NH3 and ND3 provide a highly polarizable, radiation resistant source of
polarized protons and deuterons and have been used extensively in high
luminosity experiments investigating the spin structure of the nucleon. Over
the past twenty years, the UVA polarized target group has been instrumental in
producing and polarizing much of the material used in these studies, and many
practical considerations have been learned in this time. In this discussion, we
analyze the polarization performance of the solid ammonia targets used during
the recent JLab Eg4 run. Topics include the rate of polarization decay with
accumulated charge, the annealing procedure for radiation damaged targets to
recover polarization, and the radiation induced change in optimum microwave
frequency used to polarize the sample. We also discuss the success we have had
in implementing frequency modulation of the polarizing microwave frequency.
