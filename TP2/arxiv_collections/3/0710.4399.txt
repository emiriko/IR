We describe a self consistent magnetic tight-binding theory based in an
expansion of the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional to second order, about a non
spin polarised reference density. We show how a first order expansion about a
density having a trial input magnetic moment leads to the Stoner--Slater rigid
band model. We employ a simple set of tight-binding parameters that accurately
describes electronic structure and energetics, and show these to be
transferable between first row transition metals and their alloys. We make a
number of calculations of the electronic structure of dilute Cr impurities in
Fe which we compare with results using the local spin density approximation.
The rigid band model provides a powerful means for interpreting complex
magnetic configurations in alloys; using this approach we are able to advance a
simple and readily understood explanation for the observed anomaly in the
enthalpy of mixing.
