The obtained $\pi^{-}$ and charged multiplicity distribution parameters of
Gluon Dominance Model explain the experimental data in nucleus-nucleus, p
nucleus, pd, pp, p antip and $\pi^{-}$(p,n) interactions. We have undertaken an
attempt to give description in different processes of multiparticle production
by means of a unifed approach based on quark-gluon picture using the
phenomenological hadronization. We have obtained agreement of GDM with
experimental data in a very wide energy range.
