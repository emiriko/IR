Anomalous transport of a particle subjected to non-Ohmic damping of the power
$\delta$ in a tilted periodic potential is investigated via Monte Carlo
simulation of generalized Langevin equation. It is found that the system
exhibits two relative motion modes: the locking state and the running state.
Under the surrounding of sub-Ohmic damping ($0<\delta<1$), the particle should
transfer into a running state from a locking state only when local minima of
the potential vanish; hence the particle occurs a synchronization oscillation
in its mean displacement and mean square displacement (MSD). In particular, the
two motion modes are allowed to coexist in the case of super-Ohmic damping
($1<\delta<2$) for moderate driving forces, namely, where exists double centers
in the velocity distribution. This induces the particle having faster
diffusion, i.e., its MSD reads $<\Delta x^2(t)> = 2D^{(\delta)}_{eff}
t^{\delta_{eff}}$. Our result shows that the effective power index
$\delta_{\textmd{eff}}$ can be enhanced and is a nonmonotonic function of the
temperature and the driving force. The mixture effect of the two motion modes
also leads to a breakdown of hysteresis loop of the mobility.
