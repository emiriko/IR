The long awaited experimental results from MiniBooNE have recently been
announced. This experiment tests whether neutrino oscillations can occur at a
higher mass squared difference $\sim1 {eV}^2$ compared to well established
observations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The LSND experiment has
previously claimed to have observed neutrino oscillations at $\Delta m^2 \sim 1
{eV}^2$, however the results being controversial, required an independent
confirmation. The MiniBooNE results settle this controversy by observing null
oscillations at the said mass squared difference. These results have strong
implications on existence of sterile neutrinos, CPT violation and mass varying
neutrinos. We review the present status of neutrino masses and mixing in the
light of this recent result.
