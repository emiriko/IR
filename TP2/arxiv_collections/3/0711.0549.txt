Gravitational probes should maintain spatial flatness for
Einsten-Infeld-Hoffmann dynamics of relativistic matter-energy. The continuous
elementary source/particle in Einstein's gravitational theory is the r^{-4}
radial energy density rather than the delta-operator density in empty-space
gravitation. The space energy integral of such an infinite (astro)particle is
finite and determines its nonlocal gravitational charge for the
energy-to-energy attraction of other nonlocal (astro)particles. The non-empty
flat space of the undivided material Universe is charged continuously by the
world energy density of the global ensemble of overlapping radial particles.
Nonlocal gravitational/inertial energy-charges incorporate Machian relativism
quantitatively into Einstein's gravitation for self-contained SR-GR dynamics
without references on Newton's mass-to-mass attraction.
