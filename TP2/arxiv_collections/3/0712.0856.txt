We extend our earlier study of the electroweak interactions of quantum knots
to their gravitational and strong interactions. The knots are defined by
appropriate quantum groups and are intended to describe all knotted field
structures that conserve mass and spin, charge and hypercharge, as well as
color charge and color hypercharge. As sources of the gravitational fields the
knots are described as representations of the quantum group $SL_q(2)$ and as
sources of the electroweak and strong fields they are described by $SU_q(2)$.
When the point sources of the standard theory are replaced by the quantum
knots, the interaction terms of the new Lagrangian density acquire knot form
factors and the standard local gauge invariance is supplemented by an
additional global $U(1)\times U(1)$ invariance of the $SU_q(2)$ algebra.
