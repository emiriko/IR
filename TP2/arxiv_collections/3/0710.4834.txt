In this paper a general architecture suitable to interface several kinds of
sensors for automotive applications is presented. A platform based design
approach is pursued to improve system performance while minimizing
time-to-market.. The platform is composed by an analog front-end and a digital
section. The latter is based on a microcontroller core (8051 IP by Oregano)
plus a set of dedicated hardware dedicated to the complex signal processing
required for sensor conditioning. The microcontroller handles also the
communication with external devices (as a PC) for data output and fast
prototyping. A case study is presented concerning the conditioning of a Gyro
yaw rate sensor for automotive applications. Measured performance results
outperform current state-of-the-art commercial devices.
