We prove the multi-band Bloch oscillation and Stark ladder in the $nk$ and
site representation from the Floquet theorem. The proof is also possible from
the equivalence between the Floquet system, Bloch oscillation, and the rotator
with spin. We also exactly solve the periodically driven two level atom and two
band Bloch oscillation in terms of Heun function.
