An analogue testing standard IEEE 1149.4 is mainly targeted for low-frequency
testing. The problem studied in this paper is extending the standard also for
radio frequency testing. IEEE 1149.4 compatible measurement structures (ABMs)
developed in this study extract the information one is measuring from the radio
frequency signal and represent the result as a DC voltage level. The ABMs
presented in this paper are targeted for power and frequency measurements
operating in frequencies from 1 GHz to 2 GHz. The power measurement error
caused by temperature, supply voltage and process variations is roughly 2 dB
and the frequency measurement error is 0.1 GHz, respectively.
