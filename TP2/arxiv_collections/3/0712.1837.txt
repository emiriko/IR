We study four different approximations for finding the profile of discrete
solitons in the one-dimensional Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS)
Equation. Three of them are discrete approximations (namely, a variational
approach, an approximation to homoclinic orbits and a Green-function approach),
and the other one is a quasi-continuum approximation. All the results are
compared with numerical computations.
