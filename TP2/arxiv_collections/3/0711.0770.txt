All fields of the standard model and gravity are unified as an E8 principal
bundle connection. A non-compact real form of the E8 Lie algebra has G2 and F4
subalgebras which break down to strong su(3), electroweak su(2) x u(1),
gravitational so(3,1), the frame-Higgs, and three generations of fermions
related by triality. The interactions and dynamics of these 1-form and
Grassmann valued parts of an E8 superconnection are described by the curvature
and action over a four dimensional base manifold.
