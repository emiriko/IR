Extended $U_e(1)\times U_g(1)$ electromagnetism containing both a photon and
a pseudo-photon is introduced at variational level and is justified by the
violation of the Bianchi identities in conceptual systems, either in the
presence of magnetic monopoles or non-regular external fields, not being
accounted by the standard Maxwell action. It is shown that in the perturbative
quantum field theory regimes there are observable consequences both for the
magnetic momenta and second order vacuum polarization radiative corrections in
the presence of non-regular strong electromagnetic fields (e.g. rotating
magnetic fields).
