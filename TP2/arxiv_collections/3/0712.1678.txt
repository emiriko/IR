In this work we discuss the dynamics of a three dimensional chain which is
described by generalized nonlinear sigma model The formula of the probability
distribution of two topologically entangled chain is provided. The interesting
case of a chain which can form only discrete angles with respect to the
$z-$axis is also presented.
