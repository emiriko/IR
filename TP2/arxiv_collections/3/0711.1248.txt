It is shown that the previously noted extreme perturbative NNLO/NLO
instability of the longitudinal structure function F_L(x,Q^2) is a mere
artefact of the commonly utilized `standard' gluon distributions. In particular
it is demonstrated that using the appropriate -- dynamically generated --
parton distributions at NLO and NNLO, F_L(x,Q^2) turns out to be perturbatively
rather stable already for Q^2 $\geq$ O(2-3 GeV^2).
