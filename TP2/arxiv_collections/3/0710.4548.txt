Catalyzed big bang nucleosynthesis (CBBN) can lead to an overproduction of
^6Li in gravitino dark matter scenarios in which the lighter stau is the
lightest Standard Model superpartner. Based on a treatment using the
state-of-the-art result for the catalyzed ^6Li production cross section, we
update the resulting constraint within the framework of the constrained minimal
supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). We confront our numerical findings with
recently derived conservative limits on the gaugino mass parameter and the
reheating temperature.
