The CODATA recommended values of the fundamental constants are widely applied
in particle, nuclear and atomic physics. They are a result of a complicated
evaluation (adjustment) of numerous correlated data of different nature. Their
application is often rather mechanical and as a result is not free of various
confusions which are discussed in this note.
