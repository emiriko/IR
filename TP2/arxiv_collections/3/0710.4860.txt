We propose an experimental scheme which allows to realize approximate time
reversal of matter waves for ultracold atoms in the regime of quantum chaos. We
show that a significant fraction of the atoms return back to their original
state, being at the same time cooled down by several orders of magnitude. We
give a theoretical description of this effect supported by extensive numerical
simulations. The proposed scheme can be implemented with existing experimental
setups.
