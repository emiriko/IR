We report the direct visualization at the scale of single particles of mass
transport between smectic layers, also called permeation, in a suspension of
rod-like viruses. Self-diffusion takes place preferentially in the direction
normal to the smectic layers, and occurs by quasi-quantized steps of one rod
length. The diffusion rate corresponds with the rate calculated from the
diffusion in the nematic state with a lamellar periodic ordering potential that
is obtained experimentally.
