We performed a series of simulations for a linear polymer chain in a solvent
using dissipative particle dynamics to check the scaling relations for the
end-to-end distance, radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius in three
dimensions. The polymer chains of up to 80 beads in explicit solvent of various
quality are studied. To extract the scaling exponent \nu, the data are analyzed
using linear fits, correction-to-scaling forms and analytical fits to the
histograms of radius of gyration distribution. For certain combinations of the
polymer characteristics and solvent quality, the correction-to-scaling terms
are found to be essential while for the others these are negligibly small. In
each particular case the final value for the exponent \nu was chosen according
to the best least-squares fit. The values of \nu obtained in this way are found
within the interval \nu=0.55-0.61 but are concentrated mostly around 0.59,
which is very close to the best known theoretical result \nu=0.588. The
existence of this interval is attributed both to the peculiarities of the
method and to the moderate chain lengths being simulated. Within this
shortcoming, the polymer chain in this kind of modeling is found to satisfy the
scaling relations for all three radii being considered
