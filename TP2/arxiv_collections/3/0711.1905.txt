Dynamics with choice is a generalization of discrete-time dynamics where
instead of the same evolution operator at every time step there is a choice of
operators to transform the current state of the system. This notion is new and
interesting from the mathematical point of view. At the same time, many real
life processes studied in chemical physics, engineering, biology and medicine,
from autocatalytic reaction systems to switched systems to cellular biochemical
processes to malaria transmission in urban environments, exhibit the properties
described by dynamics with choice. We study the long-term behavior in dynamics
with choice.
