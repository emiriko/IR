The full-potential linear augmented plane-wave calculations have been applied
to investigate the systematic change of electronic structures in CaAlSi due to
different stacking sequences of AlSi layers. The present ab-initio calculations
have revealed that the multistacking, buckling and 60 degrees rotation of AlSi
layer affect the electronic band structure in this system. In particular, such
a structural perturbation gives rise to the disconnected and cylindrical Fermi
surface along the M-L lines of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. This means that
multistacked CaAlSi with the buckling AlSi layers increases degree of
two-dimensional electronic characters, and it gives us qualitative
understanding for the quite different upper critical field anisotropy between
specimens with and without superstructure as reported previously.
