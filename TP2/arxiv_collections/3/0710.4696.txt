We present an idealised model of gravitational collapse, describing a
collapsing rotating cylindrical shell of null dust in flat space, with the
metric of a spinning cosmic string as the exterior. We find that the shell
bounces before closed timelike curves can be formed. Our results also suggest
slightly different definitions for the mass and angular momentum of the string.
