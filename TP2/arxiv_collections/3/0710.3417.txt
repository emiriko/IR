The relativistic coupled-cluster single-double method is used to calculate
the dependence of frequencies of strong $E1$-transitions in many monovalent
atoms and ions on the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. These transitions are
used in the search for manifestations of the variation of the fine-structure
constant in quasar absorption spectra. Results of the present calculations are
in good agreement with previous calculations but are more accurate.
