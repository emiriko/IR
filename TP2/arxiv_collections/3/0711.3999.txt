We investigate sum rules for heavy-to-light transition form factors at large
recoil derived from correlation functions with interpolating currents for light
pseudoscalar or vector fields in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). We
consider both, factorizable and non-factorizable contributions at leading power
in the Lambda/m_b expansion and to first order in the strong coupling constant
alpha_s, neglecting contributions from 3-particle distribution amplitudes in
the B-meson. We pay particular attention to various sources of parametric and
systematic uncertainties. We also discuss certain form factor ratios where part
of the hadronic uncertainties related to the B-meson distribution amplitude and
to logarithmically enhanced alpha_s corrections cancel.
