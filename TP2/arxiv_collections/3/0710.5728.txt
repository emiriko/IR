The H-principle, which is the analogue, for CR manifolds, of the classical
Hartogs principle in several complex variables, is known to be valid in the
small on a pseudoconcave CR manifold of any codimension. However it fails in
the large, as has been shown by the counterexample found in [HN1]. Hence there
is an underlying obstruction to the global H-principle on a pseudoconcave CR
manifold. The purpose of this note is to take the first steps toward a deeper
understanding of this obstruction.
