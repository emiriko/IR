The emptiness formation probability in the six-vertex model with domain wall
boundary conditions is considered. This correlation function allows one to
address the problem of limit shapes in the model. We apply the quantum inverse
scattering method to calculate the emptiness formation probability for the
inhomogeneous model. For the homogeneous model, the result is given both in
terms of certain determinant and as a multiple integral representation.
