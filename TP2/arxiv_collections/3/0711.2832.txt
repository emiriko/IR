In the first design stage, image reference plays a double role of means of
formulation and resolution of problems. In our approach, we consider image
reference as a support of creation activity to generate ideas and we propose a
tool for navigation in references by image in order to assist daylight ambience
design. Within this paper, we present, in a first part, the semantic indexation
method to be used for the indexation of our image database. In a second part we
propose a synthetic analysis of various modes of referential navigation in
order to propose a tool implementing all or a part of these modes.
