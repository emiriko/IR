We have presented an optimal buffer sizing and buffer insertion methodology
which uses stochastic models of the architecture and Continuous Time Markov
Decision Processes CTMDPs. Such a methodology is useful in managing the scarce
buffer resources available on chip as compared to network based data
communication which can have large buffer space. The modeling of this problem
in terms of a CT-MDP framework lead to a nonlinear formulation due to usage of
bridges in the bus architecture. We present a methodology to split the problem
into several smaller though linear systems and we then solve these subsystems.
