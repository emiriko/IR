I concentrate in this article on the reaction--coherent pion production by
neutrinos incident on nuclei. A special effort is made in order to describe the
approximations entering the calculation. I conclude that the reaction is well
understood and with appropriate data for hadronic reactions is can be computed
for low and high energies. Because of shortage of space I omitted the resonance
analysis, which is described in articles with my collaborators.
