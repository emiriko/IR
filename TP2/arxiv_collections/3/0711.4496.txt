So far, the infrared behavior of the gluon and ghost propagator based on the
Gribov-Zwanziger approach predicted a positivity violating gluon propagator
vanishing at zero momentum, and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator. However,
recent data based on huge lattices have revealed a positivity violating gluon
propagator which turns out to attain a finite nonvanishing value very close to
zero momentum. At the same time the ghost propagator does not seem to be
infrared enhanced anymore. We point out that these new features can be
accounted for by yet unexploited dynamical effects within the Gribov-Zwanziger
approach, leading to an infrared behavior in qualitatively good agreement with
the new data.
