We investigate continuous variable (CV) quantum teleportation using relevant
classes of non-Gaussian states of the radiation field as entangled resources.
First, we introduce the class two-mode squeezed symmetric superposition of Fock
states, including finite truncations of twin-beam Gaussian states as special
realizations. These states depend on a set of free independent parameters that
can be adjusted for the optimization of teleportation protocols, with an
enhancement of the success probability of teleportation both for coherent and
Fock input states. We show that the optimization procedure reduces the
entangled resources to truncated twin beam states, which thus represents an
optimal class of non-Gaussian resources for quantum teleportation. We then
introduce a further class of two-mode non-Gaussian entangled resources, in the
form of squeezed cat-like states. We analyze the performance and the properties
of such states when optimized for (CV) teleportation, and compare them to the
optimized squeezed Bell-like states introduced in a previous work
\cite{CVTelepNoi}. We discuss how optimal resources for teleportation are
characterized by a suitable balance of entanglement content and squeezed vacuum
affinity. We finally investigate the effects of thermal noise on the efficiency
of quantum teleportation. To this aim, a convenient framework is to describe
noisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non-Gaussian state and
thermal states. Although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces
the teleportation fidelity, noisy non-Gaussian states remain preferred
resources when compared to noisy twin-beam Gaussian states.
