We review models for neutrino mass, with special emphasis in supersymmetric
models where R-parity is broken either explicitly or spontaneously. The
simplest unified extension of the MSSM with explicit bilinear R-parity
violation provides a predictive scheme for neutrino masses and mixings which
can account for the observed atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies. Despite
the smallness of neutrino masses R-parity violation is observable at present
and future high-energy colliders, providing an unambiguous cross-check of the
model. This model can be shown to be an effective model for the, more
theoretically satisfying, spontaneous broken theory. The main difference in
this last case is the appearance of a massless particle, the majoron, that can
modify the decay modes of the Higgs boson, making it decay invisibly most of
the time.
