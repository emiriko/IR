A supersymmetric Lagrangian used to study D-particle probes in a D6-brane
background is exactly soluble. We present an analysis of the classical and
quantum mechanics of this theory, including classical trajectories in the
bosonic theory, and the exact quantum spectrum and wavefunctions, including
both bound and unbound states.
