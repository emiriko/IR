The aim of this paper is to deal with multi-physics simulation of
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based on an advanced numerical
methodology. MEMS are very small devices in which electric as well as
mechanical and fluid phenomena appear and interact. Because of their
microscopic scale, strong coupling effects arise between the different physical
fields, and some forces, which were negligible at macroscopic scale, have to be
taken into account. In order to accurately design such micro-electro-mechanical
systems, it is of primary importance to be able to handle the strong coupling
between the electric and the mechanical fields. In this paper, the finite
element method (FEM) is used to model the strong coupled electro-mechanical
interactions and to perform static and transient analyses taking into account
large mesh displacements. These analyses will be used to study the behaviour of
electrostatically actuated micro-mirrors.
