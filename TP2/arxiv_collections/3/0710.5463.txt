The presented results are obtained during the first steps taken in order to
develop a setup and measurement procedures which allow to compare properties of
diverse kinds of silicon photomultipliers. The response to low-intensity light
was studied for silicon photomultipliers produced by CPTA (Russia), Hamamatsu
(Japan), ITC-irst (Italy) and SensL (Ireland).
