In this paper we explore the physical origin of the transparency induced in
absorbing three-level cascade atoms by the simultaneous interplay of two
coherent beams of light. By utilizing the scattering technique we offer what we
believe is a very convincing physical evidence for the existence, or for the
absence, of quantum interference effects in the Autler-Townes (AT) and
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) phenomena.
