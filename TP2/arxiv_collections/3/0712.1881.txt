The scalar-tensor theory is plagued by nagging questions if different
conformal frames, in particular the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames, are
equivalent to each other. As a closely related question, there are opposing
views on which of the two conformal frames is physically acceptable.
Reinforcing our previous claims, we offer replies based on a cosmological model
of the scalar-tensor theory, believed to be a promising theory for
understanding the accelerating universe, as well as today's version of the
cosmological constant problem. Exploiting the advantage that this model admits
analytical asymptotic solutions, our argument does not depend on whether the
underlying theory is invariant under conformal transformations. Our argument
provides partial support for the claimed "equivalence," but we also present
examples that require more careful analyses exploiting field equations. We also
point out that the Jordan conformal frame is suitable for an interpretation in
terms of unification theories in physics, for example, string theory and the
Kaluza-Klein approach, while the Einstein conformal frame may be acceptable as
a physical conformal frame under two conditions: (i) the simplest constant
$\Lambda$ term in the Lagrangian in the Jordan conformal frame; (ii) the
revised form of the conventional Brans-Dicke model based on the validity of
weak equivalence principle.
