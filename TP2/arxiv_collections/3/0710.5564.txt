We resolve the long-standing controversy over the surface energy of simple
metals: Density functional methods that require uniform-electron-gas input
agree with each other at many levels of sophistication, but not with high-level
correlated calculations like Fermi Hypernetted Chain and Diffusion Monte Carlo
(DMC) that predict the uniform-gas correlation energy. Here we apply a very
high-level correlated approach, the inhomogeneous Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander
(ISTLS) method, and find that the density functionals are indeed reliable
(because the surface energy is "bulk-like"). ISTLS values are close to
recently-revised DMC values. Our work also vindicates the previously-disputed
use of uniform-gas-based nonlocal kernels in time-dependent density functional
theory.
