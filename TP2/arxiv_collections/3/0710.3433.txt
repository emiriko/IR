Synperonic F-108 (generic name, 'pluronic') is a micelle forming triblock
copolymer of type ABA, where A is polyethylene oxide (PEO) and B is
polypropylene oxide (PPO). At high temperatures, the hydrophobicity of the PPO
chains increase, and the pluronic molecules, when dissolved in an aqueous
medium, self-associate into spherical micelles with dense PPO cores and
hydrated PEO coronas. At appropriately high concentrations, these micelles
arrange in a face centred cubic lattice to show inverse crystallization, with
the samples exhibiting high-temperature crystalline and low-temperature
fluidlike phases. By studying the evolution of the elastic and viscous moduli
as temperature is increased at a fixed rate, we construct the
concentration-temperature phase diagram of Synperonic F-108. For a certain
range of temperatures and at appropriate sample concentrations, we observe a
predominantly elastic response. Oscillatory strain amplitude sweep measurements
on these samples show pronounced peaks in the loss moduli, a typical feature of
soft solids. The soft solid-like nature of these materials is further
demonstrated by measuring their frequency dependent mechanical moduli. The
storage moduli are significantly larger than the loss moduli and are almost
independent of the applied angular frequency. Finally, we perform strain rate
frequency superposition (SRFS) experiments to measure the slow relaxation
dynamics of this soft solid.
