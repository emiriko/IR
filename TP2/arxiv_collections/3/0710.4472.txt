We provide a strategy to find in few elementary calculations the critical
exponents of the overlaps for dilute spin glasses, in absence of external
field. Such a strategy is based on the expansion of a suitably perturbed
average of the overlaps, which is used in the formulation of the free energy as
the difference between a cavity part and the derivative of the free energy
itself, considered as a function of the connectivity of the model. We assume
the validity of certain reasonable approximations, e.g. that higher powers of
overlap monomials are of smaller magnitude near the critical point, of which we
do not provide a rigorous proof.
