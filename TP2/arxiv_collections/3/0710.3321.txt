A new "on the fly" method to perform Born-Oppenheimer ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) is presented. Inspired by Ehrenfest dynamics in time-dependent
density functional theory, the electronic orbitals are evolved by a
Schroedinger-like equation, where the orbital time derivative is multiplied by
a parameter. This parameter controls the time scale of the fictitious
electronic motion and speeds up the calculations with respect to standard
Ehrenfest dynamics. In contrast to other methods, wave function orthogonality
needs not be imposed as it is automatically preserved, which is of paramount
relevance for large scale AIMD simulations.
