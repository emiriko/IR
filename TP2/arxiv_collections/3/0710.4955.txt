A systematic analysis of Higgs-mediated contributions to the Bd and Bs mass
differences is presented in the MSSM with large values of tan(beta). In
particular, supersymmetric corrections to Higgs self-interactions are seen to
modify the correlation between Delta Mq and BR(Bq --> mu+ mu-) for light
Higgses. The present experimental upper bound on BR(Bs --> mu+ mu-) is
nevertheless still sufficient to exclude noticeable Higgs-mediated effects on
the mass differences in most of the parameter space.
