We describe a three-stage procedure to analyze the dependence of Poisson
Boltzmann calculations on the shape, size and geometry of the boundary between
solute and solvent. Our study is carried out within the boundary element
formalism, but our results are also of interest to finite difference techniques
of Poisson Boltzmann calculations. At first, we identify the critical size of
the geometrical elements for discretizing the boundary, and thus the necessary
resolution required to establish numerical convergence. In the following two
steps we perform reference calculations on a set of dipeptides in different
conformations using the Polarizable Continuum Model and a high-level Density
Functional as well as a high-quality basis set. Afterwards, we propose a
mechanism for defining appropriate boundary geometries. Finally, we compare the
classic Poisson Boltzmann description with the Quantum Chemical description,
and aim at finding appropriate fitting parameters to get a close match to the
reference data. Surprisingly, when using default AMBER partial charges and the
rigorous geometric parameters derived in the initial two stages, no scaling of
the partial charges is necessary and the best fit against the reference set is
obtained automatically
