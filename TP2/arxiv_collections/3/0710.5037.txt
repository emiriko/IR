We discuss why regular observables can not be proper entanglement measures,
and how observables in a generalized setting can be used to make an
entanglement monotone a directly observable quantity for the case of pure
states. For the case of mixed states, these generalized observables can be used
to find valid lower bounds on entanglement monotones that can be measured in
laboratory experiments in the same fashion as it can also be done for pure
states.
