The two-terminal magneto-conductance of a hole gas in C-doped AlGaAs/GaAs
heterostructures with ohmic contacts consisting of alloyed In/Zn/Au displays a
pronounced hysteresis of the conductance around zero magnetic field. The
hysteresis disappears above magnetic fields of around 0.5 T and temperatures
above 300 mK. For magnetic fields below 10 mT we observe a pronounced dip in
the magneto-conductance. We tentatively discuss these experimental observations
in the light of superconductivity of the ohmic contacts.
