Transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions are analyzed in
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering at low transverse momentum using
soft-collinear effective theory. The transverse-momentum-dependent parton
distribution functions are defined on the lightcone without distorting the
lightcone path nor adding additional soft Wilson lines. In this approach, the
comparison between the integrated and unintegrated parton distribution
functions becomes transparent. The procedure of computing radiative corrections
in dimensional regularization is explained in detail, and the divergence, which
is a product of infrared and ultraviolet divergence, is cancelled. The
renormalization group equation for the transverse-momentum-dependent parton
distribution functions is derived. It depends only on the relevant physical
quantities and exhibits a nontrivial scaling behavior because the longitudinal
momentum fraction and the transverse momentum are coupled in the
renormalization group equation.
