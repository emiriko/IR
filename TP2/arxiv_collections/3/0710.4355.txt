The qualitative solvent- and temperature-dependent conformational behavior of
a peptide in the proximity of solid substrates with different adsorption
properties is investigated by means of a simple lattice model. The resulting
pseudophase diagrams exhibit a complex structure, which can be understood by
analysing the minima of the free-energy landscape in dependence of appropriate
system parameters.
