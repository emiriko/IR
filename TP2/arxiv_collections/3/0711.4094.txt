Temperature dependencies of gap energies and magnon lifetimes are measured in
the quasi-1-dimensional S=1/2 gapped quantum magnets IPA-CuCl3 and Sul-Cu2Cl4
using inelastic neutron scattering. The results are compared to those found in
literature for S=1 Haldane spin chain materials and to theoretical calculations
for the O(3)- and O(N)- quantum non-linear sigma-models. It is found that when
the T=0 energy gap Delta is used as the temperature scale, all experimental and
theoretical curves are identical to within system-dependent but
temperature-independent scaling factors of the order of unity. This
quasi-universality extends over a surprising broad T range, at least up to
kappa T ~ 1.5 Delta.
