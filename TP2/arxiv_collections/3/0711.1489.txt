The dynamics of activation waves in excitable media can give rise to spiral
turbulence, the resulting spatiotemporal chaos being associated with empirical
biological phenomena such as life-threatening disturbances in the natural
rhythm of the heart. In this paper, we propose a spatially extended but
non-global scheme using an array of control points for terminating such
spatiotemporally chaotic excitations. A low-amplitude control signal is applied
sequentially at each point on the array, resulting in a traveling wave of
excitation in the underlying medium which drives away the turbulent activity.
Our method is robust even in the presence of significant heterogeneities in the
medium, which have often been an impediment to the success of other control
schemes.
