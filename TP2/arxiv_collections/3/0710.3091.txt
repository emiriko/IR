The decays of $\jpsi$ and $\psip$ to ${n}{K^0_S}\bar{\Lambda}+c.c.$ are
observed and measured for the first time, and the perturbative QCD ``12%'' rule
is tested, based on $5.8 \times 10^7$ $\jpsi$ and $1.4 \times 10^7$ $\psip$
events collected with BESII detector at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider.
No obvious enhancement near $n\bar{\Lambda}$ threshold in $\jpsi \to
{n}{K^0_S}\bar{\Lambda}+c.c.$ is observed, and the upper limit on the branching
ratio of $\jpsi \to {K^0_S} X, X \to n \bar \Lambda$ is determined.
