We consider a model of neutrino oscillations with three additional sterile
neutrinos and a gauged B-L interaction. We find allowed values of the model
parameters which can reconcile the results of the evidence for antimuon
neutrino to antielectron neutrino conversion seen at the LSND neutrino
oscillation experiment with the null results of the MiniBooNE experiment. A
portion of the low energy excess of electron neutrino events seen at MiniBooNE
can arise naturally, and we make a quantitative prediction for the forthcoming
anti-neutrino oscillation results at MiniBooNE.
