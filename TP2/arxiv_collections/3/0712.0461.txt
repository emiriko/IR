We study two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model on a series of regular
lattices, which are represented as the tessellation of polygons with p>=5
sides, such as pentagons (p=5), hexagons (p=6), etc. Such lattices are on
hyperbolic planes, which have constant negative scalar curvatures. We calculate
critical temperatures and scaling exponents by use of the corner transfer
matrix renormalization group method. As a result, the mean-field like phase
transition is observed for all the cases p>=5. Convergence of the calculated
transition temperatures with respect to p is investigated towards the limit
p->infinity, where the system coincides with the Ising model on the Bethe
lattice.
