We investigate the differential geometry of bipartite quantum states. In
particular the manifold structures of pure bipartite states are studied in
detail. The manifolds with respect to all normalized pure states of arbitrarily
given Schmidt ranks or Schmidt coefficients are explicitly presented. The
dimensions of the related manifolds are calculated.
