We have determined the screened on-site Coulomb repulsion in graphite and
single wall carbon nanotubes by measuring their Auger spectra and performing a
new theoretical analysis based on an extended Cini-Sawatzky approach where only
one fit parameter is employed. The experimental lineshape is very well
reproduced by the theory and this allows to determine the value of the screened
on-site repulsion between $2p$ states, which is found to be 2.1 eV in graphite
and 4.6 eV in nanotubes. The latter is robust by varying the nanotube radius
from 1 to 2 nm.
