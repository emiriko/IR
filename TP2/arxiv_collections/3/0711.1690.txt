There has recently been significant interest in rubrene single-crystals grown
using physical vapour transport techniques due to their application in
high-mobility organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices. Despite numerous
studies of the electrical properties of such crystals, there has only been one
study to date focussing on characterising and optimising the crystal growth as
a function of the relevant growth parameters. Here we present a study of the
dependence of the yield of useful crystals (defined as crystals with at least
one dimension of order 1 mm) on the temperature and volume flow of carrier gas
used in the physical vapour growth process.
