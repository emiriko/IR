We consider the following model of decision-making by cognitive systems. We
present an algorithm -- quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) -- which
provides a possibility to represent probabilistic data of any origin by complex
probability amplitudes. Our conjecture is that cognitive systems developed the
ability to use QLRA. They operate with complex probability amplitudes, mental
wave functions. Since the mathematical formalism of QM describes as well (under
some generalization) processing of such quantum-like (QL) mental states, the
conventional quantum decision-making scheme can be used by the brain. We
consider a modification of this scheme to describe decision-making in the
presence of two ``incompatible'' mental variables. Such a QL decision-making
can be used in situations like Prisoners Dilemma (PD) as well as others
corresponding to so called disjunction effect in psychology and cognitive
science.
