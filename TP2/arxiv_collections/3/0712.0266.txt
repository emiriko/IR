The main purpose of this paper is to show that ideas of deformation theory
can be applied to "infinite dimensional geometry". We develop the deformation
theory of Brody curves. Brody curve is a kind of holomorphic map from the
complex plane to the projective space. Since the complex plane is not compact,
the parameter space of the deformation can be infinite dimensional. As an
application we prove a lower bound on the mean dimension of the space of Brody
curves.
