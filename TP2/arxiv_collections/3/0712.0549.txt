We consider a variant of the Georgi Glashow model in the BPS limit, augmented
by a higher derivative Skyrme-like term, which is the simplest YMH model that
can support monopole bound states. The spherically symetric solutions are
studied with a combination of analytic and numerical techniques, which strongly
suggest that the solutions converge to a finite energy configuration in the
limit of infinite coupling of the Skyrme-like term.
