The unitarity relation, Im(A)=T* A, is derived for a three-body production
amplitude, A, that consists of a complex linear combination of elements of the
two-body scattering amplitude, T. We conclude that the unitarity relation does
not impose a realness condition on the coefficients in the expansion of, A, in
terms of, T.
