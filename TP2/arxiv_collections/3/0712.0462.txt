Both external environmental selection and internal lower-level evolution are
essential for an integral picture of evolution. This paper proposes that the
division of internal evolution into DNA/RNA pattern formation (genotype) and
protein functional action (phenotype) resolves a universal conflict between
fitness and evolvability. Specifically, this paper explains how this universal
conflict drove the emergence of genotype-phenotype division, why this labor
division is responsible for the extraordinary complexity of life, and how the
specific ways of genotype-phenotype mapping in the labor division determine the
paths and forms of evolution and development.
