In previous work, the first author developed an algorithm for the computation
of Hilbert modular forms. In this paper, we extend this to all totally real
number fields of even degree and nontrivial class group. Using the algorithm
over $\Q(\sqrt{10})$ and $\Q(\sqrt{85})$ and their Hilbert class fields, we
present some new instances of the conjectural Eichler-Shimura construction for
totally real fields, and in particular find new examples of modular abelian
varieties with everywhere good reduction.
