We describe a method to construct irreducible baryon operators using
all-to-all quark propagators. It was demonstrated earlier that a large basis of
extended baryon operators on anisotropic, quenched lattices can be used to
reliably extract the masses of 5 or more excited states in the nucleon channel.
All-to-all quark propagators are expected to be needed when studying these
excited states on light, dynamical configurations because contributions from
multi-particle states are expected to be significant. The dilution method is
used to approximate the all-to-all quark propagators. Low-lying eigenmodes can
also be used if necessary. For efficient computation of matrix elements of the
interpolating operators, the algorithms should exploit the fact that many
extended baryon operators can be obtained from the different linear
combinations of three-quark colour-singlet operators. The sparseness of the
diluted noise vectors also afford several computation simplifications. Some
preliminary results are presented for nucleon effective masses.
