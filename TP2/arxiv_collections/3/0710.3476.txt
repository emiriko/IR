Construction of multi-particle entangled states and direct teleportation of
N-(spin 1/2) particles are important areas of quantum information processing. A
number of different schemes which have been presented already, address the
problem through controlled teleportation. In this article, a criterion based on
standard quantum statistical correlations employed in the many body virial
expansions is used to determine maximum entanglement for a N-particle state.
These states remain entangled through proper traces to states for a smaller
number of particles and can be generalized for arbitrary number of particles.
It is shown that they are quite useful in generalized, N-particle, direct
teleportation. The corresponding quantum gates are also indicated for
teleportation schemes from simple computational basis states.
