What is a complex network? How do we characterize complex networks? Which
systems can be studied from a network approach? In this text, we motivate the
use of complex networks to study and understand a broad panoply of systems,
ranging from physics and biology to economy and sociology. Using basic tools
from statistical physics, we will characterize the main types of networks found
in nature. Moreover, the most recent trends in network research will be briefly
discussed.
