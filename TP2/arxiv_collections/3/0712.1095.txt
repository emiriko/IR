Heat capacity of polycrystalline R2Ti3Ge4 (R = Gd, Tb and Er) compounds
(Orthorhombic, Sm5Ge4-type, Space group Pnma) has been studied in the
temperature range of 1.8 K to 300 K in various applied magnetic fields. The
compounds with magnetic lanthanide elements show interesting low field
magnetism intrigued by possible presence of competing antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic interactions. The magnetocaloric effect in these compounds is
estimated from the field dependent heat capacity data. The magnetic entropy
change and the adiabatic temperature change in the vicinity of the magnetic
transition are found to be significant.
