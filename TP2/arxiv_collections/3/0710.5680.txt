We present experimental evidence of sub-GHz spin-transfer oscillations in
metallic nano-contacts that are due to the translational motion of a magnetic
vortex. The vortex is shown to execute large-amplitude orbital motion outside
the contact region. Good agreement with analytical theory and micromagnetics
simulations is found.
