We combine the projective geometry approach to Schroedinger equations on the
circle and differential Galois theory with the theory of Poisson Lie groups to
construct a natural Poisson structure on the space of wave functions (at the
zero energy level). Applications to KdV-like nonlinear equations are discussed.
The same approach is applied to second order difference operators on a
one-dimensional lattice, yielding an extension of the lattice Poisson Virasoro
algebra.
