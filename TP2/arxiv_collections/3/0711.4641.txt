We study the quantum dynamics of a time reparametrization invariant system
with a vanishing Hamiltonian. The evolution of the physical degrees of freedom
of the system is described, both at the classical and at the quantum level, in
relational terms by the construction of an internal time parameter. We use the
Pegg-Barnett phase operator formalism in finite dimensional Hilbert space as an
essential ingredient.
