The longitudinal response function of 4He is calculated with the Argonne V18
potential. The comparison with experiment suggests the need of a three-body
force. When adding the Urbana IX three-body potential in the calculation of the
lower longitudinal multipoles, the total strength is suppressed in the
quasi-elastic peak, towards the trend of the experimental data.
