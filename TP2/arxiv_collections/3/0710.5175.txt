For MSSM phenomenology, soft SUSY breaking dimension-three operators are
important, in particular the couplings between Higgs bosons and squarks. In
scattering processes, perturbative unitarity is violated at modest
center-of-mass energy if these couplings are much larger than the masses of the
scalar particles involved. Assuming perturbative unitarity, constraints on the
trilinear couplings can be determined using a computer program that we have
developed.
