We demonstrate that the superposition of light polarization states is
coherently transferred to electron spins in a semiconductor quantum well. By
using time-resolved Kerr rotation we observe the initial phase of Larmor
precession of electron spins whose coherence is transferred from light. To
break the electron-hole spin entanglement, we utilized the big discrepancy
between the transverse g-factors of electrons and light holes. The result
encourages us to make a quantum media converter between flying photon qubits
and stationary electron spin qubits in semiconductors.
