It is well known that, in the five-dimensional scenario of braneworld and
space-time-mass theories, geodesic motion in 5D is observed to be non-geodesic
in 4D. Usually, the discussion is purely geometric and based on the dimensional
reduction of the geodesic equation in 5D, without any reference to the test
particle whatsoever. In this work we obtain the equation of motion in 4D
directly from the principle of least action. So our main thrust is not the
geometry but the particle observed in 4D. A clear physical picture emerges from
our work. Specifically, that the deviation from the geodesic motion in 4D is
due to the variation of the rest mass of a particle, which is induced by the
scalar field in the 5D metric and the explicit dependence of the spacetime
metric on the extra coordinate. Thus, the principle of least action not only
leads to the correct equations of motion, but also provides a concrete physical
meaning for a number of algebraic quantities appearing in the geometrical
reduction of the geodesic equation.
