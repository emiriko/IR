Current algorithms for bounded model checking use SAT methods for checking
satisfiability of Boolean formulae. These methods suffer from the potential
memory explosion problem. Methods based on the validity of Quantified Boolean
Formulae (QBF) allow an exponentially more succinct representation of formulae
to be checked, because no "unrolling" of the transition relation is required.
These methods have not been widely used, because of the lack of an efficient
decision procedure for QBF. We evaluate the usage of QBF in bounded model
checking (BMC), using general-purpose SAT and QBF solvers. We develop a
special-purpose decision procedure for QBF used in BMC, and compare our
technique with the methods using general-purpose SAT and QBF solvers on
real-life industrial benchmarks.
