It has been conjectured that the mass spectrum of the O(3) non-linear sigma
model with a theta term in 2 dimensions may possess an excited state, which
decays when theta is lowered from pi below a critical value. Since the direct
numerical investigation of the model is prevented by a sign problem, we try to
infer some information on the mass spectrum at real theta by studying the model
at imaginary theta via analytic continuation. A modified Swendsen-Wang cluster
algorithm has been introduced to simulate the model with the theta term.
