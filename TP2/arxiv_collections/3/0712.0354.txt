We discuss a possible interpretation of the f0(980) meson as a hadronic
molecule - a bound state of K and bar K mesons. Using a phenomenological
Lagrangian approach we calculate the strong f0(980) to pi pi and
electromagnetic f0(980) to gamma gamma decays. The compositeness condition
provides a self-consistent method to determine the coupling constant between f0
and its constituents, K and bar K. Form factors governing the decays of the
f0(980) are calculated by evaluating the kaon loop integrals. The predicted
f0(980) to pi pi and f0(980) to gamma gamma decay widths are in good agreement
with available data and results of other theoretical approaches.
