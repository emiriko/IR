In this paper we prove an analogue of the McKay correspondence for
Landau-Ginzburg models. Our proof is based on the ideas introduced by T.
Bridgeland, A. King and M. Reid, which reformulate and generalize the McKay
correspondence in the language of derived categories, along with the techniques
introduced by J.-C. Chen.
