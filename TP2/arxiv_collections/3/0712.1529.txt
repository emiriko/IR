In this note we suggest that difficulties encountered in natural language
semantics are, for the most part, due to the use of mere symbol manipulation
systems that are devoid of any content. In such systems, where there is hardly
any link with our common-sense view of the world, and it is quite difficult to
envision how one can formally account for the considerable amount of content
that is often implicit, but almost never explicitly stated in our everyday
discourse. The solution, in our opinion, is a compositional semantics grounded
in an ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we
talk about it in ordinary language. In the compositional logic we envision
there are ontological (or first-intension) concepts, and logical (or
second-intension) concepts, and where the ontological concepts include not only
Davidsonian events, but other abstract objects as well (e.g., states,
processes, properties, activities, attributes, etc.) It will be demonstrated
here that in such a framework, a number of challenges in the semantics of
natural language (e.g., metonymy, intensionality, metaphor, etc.) can be
properly and uniformly addressed.
