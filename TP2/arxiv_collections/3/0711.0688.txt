After a brief discussion of the concepts of fractional exchange and
fractional exclusion statistics, we report partly analytical and partly
numerical results on thermodynamic properties of assemblies of particles
obeying fractional exclusion statistics. The effect of dimensionality is one
focal point, the ratio mu/kB T of chemical potential to thermal energy being
obtained numerically as a function of a scaled particle density. Pair
correlation functions are also presented as a function of the statistical
parameter, with `Friedel' oscillations developing close to the fermion limit,
for sufficiently large density.
