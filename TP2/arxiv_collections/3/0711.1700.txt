In this paper, we apply the first-principle theory to explore how the
electronic structures of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) are affected by
chemical modifications. The edge addends include H, F, N, NH$_{2}$, and
NO$_{2}$. Our theoretical results show that the energy gaps are highly tunable
by controlling the widths of AGNRs and addends. The most interesting finding is
that N-passivated AGNRs with various widths are metallic due to the unique
electronic features of N-N bonds. This property change of AGNRs (from
semiconducting to metallic) is important in developing graphene-based devices.
