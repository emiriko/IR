Functional determinants of differential operators play a prominent role in
theoretical and mathematical physics, and in particular in quantum field
theory. They are, however, difficult to compute in non-trivial cases. For one
dimensional problems, a classical result of Gel'fand and Yaglom dramatically
simplifies the problem so that the functional determinant can be computed
without computing the spectrum of eigenvalues. Here I report recent progress in
extending this approach to higher dimensions (i.e., functional determinants of
partial differential operators), with applications in quantum field theory.
