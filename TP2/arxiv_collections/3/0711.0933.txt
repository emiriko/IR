RF frequency transfer over an urban 86 km fibre has been demonstrated with a
resolution of 2.10-18 at one day measuring time using an optical compensator.
This result is obtained with a reference carrier frequency of 1 GHz, and a
rapid scrambling of the polarisation state of the input light in order to
reduce the sensitivity to the polarisation mode dispersion in the fibre. The
limitation due to the fibre chromatic dispersion associated with the laser
frequency fluctuations is highlighted and analyzed. A preliminary test of an
extended compensated link over 186 km using optical amplifiers gives a
resolution below 10-17 at 1 day.
