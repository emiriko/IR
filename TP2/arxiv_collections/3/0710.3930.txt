The search for stable heavy exotic hadrons is a promising way to observe new
physics processes at collider experiments. The discovery potential for such
particles can be enhanced or suppressed by their interactions with detector
material. This paper describes a model for the interactions in matter of stable
hadrons containing an exotic quark of charges $\pm {1/3}e$ or $\pm {2/3}e$
using Regge phenomenology and the Quark Gluon String Model. The influence of
such interactions on searches at the LHC is also discussed.
