We present recent results on noise-induced transitions in a nonlinear
oscillator with randomly modulated frequency. The presence of stochastic
perturbations drastically alters the dynamical behaviour of the oscillator:
noise can wash out a global attractor but can also have a constructive role by
stabilizing an unstable fixed point. The random oscillator displays a rich
phenomenology but remains elementary enough to allow for exact calculations:
this system is thus a useful paradigm for the study of noise-induced
bifurcations and is an ideal testing ground for various mathematical
techniques. We show that the phase is determined by the sign of the Lyapunov
exponent (which can be calculated non-perturbatively for white noise), and we
derive the full phase diagram of the system. We also investigate the effect of
time-correlations of the noise on the phase diagram and show that a smooth
random perturbation is less efficient than white noise. We study the critical
behaviour near the transition and explain why noise-induced transitions often
exhibit intermittency and multiscaling: these effects do not depend on the
amplitude of the noise but rather on its power spectrum. By increasing or
filtering out the low frequencies of the noise, intermittency and multiscaling
can be enhanced or eliminated.
