Presented are complete next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) corrections
to top-squark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). At this order, also effects from
the interference of EW and QCD contributions have to be taken into account.
Moreover, photon-induced top-squark production is considered as an additional
partonic channel, which arises from the non-zero photon density in the proton.
