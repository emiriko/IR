Quantum mechanics is based on a series of postulates which lead to a very
good description of the microphysical realm but which have, up to now, not been
derived from first principles. In the present work, we suggest such a
derivation in the framework of the theory of scale relativity. After having
analyzed the actual status of the various postulates, rules and principles that
underlie the present axiomatic foundation of quantum mechanics (in terms of
main postulates, secondary rules and derived `principles'), we attempt to
provide the reader with an exhaustive view of the matter, by both gathering
here results which are already available in the literature, and deriving new
ones which complete the postulate list.
