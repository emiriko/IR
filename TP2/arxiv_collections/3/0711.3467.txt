We demonstrate the presence of energy dependent fluctuations in the
localization length, which depend on the disorder distribution. These
fluctuations lead to Ensemble Averaged Conductance Fluctuations (EACF) and are
enhanced by large disorder. For the binary distribution the fluctuations are
strongly enhanced in comparison to the Gaussian and uniform distributions.
These results have important implications on ensemble averaged quantities, such
as the transmission through quantum wires, where fluctuations can subsist to
very high temperatures. For the non-fluctuating part of the localization length
in one dimension we obtained an improved analytical expression valid for all
disorder strengths by averaging the probability density.
