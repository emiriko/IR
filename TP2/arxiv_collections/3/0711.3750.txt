We analyze the impact of a porous medium (structural disorder) on the scaling
of the partition function of a star polymer immersed in a good solvent. We show
that corresponding scaling exponents change if the disorder is
long-range-correlated and calculate the exponents in the new universality
class. A notable finding is that star and chain polymers react in qualitatively
different manner on the presence of disorder: the corresponding scaling
exponents increase for chains and decrease for stars. We discuss the physical
consequences of this difference.
