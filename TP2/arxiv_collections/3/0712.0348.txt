The multi-scale entanglement renormalisation ansatz (MERA) is argued to
provide a natural description for topological states of matter. The case of
Kitaev's toric code is analyzed in detail and shown to possess a remarkably
simple MERA description leading to distillation of the topological degrees of
freedom at the top of the tensor network. Kitaev states on an infinite lattice
are also shown to be a fixed point of the RG flow associated with entanglement
renormalization. All these results generalize to arbitrary quantum double
models.
