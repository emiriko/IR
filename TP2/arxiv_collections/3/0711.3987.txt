This paper establishes power scaling of lasers as a clearly defined concept,
based on a power scaling procedure which must satisfy various criteria. It is
demonstrated that this concept creates useful insight particularly for the
evaluation of the future performance potential of different laser
architectures, and for identifying technological aspects which will need to be
modified for generating higher powers. It turns out that some aspects (such as
e.g. thermal lensing in thin disk lasers) can have rather benign scaling
properties, not causing problems even at very high power levels, while other
aspects can become essential even if they initially may have appeared to be
insignificant.
