In multicellular organisms, several cell states coexist. For determining each
cell type, cell-cell interactions are often essential, in addition to
intracellular gene expression dynamics. Based on dynamical systems theory, we
propose a mechanism for cell differentiation with regulation of populations of
each cell type by taking simple cell models with gene expression dynamics. By
incorporating several interaction kinetics, we found that the cell models with
a single intracellular positive-feedback loop exhibit a cell fate switching,
with a change in the total number of cells. The number of a given cell type or
the population ratio of each cell type is preserved against the change in the
total number of cells, depending on the form of cell-cell interaction. The
differentiation is a result of bifurcation of cell states via the intercellular
interactions, while the population regulation is explained by self-consistent
determination of the bifurcation parameter through cell-cell interactions. The
relevance of this mechanism to development and differentiation in several
multicellular systems is discussed.
