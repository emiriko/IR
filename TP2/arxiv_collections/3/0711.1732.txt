Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data for the bilayer manganite
La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 show that, upon lowering the temperature below the Curie point,
a coherent polaronic metallic groundstate emerges very rapidly with well
defined quasiparticles which track remarkably well the electrical conductivity,
consistent with macroscopic transport properties. Our data suggest that the
mechanism leading to the insulator-to-metal transition in La1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 can
be regarded as a polaron coherence condensation process acting in concert with
the Double Exchange interaction.
