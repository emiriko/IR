Event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations in central C+C, S+S, In+In, and
Pb+Pb as well as p+p collisions at bombarding energies from 10 to 160 AGeV are
studied within the HSD and UrQMD microscopic transport approaches. Our
investigation is directly related to the future experimental program of the
NA61 Collaboration at the SPS for a search of the QCD critical point. The
dependence on energy and atomic mass number of the scaled variances for
negative, positive, and all charged hadrons is presented and compared to the
results of the model of independent sources. Furthermore, the nucleus-nucleus
results from the transport calculations are compared to inelastic proton-proton
collisions for reference. We find a dominant role of the participant number
fluctuations in nucleus-nucleus reactions at finite impact parameter $b$. In
order to reduce the influence of the participant numbers fluctuations on the
charged particle multiplicity fluctuations only the most central events have to
be selected. Accordingly, the samples of the 1% most central nucleus-nucleus
collisions with the largest numbers of the projectile participants are studied.
The results are compared with those for collisions at zero impact parameter. A
strong influence of the centrality selection criteria on the multiplicity
fluctuations is pointed out. Our findings are essential for an optimal choice
of colliding nuclei and bombarding energies for the experimental search of the
QCD critical point.
