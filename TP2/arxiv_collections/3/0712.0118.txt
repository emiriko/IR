In this article, we calculate the masses and decay constants of the $P$-wave
strange-bottomed mesons $B_{s0}$ and $B_{s1}$ with the QCD sum rules, and
observe that the central values of the masses of the $B_{s0}$ and $B_{s1}$ are
smaller than the corresponding $BK$ and $B^*K$ thresholds respectively, the
strong decays $B_{s0}\to BK$ and $B_{s1}\to B^*K$ are kinematically forbidden.
They can decay through the isospin violation precesses $B_{s0}\to B_s\eta\to
B_s\pi^0$ and $B_{s1}\to B_s^*\eta\to B_s^*\pi^0$. The bottomed mesons $B_{s0}$
and $B_{s1}$, just like their charmed cousins $D_{s0}(2317)$ and
$D_{s1}(2460)$, maybe very narrow.
