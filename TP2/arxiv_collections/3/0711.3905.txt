We use the spectra of Dirac type operators on the sphere $S^{n}$ to produce
sharp $L^{2}$ inequalities on the sphere. These operators include the Dirac
operator on $S^{n}$, the conformal Laplacian and Paenitz operator. We use the
Cayley transform, or stereographic projection, to obtain similar inequalities
for powers of the Dirac operator and their inverses in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$.
