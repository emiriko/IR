We describe the four most famous versions of the classical canonical
formalism in the Einstein theory of gravity: the Arnovitt-Deser-Misner
formalism, the Faddeev-Popov formalism, the tetrad formalism in the usual form,
and the tetrad formalism in the form best suited for constructing the loop
theory of gravity, which is now being developed. We present the canonical
transformations relating these formalisms. The paper is written mainly for
pedagogical purposes.
