We study numerically phase separation in a binary fluid subject to an applied
shear flow in two dimensions, with full hydrodynamics. To do so, we introduce a
mixed finite-differencing/spectral simulation technique, with a transformation
to render trivial the implementation of Lees-Edwards sheared periodic boundary
conditions. For systems with inertia, we reproduce the nonequilibrium steady
states reported in a recent lattice Boltzmann study. The domain coarsening that
would occur in zero shear is arrested by the applied shear flow, which restores
a finite domain size set by the inverse shear rate. For inertialess systems, in
contrast, we find no evidence of nonequilibrium steady states free of finite
size effects: coarsening persists indefinitely until the typical domain size
attains the system size, as in zero shear. We present an analytical argument
that supports this observation, and that furthermore provides a possible
explanation for a hitherto puzzling property of the nonequilibrium steady
states with inertia.
