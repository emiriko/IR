In this article, we calculate the electromagnetic form-factor of the $\pi$
meson with the light-cone QCD sum rules. The numerical value $F_\pi^{p}(0)
=0.999\pm 0.001$ is in excellent agreement with the experimental data
(extrapolated to the limit of zero momentum transfer, or the normalization
condition $F_\pi(0)=1$). For large momentum transfers, the values from the two
sum rules are all comparable with the experimental data and theoretical
estimations.
