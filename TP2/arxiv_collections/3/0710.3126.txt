The spectrum-generating algebra (SGA) for charged superstrings placed in
constant background magnetic fields is constructed. Contrary to the neutral
string this algebra is characteristic of including the cyclotron frequency. The
Regge intercept and superconformal anomalies are calculated to be shifted by
the cyclotron frequency and D-brane parameters from the conventional values.
