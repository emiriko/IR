An empirical fit is described to measurements of inclusive inelastic
electron-deuteron cross sections in the kinematic r ange of four-momentum
transfer $0 \le Q^2<10$ GeV$^2$ and final state invariant mass $1.1<W<3.2$ GeV.
The deuteron fit relies on a fit of the ratio $R_p$ of longitudinal to
transverse cross sections for the proton, and the assumption $R_p=R_n$. The
underlying fit parameters describe the average cross section for proton and
neutron, with a plane-wave impulse approximation used to fit to the deuteron
data. An additional term is used to fill in the dip between the quasi-elastic
peak and the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. The mean deviation of data from the fit
is 3%, with less than 4% of the data points deviating from the fit by more than
10%.
