We investigate the effects of a quantum entanglement regime within an ion
conducting molecule (ion channel) of the neuronal plasma membrane on the onset
dynamics of propagating nerve pulses (action potentials). In particular, we
model the onset parameters of the sodium current in the Hodgkin Huxley equation
as three similar but independent probabilistic mechanisms which become quantum
entangled. The underlying physics is general and can involve entanglement
between various degrees of freedom underlaying ion transition states or 'gating
states' during conduction, e.g. Na$^+$ ions in different channel locations, or
different 'affinity' states of ions with atoms lining the sub-regions of the
channel protein ('filter-states'). We find that the 'quantum corrected' Hodgkin
Huxley equation incorporating entangled systems states can reproduce action
potential pulses with the critical onset dynamics observed recently in
neocortical neurons in vivo by Naundorf et al. [Nature {\bf 440}, 1060 (20
April 2006)]. Interestingly, the suggested entanglement term can also slow down
action potential initiation.
