The CMS experiment at the LHC includes a hybrid silicon pixel detector for
the reconstruction of charged tracks and of the interaction vertices. The
detector is made of three barrel layers and two disks at each end of the
barrel. Detector modules consist of thin, segmented silicon sensors with highly
integrated readout chips connected by the bump bonding technique. In this paper
we report on the progress of the detector construction and testing. In
addition, first results from the commissioning systems at CERN and PSI are
presented.
