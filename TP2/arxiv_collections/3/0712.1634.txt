This paper considers a generalization of the notion of quantum observables in
ontological models of quantum mechanics. Within this framework it is possible
to construct physical models where quantum noncommutativity can arise
dynamically. Unlike quantum systems, the basic entities in this model have
definite properties. Relations with no-go theorems and other hidden variable
theories are also discussed.
