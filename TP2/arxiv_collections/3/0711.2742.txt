New explicit expressions are derived for the one-loop two-point Feynman
integral with arbitrary external momentum and masses $m_1^2$ and $m_2^2$ in D
dimensions. The results are given in terms of Appell functions, manifestly
symmetric with respect to the masses $m_i^2$. Equating our expressions with
previously known results in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions yields
reduction relations for the involved Appell functions that are apparently new
mathematical results.
