We show the evolution of Raman spectra with number of graphene layers on
different substrates, SiO$_{2}$/Si and conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) plate.
The G mode peak position and the intensity ratio of G and 2D bands depend on
the preparation of sample for the same number of graphene layers. The 2D Raman
band has characteristic line shapes in single and bilayer graphene, capturing
the differences in their electronic structure. The defects have a significant
influence on the G band peak position for the single layer graphene: the
frequency shows a blue shift upto 12 cm$^{-1}$ depending on the intensity of
the D Raman band, which is a marker of the defect density. Most surprisingly,
Raman spectra of graphene on the conducting ITO plates show a lowering of the G
mode frequency by $\sim$ 6 cm$^{-1}$ and the 2D band frequency by $\sim$ 20
cm$^{-1}$. This red-shift of the G and 2D bands is observed for the first time
in single layer graphene.
