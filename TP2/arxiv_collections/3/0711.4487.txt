The Fokker-Planck equation for the probability $f(r,t)$ to find a random
walker at position $r$ at time $t$ is derived for the case that the the
probability to make jumps depends nonlinearly on $f(r,t)$. The result is a
generalized form of the classical Fokker-Planck equation where the effects of
drift, due to a violation of detailed balance, and of external fields are also
considered. It is shown that in the absence of drift and external fields a
scaling solution, describing anomalous diffusion, is only possible if the
nonlinearity in the jump probability is of the power law type ($\sim f^{\eta
}(r,t)$), in which case the generalized Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the
well-known Porous Media equation. Monte-Carlo simulations are shown to confirm
the theoretical results.
