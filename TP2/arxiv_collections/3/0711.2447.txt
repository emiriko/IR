We present an overview of a fully covariant formulation of describing the
hypernuclear production with hadronic and electromagnetic probes. This theory
is based on an effective Lagrangian picture and it focuses on production
amplitudes that are described via creation, propagation and decay into relevant
channel of N*(1650), N*(1710) and N*(1720) intermediate baryonic resonance
states in the initial collision of the projectile with one of the target
nucleons. The bound state nucleon and hyperon wave functions are obtained by
solving the Dirac equation with appropriate scalar and vector potentials.
Specific examples are discussed for reactions which are of interest to current
and future experiments on the hypernuclear production.
