Importance of addressing soft errors in both safety critical applications and
commercial consumer products is increasing, mainly due to ever shrinking
geometries, higher-density circuits, and employment of power-saving techniques
such as voltage scaling and component shut-down. As a result, it is becoming
necessary to treat reliability as a first-class citizen in system design. In
particular, reliability decisions taken early in system design can have
significant benefits in terms of design quality. Motivated by this observation,
this paper presents a reliability-centric high-level synthesis approach that
addresses the soft error problem. The proposed approach tries to maximize
reliability of the design while observing the bounds on area and performance,
and makes use of our reliability characterization of hardware components such
as adders and multipliers. We implemented the proposed approach, performed
experiments with several designs, and compared the results with those obtained
by a prior proposal.
