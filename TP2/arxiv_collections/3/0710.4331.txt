We present a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation for the total
cross section for inclusive Higgs pair production via bottom-quark fusion at
the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model (MSSM) and the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA). We emphasize the
contributions of squark and gluino loops (SQCD) and the decoupling properties
of our results for heavy squark and gluino masses. The enhanced couplings of
the b quark to the Higgs bosons in supersymmetric models with large tanb yield
large NLO SQCD corrections in some regions of parameter space.
