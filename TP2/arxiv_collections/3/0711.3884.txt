We study the exact solutions of the cascade three-level atom interacting with
a single mode classical and quantized field with different initial conditions
of the atom. For the semiclassical model, it is found that if the atom is
initially in the middle level, the time dependent populations of the upper and
lower levels are always equal. This dynamical symmetry exhibited by the
classical field is spoiled on quantization of the field mode. To reveal this
nonclassical effect an Euler matrix formalism is developed to solve the dressed
states of the cascade Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). Possible modification of
such effect on the collapse and revival phenomenon is also discussed by taking
the quantized field in a coherent state.
