We present a general scheme to determine the loss-free adiabatic
eigensolutions (dark-state polaritons) of the interaction of multiple probe
laser beams with a coherently driven atomic ensemble under conditions of
electromagnetically induced transparency. To this end we generalize the
Morris-Shore transformation to linearized Heisenberg-Langevin equations
describing the coupled light-matter system in the weak excitation limit. For
the simple lambda-type coupling scheme the generalized Morris-Shore
transformation reproduces the dark-state polariton solutions of slow light.
Here we treat a closed-loop dual-V scheme wherein two counter-propagating
control fields generate a quasi stationary pattern of two counter-propagating
probe fields -- so-called stationary light. We show that contrary to previous
predictions,there exists a single unique dark-state polariton; it obeys a
simple propagation equation.
