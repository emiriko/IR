Flow and Diffusion Distributed Structures (FDS) are stationary spatially
periodic patterns that can be observed in reaction-diffusion-advection systems.
These structures arise when the flow rate exceeds a certain bifurcation point
provided that concentrations of interacting species at the inlet differ from
steady state values and the concentrations are held constant. Normally,
theoretical studies of these patterns are developed without concerning a noise.
In this paper we consider FDS for a more realistic conditions and assume that
the inlet concentrations are perturbed by a small noise. When the flow rate is
small, the FDS is linearly sensitive to noise at the inlet. Even weak
fluctuations destroy the stationary pattern and an oscillatory solution appears
instead. For higher flow rates the instability becomes nonlinear: the pattern
remains unaltered for a weak noise and undergoes the destruction when the noise
amplitude passes a certain threshold. We represent a detailed description of
these effects and examine two scenarios for the stabilization.
