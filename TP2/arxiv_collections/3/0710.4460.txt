In this work is shown that standard dynamical equations of the chaotic
inflation for a massive real scalar field hold an especial local gauge
symmetry. Given symmetry admits that inflation field mass can be considered as
an especial "charge". Also, it is shown that given equations except expected
$CPT$ symmetry, hold surprisingly, $C^{{1/2}}P^{{1/2}}T^{{1/2}}$ symmetry too.
