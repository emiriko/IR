We propose the use of microcanonical analyses for numerical studies of
peptide aggregation transitions. Performing multicanonical Monte Carlo
simulations of a simple hydrophobic-polar continuum model for interacting
heteropolymers of finite length, we find that the microcanonical entropy
behaves convex in the transition region, leading to a negative microcanonical
specific heat. As this effect is also seen in first-order-like transitions of
other finite systems, our results provide clear evidence for recent hints that
the characterisation of phase separation in first-order-like transitions of
finite systems profits from this microcanonical view.
