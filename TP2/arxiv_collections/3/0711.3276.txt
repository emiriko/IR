Advances in material processing such as silicon micromachining are opening
the way to vacuum microelectronics. Two-dimensional vacuum components can be
fabricated using the microsystems processes. We developed such devices using a
single metal layer and silicon micromachining by DRIE. The latter technological
step has significant impact on the characteristics of the vacuum components.
This paper presents a brief summary of electron emission possibilities and the
design leading to the fabrication of a lateral field emission diode. First
measurement results and the aging of the devices are also discussed.
