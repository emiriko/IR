This paper presents a method to automatically generate compact symbolic
performance models of analog circuits with no prior specification of an
equation template. The approach takes SPICE simulation data as input, which
enables modeling of any nonlinear circuits and circuit characteristics. Genetic
programming is applied as a means of traversing the space of possible symbolic
expressions. A grammar is specially designed to constrain the search to a
canonical form for functions. Novel evolutionary search operators are designed
to exploit the structure of the grammar. The approach generates a set of
symbolic models which collectively provide a tradeoff between error and model
complexity. Experimental results show that the symbolic models generated are
compact and easy to understand, making this an effective method for aiding
understanding in analog design. The models also demonstrate better prediction
quality than posynomials.
