We point out that electromagnetic one-way edge modes analogous to quantum
Hall edge states, originally predicted by Raghu and Haldane in 2D gyroelectric
photonic crystals possessing Dirac point-derived bandgaps, can appear in more
general settings. In particular, we show that the TM modes in a gyromagnetic
photonic crystal can be formally mapped to electronic wavefunctions in a
periodic electromagnetic field, so that the only requirement for the existence
of one-way edge modes is that the Chern number for all bands below a gap is
non-zero. In a square-lattice gyromagnetic Yttrium-Iron-Garnet photonic crystal
operating at microwave frequencies, which lacks Dirac points, time-reversal
breaking is strong enough that the effect should be easily observable. For
realistic material parameters, the edge modes occupy a 10% band gap. Numerical
simulations of a one-way waveguide incorporating this crystal show 100%
transmission across strong defects, such as perfect conductors several lattice
constants wide, larger than the width of the waveguide.
