We observed the recently predicted quantum suppression of dynamical Coulomb
blockade on short coherent conductors by measuring the conductance of a quantum
point contact embedded in a tunable on-chip circuit. Taking advantage of the
circuit modularity we measured most parameters used by the theory. This allowed
us to perform a reliable and quantitative experimental test of the theory.
Dynamical Coulomb blockade corrections, probed up to the second conductance
plateau of the quantum point contact, are found to be accurately normalized by
the same Fano factor as quantum shot noise, in excellent agreement with the
theoretical predictions.
