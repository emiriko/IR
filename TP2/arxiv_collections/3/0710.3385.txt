We use extreme-ultraviolet interferometry to measure the phase of high-order
harmonic generation from transiently aligned CO2 molecules. We unambiguously
observe a reversal in phase of the high order harmonic emission for higher
harmonic orders with a sufficient degree of alignment. This results from
molecular-scale quantum interferences between the molecular electronic wave
function and the recolliding electron as it recombines with the molecule, and
is consistent with a two-center model. Furthermore, using the combined harmonic
intensity and phase information, we extract accurate information on the
dispersion relation of the returning electron wavepacket as a function of
harmonic order. This analysis shows evidence of the effect of the molecular
potential on the recolliding electron wave.
