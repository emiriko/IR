The magnetic properties and structure of LixCoO2 for x between 0.5 and 1.0
are reported. Co4+ is found to be high-spin in LixCoO2 for x between 0.94 and
1.0 and low-spin for x between 0.50 and 0.78. Weak antiferromagnetic coupling
is observed, increasing in strength as more Co4+ is introduced. At an x value
of about 0.65, the temperature-independent contribution to the magnetic
susceptibility and the electronic contribution to the specific heat are
largest. Neutron diffraction analysis reveals that the lithium oxide layer
expands perpendicular to the basal plane and the Li ions displace from their
ideal octahedral sites with decreasing x. A comparison of the structures of the
NaxCoO2 and LixCoO2 systems reveals that the CoO2 layer changes substantially
with alkali content in the former but is relatively rigid in the latter.
Further, the CoO6 octahedra in LixCoO2 are less distorted than those in
NaxCoO2. We postulate that these structural differences strongly influence the
physical properties in the two systems.
