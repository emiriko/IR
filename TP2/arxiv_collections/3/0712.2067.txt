The results of the muon-spin rotation experiments on BCS superconductors
NbB_2+x (x = 0.2, 0.34) are reported. Both samples, studied in the present
work, exhibit rather broad transitions to the superconducting state, suggesting
a distribution of the volume fractions with different transition temperatures
(T_c)'s. By taking these distributions into account, the dependence of the
inverse squared zero-temperature magnetic penetration depth (\lambda_0^{-2}) on
T_c was reconstructed for temperatures in the range 1.5K<T_c<8.0K.
\lambda_0^{-2} was found to obey the power law dependence \lambda_0^{-2}\propto
T_c^{3.1(1)} which appears to be common for some families of BCS
superconductors as, {\it e.g.}, Al doped MgB_2 and high-temperature cuprate
superconductors as underdoped YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}.
