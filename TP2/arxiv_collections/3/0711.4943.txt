We have investigated correlations of coincident $\Lambda N$ pairs from the
stopped $K^-$ reaction on ${}^4$He, and clearly observed $\Lambda p$ and
$\Lambda n$ branches of the two-nucleon absorption process in the $\Lambda N$
invariant mass spectra. In addition, non-mesonic reaction channels, which
indicate possible exotic signals for the formation of strange multibaryon
states, have been identified.
