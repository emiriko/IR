Consider the plane as a checkerboard, with each unit square colored black or
white in an arbitrary manner. We show that for any such coloring there are
straight line segments, of arbitrarily large length, such that the difference
of their white length minus their black length, in absolute value, is at least
the square root of their length, up to a multiplicative constant. For the
corresponding ``finite'' problem ($N \times N$ checkerboard) we also prove that
we can color it in such a way that the above quantity is at most $C \sqrt{N
\log N}$, for any placement of the line segment.
