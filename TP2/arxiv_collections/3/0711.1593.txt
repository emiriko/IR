We propose an approach to derive longitudinal shower development information
from the longitudinally unsegmented BABAR electromagnetic calorimeter by using
tracking information. Our algorithm takes advantage of the good
three-dimensional tracking resolution of BABAR, which provides an independent
geometric constraint on the shower as measured in the BABAR crystal
calorimeter. We show that adding the derived longitudinal shower development
information to standard particle identification algorithms significantly
improves the low-momentum separation of pions from electrons and muons. We also
verify that the energy dependence of the electromagnetic shower development we
measure is consistent with the prediction of a standard electromagnetic shower
model.
