This paper shows how increased entropy values from an initially low big bang
level can be measured experimentally by counting relic gravitons. Furthermore
the physical mechanism of this entropy increase is explained via analogies with
early-universe phase transitions. The rapid increase in entropy so alluded to
without near sudden increases up to 10 to the 88 power may be enough to allow
successful modeling of relic graviton production for entropy in a manner
similar to zero point energy extraction from a vacuum state
