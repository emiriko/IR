We study the relation between the quantum games, communication complexity
problems and Bell inequalities. In particular we are interested in answering
the question whether for every element of one of these groups there is a
corresponding element in the other two. We show that there are cases where
there is no such relation. Moreover, in the communication complexity problems
for which there is no Bell inequality the advantage of the quantum strategies
over the classical ones is much higher.
