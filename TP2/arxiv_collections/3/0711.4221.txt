We have integrated on oxidized silicon wafers superconductive films and
Josephson junctions along with sol-gel optical channel waveguides. The
fabrication process is carried out in two steps that result to be solid and
non-invasive. It is demonstrated that 660 nm light, coupled from an optical
fibre into the channel sol-gel waveguide, can be directed toward
superconducting tunnel junctions whose current-voltage characteristics are
affected by the presence of the radiation. The dependence of the change in the
superconducting energy gap under optical pumping is discussed in terms of a
non-equilibrium superconductivity model.
