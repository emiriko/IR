CP violation in supersymmetric models is reviewd with focus on explicit CP
violation in the MSSM. The topics covered in particular are CP-mixing in the
Higgs sector and its measurement at the LHC, CP-odd observables in the gaugino
sector at the ILC, EDM constraints, and the neutralino relic density.
