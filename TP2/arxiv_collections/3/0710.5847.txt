The leading order corrections to Reissner--Nordstrom solutions of the
Einstein's equations on noncommutative space time have been worked out basing
on a noncommutative gauge theory of gravity. From the corrcted metric the
horizons have been derived and the curvature scalar is also computed. The
introduction of noncommutativity leads to the removal of the coordinate
singularities.
