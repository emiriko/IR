We study the q-deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation in path
representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebras. We consider two types of open
boundary conditions, and in both cases we derive factorised expressions for the
solutions of the qKZ equation in terms of Baxterised Demazurre-Lusztig
operators. These expressions are alternative to known integral solutions for
tensor product representations. The factorised expressions reveal the algebraic
structure within the qKZ equation, and effectively reduce it to a set of
truncation conditions on a single scalar function. The factorised expressions
allow for an efficient computation of the full solution once this single scalar
function is known. We further study particular polynomial solutions for which
certain additional factorised expressions give weighted sums over components of
the solution. In the homogeneous limit, we formulate positivity conjectures in
the spirit of Di Francesco and Zinn-Justin. We further conjecture relations
between weighted sums and individual components of the solutions for larger
system sizes.
