We present perfect fluid Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological
models in the presence of negative cosmological constant. In this work the
Schutz's variational formalism is applied for radiation, dust, cosmic string,
and domain wall dominated Universes with positive, negative, and zero constant
spatial curvature. In this approach the notion of time can be recovered. These
give rise to Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the scale factor. We find their
igenvalues and eigenfunctions by using Spectral Method. After that, we use the
eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case and evaluate
the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factors, which are found to
oscillate between finite maximum and minimum values. Since the expectation
values of the scale factors never tends to the singular point, we have an
initial indication that these models may not have singularities at the quantum
level.
