The exclusive process e+ e- -> e+ e-rho0_L rho0_L allows to study various
dynamics and factorization properties of perturbative QCD. At moderate energy,
we demonstrate how collinear QCD factorization emerges, involving either
generalized distribution amplitudes (GDA) or transition distribution amplitudes
(TDA). At higher energies, in the Regge limit of QCD, we show that it offers a
promising probe of the BFKL resummation effects to be studied at ILC.
