Recently it was shown that the excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays above 1
GeV could be interpreted as a Dark Matter annihilation signal. From the
spectral shape of the excess it is possible to determine a range for the
allowed WIMP mass which can be used to test the supersymmetric parameter space.
It is found that the EGRET excess combined with electroweak and other
constraints, e.g. relic denisity or direct detection limits, is fully
consistent with the minimal mSUGRA model for scalars in the TeV range and
gauginos below 500 GeV.
