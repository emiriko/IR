We calculate the background field equations for the T-duality symmetric
string building on previous work by including the effect of the Dilaton up to
two-loops. Inclusion of the Dilaton allows us to obtain the full beta
functionals of the duality symmetric sigma model. We are able to interpret the
result in terms of a dimensionally reduced O(d,d) invariant target space
effective action.
