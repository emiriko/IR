We study scarring phenomena in open quantum systems. We show numerical
evidence that individual resonance eigenstates of an open quantum system
present localization around unstable short periodic orbits in a similar way as
their closed counterparts. The structure of eigenfunctions around these
classical objects is not destroyed by the opening. This is exposed in a
paradigmatic system of quantum chaos, the cat map.
