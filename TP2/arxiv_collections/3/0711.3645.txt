For $\theta$ a non-algebraic point on a quasi projective variety over a
number field, I prove that $\theta$ has an approximation by a series of
algebraic points of bounded height and degree which is essentially best
possible.
  Applications of this result will include a proof of a slightly strengthened
version of the Philippon criterion, some new algebraic independence criteria,
statements concerning metric transcendence theory on varieties of arbitrary
dimension, and a rather accurate estimate for the number of algebraic points of
bounded height and degree on quasi projective varieties over number fields.
