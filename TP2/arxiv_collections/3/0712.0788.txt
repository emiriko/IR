We study the connection between the category of modules over the affine
Kac-Moody Lie algebra at the critical level, and the category of D-modules on
the affine flag scheme G((t))/I, where I is the Iwahori subgroup.
  We prove a localization-type result, which establishes an equivalence between
certain subcategories on both sides.
  We also establish an equivalence between a certain subcategory of Kac-Moody
modules, and the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the scheme of Miura
opers for the Langlands dual group, thereby proving a conjecture of [FG2].
