AgInSe2 nanorods (NRs) with diameter of 15 nm have been investigated for
their nonlinear optical responses by using Z-scan and transient absorption
techniques with femtosecond laser pulses of photon energy greater than the
bandgap. At excitation irradiance of 20 GW/cm2, AgInSe2 NRs reveal saturation
in the nonlinear absorption and optical Kerr nonlinearity with a recovery time
determined to be a few ten picoseconds. Such large saturable absorption and
Kerr nonlinearity exhibit a third-order susceptibility of 1.2 x 10-8 esu and a
figure of merit of 0.04 esu.cm.s-1, making AgInSe2 NRs a promising candidate
for saturable absorption devices.
