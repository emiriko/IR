We propose a new starting point for comparing dose distributions in
therapeutic radiation physics using a Jacobian-based measure. The measure is
normalization independent, free of tunable parameters, bounded and converges to
a unique value when comparing unrelated dose distributions. We present a
preliminary demonstration of the sensitivity and general characteristics of
this measure.
