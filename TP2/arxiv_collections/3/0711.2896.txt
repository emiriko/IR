We have studied the effect of magnetic field on a non-stoichiometric Heusler
alloy Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{35}$In$_{15}$ that undergoes a martensitic as well as a
magnetic transition near room temperature. Temperature dependent magnetization
measurements demonstrate the influence of magnetic field on the structural
phase transition temperature. From the study of magnetization as a function of
applied field, we show the occurrence of inverse-magnetocaloric effect
associated with this magneto-structural transition. The magnetic entropy change
attains a value as high as 25 J/kg-K (at 5 T field) at room temperature as the
alloy transforms from the austenitic to martensitic phase with a concomitant
magnetic ordering.
