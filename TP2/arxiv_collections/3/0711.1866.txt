We consider the Langevin lattice dynamics for a spontaneously broken lambda
phi^4 scalar field theory where both additive and multiplicative noise terms
are incorporated. The lattice renormalization for the corresponding stochastic
Ginzburg-Landau-Langevin and the subtleties related to the multiplicative noise
are investigated.
