We adapt multilevel, force-directed graph layout techniques to visualizing
dynamic graphs in which vertices and edges are added and removed in an online
fashion (i.e., unpredictably). We maintain multiple levels of coarseness using
a dynamic, randomized coarsening algorithm. To ensure the vertices follow
smooth trajectories, we employ dynamics simulation techniques, treating the
vertices as point particles. We simulate fine and coarse levels of the graph
simultaneously, coupling the dynamics of adjacent levels. Projection from
coarser to finer levels is adaptive, with the projection determined by an
affine transformation that evolves alongside the graph layouts. The result is a
dynamic graph visualizer that quickly and smoothly adapts to changes in a
graph.
