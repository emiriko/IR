We develop a computationally tractable method for calculating correlation
functions of the finite temperature trapped Bose gas that includes the effects
of s-wave interactions. Our approach uses a classical field method to model the
low energy modes and treats the high energy modes using a Hartree-Fock
description. We present results of first and second order correlation
functions, in position and momentum space, for an experimentally realistic
system in the temperature range of $0.6T_c$ to $1.0T_c$. We also characterize
the spatial coherence length of the system. Our theory should be applicable in
the critical region where experiments are now able to measure first and second
order correlations.
