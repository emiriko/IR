We study a generalized isotropic XY-model which includes both two-spin and
four-spin mean-field interactions. This model can be solved in the
microcanonical ensemble. It is shown that in certain parameter regions the
model exhibits gaps in the magnetization at fixed energy, resulting in
ergodicity breaking. This phenomenon has previously been reported in
anisotropic and discrete spin models. The entropy of the model is calculated
and the microcanonical phase diagram is derived, showing the existence of first
order phase transitions from the ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic disordered
phase. It is found that ergodicity breaking takes place both in the
ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases. As a consequence, the system can
exhibit a stable ferromagnetic phase within the paramagnetic region, and
conversely a disordered phase within the magnetically ordered region.
