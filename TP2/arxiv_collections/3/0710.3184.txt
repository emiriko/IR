The 6.1, 6.9 and 7.1 MeV photon yields in the reaction with protons in the
1.32 to 1.42 MeV energy range were determined from the comparison between
experimental and simulated spectrum. The gamma-ray spectra were measured with a
HPGe detector which was 72.5 mm in diameter and 60.5 mm in length. The reaction
kinematics and the detector response function were simulated by different
programs using the Monte Carlo method. The relative photon yields were obtained
from the least-squares fit of the experimental gamma-ray spectra to the
convolution of the detector response function with the photon energy
distribution arising from the reaction kinematics.
