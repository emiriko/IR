We show that bimodal radio frequency spectra universally arise at
intermediate temperatures in models of strongly interacting trapped Fermi
gases. The bimodality is independent of superfluidity or pseudogap physics,
depending only on the functional form of the equation of state -- which is
constrained by dimensional analysis at low temperatures and the virial
expansion at high temperatures. In addition to these model independent results,
we present a simple calculation of the radio frequency line-shape of a highly
polarized Fermi gas which uses energetic considerations to include final state
interactions. While this model only qualitatively captures the line-shapes
observed in the experiments, it provides a conceptually clean and powerful
technique for estimating the energy scales and how they vary with experimental
parameters.
