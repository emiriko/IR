A system of electrons in a local or nonlocal external potential can be
studied with 1-matrix functional theory (1MFT), which is similar to density
functional theory (DFT) but takes the one-particle reduced density matrix
(1-matrix) instead of the density as its basic variable. Within 1MFT, Gilbert
derived [PRB 12, 2111 (1975)] effective single-particle equations analogous to
the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations in DFT. The self-consistent solution of these
1MFT-KS equations reproduces not only the density of the original electron
system but also its 1-matrix. While in DFT it is usually possible to reproduce
the density using KS orbitals with integer (0 or 1) occupancy, in 1MFT
reproducing the 1-matrix requires in general fractional occupancies. The
variational principle implies that the KS eigenvalues of all fractionally
occupied orbitals must collapse at self-consistency to a single level, equal to
the chemical potential. We show that as a consequence of the degeneracy the
iteration of the KS equations is intrinsically divergent. Fortunately, the
level shifting method, commonly introduced in Hartree-Fock calculations, is
always able to force convergence. We introduce an alternative derivation of the
1MFT-KS equations that allows control of the eigenvalue collapse by
constraining the occupancies. As an explicit example, we apply the 1MFT-KS
scheme to calculate the ground state 1-matrix of an exactly solvable two-site
Hubbard model.
