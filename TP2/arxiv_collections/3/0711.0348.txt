This paper proposes an environment to support high-level database programming
in a declarative programming language. In order to ensure safe database
updates, all access and update operations related to the database are generated
from high-level descriptions in the entity- relationship (ER) model. We propose
a representation of ER diagrams in the declarative language Curry so that they
can be constructed by various tools and then translated into this
representation. Furthermore, we have implemented a compiler from this
representation into a Curry program that provides access and update operations
based on a high-level API for database programming.
