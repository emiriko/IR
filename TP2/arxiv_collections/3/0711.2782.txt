It is shown in linear approximation that in the case of one-dimensional
problem of transverse electron waves in a half-infinite slab of homogeneous
Maxwellian collisionless plasma with the given boundary field frequency two
wave branches of solution of the dispersion equation are simultaneously
realizing. These are the branch of fast forward waves determined mainly by
Maxwell equations of electromagnetic field, as well as the branch of forward
and backward slow waves determined in the whole by kinetic properties of
electrons in the collective electrical field. The physical nature of wave
movements is revealed. A relation is found between electric field amplitudes of
fast and slow waves. Multiform dividing the coupled slow waves into standing
and traveling parts leads to a necessity of additional requirements to a
selection of the type of a device analyzing these waves and its response
interpretation.
