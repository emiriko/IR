The conditions, at which quasi-bound $\eta-^{3}$He state is possible, have
been investigated and compared with the available findings about
$\eta$N-scattering length and the information about $^{3}$He nucleus from
references. We conclud that the existence of quasi-bound $\eta-^{3}$He state
within the framework of the optical potential model, which doesn`t contradict
all collected findings, is not possible, but the observing anomaly of
$\eta^{3}$He-interaction at low energies is a virtual state.
