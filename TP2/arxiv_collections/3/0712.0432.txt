We calculate a pump current in a classical two-state stochastic chemical
kinetics by means of the non-adiabatic geometrical phase interpretation. The
two-state system is attached to two particle reservoirs, and under a periodic
perturbation of the kinetic rates, it gives rise to a pump current between the
two-state system and the absorbing states. In order to calculate the pump
current, the Floquet theory for the non-adiabatic geometrical phase is extended
from a Hermitian case to a non-Hermitian case. The dependence of the pump
current on the frequency of the perturbative kinetic rates is explicitly
derived, and a stochastic resonance-like behavior is obtained.
