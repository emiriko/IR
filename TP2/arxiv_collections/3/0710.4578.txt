Within the frame of an effective, coarse-grained hydrophobic-polar protein
model, we employ multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations to investigate
free-energy landscapes and folding channels of exemplified heteropolymer
sequences, which are permutations of each other. Despite the simplicity of the
model, the knowledge of the free-energy landscape in dependence of a suitable
system order parameter enables us to reveal complex folding characteristics
known from real bioproteins and synthetic peptides, such as two-state folding,
folding through weakly stable intermediates, and glassy metastability.
