Determining the hadron spectrum and hadron properties beyond the ground
states is a challenge in lattice QCD. Most of these results have been in the
quenched approximation but now we are entering the dynamical era. I review some
of the ideas and methods of the lattice approach, concentrating on a few
examples and on results obtained for Chirally Improved (CI) fermions.
