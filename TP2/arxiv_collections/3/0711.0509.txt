The infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators in Yang-Mills gauge
theories is of central importance for the understanding of confinement in QCD.
While analytic studies using Schwinger-Dyson equations predict the same
infrared exponents for the SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups, lattice simulations
usually assume that the two cases are different, although their qualitative
infrared features may be the same. We carry out a comparative study of lattice
(Landau) propagators for both gauge groups. Our data were especially produced
with equivalent lattice parameters to allow a careful comparison of the two
cases.
