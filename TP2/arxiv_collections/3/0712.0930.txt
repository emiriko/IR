Spin-dependent transport through a multilevel quantum dot weakly coupled to
ferromagnetic leads is analyzed theoretically by means of the real-time
diagrammatic technique. Both the sequential and cotunneling processes are taken
into account, which makes the results on tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and
shot noise applicable in the whole range of relevant bias and gate voltages.
Suppression of the TMR due to inelastic cotunneling and super-Poissonian shot
noise have been found in some of the Coulomb blockade regions. Furthermore, in
the Coulomb blockade regime there is an additional contribution to the noise
due to bunching of cotunneling processes involving the spin-majority electrons.
On the other hand, in the sequential tunneling regime TMR oscillates with the
bias voltage, while the current noise is generally sub-Poissonian.
