We propose a cavity-QED scheme that can deterministically generate
Einstein-Podosky-Rosen polarization-entangled photon pairs. A four-level tripod
atom successively couples to two high-Q optical cavities possessing
polarization degeneracy, assisted by a classical $\pi$-polarized pump field.
The stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process in the atom-cavity system is
used to produce the polarization-entangled photon pairs. The proposal is
particularly robust against atomic spontaneous decay, which should have
potential applications in quantum information processing.
