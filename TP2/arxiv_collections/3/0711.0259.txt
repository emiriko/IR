We investigate market forces that would lead to the emergence of new classes
of players in the sponsored search market. We report a 3-fold diversification
triggered by two inherent features of the sponsored search market, namely,
capacity constraints and collusion-vulnerability of current mechanisms. In the
first scenario, we present a comparative study of two models motivated by
capacity constraints - one where the additional capacity is provided by
for-profit agents, who compete for slots in the original auction, draw traffic,
and run their own sub-auctions, and the other, where the additional capacity is
provided by the auctioneer herself, by essentially acting as a mediator and
running a single combined auction. This study was initiated by us in
\cite{SRGR07}, where the mediator-based model was studied. In the present work,
we study the auctioneer-based model and show that this model seems inferior to
the mediator-based model in terms of revenue or efficiency guarantee due to
added capacity. In the second scenario, we initiate a game theoretic study of
current sponsored search auctions, involving incentive driven mediators who
exploit the fact that these mechanisms are not collusion-resistant. In
particular, we show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the
services of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction, and
that the mediator can also obtain monetary benefit, without violating incentive
constraints from the advertisers who do not use its services. We also point out
that the auctioneer can not do very much via mechanism design to avoid such
for-profit mediation without losing badly in terms of revenue, and therefore,
the mediators are likely to prevail.
