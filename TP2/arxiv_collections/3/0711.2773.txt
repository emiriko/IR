Quantum computing in terms of geometric phases, i.e. Berry or
Aharonov-Anandan phases, is fault-tolerant to a certain degree. We examine its
implementation based on Zeeman coupling with a rotating field and isotropic
Heisenberg interaction, which describe NMR and can also be realized in quantum
dots and cold atoms. Using a novel physical representation of the qubit basis
states, we construct $\pi/8$ and Hadamard gates based on Berry and
Aharonov-Anandan phases. For two interacting qubits in a rotating field, we
find that it is always impossible to construct a two-qubit gate based on Berry
phases, or based on Aharonov-Anandan phases when the gyromagnetic ratios of the
two qubits are equal. In implementing a universal set of quantum gates, one may
combine geometric $\pi/8$ and Hadamard gates and dynamical $\sqrt{\rm SWAP}$
gate.
