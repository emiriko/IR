We predict the existence of an isomeric 0$^-$-state in $^{12}$Be at an
excitation energy of about 2.5 MeV, and a 0$^-$-resonance in $^{11}$Li with
both energy and width of about 1 MeV corresponding to two-neutron emission. The
structure of these halo-like states are like the 1$^-$-states which means
essentially a core surrounded by two neutrons in single-particle $s$ and
p-states. The life-time of the $^{12}$Be state is determined by $M1$ or
$M2$-emission, $\tau(M1) \approx 10^{-11}$ s or $\tau(M2) \approx 10^{-8}$ s
estimated for photon energies of 0.1 MeV and 0.6 MeV, respectively.
