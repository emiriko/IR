Neutrino masses may be generated by the VEV of an $SU(2)_L$ Higgs triplet. We
assume that the doubly charged component of such a triplet has a mass in the
range of several 100 GeV, such that it is accessible at LHC. Its decay into
like-sign leptons provides a clean experimental signature, which allows for a
direct test of the neutrino mass matrix. By exploring the branching ratios of
this decay into leptons of various flavours, we show that within this model the
type of the neutrino mass spectrum (normal, inverted or quasi-degenerate) might
actually be resolved at the LHC. Furthermore, we show that within the Higgs
triplet model for neutrino mass the decays of the doubly charged scalar into
like-sign lepton pairs at the LHC provide a possibility to determine the
Majorana CP phases of the lepton mixing matrix.
