We study directly the length of the domain walls (DW) obtained by comparing
the ground states of the Edwards-Anderson spin glass model subject to periodic
and antiperiodic boundary conditions. For the bimodal and Gaussian bond
distributions, we have isolated the DW and have calculated directly its fractal
dimension $d_f$. Our results show that, even though in three dimensions $d_f$
is the same for both distributions of bonds, this is clearly not the case for
two-dimensional (2D) systems. In addition, contrary to what happens in the case
of the 2D Edwards-Anderson spin glass with Gaussian distribution of bonds, we
find no evidence that the DW for the bimodal distribution of bonds can be
described as a Schramm-Loewner evolution processes.
