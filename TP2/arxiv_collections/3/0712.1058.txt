We compute correlators of chiral operators in (0,2) supersymmetric
Landau-Ginzburg theories. The class of theories and the correlators we study
are relevant for extending and testing mirror symmetry away from the (2,2)
locus. More generally, these methods provide alpha'-exact results about certain
superpotential couplings in compactifications of the heterotic string.
