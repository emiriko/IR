We study multipliers of Hardy-Orlicz spaces $\mH_{\Phi}$ which are strictly
contained between $\bigcup_{p>0}H^p$ and so-called ``big'' Hardy-Orlicz spaces.
Big Hardy-Orlicz spaces, carrying an algebraic structure, are equal to their
multiplier algebra, whereas in classical Hardy spaces $H^p$, the multipliers
reduce to $H^{\infty}$. For Hardy-Orlicz spaces $\mH_{\Phi}$ between these two
extremal situations and subject to some conditions, we exhibit multipliers that
are in Hardy-Orlicz spaces the defining functions of which are related to
$\Phi$. Even if the results do not entirely characterize the multiplier
algebra, some examples show that we are not very far from precise conditions.
In certain situations we see how the multiplier algebra grows in a sense from
$\Hi$ to big Hardy-Orlicz spaces when we go from classical $H^p$ spaces to big
Hardy-Orlicz spaces. However, the multiplier algebras are not always ordered as
their underlying Hardy-Orlicz spaces. Such an ordering holds in certain
situations, but examples show that there are large Hardy-Orlicz spaces for
which the multipliers reduce to $\Hi$ so that the multipliers do in general not
conserve the ordering of the underlying Hardy-Orlicz spaces. We apply some of
the multiplier results to construct Hardy-Orlicz spaces close to
$\bigcup_{p>0}H^p$ and for which the free interpolating sequences are no longer
characterized by the Carleson condition which is well known to characterize
free interpolating sequences in $H^p$, $p>0$.
