In this paper we prove that for any spacelike hypersurface containing an
untrapped barrier in a stationary spacetime satisfying the null energy
condition, any marginally outer trapped surface cannot lie in the exterior
region where the stationary Killing vector is timelike. In the static case we
prove that any marginally outer trapped surface cannot penetrate into the
exterior region where the static Killing vector is timelike. In fact, we prove
these result at an initial data level, without even assuming existence of a
spacetime. The proof relies on a powerful theorem by Andersson and Metzger on
existence of an outermost marginally outer trapped surface.
