We explicitly evaluate a special type of multiple Dirichlet $L$-values at
positive integers in two different ways: One approach involves using symmetric
functions, while the other involves using a generating function of the values.
Equating these two expressions, we derive several summation formulae involving
the Bernoulli and Euler numbers. Moreover, values at non-positive integers,
called central limit values, are also studied.
