One source of disturbance in a pulsed T-ray signal is attributed to ambient
water vapor. Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb T-rays at
discrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions.
This results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum, and in the
time domain the T-ray signal is observed as fluctuations after the main pulse.
These effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical
spectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapor is commonly removed from the T-ray
path by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some
applications a closed chamber is not applicable. This situation, therefore,
motivates the need for another method to reduce these unwanted artifacts. This
paper presents a study on a computational means to address the problem.
Initially, a complex frequency response of water vapor is modeled from a
spectroscopic catalog. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine
tuning of the strength of each resonance, parts of the water-vapor response are
removed from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion.
