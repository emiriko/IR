Recently, time-dependent current-density functional theory has been extended
to include the dynamical interaction of quantum systems with external
environments [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 226403 (2007)]. Here we show that such
a theory allows us to study a fundamentally important class of phenomena
previously inaccessible by standard density-functional methods: the decay of
excited systems. As an example we study the decay of an ensemble of excited He
atoms, and discuss these results in the context of quantum measurement theory.
