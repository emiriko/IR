The alternative approach to QCD analysis of the structure function F2gamma is
presented. It differs from the conventional one by the presence of the terms,
which in conventional approach appear in higher orders. The numerical results
show that this difference is nonnegligible and may play an important role in
the analysis on photon data of the future experiments.
