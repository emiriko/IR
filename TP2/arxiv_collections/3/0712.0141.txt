The electrical detection of spin echoes via echo tomography is used to
observe decoherence processes associated with the electrical readout of the
spin state of phosphorus donor electrons in silicon near a SiO$_2$ interface.
Using the Carr-Purcell pulse sequence, an echo decay with a time constant of
$1.7\pm0.2 \rm{\mu s}$ is observed, in good agreement with theoretical modeling
of the interaction between donors and paramagnetic interface states. Electrical
spin echo tomography thus can be used to study the spin dynamics in realistic
spin qubit devices for quantum information processing.
