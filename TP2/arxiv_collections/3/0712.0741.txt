We perform broadband phase sensitive measurements of the reflection
coefficient from 45 MHz up to 20 GHz employing a vector network analyzer with a
2.4 mm coaxial sensor which is terminated by the sample under test. While the
material parameters (conductivity and permittivity) can be easily extracted
from the obtained impedance data if the sample is metallic, no direct solution
is possible if the material under investigation is an insulator. Focusing on
doped semiconductors with largely varying conductivity, here we present a
closed calibration and evaluation procedure for frequencies up to 5 GHz, based
on the rigorous solution for the electromagnetic field distribution inside the
sample combined with the variational principle; basically no limiting
assumptions are necessary. A simple static model based on the electric current
distribution proves to yield the same frequency dependence of the complex
conductivity up to 1 GHz. After a critical discussion we apply the developed
method to the hopping transport in Si:P at temperature down to 1 K.
