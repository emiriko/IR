The temperatures in large parts of Europe have been record high during the
meteorological autumn of 2006. Compared to 1961-1990, the 2m temperature was
more than three degrees Celsius above normal from the North side of the Alps to
southern Norway. This made it by far the warmest autumn on record in the United
Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, with the
records in Central England going back to 1659, in the Netherlands to 1706 and
in Denmark to 1768.
  Assuming that the mean of the temperature distribution changes proportional
to the global mean temperature, but the shape remains the same includes to
first order the effects of global warming. Even under this assumption the
autumn temperatures were very unusual, with estimates of the return time of 200
to 2000 years in this region. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is
more than 100 to 300 years.
  Climate models that simulate the current atmospheric circulation well
underestimate the observed mean rise in autumn temperatures. They do not
simulate a change in the shape of the distribution that would increase the
probability of warm events under global warming. This implies that the warm
autumn 2006 either was a very rare coincidence, or the local temperature rise
is much stronger than modelled, or non-linear physics that is missing from
these models increases the probability of warm extremes.
