Operating frequency of a pipelined circuit is determined by the delay of the
slowest pipeline stage. However, under statistical delay variation in sub-100nm
technology regime, the slowest stage is not readily identifiable and the
estimation of the pipeline yield with respect to a target delay is a
challenging problem. We have proposed analytical models to estimate yield for a
pipelined design based on delay distributions of individual pipe stages. Using
the proposed models, we have shown that change in logic depth and imbalance
between the stage delays can improve the yield of a pipeline. A statistical
methodology has been developed to optimally design a pipeline circuit for
enhancing yield. Optimization results show that, proper imbalance among the
stage delays in a pipeline improves design yield by 9% for the same area and
performance (and area reduction by about 8.4% under a yield constraint) over a
balanced design.
