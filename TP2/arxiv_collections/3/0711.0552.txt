Remarkable subalgebras of the Yangian for gl_n called the shifted Yangians
were introduced in a recent work by Brundan and Kleshchev in relation to their
study of finite W-algebras. In particular, in that work a classification of
finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the shifted Yangians and the
associated finite W-algebras was given. We construct a class of these
representations in an explicit form via bases of Gelfand-Tsetlin type.
