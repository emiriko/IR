A noncommutative version of the modified KP equation and a family of its
solutions expressed as quasideterminants are discussed. The origin of these
solutions is explained by means of Darboux transformations and the solutions
are verified directly. We also verify directly an explicit connection between
quasideterminant solutions of the noncommutative mKP equation and the
noncommutative KP equation arising from the Miura transformation.
