The equation of state of the partially polarized two component Fermi gas at
zero temperature in the unitary limit is computed by {\it ab initio} auxiliary
field Monte Carlo method. We obtain the critical ratio of the chemical
potentials $\mu_\downarrow/\mu_\uparrow$ at the phase transitions. The value of
$\mu_\downarrow/\mu_\uparrow$ at the transition between the fully paired
superfluid and the partially polarized phase is 0.11 while the critical value
for the phase transition between the partially polarized phase and the fully
polarized normal fluid is -0.59. We also determine the radial boundaries of the
phase transitions of the Fermi gas in the harmonic trap as function of the
total polarization. We find that beyond the critical polarization 0.65, the
fully paired superfluid core disappears in the trapped Fermi gas.
