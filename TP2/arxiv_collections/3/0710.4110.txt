We study the $s-\bar s$ asymmetry in the nucleon sea using a model in which
the proton wave function includes a Kaon-Hyperon Fock state. Parameters of the
model are fixed by fitting the $s-\bar s$ asymmetry obtained from global fits
to Deep Inelastic Scattering data. We discuss possible effects of the $s-\bar
s$ asymmetry on the measurement of the Weinberg angle by the NuTeV
Collaboration.
