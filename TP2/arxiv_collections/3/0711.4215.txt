A unified homogenization procedure for split ring metamaterials taking into
account time and spatial dispersion is introduced. The procedure is based on
two coupled systems of equations. The first one comes from an approximation of
the metamaterial as a cubic arrangement of coupled LC circuits, giving the
relation between currents and local magnetic field. The second equation comes
from macroscopic Maxwell equations, and gives the relation between the
macroscopic magnetic field and the average magnetization of the metamaterial.
It is shown that electromagnetic and magnetoinductive waves propagating in the
metamaterial are obtained from this analysis. Therefore, the proposed time and
spatially dispersive permeability accounts for the characterization of the
complete spectrum of waves of the metamaterial. Finally, it is shown that the
proposed theory is in good quantitative and qualitative agreement with full
wave simulations.
