This article is a survey about applications of bi-quantization theory in Lie
theory. We focus on a conjecture of M. Duflo. Most of the applications are
coming from our article with Alberto Cattaneo and some extensions are relating
discussions with my student. The end of the article is completely new. We prove
that the conjecture E=1 implies the Kashiwara-Vergne conjecture. Our
deformation is non geometric but uses a polynomial deformation of the
coefficients.
