This version is a significant improvement of the original paper. It includes
a new section where we discuss norm tori in some detail. The new abstract is
the following: In this paper we obtain Chevalley's ambiguous class number
formula for an arbitrary torus T over a global field. The classical formula of
C.Chevalley may be recovered by setting T=G_{m} in our formula. As an
illustration of the general result, we discuss norm tori in detail. A key
ingredient of the proof of our main theorem is the work of X.Xarles on groups
of components of Neron-Raynaud models of tori.
