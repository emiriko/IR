Massive gravity previously constructed as the spin-2 quantum gauge theory is
studied in the classical limit. The vector-graviton field v which does not
decouple in the limit of vanishing graviton mass gives rise to a modification
of general relativity. The modified Schwarzschild solution contains a
contribution which can be interpreted as the dark mass density. We calculate
the density profile in the simplest spherically symmetric geometry.
