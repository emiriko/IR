We present diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) results on a new metastable,
superfluid phase above the crystal ground state in two-dimensional 4He at
densities > 0.065 1/A^2. The state is anisotropic with hexatic orbital order.
This implies that the liquid--solid phase transition has two stages: A second
order phase transition from the isotropic superfluid to the hexatic superfluid,
followed by a first order transition that localizes atoms into the triangular
crystal order. This metastable hexatic phase has finite condensate fraction and
it provides a natural explanation for the superflow in the supersolid grain
boundaries.
