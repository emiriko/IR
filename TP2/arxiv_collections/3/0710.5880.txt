We review simulations of dynamical domain wall fermions at a fixed inverse
lattice spacing of 1.73GeV and with pion masses as light as 330MeV and spatial
dimensions as large as 2.7fm performed by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations.
These results include pseudoscalar masses and decay constants and low energy
constants of the chiral effective lagrangian. We also review results for the
neutral kaon mixing amplitude $B_K$, the Kl3 form factor, pseudoscalar meson
structure, and vector meson decay constants. In the baryon sector we review
results for the spectrum, and nucleon form factors and structure functions.
Highlights of our programme include preliminary quark masses, and
determinations of $V_{us}$ from both $f_K/f_\pi$ and from Kl3, and an updated
result for $B_K$. We find significant finite volume effects in the nucleon
axial charge $g_A$ for our $m_\pi=330$ MeV ensemble on a $(2.7 {\rm fm})^3$
lattice, and highlight the importance of large physical volumes for non-trivial
nucleon physics.
