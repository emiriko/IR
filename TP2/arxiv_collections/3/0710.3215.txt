A detailed simple model is applied to study a high temperature plasma ball.
It is assumed that the ions and delocalized electrons are distributed randomly
throughout the charged plasma ball (extra/missing charge is assumed to be found
in a thin layer on the surface of a ball). The energy of the microscopic
electrostatic field around the ions is taken into account and calculated. It is
shown in the framework of this model that regarded charged plasma ball can be
stable as a metastable state, when subjected to an external (atmospheric)
pressure. Equilibrium radius of a ball is calculated.
