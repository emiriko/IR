Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ undergoes a martensitic transformation around 250
K and exhibits a field induced reverse martensitic transformation and
substantial magnetocaloric effects. We substitute small amounts Ga for In,
which are isoelectronic, to carry these technically important properties to
close to room temperature by shifting the martensitic transformation
temperature.
