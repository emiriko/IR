We examine the heuristic approach to constant gravitational field by Dehnen,
H\"onl and Westpfahl, extending it everywhere beyond linear approximation. Then
it becomes flexible to accommodate possible modifications of General
Relativity. We have found that two pictures introduced in the related paper by
Thirring are helpful in better understanding some features of gravitation. In
particular, this approach suggest that the privileged system for constant
gravitational field must be the isotropic one and that the requirement of gauge
invariance in gravitation theory may be a luxury; it is sufficient to take care
that the nonphysical degrees of freedom do not invalidate calculations. It
follows from this approach that gravitational constant should depend on
gravitational field and some universality in the form of metric of an
asymmetric body is suggested.
