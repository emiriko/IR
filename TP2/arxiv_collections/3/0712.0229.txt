We present a constitutive model capturing some of the experimentally observed
features of soft biological tissues: nonlinear viscoelasticity, nonlinear
elastic anisotropy, and nonlinear viscous anisotropy. For this model we derive
the equation governing rectilinear shear motion in the plane of the fiber
reinforcement; it is a nonlinear partial differential equation for the shear
strain. Specializing the equation to the quasi-static processes of creep and
recovery, we find that usual (exponential-like) time growth and decay exist in
general, but that for certain ranges of values for the material parameters and
for the angle between the shearing direction and the fiber direction, some
anomalous behaviors emerge. These include persistence of a nonzero strain in
the recovery experiment, strain growth in recovery, strain decay in creep,
disappearance of the solution after a finite time, and similar odd
comportments. For the full dynamical equation of motion, we find kink
(traveling wave) solutions which cannot reach their assigned asymptotic limit.
