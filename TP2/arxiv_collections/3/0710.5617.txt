We study the effect of Coulomb interaction on the few-electron dynamics in
coupled semiconductor quantum dots by exact diagonalization of the few-body
Hamiltonian. The oscillation of carriers is strongly affected by the number of
confined electrons and by the strength of the interdot correlations.
Single-frequency oscillations are found for either uncorrelated or highly
correlated states, while multi-frequency oscillations take place in the
intermediate regime. Moreover, Coulomb interaction renders few-particle
oscillations sensitive to perturbations in spatial directions other than that
of the tunneling, contrary to the single-particle case. The inclusion of
acoustic phonon scattering does not modify the carrier dynamics substantially
at short times, but can damp oscillation modes selectively at long times.
