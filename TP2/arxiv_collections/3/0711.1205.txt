Let X be a complex algebraic manifold of dimension n+1 embedded in a
sufficiently higher dimensional complex projective space, and Y a generic
hyperplane section of X. We describe the mixed Hodge structure on H^p(X-Y,C)
and the Hodge filtration of the middle primitive cohomology group H^n(Y,C)_0 of
Y in terms of rational integrals on X. (Key words: Primitive cohomology,
Rational integral of the 2nd kind, Generalized Poincare residue map, Hodge
filtration, Mixed Hodge structure)
