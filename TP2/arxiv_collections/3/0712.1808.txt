We explore the pairing properties of the one-dimensional attractive Hubbard
model in the presence of finite spin polarization. The correlation exponents
for the most important fluctuations are determined as a function of the density
and the polarization. We find that in a system with spin population imbalance,
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-type pairing at wavevector
Q=|k_{F,\uparrow}-k_{F,\downarrow}| is always dominant and there is no
Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit. We then investigate the case of weakly coupled 1D
systems and determine the region of stability of the 1D FFLO phase. This
picture is corroborated by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG)
simulations of the spatial noise correlations in uniform and trapped systems,
unambiguously revealing the presence of fermion pairs with nonzero momentum Q.
This opens up an interesting possibility for experimental studies of FFLO
states.
