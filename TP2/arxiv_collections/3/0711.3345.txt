Ensembles of random stochastic and bistochastic matrices are investigated.
While all columns of a random stochastic matrix can be chosen independently,
the rows and columns of a bistochastic matrix have to be correlated. We
evaluate the probability measure induced into the Birkhoff polytope of
bistochastic matrices by applying the Sinkhorn algorithm to a given ensemble of
random stochastic matrices. For matrices of order N=2 we derive explicit
formulae for the probability distributions induced by random stochastic
matrices with columns distributed according to the Dirichlet distribution. For
arbitrary $N$ we construct an initial ensemble of stochastic matrices which
allows one to generate random bistochastic matrices according to a distribution
locally flat at the center of the Birkhoff polytope. The value of the
probability density at this point enables us to obtain an estimation of the
volume of the Birkhoff polytope, consistent with recent asymptotic results.
