We measure the temperature dependence of the Raman spectra of metallic and
semiconducting nanotubes. We show that the different trend in metallic tubes is
due to phonon re-normalization induced by the variation in electronic
temperature, which is modeled including non-adiabatic contributions to account
for the dynamic, time dependent nature
