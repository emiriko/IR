We present explicit expressions for a large set of hierarchy wave functions
on the torus. Included are the Laughlin states, the states in the positive Jain
series, and recently observed states at e.g. $\nu = 4/11$. The techniques we
use constitute a nontrivial extension of the conformal field theory methods
developed earlier to construct the corresponding wave functions in disc
geometry.
