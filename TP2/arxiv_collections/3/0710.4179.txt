We define an entropy based on a chosen governing probability distribution. If
a certain kind of measurements follow such a distribution it also gives us a
suitable scale to study it with. This scale will appear as a link function that
is applied to the measurements. A link function can also be used to define an
alternative structure on a set. We will see that generalized entropies are
equivalent to using a different scale for the phenomenon that is studied
compared to the scale the measurements arrive on. An extensive measurement
scale is here a scale for which measurements fulfill a memoryless property. We
conclude that the alternative algebraic structure defined by the link function
must be used if we continue to work on the original scale. We derive Tsallis
entropy by using a generalized log-logistic governing distribution. Typical
applications of Tsallis entropy are related to phenomena with power-law
behaviour.
