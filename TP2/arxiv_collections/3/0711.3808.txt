G\'abor Elek introduced the notion of a hyperfinite graph family: a
collection of graphs is hypefinite if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is some
finite $k$ such that each graph $G$ in the collection can be broken into
connected components of size at most $k$ by removing a set of edges of size at
most $\epsilon|V(G)|$. We presently extend this notion to a certain
compactification of finite bounded-degree graphs, and show that if a sequence
of finite graphs converges to a hyperfinite limit, then the sequence itself is
hyperfinite.
