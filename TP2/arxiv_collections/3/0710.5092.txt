We have executed for the first time an experiment on mental observables
concluding that there exists equivalence (that is to say, quantum like
behavior) between quantum and cognitive entities.Such result has enabled us to
formulate an abstract quantum mechanical formalism that is able to describe
cognitive entities and their time dynamics.
