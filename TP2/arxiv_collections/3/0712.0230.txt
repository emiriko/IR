We rederive uncertainty relations for the angular position and momentum of a
particle on a circle by employing the exponential of the angle instead of the
angle itself, which leads to circular variance as a natural measure of
resolution. Intelligent states minimizing the uncertainty product under the
constraint of a given uncertainty in angle or in angular momentum turn out to
be given by Mathieu wave functions. We also discuss a number of physically
feasible approximations to these optimal states. The theory is applied to the
orbital angular momentum of a beam of photons and verified in an experiment
that employs computer-controlled spatial light modulators both at the state
preparation and analyzing stages.
