Among ${\cal P}$-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H ={\cal P}^{-1} H^\dagger
\cal P}$ with real spectra, the ''weakly pseudo-Hermitian" ones (i.e., those
employing non-self-adjoint ${\cal P} \neq {\cal P}^\dagger$) form a remarkable
subfamily. We list some reasons why it deserves a special attention. In
particular we show that whenever ${\cal P} \neq {\cal P}^\dagger$, the current
involutive operator of charge ${\cal C}$ gets complemented by a nonequivalent
alternative involutive quasiparity operator ${\cal Q}$. We show how, in this
language, the standard quantum mechanics is restored via the two alternative
inner products in the physical Hilbert space of states, with $<\psi_1|{\cal
PQ}|\psi_2>=< \psi_1|{\cal CP}|\psi_2>$.
