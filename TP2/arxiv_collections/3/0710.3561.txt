A method for the construction of approximate analytical expressions for the
stationary marginal densities of general stochastic search processes is
proposed. By the marginal densities, regions of the search space that with high
probability contain the global optima can be readily defined. The density
estimation procedure involves a controlled number of linear operations, with a
computational cost per iteration that grows linearly with problem size.
