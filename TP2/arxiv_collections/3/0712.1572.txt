We prove a conjecture of Milne pertaining to the existence of integral
canonical models of Shimura varieties of abelian type in arbitrary unramified
mixed characteristic $(0,p)$. As an application we prove for $p=2$ a motivic
conjecture of Milne pertaining to integral canonical models of Shimura
varieties of Hodge type.
