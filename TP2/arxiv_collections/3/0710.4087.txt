We describe recent work on the Bergman kernel of the (non-smooth) worm domain
in several complex variables. An asymptotic expansion is obtained for the
Bergman kernel. Mapping properties of the Bergman projection are studied.
Irregularity properties of the kernal at the boundary are established.
  This is an expository paper, and considerable background is provided.
Discussion of the smooth worm is also included.
