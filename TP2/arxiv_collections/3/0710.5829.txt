We compute energy distributions of three $\alpha$-particles emerging from the
decay of $^{12}$C resonances by means of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion
method combined with complex scaling. The large distance continuum properties
of the wave functions are crucial and must be accurately calculated. The
substantial changes from small to large distances determine the decay
mechanisms. We illustrate by computing the energy distributions from decays of
the $1^{+}$ and $3^-$-resonances in $^{12}$C. These states are dominated by
direct and sequential decays into the three-body continuum respectively.
