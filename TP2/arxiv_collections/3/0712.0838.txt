Macroscopic resonant tunneling between the two lowest lying states of a
bistable RF-SQUID is used to characterize noise in a flux qubit. Measurements
of the incoherent decay rate as a function of flux bias revealed a Gaussian
shaped profile that is not peaked at the resonance point, but is shifted to a
bias at which the initial well is higher than the target well. The r.m.s.
amplitude of the noise, which is proportional to the decoherence rate 1/T_2^*,
was observed to be weakly dependent on temperature below 70 mK. Analysis of
these results indicates that the dominant source of low frequency (1/f) flux
noise in this device is a quantum mechanical environment in thermal
equilibrium.
