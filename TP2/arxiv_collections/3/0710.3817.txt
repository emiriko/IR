Use of an error correction code in a given transmission channel can be
regarded as the statistical experiment. Therefore, powerful results from the
theory of comparison of experiments can be applied to compare the performances
of different error correction codes. We present results on the comparison of
block error correction codes using the representation of error correction code
as a linear experiment. In this case the code comparison is based on the
Loewner matrix ordering of respective code matrices. Next, we demonstrate the
bit-error rate code performance comparison based on the representation of the
codes as dichotomies, in which case the comparison is based on the matrix
majorization ordering of their respective equivalent code matrices.
