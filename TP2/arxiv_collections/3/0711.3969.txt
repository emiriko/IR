We report the measurements of the heat capacity of ^4He confined in
nanoporous Gelsil glass that has nanopores of 2.5-nm diameter at pressures up
to 5.3 MPa. The heat capacity has a broad peak at a temperature much higher
than the superfluid transition temperature obtained using the torsional
oscillator technique. The peak provides a definite thermodynamic evidence for
the formation of localized Bose-Einstein condensates (LBECs) on nanometer
length scales. The temperature dependence of heat capacity is well described by
the excitations of phonons and rotons, supporting the existence of LBEC.
