Heavy quarks, namely, the top and bottom quarks, may show great sensitiveness
to new physics effects. In particular, they might have unusually large electric
dipole moments. This possibility is analyzed via the corresponding one-loop
correction to the neutron electric dipole moment, $d_n$. The current
experimental limit on $d_n$ is used then to derive the uppers bounds
$|d_t|<3.06\times 10^{-15}$ e-cm, $|d_b|<1.22\times 10^{-13}$ e-cm.
