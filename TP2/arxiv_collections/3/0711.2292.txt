We consider a cosmological model with bulk viscosity ($\eta$) and variable
cosmological $(\Lambda\propto \rho^{-\alpha}, \alpha=\rm const.$) and
gravitational ($G$) constants. The model exhibits many interesting cosmological
features. Inflation proceeds du to the presence of bulk viscosity and dark
energy without requiring the equation of state $p=-\rho$. During the
inflationary era the energy density ($\rho$) does not remain constant, as in
the de-Sitter type. Moreover, the cosmological and gravitational constants
increase exponentially with time, whereas the energy density and viscosity
decrease exponentially with time. The rate of mass creation during inflation is
found to be very huge suggesting that all matter in the universe was created
during inflation.
