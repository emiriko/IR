The present approach to SERS does not rely on a hihj electrical conductivity
substrate or admixture to enable the SERS process. The novelty of our method is
to create an artificial periodic electron distribution on a surface by
illumination with ultraviolet radiation whose photon energy is above the
photoelectric work function of the material.
