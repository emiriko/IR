We propose a method for computing any Gelfand-Dickey tau function living in
Segal-Wilson Grassmannian as the asymptotics of block Toeplitz determinant
associated to a certain class of symbols. Also truncated block Toeplitz
determinants associated to the same symbols are shown to be tau function for
rational reductions of KP. Connection with Riemann-Hilbert problems is
investigated both from the point of view of integrable systems and block
Toeplitz operator theory. Examples of applications to algebro-geometric
solutions are given.
