We study a coevolution voter model on a network that evolves according to the
state of the nodes. In a single update, a link between opposite-state nodes is
rewired with probability $p$, while with probability $1-p$ one of the nodes
takes its neighbor's state. A mean-field approximation reveals an absorbing
transition from an active to a frozen phase at a critical value
$p_c=\frac{\mu-2}{\mu-1}$ that only depends on the average degree $\mu$ of the
network. The approach to the final state is characterized by a time scale that
diverges at the critical point as $\tau \sim |p_c-p|^{-1}$. We find that the
active and frozen phases correspond to a connected and a fragmented network
respectively. We show that the transition in finite-size systems can be seen as
the sudden change in the trajectory of an equivalent random walk at the
critical rewiring rate $p_c$, highlighting the fact that the mechanism behind
the transition is a competition between the rates at which the network and the
state of the nodes evolve.
