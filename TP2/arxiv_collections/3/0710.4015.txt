A method is proposed to construct a new extended KP hierarchy, which includes
two types of KP equation with self-consistent sources and admits reductions to
k-constrained KP hierarchy and to Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy with sources. It
provides a general way to construct soliton equations with sources and their
Lax representations.
