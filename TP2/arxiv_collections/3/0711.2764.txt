It is known that a generalized $q$-Schur algebra may be constructed as a
quotient of a quantized enveloping algebra $\UU$ or its modified form
$\dot{\UU}$. On the other hand, we show here that both $\UU$ and $\dot{\UU}$
may be constructed within an inverse limit of a certain inverse system of
generalized $q$-Schur algebras. Working within the inverse limit $\hat{\UU}$
clarifies the relation between $\dot{\UU}$ and $\UU$. This inverse limit is a
$q$-analogue of the linear dual $R[G]^*$ of the coordinate algebra of a
corresponding linear algebraic group $G$.
