We present an intuitive geometrical entanglement criterion. It allows
formulation of simple and experimentally friendly sufficient conditions for
entanglement. The conditions are illustrated with several examples. Moreover, a
generalization of our approach is a necessary and sufficient separability
condition. It can be associated with a family of entanglement identifiers,
which is strictly richer than the family of entanglement witnesses.
