This note presents constraints on Standard Model parameters using published
and preliminary precision electroweak results measured at the electron-positron
colliders LEP and SLC. The results are compared with precise electroweak
measurements from other experiments, notably CDF and D{\O}at the Tevatron.
Constraints on the input parameters of the Standard Model are derived from the
results obtained in high-$Q^2$ interactions, and used to predict results in
low-$Q^2$ experiments, such as atomic parity violation, M{\o}ller scattering,
and neutrino-nucleon scattering.
