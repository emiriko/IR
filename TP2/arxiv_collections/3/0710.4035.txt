In the case of two degree system the pairs of quadratic in momenta
Hamiltonians commuting according the standard Poisson bracket are considered.
The new many-parametrical families of such pairs are founded. The universal
method of constructing the full solution of Hamilton - Jacobi equation in terms
of integrals on some algebraic curve is proposed. For some examples this curve
is non-hyperelliptic covering over the elliptic curve.
