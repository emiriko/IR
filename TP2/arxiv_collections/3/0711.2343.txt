We propose a technique for measuring the state of a single donor electron
spin using a field-effect transistor induced two-dimensional electron gas and
electrically detected magnetic resonance techniques. The scheme is facilitated
by hyperfine coupling to the donor nucleus. We analyze the potential
sensitivity and outline experimental requirements. Our measurement provides a
single-shot, projective, and quantum non-demolition measurement of an
electron-encoded qubit state.
