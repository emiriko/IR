The premise of an organizing quadratic hierarchy rule in lepton-quark flavor
physics was used earlier for explanation of the hierarchy patterns of four
generic pairs of flavor quantities 1) charged-lepton and 2) neutrino deviations
from mass-degeneracy, 3) deviations of lepton mixing from maximal magnitude and
4) deviations of quark mixing from minimal one. Here it is shown that the
quadratic hierarchy equation that is uniquely related to three flavor particle
generations may have yet another important function. It determines two
complementary values of the Dirac CP-violating phases in the quark and neutrino
mixing matrices without involvement of any empirical parameters. If confirmed
by accurate experimental data, it means a discovery of an explicit CP-violation
source in elementary particle mixing matrices and a single source of
CP-violation at least in the quark mass matrix phenomenology.
