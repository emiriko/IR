GLISSANDO is a Glauber Monte-Carlo generator for early-stages of relativistic
heavy-ion collisions, written in c++ and interfaced to Root. Several models are
implemented: the wounded-nucleon model, the binary collisions model, the mixed
model, and the model with hot-spots. Subtleties of the distribution of nucleon
in the nucleus are discussed. The original geometric distribution of sources in
the transverse plane can be superimposed with a statistical distribution
simulating the dispersion in the generated transverse energy in each individual
collision. The program generates inter alia the fixed axes (standard) and
variable-axes (participant) two-dimensional profiles of the density of sources
in the transverse plane and their Fourier components. These profiles can be
used in further analyses of physical phenomena, such as the the jet quenching,
event-by-event hydrodynamics, or analysis of the elliptic flow and its
fluctuations. Characteristics of the event (multiplicities, eccentricities,
Fourier coefficients, etc.) are evaluated and stored in a file for further
off-line studies. A number of scripts is provided for that purpose. Supplied
variants of the code can also be used for the proton-nucleus and
deuteron-nucleus collisions.
