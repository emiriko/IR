Fitting models for non-Poisson point processes is complicated by the lack of
tractable models for much of the data. By using large samples of independent
and identically distributed realizations and statistical learning, it is
possible to identify absence of fit through finding a classification rule that
can efficiently identify single realizations of each type. The method requires
a much wider range of descriptive statistics than are currently in use, and a
new concept of model fitting which is derive from how physical laws are judged
to fit data.
