What are the orbital angular momentum correlations between spatially
entangled photon pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion? We
show that the answer to this question can be given in two alternative, although
complementary, ways. The answer posed in this letter explains satisfactorily
the seemingly contradictory results obtained in different experiments, and
theoretical approaches.
