We study the thermodynamic properties and the phase diagrams of a multi-spin
antiferromagnetic spherical spin-glass model using the replica method. It is a
two-sublattice version of the ferromagnetic spherical p-spin glass model. We
consider both the replica-symmetric and the one-step replica-symmetry-breaking
solutions, the latter being the most general solution for this model. We find
paramagnetic, spin-glass, antiferromagnetic and mixed or glassy
antiferromagnetic phases. The phase transitions are always of second order in
the thermodynamic sense, but the spin-glass order parameter may undergo a
discontinuous change.
