In quantum information science, the phase of a wavefunction plays an
important role in encoding information. While most experiments in this field
rely on dynamic effects to manipulate this information, an alternative approach
is to use geometric phase, which has been argued to have potential fault
tolerance. We demonstrate the controlled accumulation of a geometric phase,
Berry's phase, in a superconducting qubit, manipulating the qubit geometrically
using microwave radiation, and observing the accumulated phase in an
interference experiment. We find excellent agreement with Berry's predictions,
and also observe a geometry dependent contribution to dephasing.
