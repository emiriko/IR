We have found that in the MSSM, the possibility for the lightest CP-even
Higgs boson to be lighter than $Z$ boson (as low as about 60 GeV) is, contrary
to the usual belief, not yet excluded by LEP2 Higgs search nor any direct
searches for supersymmetric particles at high energy colliders. The Light Higgs
boson scenario (LHS) is realised when the $ZZh$ coupling and the decay
branching ratio ${\rm Br}(h/A\to b\bar{b})$ are simultaneously suppressed as a
result of generic supersymmetric loop corrections. Consequently, the $W^\pm
H^\mp h$ coupling has to be large due to the sum rule of Higgs couplings to
weak gauge bosons and as we demonstrate, the associate neutral and charged
Higgs boson production process, $pp\to H^\pm h (A)$, at the LHC can completely
probe the LHS.
