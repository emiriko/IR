Suggestion of physics laboratory exercises and discussion of the physics
laboratory curricula for engineering majors where the properties of light and
electromagnetic waves are studied in parallel. It is shown that one of the
important educational advantages of an experimental study of the properties of
microwaves as an example of electromagnetic waves simultaneously with the
properties of light are, on one hand, visualization of the properties of
microwaves, and on the other hand, provide evidences that light is an
electromagnetic wave.
