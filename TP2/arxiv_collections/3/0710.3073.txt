Medium-induced gluon radiation is usually identified as the dominant
dynamical mechanism underling the {\it jet quenching} phenomenon observed in
heavy-ion collisions. In its actual implementation, multiple medium-induced
gluon emissions are assumed to be independent, leading, in the eikonal
approximation, to a Poisson distribution. Here, we introduce a medium term in
the splitting probabilities so that both medium and vacuum contributions are
included on the same footing in a DGLAP approach. The improvements include
energy-momentum conservation at each individual splitting, medium-modified
virtuality evolution and a coherent implementation of vacuum and medium
splitting probabilities. Noticeably, the usual formalism is recovered when the
virtuality and the energy of the parton are very large. This leads to a similar
description of the suppression observed in heavy-ion collisions with values of
the transport coefficient of the same order as those obtained using the {\it
quenching weights}.
