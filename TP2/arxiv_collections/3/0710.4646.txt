In this paper is proposed a technique to integrate and simulate a dynamic
memory in a multiprocessor framework based on C/C++/SystemC. Using host
machine's memory management capabilities, dynamic data processing is supported
without compromising speed and accuracy of the simulation. A first prototype in
a shared memory context is presented.
