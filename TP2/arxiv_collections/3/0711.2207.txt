Thermal fluctuations in time-dependent quantum processes are treated by a
constant-temperature generalization of Wigner's formulation of quantum
mechanics in phase space. To this end, quantum Nos\`e-Hoover dynamics is
defined by generalizing the Moyal bracket. Computational applications of the
formalism, together with further theoretical developments, are discussed.
