We study the regularity of the Green currents and of the equilibrium measure
associated to a horizontal-like map in C^k, under a natural assumption on the
dynamical degrees. We estimate the speed of convergence towards the Green
currents, the decay of correlations for the equilibrium measure and the
Lyapounov exponents. We show in particular that the equilibrium measure is
hyperbolic. We also show that the Green currents are the unique invariant
vertical and horizontal positive closed currents. The results apply, in
particular, to Henon-like maps, to regular polynomial automorphisms of C^k and
to their small pertubations.
