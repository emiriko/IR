We present a program that implements the OPP reduction method to extract the
coefficients of the one-loop scalar integrals from a user defined
(sub)-amplitude or Feynman Diagram, as well as the rational terms coming from
the 4-dimensional part of the numerator. The rational pieces coming from the
epsilon-dimensional part of the numerator are treated as an external input, and
can be computed with the help of dedicated tree-level like Feynman rules.
  Possible numerical instabilities are dealt with the help of arbitrary
precision routines, that activate only when needed.
