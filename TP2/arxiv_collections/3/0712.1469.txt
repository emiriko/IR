We investigate the spectrum of the free Neuberger-Dirac operator $\Dov$ on
the Schr\"odinger functional (SF). We check that the lowest few eigen-values of
the Hermitian operator $\Dov^{\dag}\Dov$ in unit of $L^{-2}$ converge to the
continuum limit properly. We also perform a one-loop calculation of the SF
coupling, and then check the universality and investigate lattice artifacts of
the step scaling function. It turns out that the lattice artifacts for the
Neuberger-Dirac operator are comparable in those of the clover action.
