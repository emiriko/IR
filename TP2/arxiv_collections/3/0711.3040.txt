Disorder in point patterns can be quantified by means of the complexity,
rather than in terms of geometric attributes of pattern structure. A
complexity-based disorder-quantifying statistic indicates the practical
difficulties associated with modeling processes that produce jammed patterns,
particularly with the assessment of model fit and with the simulation of
high-intensity hard-core patterns.
