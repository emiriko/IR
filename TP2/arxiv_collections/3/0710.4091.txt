Here we update the predictions for lepton flavour violating tau and muon
decays, $l_j \to l_i \gamma$, $l_j \to 3 l_i$, and $\mu-e$ conversion in
nuclei. We work within a SUSY-seesaw context where the particle content of the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is extended by three right handed
neutrinos plus their corresponding SUSY partners, and where a seesaw mechanism
for neutrino mass generation is implemented. Two different scenarios with
either universal or non-universal soft supersymmetry breaking Higgs masses at
the gauge coupling unification scale are considered. After comparing the
predictions with present experimental bounds and future sensitivities, the most
promising processes are particularly emphasised.
