In nuclear power generation, fissile materials are mainly used. For example,
$U^{235}$ is fissile and therefore quite essential for use of nuclear energy.
However, the material $U^{235}$ has very small natural abundance less than 1 %.
We should seek possibility of utilizing fissionable materials such as $U^{238}$
because natural abundance of such fissionable materials is generally much
larger than fissile ones. In this paper, we show that thermal neutrons with
vanishing kinetic energy can induce nuclear fission when high voltage is
applied to fissionable materials. To obtain this result, we use the liquid-drop
model for nuclei. Finally, we propose how fissionable materials can be
utilized.
