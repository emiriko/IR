We investigate the standard susceptible-infected-susceptible model on a
random network to study the effects of preference and geography on diseases
spreading. The network grows by introducing one random node with $m$ links on a
Euclidean space at unit time. The probability of a new node $i$ linking to a
node $j$ with degree $k_j$ at distance $d_{ij}$ from node $i$ is proportional
to $k_{j}^{A}/d_{ij}^{B}$, where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants governing
preferential attachment and the cost of the node-node distance. In the case of
A=0, we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a critical threshold below
which diseases eventually die out. Whereas for B=0, the critical behavior is
absent only in the condition A=1. While both ingredients are proposed
simultaneously, the network becomes robust to infection for larger $A$ and
smaller $B$.
