We study the correlation in azimuthal angle between Mueller-Navelet jets
produced in hadron-hadron collisions. We argue that this observable would test
the BFKL approach at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. In order to motivate
such a measurement, we give predictions for jets separated by large rapidity
intervals within the Tevatron and LHC ranges.
