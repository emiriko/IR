William Kruskal (Bill) was a distinguished statistician who spent virtually
his entire professional career at the University of Chicago, and who had a
lasting impact on the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and on the field of
statistics more broadly, as well as on many who came in contact with him. Bill
passed away last April following an extended illness, and on May 19, 2005, the
University of Chicago held a memorial service at which several of Bill's
colleagues and collaborators spoke along with members of his family and other
friends. This biography and the accompanying commentaries derive in part from
brief presentations on that occasion, along with recollections and input from
several others. Bill was known personally to most of an older generation of
statisticians as an editor and as an intellectual and professional leader. In
1994, Statistical Science published an interview by Sandy Zabell (Vol. 9,
285--303) in which Bill looked back on selected events in his professional
life. One of the purposes of the present biography and accompanying
commentaries is to reintroduce him to old friends and to introduce him for the
first time to new generations of statisticians who never had an opportunity to
interact with him and to fall under his influence.
