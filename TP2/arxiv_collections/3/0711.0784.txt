In October 2007, a Research Proposal for the University of Sydney, Australia,
the author suggested that biovie-physical phenomenon as `electrodynamic
dependant biological vision', is governed by relativistic quantum laws and
biovision. The phenomenon on the basis of `biovielectroluminescence', satisfies
man/microbio/megabio/computer vision (MMMCV), as a robust candidate for
physical and visual sciences. The general aim of this addendum is to present a
refined text of Sections 1-3 of that proposal and highlighting the contents of
its Appendix in form of a `Mechanisms' Section. We then briefly remind in an
article aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section
3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the
phenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant
role in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis
3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410]. It also expresses the time
concept in terms of causing quantized energy f(|E|) of time |t|, emit in regard
to shortening the probability of particle loci as predictable patterns of
particle's un-occurred motion, a solution to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
(HUP) into a simplistic manner. We conclude that, practical frames via a time
algorithm to this model, fixates such predictable patterns of motion of scenery
bodies onto recordable observation points of a MMMCV system. It even
suppresses/predicts superposition phenomena coming from a human subject and/or
other bio-subjects for any decision making event, e.g., brainwave quantum
patterns based on vision. Maintaining the existential probability of Riemann
surfaces of II-time scenarios in the context of biovielectroluminescence, makes
motion-prediction a possibility.
