We report a large entropy change (DeltaS) below 300 K, peaking near TC= 220
K, due to isothermal change of magnetic field, for Gd4Co3, with a refrigeration
capacity higher than that of Gd. Notably, the isothermal magnetization is
nonhysteretic - an important criterion for magnetic refrigeration without loss.
DeltaS behavior is also compared with that of magnetoresistance.
