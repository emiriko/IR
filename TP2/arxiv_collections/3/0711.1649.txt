Group theoretic method for the systematic study of multi-quark states is
developed. The calculation of matrix elements of many body Hamiltonian is
simplified by transforming the physical bases (quark cluster bases) to symmetry
bases (group chain classified bases), where the fractional parentage expansion
method can be used. Five quark system is taken as example in this study. The
Jaffe-Wilczek $qq-qq-\bar{q}$ configuration is chosen as one of examples to
construct the physical bases and the transformation coefficients between
physical bases and symmetry ones are shown to be related to the
${SU}_{mn}\supset{SU}_m\times{SU}_n$ isoscalar factors and a complete
transformation coefficients table is given. The needed isoscalar factors and
fractional parentage coefficients had been calculated with our new group
representation theory and published before. Three quark models, the naive
Glashow-Isgur, Salamanca and quark delocalization color screening, are used to
show the general applicability of the new multi-quark calculation method and
general results of constituent quark models for five-quark states are given.
