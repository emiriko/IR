We study thermal effects for a noncommutative real scalar field in 2+1
dimensions including a Grosse-Wulkenhaar term. Using a perturbative expansion
for the free energy, we deduce some general properties of the corresponding
contributions, in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the model can be
consistently interpreted as defined on a finite volume, which is naturally
determined by the noncommutativity scale.
