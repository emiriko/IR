This short paper is intended as an additional progress report to share our
experiences in Indonesia on collecting, integrating and disseminating both
global and local scientific data across the country through the web technology.
Our recent efforts are exerted on improving the local public access to global
scientific data, and on the other hand encouraging the local scientific data to
be more accessible for the global communities. We have maintained
well-connected infrastructure and some web-based information management systems
to realize such objectives. This paper is especially focused on introducing the
ARSIP for mirroring global as well as sharing local scientific data, and the
newly developed Indonesian Scientific Index for integrating local scientific
data through an automated intelligent indexing system.
