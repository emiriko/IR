We study the case of two polaritonic qubits localized in two separate
cavities coupled by a fiber/additional cavity. We show that surprisingly
enough, even a coherent classical pump in the intermediate cavity/fiber can
lead to the creation of entanglement between the two ends in the steady state.
The stationary nature of this entanglement and its survival under dissipation
opens possibilities for its production under realistic laboratory conditions.
To facilitate the verification of the entanglement in an experiment we also
construct the relevant entanglement witness measurable by accessing only a few
local variables of each polaritonic qubit.
