A low complexity computational model of the current-voltage characteristics
for graphene nano-ribbon (GNR) field effect transistors (FET), able to simulate
a hundred of points in few seconds using a PC, is presented. For quantum
capacitance controlled devices, self-consistent calculations of the
electrostatic potential can be skipped. Instead, analytical closed-form
electrostatic potential from Laplace's equation yields accurate results
compared with that obtained by self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green's
Functions (NEGF) method. The model includes both tunnelling current through the
Schottky barrier (SB) at the contact interfaces and thermionic current above
the barrier, properly capturing the effect of arbitrary physical and electrical
parameters.
