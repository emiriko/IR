Modular decomposition is fundamental for many important problems in
algorithmic graph theory including transitive orientation, the recognition of
several classes of graphs, and certain combinatorial optimization problems.
Accordingly, there has been a drive towards a practical, linear-time algorithm
for the problem. Despite considerable effort, such an algorithm has remained
elusive. The linear-time algorithms to date are impractical and of mainly
theoretical interest. In this paper we present the first simple, linear-time
algorithm to compute the modular decomposition tree of an undirected graph. The
breakthrough comes by combining the best elements of two different approaches
to the problem.
