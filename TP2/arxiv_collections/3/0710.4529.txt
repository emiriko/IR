We study flavor violation in a supersymmetric SU(5) grand unification
scenario in a model-independent way employing mass insertions. We examine how
the quark and the lepton sector observables restrict sfermion mixings. In many
cases, a lepton flavor violating process provides a stringent constraint on the
flavor structure of right-handed down-type squarks. In particular, mu -> e
gamma turns out to be highly susceptible to the 1-3 and 2-3 mixings thereof,
due to the radiative correction from the top Yukawa coupling to the scalar mass
terms of 10. We also discuss projected sensitivity of forthcoming experiments,
and ways to maintain the power of leptonic restrictions even after
incorporating a solution to fix the incorrect quark-lepton mass relations.
