We prove that Wigner functions contain a symplectic connection. The latter
covariantises the symplectic exterior derivative on phase space. We analyse the
role played by this connection and introduce the notion of local symplectic
covariance of quantum-mechanical states. This latter symmetry is at work in the
Schroedinger equation on phase space.
