I classify all cohomological 2D field theories based on a semi-simple complex
Frobenius algebra A. They are controlled by a linear combination of
kappa-classes and by an extension datum to the Deligne-Mumford boundary. Their
effect on the Gromov-Witten potential is described by Givental's Fock space
formulae. This leads to the reconstruction of Gromov-Witten invariants from the
quantum cup-product at a single semi-simple point and from the first Chern
class, confirming Givental's higher-genus reconstruction conjecture. The proof
uses the Mumford conjecture proved by Madsen and Weiss.
