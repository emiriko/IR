Application of the differential method (also called the C method) to
plane-wave diffraction by a perfectly conducting, sinusoidally corrugated
metallic grating coated with a linear, homogeneous, isotropic, lossless
dielectric-magnetic material shows that coating materials with negative index
of refraction may deliver enhanced maximum nonspecular reflection efficiencies
in comparison to coating materials with positive index of refraction.
