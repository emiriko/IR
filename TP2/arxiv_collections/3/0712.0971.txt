The electromagnetic form factors calculated through Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter
amplitude and through the light-front wave function are compared with the one
found using the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude in Minkowski space. The form factor
expressed through the Euclidean Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (both within and
without static approximation) considerably differs from the Minkowski one,
whereas form factor found in the light-front approach is almost
indistinguishable from it.
