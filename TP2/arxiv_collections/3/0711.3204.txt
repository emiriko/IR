We generalize the fractional quantum Hall hierarchy picture to apply to
arbitrary, possibly non-Abelian, fractional quantum Hall states. Applying this
to the nu = 5/2 Moore-Read state, we construct new explicit trial wavefunctions
to describe the fractional quantum Hall effect in the second Landau level. The
resulting hierarchy of states, which reproduces the filling fractions of all
observed Hall conductance plateaus in the second Landau level, is characterized
by electron pairing in the ground state and an excitation spectrum that
includes non-Abelian anyons of the Ising type. We propose this as a unifying
picture in which p-wave pairing characterizes the fractional quantum Hall
effect in the second Landau level.
