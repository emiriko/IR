A quantitative evaluation of dilepton sources in heavy-ion reactions is
performed taking into account both thermal and non-thermal production
mechanisms. The hadronic thermal emission rate is based on an electromagnetic
current-correlation function with a low-mass region (LMR, M \lsim 1 GeV)
dominated by vector mesons (\rho, \omega, \phi) and an intermediate-mass region
(IMR, 1 GeV \le M \le 3 GeV) characterized by (the onset of) a multi-meson
continuum. A convolution of the emission rates over a thermal fireball
expansion results in good agreement with experiment in the low-mass spectra,
confirming the predicted broadening of the \rho meson in hadronic matter in
connection with the prevalence of baryon-induced medium effects. The absolute
magnitude of the LMR excess is mostly controlled by the fireball lifetime,
which in turn leads to a consistent explanation of the dilepton excess in the
IMR in terms of thermal radiation. The analysis of experimental
transverse-momentum (q_T) spectra reveals discrepancies with thermal emission
for q_T \gsim 1 GeV in noncentral In-In collisions, which we address by
extending our calculations by: (i) a refined treatment of \rho decays at
thermal freezeout, (ii) primordially produced \rho's subject to energy-loss,
(iii) Drell-Yan annihilation, and (iv) thermal radiation from t-channel meson
exchange processes. We investigate the sensitivity of dilepton spectra to the
critical temperature and hadro-chemical freezeout of the fireball. The \rho
broadening in the LMR turns out to be robust, while in the IMR Quark-Gluon
Plasma radiation is moderate unless the critical temperature is rather low.
