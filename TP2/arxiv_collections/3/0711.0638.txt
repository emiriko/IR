We show that the $N$-photon generalized binomial states of electromagnetic
field may be put in a bijective mapping with the coherent atomic states of $N$
two-level atoms. We exploit this correspondence to simply obtain both known and
new properties of the $N$-photon generalized binomial states. In particular, an
over-complete basis of these binomial states and an orthonormal basis are
obtained. Finally, the squeezing properties of generalized binomial state are
analyzed.
