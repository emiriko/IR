We propose a new implementation of medium effects in jet structures in which
a modification of the splitting function is included at every step in the
typical final state parton shower. Although the main application of this new
formalism will be at the LHC, it is interesting that, in the presence of a
trigger bias to small number of splittings, non-trivial angular dependences
could appear with shapes similar to those measured experimentally at RHIC in
high-pT particle correlations.
