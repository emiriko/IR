We revisit our earlier proposal for the form of the neutrino mass matrix: a
two-zero ansatz wherein the CP-violating PMNS phase $\delta$ plays a
surprisingly important role. We review its observable consequences and show how
our ansatz follows from a softly-broken symmetry (muon number minus tau lepton
number) in a see-saw model with three Higgs doublets.
