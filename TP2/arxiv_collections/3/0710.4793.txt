Complex real-time control system is a software dense and algorithms dense
system, which needs modern software engineering techniques to design. UML is an
object-oriented industrial standard modeling language, used more and more in
real-time domain. This paper first analyses the advantages and problems of
using UML for real-time control systems design. Then, it proposes an extension
of UML-RT to support time-continuous subsystems modeling. So we can unify
modeling of complex real-time control systems on UML-RT platform, from
requirement analysis, model design, simulation, until generation code.
