The spin-exchange effect in spin-polarized electron collisions with
unpolarized open-shell molecules, O$_2$, B$_2$, S$_2$ and Si$_2$, has been
studied by the R-matrix method with the fixed-bond approximation. All of these
molecules have ${}^3 \Sigma_{g}^{-}$ symmetry in their ground states. Usual
integrated cross sections with unpolarized electrons has also been studied. We
used the complete active space self consistent field orbitals and put more than
10 target electronic states in the R-matrix models. In electron O$_2$ elastic
collisions, calculated polarization fractions agree well with the experimental
results, especially around the ${}^4 \Sigma_u^-$ resonance. In e-B$_2$, S$_2$
and Si$_2$ elastic collisions, larger spin-exchange effect is observed compared
to the e-O$_2$ elastic collisions. In all four cases, spin-exchange effect
becomes prominent near resonances. This association of resonance and magnitude
of the spin-exchange effect was studied by explicitly removing the resonance
configurations from the R-matrix calculations. In general, spin-exchange effect
is larger in e-B$_2$ collisions than in e-S$_2$ and Si$_2$ collisions, and is
smallest in e-O$_2$ collisions.
