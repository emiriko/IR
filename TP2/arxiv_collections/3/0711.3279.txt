This paper introduces a new feedback topology for the Pulsed Digital
Oscillator (PDO) and compares it to the classical topology. The `classic' or
single feedback topology, introduced in previous works, shows a strong behavior
dependence on the damping losses in the MEMS resonator. A new double feedback
topology is introduced here in order to help solving this problem. Comparative
discrete-time simulations and preliminary experimental measurements have been
carried out for both topologies, showing how the new double feedback topology
may increase PDO performance for some frequency ranges.
