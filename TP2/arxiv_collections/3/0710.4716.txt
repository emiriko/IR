FPGAs, as computing devices, offer significant speedup over microprocessors.
Furthermore, their configurability offers an advantage over traditional ASICs.
However, they do not yet enjoy high-level language programmability, as
microprocessors do. This has become the main obstacle for their wider
acceptance by application designers. ROCCC is a compiler designed to generate
circuits from C source code to execute on FPGAs, more specifically on CSoCs. It
generates RTL level HDLs from frequently executing kernels in an application.
In this paper, we describe ROCCC's system overview and focus on its data path
generation. We compare the performance of ROCCC-generated VHDL code with that
of Xilinx IPs. The synthesis result shows that ROCCC-generated circuit takes
around 2x ~ 3x area and runs at comparable clock rate.
