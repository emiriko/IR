We have explored the nonlinear dynamics of an optomechanical system
consisting of an illuminated Fabry-Perot cavity, one of whose end-mirrors is
attached to a vibrating cantilever. Such a system can experience negative
light-induced damping and enter a regime of self-induced oscillations. We
present a systematic experimental and theoretical study of the ensuing
attractor diagram describing the nonlinear dynamics, in an experimental setup
where the oscillation amplitude becomes large, and the mirror motion is
influenced by several optical modes. A theory has been developed that yields
detailed quantitative agreement with experimental results. This includes the
observation of a regime where two mechanical modes of the cantilever are
excited simultaneously.
