By considering the specialisation $s_{\lambda}(1,q,q^2,...,q^{n-1})$ of the
Schur function, Stanley was able to describe a formula for the number of
semistandard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ in terms of two properties of
the boxes in the diagram for $\lambda$. Using specialisations of symplectic and
orthogonal Schur functions, we derive corresponding formulae, first given by El
Samra and King, for the number of semistandard symplectic and orthogonal
$\lambda$-tableaux.
