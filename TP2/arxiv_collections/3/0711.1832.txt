In a previous work [L.Delle Site, J.Phys.A 40, 2787 (2007)] the derivation of
an analytic expression for the kinetic functional of a many-body electron
system has been proposed. Though analytical, the formula is still non local
(multidimensional) and thus not ideal for numerical applications. In this work,
by treating the test case of a uniform gas of interacting spinless electrons,
we propose a computational protocol which combines the previous analytic
results with the Monte Carlo (MC) sampling of electronic configurations in
space. This, we show, leads to an internally consistent scheme to design well
founded local kinetic functionals.
