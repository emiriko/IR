Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is important in
neurological disorders. Neuroinflammation is associated with increased BBB
breakdown and brain injury. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is involved in BBB
injury and edema formation through a mechanism involving matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) upregulation. There is emerging evidence indicating
that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition limits BBB disruption following ischemic
stroke and bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms involved are not known. We
used intracerebral injection of TNF-a to study the effect of COX inhibition on
TNF-a-induced BBB breakdown, MMP expression/activity and oxidative stress. BBB
disruption was evaluated by the uptake of 14C-sucrose into the brain and by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing Gd-DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast
agent. Using selective inhibitors of each COX isoform, we found that COX-1
activity is more important than COX-2 in BBB opening. TNF-a induced a
significant upregulation of gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and
COX-2. In addition, TNF-a significantly depleted glutathione as compared to
saline. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, reduced
BBB damage at 24 h. Indomethacin significantly attenuated MMP-9 and MMP-3
expression and activation, and prevented the loss of endogenous radical
scavenging capacity following intracerebral injection of TNF-a. Our results
show for the first time that BBB disruption during neuroinflammation can be
significantly reduced by administration of COX inhibitors. Modulation of COX in
brain injury by COX inhibitors or agents modulating prostaglandin E2
formation/signaling may be useful in clinical settings associated with BBB
disruption.
