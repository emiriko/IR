Wind-blown sand, or "saltation," is an important geological process, and the
primary source of atmospheric dust aerosols. Significant discrepancies exist
between classical saltation theory and measurements. We show here that these
discrepancies can be resolved by the inclusion of sand electrification in a
physically based saltation model. Indeed, we find that electric forces enhance
the concentration of saltating particles and cause them to travel closer to the
surface, in agreement with measurements. Our results thus indicate that sand
electrification plays an important role in saltation.
