In the left-right twin Higgs model, one of the neutral Higgses is a natural
candidate for WIMP dark matter. We analyzed the dark matter relic density in
this framework and identified regions of parameter space that provide the right
amount of dark matter. We also studied the dark matter in the more general
inert Higgs doublet model in which the mass splittings between the dark matter
and other particles do not follow the relations in the left-right twin Higgs
model.
