Invariant correlation functions for ${\rm SO}(1,N)$ hyperbolic sigma-models
are investigated. The existence of a large $N$ asymptotic expansion is proven
on finite lattices of dimension $d \geq 2$. The unique saddle point
configuration is characterized by a negative gap vanishing at least like 1/V
with the volume. Technical difficulties compared to the compact case are
bypassed using horospherical coordinates and the matrix-tree theorem.
