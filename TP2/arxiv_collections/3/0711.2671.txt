In this paper, we propose an architecture/methodology for making FPGAs
suitable for integer as well as variable precision floating point
multiplication. The proposed work will of great importance in applications
which requires variable precision floating point multiplication such as
multi-media processing applications. In the proposed architecture/methodology,
we propose the replacement of existing 18x18 bit and 25x18 bit dedicated
multipliers in FPGAs with dedicated 24x24 bit and 24x9 bit multipliers,
respectively. We have proved that our approach of providing the dedicated 24x24
bit and 24x9 bit multipliers in FPGAs will make them efficient for performing
integer as well as single precision, double precision, and Quadruple precision
floating point multiplications.
