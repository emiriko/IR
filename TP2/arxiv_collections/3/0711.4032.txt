In quantum zero knowledge, the assumption was made that the verifier is only
using unitary operations. Under this assumption, many nice properties have been
shown about quantum zero knowledge, including the fact that Honest-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (HVQSZK) is equal to Cheating-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (QSZK) (see [Wat02,Wat06]).
  In this paper, we study what happens when we allow an honest verifier to flip
some coins in addition to using unitary operations. Flipping a coin is a
non-unitary operation but doesn't seem at first to enhance the cheating
possibilities of the verifier since a classical honest verifier can flip coins.
In this setting, we show an unexpected result: any classical Interactive Proof
has an Honest-Verifier Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge proof with coins.
Note that in the classical case, honest verifier SZK is no more powerful than
SZK and hence it is not believed to contain even NP. On the other hand, in the
case of cheating verifiers, we show that Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge
where the verifier applies any non-unitary operation is equal to Quantum
Zero-Knowledge where the verifier uses only unitaries.
  One can think of our results in two complementary ways. If we would like to
use the honest verifier model as a means to study the general model by taking
advantage of their equivalence, then it is imperative to use the unitary
definition without coins, since with the general one this equivalence is most
probably not true. On the other hand, if we would like to use quantum zero
knowledge protocols in a cryptographic scenario where the honest-but-curious
model is sufficient, then adding the unitary constraint severely decreases the
power of quantum zero knowledge protocols.
