We conjecture the existence of strings bounded inside walls in SU$(n)$ $\N=1$
Super Yang-Mills theory. These strings carry $\Z_{[k,n]}$ quantum number, where
$[k,n]$ is the greatest common divisor between $k$, the charge of the wall, and
$n$. We provide field-theoretical arguments and string-theoretical evidences,
both from MQCD and from gauge-gravity correspondence. We interpret this result
from the point of view of the low-energy effective action living on the
$k$-wall.
