Phenomenology of neutralino dark matter in the minimal supersymmetric model
is discussed for a scenario where the lightest Higgs boson mass is lighter than
114.4 GeV. We show that the scenario is consistent not only with many collider
experiments but also with the observed relic abundance of dark matter. The
allowed region may be probed by experiments of Bs to mu^+ mu^- in near future.
The scenario predicts a large scattering cross section between the dark matter
and ordinary matter and thus it may be tested in present direct detection
experiments of dark matter.
