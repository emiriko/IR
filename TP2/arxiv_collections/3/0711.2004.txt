The application of stress to multiphase solid-liquid systems often results in
morphological instabilities. Here we propose a solid-solid phase transformation
model for roughening instability in the interface between two porous materials
with different porosities under normal compression stresses. This instability
is triggered by a finite jump in the free energy density across the interface,
and it leads to the formation of finger-like structures aligned with the
principal direction of compaction. The model is proposed as an explanation for
the roughening of stylolites - irregular interfaces associated with the
compaction of sedimentary rocks that fluctuate about a plane perpendicular to
the principal direction of compaction.
