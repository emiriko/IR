Considering a linearly ordered set, we introduce its symmetric version, and
endow it with two operations extending supremum and infimum, so as to obtain an
algebraic structure close to a commutative ring. We show that imposing symmetry
necessarily entails non associativity, hence computing rules are defined in
order to deal with non associativity. We study in details computing rules,
which we endow with a partial order. This permits to find solutions to the
inversion formula underlying the M\"obius transform. Then we apply these
results to the case of capacities, a notion from decision theory which
corresponds, in the language of ordered sets, to order preserving mappings,
preserving also top and bottom. In this case, the solution of the inversion
formula is called the M\"obius transform of the capacity. Properties and
examples of M\"obius transform of sup-preserving and inf-preserving capacities
are given.
