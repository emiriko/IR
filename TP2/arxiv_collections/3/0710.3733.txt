The small-scale structure of a string connecting a pair of static sources is
explored for the weakly-coupled anisotropic SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)
dimensions. A crucial ingredient in the formulation of the string Hamiltonian
is the phenomenon of color smearing of the string constituents. The
quark-anti-quark potential is determined. We close with some discussion of the
standard, fully Lorentz-invariant Yang-Mills theory.
