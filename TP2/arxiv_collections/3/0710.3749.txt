Given an iterated skew polynomial ring C[y_1;t_1,d_1]ldots [y_n;t_n,d_n] over
a complete local ring C with maximal ideal m, we prove, under suitable
assumptions, that the completion at the ideal m + < y_1,y_2,ldots,y_n> is an
iterated skew power series ring. Under further conditions, this completion is a
local, noetherian, Auslander regular domain. Applicable examples include
quantum matrices, quantum symplectic spaces, and quantum Euclidean space.
