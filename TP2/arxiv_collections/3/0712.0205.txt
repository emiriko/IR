We study the roles of the dynamical high order perturbation and statistically
non-linear infrared fluctuation/correlation in the virial equation of state for
the Fermi gas in the unitary limit. Incorporating the quantum level crossing
rearrangement effects, the spontaneously generated entropy departing from the
mean-field theory formalism leads to concise thermodynamical expressions. The
dimensionless virial coefficients with complex non-local correlations are
calculated up to the fourth order for the first time. The virial coefficients
of unitary Fermi gas are found to be proportional to those of the ideal quantum
gas with integer ratios through a general term formula. Counterintuitively,
contrary to those of the ideal bosons ($a^{(0)}_2=-\frac{1}{4 \sqrt{2}}$) or
fermions($a^{(0)}_2=\frac{1}{4 \sqrt{2}}$), the second virial coefficient $a_2$
of Fermi gas at unitarity is found to be equal to zero. With the vanishing
leading order quantum correction, the BCS-BEC crossover thermodynamics
manifests the famous pure classical Boyle's law in the Boltzmann regime. The
non-Gaussian correlation phenomena can be validated by studying the
Joule-Thomson effect.
