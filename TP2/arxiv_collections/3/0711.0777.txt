The 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction plays a role in the ignition of Type I
x-ray bursts on accreting neutron stars. The lifetimes of states in 19Ne above
the 15O + alpha threshold of 3.53 MeV are important inputs to calculations of
the astrophysical reaction rate. These levels in 19Ne were populated in the
3He(20Ne,alpha)19Ne reaction at a 20Ne beam energy of 34 MeV. The lifetimes of
six states above the threshold were measured with the Doppler shift attenuation
method (DSAM). The present measurements agree with previous determinations of
the lifetimes of these states and in some cases are considerably more precise.
