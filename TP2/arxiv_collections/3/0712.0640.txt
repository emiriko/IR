The contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface is a direct measure
of fundamental atomic-scale forces acting between liquid molecules and the
solid surface. In this work, the validity is assessed of a simple equation,
which approximately relates the contact angle of a liquid on a surface to its
density, its surface tension, and the effective molecule-surface potential.
This equation is derived in the sharp-kink approximation, where the density
profile of the liquid is assumed to drop precipitously within one molecular
diameter of the substrate. It is found that this equation satisfactorily
reproduces the temperature-dependence of the contact angle for helium on alkali
metal surfaces. The equation also seems be applicable to liquids such as water
on solid surfaces such as gold and graphite, based on a comparison of predicted
and measured contact angles near room-temperature. Nevertheless, we conclude
that, to fully test the equation's applicability to fluids such as water, it
remains necessary to measure the contact angle's temperature-dependence. We
hypothesize that the effects of electrostatic forces can increase with
temperature, potentially driving the wetting temperature much higher and closer
to the critical point, or lower, closer to room temperature, than predicted
using current theories.
