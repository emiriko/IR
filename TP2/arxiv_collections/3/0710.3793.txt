A systematic study the magnetization in La0.8.MnO3 films of thickness varying
from ultra-thin to bulk-like has been conducted. The study reveals suppression
of the bulk magnetization for films up to at least 1600 A. In addition, the
surface (top 50 A) of all films exhibits depressed magnetization as observed by
x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The reduced surface magnetization is
attributed to the coexistence of magnetic and nonmagnetic components of the
same chemical composition.
