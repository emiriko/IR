We assume a triple geometric structure for the electromagnetic nuclear
interaction. This nuclear electromagnetism is used to calculate the binding
energies of the deuteron and the neutron. The corresponding Pauli quantum wave
equation in a geometric theory, with the SU(2) electromagnetic coupling instead
of the standard "minimal" coupling, contains a 1/r to-the-fourth-power,
short-range attractive magnetic potential term. This term, produced by the odd
part of the electromagnetic potential, may be responsible for a strong nuclear
interaction. An approximation for the resultant wave equation leads to the
modified Mathieu equation. Completely theoretical calculations give 2.205 Mev,
0.782 Mev and 27.6 Mev for the binding energies of the deuteron, the neutron
and the alpha particle respectively. These values admit correction factors due
to the approximations made.
