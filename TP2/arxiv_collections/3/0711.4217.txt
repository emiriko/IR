We study sequential programs that are instruction sequences with dynamically
instantiated instructions. We define the meaning of such programs in two
different ways. In either case, we give a translation by which each program
with dynamically instantiated instructions is turned into a program without
them that exhibits on execution the same behaviour by interaction with some
service. The complexity of the translations differ considerably, whereas the
services concerned are equally simple. However, the service concerned in the
case of the simpler translation is far more powerful than the service concerned
in the other case.
