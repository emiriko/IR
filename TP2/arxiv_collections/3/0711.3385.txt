For autonomous Lotka-Volterra systems of differential equations modelling the
dynamics of n competing species, new criteria are established for the existence
of a single point global attractor. Under the conditions of these criteria,
some of the species will survive and stabilise at a steady state whereas the
others, if any, will die out.
