Adsorption of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen on the (111) surface of
delta-Plutonium has been studied within the framework of density functional
theory using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave plus local basis
(FP-LAPW+lo) method. All adatoms prefer to bind at the higher coordinated
hollow sites, with the chemisorption energies for C, N, and O being 6.539 eV,
6.714 eV, and 8.2 eV respectively. The work function and the surface Pu
magnetic moments respectively increased and decreased in all cases upon
chemisorption. The partial charges inside the muffin tins spheres, difference
charge density distributions, and the local density of states have been used to
analyze the Pu-adatom bond interactions.
