We construct a supersymmetric version of the ``critical'' non-relativistic
bosonic string theory\cite{Kim:2007hb} with its manifest global symmetry. We
introduce the anticommuting $bc$ CFT which is the super partner of the
$\beta\gamma$ CFT. The conformal weights of the $b$ and $c$ fields are both
1/2. The action of the fermionic sector can be transformed into that of the
relativistic superstring theory. We explicitly quantize the theory with
manifest SO(8) symmetry and find that the spectrum is similar to that of Type
IIB superstring theory. There is one notable difference: the fermions are
non-chiral. We further consider ``noncritical'' generalizations of the
supersymmetric theory using the superspace formulation. There is an infinite
range of possible string theories similar to the supercritical string theories.
We comment on the connection between the critical non-relativistic string
theory and the lightlike Linear Dilaton theory.
