The quadratic divergences caused by Yukawa interactions in the standard
theory of elementary particle physics is shown to be removed by introducing
finite-mass complex-ghost regulator fields. In this modification of the
standard theory, its manifest covariance, renormalizability, gauge invariance
and unitarity are retained, and no new observable particles are introduced.
