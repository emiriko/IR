A family of spherical non-Hermitian potentials is studied. It is shown that
the corresponding non-Hermitian Hamiltonians admit some "new"
P$phi$T$phi$-symmetry. It is observed that whilst such P$phi$T$phi$-symmetric
Hamiltonians just copy the eigenvalues of V(r), the corresponding wavefunctions
would rather indulge some new probabilistic interpretations due to the change
in the azimuthal part.
