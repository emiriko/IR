The gluon-gluon-higgs amplitude is investigated in the context of 5D models
of gauge-higgs unification. A simple algorithm allows to include, in a fully
analytical way, the contribution of the whole Kaluza-Klein tower of a 5D quark
to the amplitude. This algorithm is applied to realistic models based on SO(5)
symmetry. Within the studied classes of models, the higgs production cross
section is always suppressed.
