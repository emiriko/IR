We study the BCS-BEC crossover in the strongly correlated regime of an
ultra-cold rotating two component Fermi gas. Strong correlations are shown to
generate an additional long-range interaction which results in a modified
crossover region compared to the non-rotating situation. The two-particle
correlation function reveals a smooth crossover between the s-wave paired
fermionic fractional quantum Hall state and the bosonic Laughlin state.
