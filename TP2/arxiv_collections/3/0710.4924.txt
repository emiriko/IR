We consider a new class of light vectorlike exotics with fractional electric
charge which do not come in complete representations of a grand unified gauge
group, and are nevertheless compatible with gauge coupling unification and
other predictions from Grand Unified Theories. Such states naturally arise in
orbifold constructions of the heterotic string. Some aspects of their
phenomenology and the consequences for the LHC are explored.
