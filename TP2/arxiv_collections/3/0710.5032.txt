The $s$-$\bar{s}$ asymmetry in nucleon sea is an important observable for
understanding nucleon structure and strong interaction. There have been many
theoretical attempts on this subject and recently on its relation to the "NuTeV
anomaly". Calculations with different theoretical frameworks lead to different
conclusions. Here assuming a newly proposed penta-quark configuration for the
$s$-$\bar{s}$ asymmetry in nucleon, we examine its contribution to the "NuTeV
anomaly", with a result of about $10-20%$.
