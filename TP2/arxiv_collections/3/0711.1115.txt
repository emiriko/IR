The article reviews the statistical theory of signal detection in application
to analysis of deterministic gravitational-wave signals in the noise of a
detector. Statistical foundations for the theory of signal detection and
parameter estimation are presented. Several tools needed for both theoretical
evaluation of the optimal data analysis methods and for their practical
implementation are introduced. They include optimal signal-to-noise ratio,
Fisher matrix, false alarm and detection probabilities, $\F$-statistic,
template placement, and fitting factor. These tools apply to the case of
signals buried in a stationary and Gaussian noise. Algorithms to efficiently
implement the optimal data analysis techniques are discussed. Formulas are
given for a general gravitational-wave signal that includes as special cases
most of the deterministic signals of interest.
