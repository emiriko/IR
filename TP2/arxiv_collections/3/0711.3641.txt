In this work we extend previous work on the evolution of a Primordial Black
Hole (PBH) to address the presence of a dark energy component with a
super-negative equation of state as a background, investigating the competition
between the radiation accretion, the Hawking evaporation and the phantom
accretion, the latter two causing a decrease on black hole mass. It is found
that there is an instant during the matter-dominated era after which the
radiation accretion becomes negligible compared to the phantom accretion. The
Hawking evaporation may become important again depending on a mass threshold.
The evaporation of PBHs is quite modified at late times by these effects, but
only if the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics is violated.
