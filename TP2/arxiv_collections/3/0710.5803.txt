The theory of gravitation in the spacetime with Finsler structure is
constructed. It is shown that the theory keeps general covariance. Such theory
reduces to Einstein's general relativity when the Finsler structure is
Riemannian. Therefore, this covariant theory of gravitation is an elegant
realization of Einstein's thoughts on gravitation in the spacetime with Finsler
structure.
