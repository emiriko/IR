The Jaynes-Cummings model, with and without the rotating wave approximation,
is expressed in the conjugate variable representation and solved numerically by
wave packet propagation. Both cases are then cast into systems of two coupled
harmonic oscillators, reminiscent of coupled bound electronic potential curves
of diatomic molecules. Using the knowledge of such models, this approach of the
problem gives new insight of the dynamics. The effect of the rotating wave
approximation is discussed. The collapse-revival phenomenon is especially
analyzed in a non-standard manner. Extensions of the method is briefly
mentioned in terms of a three-level atom and the Dicke model.
