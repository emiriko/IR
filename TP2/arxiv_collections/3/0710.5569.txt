A quantum mechanical theory of the relationship between perceptions and brain
dynamics based on von Neumann's theory of measurments is applied to a recent
quantum theoretical treatment of binocular rivaly that makes essential use of
the quantum Zeno effect to give good fits to the complex available empirical
data. The often-made claim that decoherence effects in the warm, wet, noisy
brain must eliminate quantum effects at the macroscopic scale pertaining to
perceptions is examined, and it is argued, on the basis of fundamental
principles. that the usual decoherence effects will not upset the quantum Zeno
effect that is being exploited in the cited work.
