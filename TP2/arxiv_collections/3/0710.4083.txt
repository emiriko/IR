An ASEP with two species of particles and different hopping rates is
considered on a ring. Its integrability is proved and the Nested Algebraic
Bethe Ansatz is used to derive the Bethe Equations for states with arbitrary
numbers of particles of each type, generalizing the results of Derrida and
Evans. We present also formulas for the total velocity of particles of a given
type and their limit for large size of the system and finite densities of the
particles.
