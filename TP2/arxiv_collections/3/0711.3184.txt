The nuclear K-shell electron-capture (EC)and positron (beta+) decay
constants, lambda_(EC) and lambda_(beta^+) of H-like 140Pr58+ and He-like
140Pr57+ ions, measured recently in the ESR ion storage ring at GSI, were
calculated using standard weak interaction theory. The calculated ratios R =
lambda_(EC)/lambda_(beta^+) of the decay constants agree with the experimental
values within an accuracy better than 3 %.
