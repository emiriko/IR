The de Broglie-Einstein velocity equation is derived for a relativistic
particle by using the energy and momentum relations in terms of wave and matter
properties. It is shown that the velocity equation is independent from the
relativistic effects and is valid also for the non-relativistic case. The
results of this property is discussed.
