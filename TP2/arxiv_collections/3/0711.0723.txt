Two alternative Vinen's evolution equations for the vortex line density L in
counterflow superfluid turbulence, are physically admissible and lead to
analogous results in steady states. In Phys. Rev. B, 69, 094513 (2004) the most
used of them was generalized to counterflow superfluid turbulence in rotating
containers. Here, the analogous generalization for the alternative Vinen's
equation is proposed. Both generalized Vinen's equations are compared with the
experimental results, not only in steady-states but also in some unsteady
situations. From this analysis follows that the solutions of the alternative
Vinen's equation tend significantly faster to the corresponding final steady
state values than the solutions of the usual Vinen's equation, and that the
latter seems more suitable for the description of the experimental available
data.
