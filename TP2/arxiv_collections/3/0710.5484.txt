We explore theoretically the novel superfluidity of harmonically-trapped
polarized ultracold fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice
by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The pairing amplitude is found
to oscillate along the radial direction at low particle density and along the
angular direction at high density. The former is consistent with the existing
experiments and the latter is a newly predicted
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which can be tested in
experiments.
