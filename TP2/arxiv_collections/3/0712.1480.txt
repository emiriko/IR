Two possible applications of random decoupling are discussed. Whereas so far
decoupling methods have been considered merely for quantum memories, here it is
demonstrated that random decoupling is also a convenient tool for stabilizing
quantum algorithms. Furthermore, a decoupling scheme is presented which
involves a random decoupling method compatible with detected-jump error
correcting quantum codes. With this combined error correcting strategy it is
possible to stabilize quantum information against both spontaneous decay and
static imperfections of a qubit-based quantum information processor in an
efficient way.
