We generalize the effective point particle approach to black hole dynamics to
include spin. In this approach dissipative effects are captured by degrees of
freedom localized on the wordline. The absorptive properties of the black hole
are determined by correlation functions which can be matched with the graviton
absorption cross section in the long wavelength approximation. For rotating
black holes, superradiance is responsible for the leading contribution. The
effective theory is then used to predict the power loss due to spin in the
dynamics of non-relativistic binary systems. An enhancement of three powers of
the relative velocity is found with respect to the non-rotating case. Then we
generalize the results to other type of constituents in the binary system, such
as rotating neutron stars. Finally we compute the power loss absorbed by a test
spinning black hole in a given spacetime background.
