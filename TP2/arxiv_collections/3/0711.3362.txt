We give a partial list of 26 tight Bell inequalities for the case where Alice
and Bob choose among four two-outcome measurements. All tight Bell inequalities
with less settings are reviewed as well. For each inequality we compute
numerically the maximal quantum violation, the resistance to noise and the
minimal detection efficiency required for closing the detection loophole.
Surprisingly, most of these inequalities are outperformed by the CHSH
inequality.
