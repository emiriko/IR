We study elastic systems such as interfaces or lattices pinned by correlated
quenched disorder considering two different types of correlations: generalized
columnar disorder and quenched defects correlated as ~ x^{-a} for large
separation x. Using functional renormalization group methods, we obtain the
critical exponents to two-loop order and calculate the response to a transverse
field h. The correlated disorder violates the statistical tilt symmetry
resulting in nonlinear response to a tilt. Elastic systems with columnar
disorder exhibit a transverse Meissner effect: disorder generates the critical
field h_c below which there is no response to a tilt and above which the tilt
angle behaves as \theta ~ (h-h_c)^{\phi} with a universal exponent \phi<1. This
describes the destruction of a weak Bose glass in type-II superconductors with
columnar disorder caused by tilt of the magnetic field. For isotropic
long-range correlated disorder, the linear tilt modulus vanishes at small
fields leading to a power-law response \theta ~ h^{\phi} with \phi>1. The
obtained results are applied to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with
temporally correlated noise.
