Amplitudes for fermion-fermion, boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions
are calculated in the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky
space. An essential ingredient of the model is the Weinberg's 2(2j+1)-component
formalism for describing a particle of spin j. The boson-boson amplitude is
then compared with the two-fermion amplitude obtained long ago by Skachkov on
the basis of the Hamiltonian formulation of quantum field theory on the mass
hyperboloid, p_0^2 - p^2=M^2, proposed by Kadyshevsky. The parametrization of
the amplitudes by means of the momentum transfer in the Lobachevsky space leads
to same spin structures in the expressions of T-matrices for the fermion case
and the boson case. However, certain differences are found. Possible physical
applications are discussed.
