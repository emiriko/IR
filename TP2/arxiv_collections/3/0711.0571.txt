In this paper we develop a sysmatical theory for topological orders by the
projected p-wave superconducting (SC) wave-functions and unify the different
topological orders for spin models into the fermionic picture. We found that
the energy for the fermions at k=(0,0), (0, pi), (pi, 0), (pi, pi) acts as a
topological invariable to characterize 16 universal classes of different
topological orders for the spin models with translation invariance. Based on
the projected p-wave SC wave-functions the topological properties for the known
topological orders in the exact solved spin models are obtained. Finally new
types of topological orders are predicted.
