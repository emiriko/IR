This paper studies the security of an image encryption scheme based on the
Hill cipher and reports its following problems: 1) there is a simple necessary
and sufficient condition that makes a number of secret keys invalid; 2) it is
insensitive to the change of the secret key; 3) it is insensitive to the change
of the plain-image; 4) it can be broken with only one known/chosen-plaintext;
5) it has some other minor defects.
