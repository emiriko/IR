We propose a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining reachability information
in directed graphs. The proposed deterministic dynamic algorithm has an update
time of $O((ins*n^{2}) + (del * (m+n*log(n))))$ where $m$ is the current number
of edges, $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph, $ins$ is the number of
edge insertions and $del$ is the number of edge deletions. Each query can be
answered in O(1) time after each update. The proposed algorithm combines
existing fully dynamic reachability algorithm with well known witness counting
technique to improve efficiency of maintaining reachability information when
edges are deleted. The proposed algorithm improves by a factor of
$O(\frac{n^2}{m+n*log(n)})$ for edge deletion over the best existing fully
dynamic algorithm for maintaining reachability information.
