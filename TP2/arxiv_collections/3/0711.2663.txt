We have developed a technique in which Rb atomic response to weak magnetic
field is high and an efficient rotation of linearly polarized laser beam
results in efficient magnetometry. 85Rb isotope has been used for the
magnetometry in an ordinary vapor cell without any paraffin coating to its
inner wall. A linear regime of Faraday rotation of about 25 microT has been
observed with atomic number density within the vapor cell of about 10^9 cm-3.
