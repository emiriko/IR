We present a scheme for the extraction of singlet states of two remote
particles of arbitrary quantum spin number. The goal is achieved through
post-selection of the state of interaction mediators sent in succession. A
small number of iterations is sufficient to make the scheme effective. We
propose two suitable experimental setups where the protocol can be implemented.
