A fundamental symmetry of nuclear and particle physics is isospin whose third
component is the Gell-Mann/Nishijima expression I(z)=Q-(B+S)/2 . The role of
isospin symmetry in relativistic heavy ion collisions is studied. An isospin
I(z), strangeness S correlation is shown to be a direct and simple measure of
flavor correlations, vanishing in a Qg phase of uncorrelated flavors in both
symmetric N=Z and asymmetric N not equal to Z systems. By contrast, in a hadron
phase, a I(z)/S correlation exists as long as the electrostatic charge chemical
potential mu(Q)does not equal 0 as in N not equal to Z asymmetric systems. A
parallel is drawn with a Zeeman effect which breaks a spin degeneracy
