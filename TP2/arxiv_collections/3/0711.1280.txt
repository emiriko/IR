A self-consistent symmetry arises when the nucleon angular momentum j and the
isospin t are coupled to a grand spin G. Closed G shells become sources of a
classical pion field with a hedgehog shape. Although the amplitude of the pion
field, as measured by the chiral angle, is small, it is found to perturb
significantly the energies of the nucleon orbits.
