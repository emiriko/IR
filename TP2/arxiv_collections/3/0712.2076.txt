Work of Clifford, Munn and Ponizovski{\u\i} parameterized the irreducible
representations of a finite semigroup in terms of the irreducible
representations of its maximal subgroups. Explicit constructions of the
irreducible representations were later obtained independently by Rhodes and
Zalcstein and by Lallement and Petrich. All of these approaches make use of
Rees's theorem characterizing 0-simple semigroups up to isomorphism. Here we
provide a short modern proof of the Clifford-Munn-Ponizovski{\u\i} result based
on a lemma of J. A. Green, which allows us to circumvent the theory of 0-simple
semigroups. A novelty of this approach is that it works over any base ring.
