A fractional generalization of variations is used to define a stability of
non-integer order. Fractional variational derivatives are suggested to describe
the properties of dynamical systems at fractional perturbations. We formulate
stability with respect to motion changes at fractional changes of variables.
Note that dynamical systems, which are unstable "in sense of Lyapunov", can be
stable with respect to fractional variations.
