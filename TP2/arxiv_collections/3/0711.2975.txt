We theoretically investigate the enhanced localization of bosonic atoms by
fermionic atoms in three-dimensional optical lattices and find a self-trapping
of the bosons for attractive boson-fermion interaction. Because of this mutual
interaction, the fermion orbitals are substantially squeezed, which results in
a strong deformation of the effective potential for bosons. This effect is
enhanced by an increasing bosonic filling factor leading to a large shift of
the transition between the superfluid and the Mott-insulator phase. We find a
nonlinear dependency of the critical potential depth on the boson-fermion
interaction strength. The results, in general, demonstrate the important role
of higher Bloch bands for the physics of attractively interacting quantum gas
mixtures in optical lattices and are of direct relevance to recent experiments
with 87Rb - 40K mixtures, where a large shift of the critical point has been
found.
