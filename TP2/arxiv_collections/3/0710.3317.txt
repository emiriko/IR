We consider a magnetic superconductor MS with a spiral magnetic structure. On
the basis of generalized Eilenberger and Usadel equations we show that near the
boundary of the MS with an insulator or vacuum the condensate (Gor'kov's)
Green's functions are disturbed by boundary conditions and differ essentially
from their values in the bulk. Corrections to the bulk quasiclassical Green's
functions oscillate with the period of the magnetic spiral, $2\pi /Q$, and
decay inside the superconductor over a length of the order $v/\pi T$ (ballistic
limit) or $\sqrt{D/\pi T}$ (diffusive limit). We calculate the dc Josephson
current in an MS/I/MS tunnel junction and show that the critical Josephson
current differs substantially from that obtained with the help of the tunnel
Hamiltonian method and bulk Green's functions.
