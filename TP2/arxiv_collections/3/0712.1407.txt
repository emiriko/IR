We predict unusual (for non-relativistic quantum mechanics) electron states
in graphene, which are localized within a finite-width potential barrier. The
density of localized states in the sufficiently high and/or wide graphene
barrier exhibits a number of singularities at certain values of the energy.
Such singularities provide quantum oscillations of both the transport (e.g.,
conductivity) and thermodynamic properties of graphene - when increasing the
barrier height and/or width, similarly to the well-known Shubnikov-de-Haas
(SdH) oscillations of conductivity in pure metals. However, here the SdH-like
oscillations are driven by an electric field instead of the usual
magnetically-driven SdH-oscillations.
