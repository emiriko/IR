We study spaces obtained from a complete finite volume complex hyperbolic
n-manifold M by removing a compact totally geodesic complex (n-1)-submanifold.
The main result is that the fundamental group of M-S is relatively hyperbolic,
relative to fundamental groups of the ends of M-S, and M-S admits a complete
finite volume A-regular Riemannian metric of negative sectional curvature. It
follows that for n>1 the fundamental group of M-S satisfies Mostow-type
Rigidity, has finite asymptotic dimension and rapid decay property, satisfies
Borel and Baum-Connes conjectures, is co-Hopf and residually hyperbolic, has no
nontrivial subgroups with property (T), and has finite outer automorphism
group. Furthermore, if M is compact, then the fundamental group of M-S is
biautomatic and satisfies Strong Tits Alternative.
