We derive and systematically analyze scalar glueball correlation functions in
both the hard-wall and dilaton soft-wall approximations to holographic QCD. The
dynamical content of the holographic correlators is uncovered by examining
their spectral density and by relating them to the operator product expansion,
a dilatational low-energy theorem and a recently suggested two-dimensional
power correction associated with the short-distance behavior of the heavy-quark
potential. This approach provides holographic estimates for the three
lowest-dimensional gluon condensates or alternatively their Wilson
coefficients, the two leading moments of the instanton size distribution in the
QCD vacuum and an effective UV gluon mass. A remarkable complementarity between
the nonperturbative physics of the hard- and soft-wall correlators emerges, and
their ability to describe detailed QCD results can be assessed quantitatively.
We further provide the first holographic estimates for the decay constants of
the 0++ glueball and its excitations. The hard-wall background turns out to
encode more of the relevant QCD physics, and its prediction f ~ 0.8-0.9 GeV for
the phenomenologically important ground state decay constant agrees inside
errors with recent QCD sum rule and lattice results.
