Many schemes to realize quantum state transfer in spin chains are not robust
to random fluctuations in the spin-spin coupling strength. In efforts to
achieve robust quantum state transfer, an adiabatic quantum population transfer
scheme is proposed in this study. The proposed scheme makes use of a slowly
moving external parabolic potential and is qualitatively explained in terms of
the adiabatic following of a quantum state with a moving separatrix structure
in the classical phase space of a pendulum analogy. Detailed aspects of our
adiabatic population transfer scheme, including its robustness, is studied
computationally. Applications of our adiabatic scheme in quantum information
transfer are also discussed, with emphasis placed on the usage of a dual spin
chain to encode quantum phases. The results should also be useful for the
control of electron tunneling in an array of quantum dots.
