The analysis of the Higgs search results at LEP showed that a part of the
MSSM parameter space with non-zero complex phases could not be excluded, where
the lightest neutral Higgs boson, h_1, has a mass of only about 45 GeV and the
second lightest neutral Higgs boson, h_2, has a sizable branching fraction into
a pair of h_1 states. Full one-loop results for the Higgs cascade decay h_2 -->
h_1 h_1 are presented and combined with two-loop Higgs propagator corrections
taken from the program FeynHiggs. Using the improved theoretical prediction to
analyse the limits on topological cross sections obtained at LEP, the existence
of an unexcluded region at low Higgs mass is confirmed. The effect of the
genuine vertex corrections on the size and shape of this region is discussed.
