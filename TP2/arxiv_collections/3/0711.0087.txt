For two qubits belonging to Alice and Bob, we derive an approach to setup the
bound of Bell operator in the condition that Alice and Bob continue to perform
local vertical measurements. For pure states we find that if the entanglement
of the two qubits is less than 0.2644 (measured with von Neumann entropy) the
violation of the Bell inequality will never be realized, and only when the
entanglement is equal to 1 the maximal violation ($2\sqrt{2}$) can occur. For
specific form of mixed states, we prove that the bound of the Bell inequality
depends on the concurrence. Only when the concurrence is greater than 0.6 the
violation of the Bell inequality can occur, and the maximal violation can never
be achieved. We suggest that the bound of the Bell operator in the condition of
local vertical measurements may be used as a measure of the entanglement.
