We argue that the vast majority of flux vacua with small cosmological
constant are unstable to rapid decay to a big crunch. Exceptions are states
with large compactification volume and supersymmetric and approximately
supersymmetric states. Neither weak string coupling, warping, or the existence
of very light particles are, by themselves, enough to render states reasonably
metastable. We speculate, as well, about states which might be cosmological
attractors.
