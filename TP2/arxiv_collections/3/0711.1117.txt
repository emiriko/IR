An original MEMS-based force sensing device is designed which allows to
measure spatially resolved normal and tangential stress fields at the base of
an elastomeric film. This device is used for the study of the contact stress
between a rough film and a smooth glass sphere under normal load. The measured
profiles are compared to Finite Elements Method calculations for a smooth
contact with boundary conditions obeying Amontons-Coulomb's friction law. The
accuracy of the measurements allows to discriminate between dry and lubricated
contact conditions and to evidence load-dependent deviations from
Amontons-Coulomb's profiles. These deviations are qualitatively interpreted by
taking into account the finite compliance of the micro-contact population.
