The electric dipole moments of closed-shell atoms are sensitive to the parity
and time-reversal violating phenomena in the nucleus. The nuclear Schiff moment
is one such property, it arises from the parity and time reversal violating
quark-quark interactions and the quark-chromo electric dipole moments. We
calculate the electric dipole moment of atomic $^{199}{\rm Hg}$ arising from
the nuclear Schiff moment using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. This
is the most accurate calculation of the quantity to date. Our calculations in
combination with the experiment data provide important insights to the P and T
violating coupling constants at the elementary particle level. In addition, a
new limit on the tensor-pseudo tensor induced atomic EDM, calculated using the
relativistic coupled-cluster theory is also presented.
