We present the results of measurements of the analysing power for the p(pol)p
--> pp eta reaction at the excess energies of Q=10 and 36 MeV, and interpret
these results within the framework of the meson exchange models. The determined
values of the analysing power at both excess energies are consistent with zero
implying that the eta meson is produced predominantly in s-wave.
