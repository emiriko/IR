We present 11B NMR studies of the 2D frustrated dimer spin system SrCu2(BO3)2
in the field range 27-31 T covering the upper phase boundary of the 1/8
magnetization plateau, identified at 28.4 T. Our data provide a clear evidence
that above 28.4 T the spin-superlattice of the 1/8 plateau is modified but does
not melt even though the magnetization increases. Although this is precisely
what is expected for a supersolid phase, the microscopic nature of this new
phase is much more complex. We discuss the field-temperature phase diagram on
the basis of our NMR data.
