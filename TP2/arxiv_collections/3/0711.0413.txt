We discuss the effects of non-inertial motion in reactions occurring in
laboratory, stars, and elsewhere. It is demonstrated that non-inertial effects
due to large accelerations during nuclear collisions might have appreciable
effects nuclear and atomic transitions. We also explore the magnitude of the
corrections induced by strong gravitational fields on nuclear reactions in
massive, compact stars, and the neighborhood of black holes.
