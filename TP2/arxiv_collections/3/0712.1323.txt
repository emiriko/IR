We give an introduction into diffraction theory for aperiodic order. We focus
on an approach via dynamical systems and the phenomenon of pure point
diffraction. We review recent results and sketch proofs. We then present a new
uniform Wiener/Wintner type result generalizing various earlier results of this
type.
