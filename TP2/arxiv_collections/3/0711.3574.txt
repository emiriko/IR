In this paper we will study the existence of fundamental solutions for the
explicit and implicit backward time dependent Schodinger equation, via discrete
Fourier transform and its symbol for the Laplace operator. In both cases we
will prove that the discrete fundamental solutions obtained converges to the
continuous fundamental solution in the $l_1-$norm sense.
