We present a unified relativistic approach to inclusive electron scattering
based on the relativistic Fermi gas model and on a phenomenological extension
of it which accounts for the superscaling behaviour of $(e,e')$ data. We
present results in the $\Delta$ resonance region and in the highly inelastic
domain and show some application to neutrino scattering.
