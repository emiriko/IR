We calculate the photoionization with excitation-to photoionization ratios
for atomic helium and heliumlike ions at intermediate values of the photon
energies. The final state interactions between the electrons are included in
the lowest order of their Sommerfeld parameter. This enables us, in contrast to
purely numerical calculations to investigate the roles of various mechanisms
contributing beyond the high energy limit. The system of the two bound
electrons is described by the functions obtained by the Correlation Function
Hyperspherical Harmonic Method. For the case of heliumlike ions we present the
high energy limits as power expansion in inverse charge of the nucleus. We
analyse the role of excitation of states with the nonzero orbital momenta.
