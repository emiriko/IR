We develop a consistent semiclassical theory of spin dynamics for an
isotropic ferromagnet with a spin $ S=1$ taking into consideration both
bilinear and biquadratic over spin operators exchange interaction. For such
non-Heisenberg magnets, a peculiar class of spin oscillations and waves, for
which the quantum spin expectation value $ {\rm {\bf m}}=<{\rm {\bf S}}>$ does
not change it direction, but changes in length, is presented. Such
``longitudinal'' excitations do not exist in regular magnets, dynamics of which
are described in terms of the Landau-Lifshitz equation or by means of the spin
Heisenberg Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the presence of non-linear uniform
oscillations and waves, as well as self-localized dynamical excitations
(solitons) with finite energy. A possibility of excitation of such oscillations
by ultrafast laser pulse is discussed.
