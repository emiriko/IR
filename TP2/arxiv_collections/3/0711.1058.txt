Equivalent interactions in a low-momentum space for the $\Lambda N$, $\Sigma
N$ and $\Xi N$ interactions are calculated, using the SU$_6$ quark model
potential as well as the Nijmegen OBEP model as the input bare interaction.
Because the two-body scattering data has not been accumulated sufficiently to
determine the hyperon-nucleon interactions unambiguously, the construction of
the potential even in low-energy regions has to rely on a theoretical model.
The equivalent interaction after removing high-momentum components is still
model dependent. Because this model dependence reflects the character of the
underlying potential model, it is instructive for better understanding of
baryon-baryon interactions in the strangeness sector to study the low-momentum
space $YN$ interactions.
