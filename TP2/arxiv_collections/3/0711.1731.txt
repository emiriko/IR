We consider the mismatched measurements in the BB84 quantum key distribution
protocol, in which measuring bases are different from transmitting bases. We
give a lower bound on the amount of a secret key that can be extracted from the
mismatched measurements. Our lower bound shows that we can extract a secret key
from the mismatched measurements with certain quantum channels, such as the
channel over which the Hadamard matrix is applied to each qubit with high
probability. Moreover, the entropic uncertainty principle implies that one
cannot extract the secret key from both matched measurements and mismatched
ones simultaneously, when we use the standard information reconciliation and
privacy amplification procedure.
