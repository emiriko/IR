The masses of $S$ and $P$ states, pseudoscalar and vector decay constants,
leptonic, semileptonic decay widths of charm (D) and beauty (B) open flavour
mesons have been computed in the framework of Coulomb and power potential of
the form $V(r)=-\frac{\alpha_c}{r}+A r^{\nu}$. The results are compared with
other theoretical as well as experimental results.
