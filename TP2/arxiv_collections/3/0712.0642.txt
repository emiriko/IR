We calculate leading long-distance noncommutative corrections to the
classical Schwarzschild black hole which is sourced by a massive noncommutative
scalar field. The energy-momentum tensor is taken up to ${\cal O}(\ell^4)$ in
noncommutative parameter, and is treated in semiclassical (tree level)
approximation. These noncommutative corrections can dominate classical
post-post-Newtonian corrections providing $\ell > 1/M_P$, however, they are
still too small to be observable in present-day experiments.
