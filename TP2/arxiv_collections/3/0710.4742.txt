In this paper, we present power emulation, a novel design paradigm that
utilizes hardware acceleration for the purpose of fast power estimation. Power
emulation is based on the observation that the functions necessary for power
estimation (power model evaluation, aggregation, etc.) can be implemented as
hardware circuits. Therefore, we can enhance any given design with "power
estimation hardware", map it to a prototyping platform, and exercise it with
any given test stimuli to obtain power consumption estimates. Our empirical
studies with industrial designs reveal that power emulation can achieve
significant speedups (10X to 500X) over state-of-the-art commercial
register-transfer level (RTL) power estimation tools.
