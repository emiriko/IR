This reply shows that the argument presented in the comment by Jorg and
Krzakala (cond mat 0709.0894) cannot be used to weaken the results presented in
our paper on ultrametricity evidence in the 3d Edwards Anderson model (PRL 99,
057206, 2007; cond-mat/0607376). Our work in fact was mainly based on
identifying the scaling law that governs the large volume approach to
ultrametricity while NO asymptotic analysis has been done in (cond mat
0709.0894). We show here that the same method we used in our paper, when
properly applied to the 2d case, reveals the expected lack of RSB picture at
positive temperature, despite the fact that for a fixed finite volume some
ultrametric features might still be seen in the joint overlap probability
distribution. Those features disappear for increasing volume or when the system
is away from the critical curve in the (T,d) plane.
