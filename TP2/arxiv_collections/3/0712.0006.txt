The features of solitary waves observed in horizontal monodisperse chain of
barely touching beads not only depend on geometrical and material properties of
the beads but also on the initial perturbation provided at the edge of the
chain. An impact of a large striker on a monodisperse chain, and similarly a
sharp decrease of bead radius in a stepped chain, generates a solitary wave
train containing many single solitary waves ordered by decreasing amplitudes.
We find, by simple analytical arguments, that the unloading of compression
force at the chain edge has a nearly exponential decrease. The characteristic
time is mainly a function involving the grains' masses and the striker mass.
Numerical calculations and experiments corroborate these findings.
