We consider Exclusive Double Diffractive Events (EDDE) as a powerfull tool to
study the picture of the $pp$ interaction. Calculations of the cross-sections
for the process $p+p\to p+M+p$ are presented in the convenient form for further
experimental applications. We propose measurements of t-distributions in the
joint CMS-TOTEM experiment. It is shown that important information on the
interaction region could be extracted from the diffractive pattern.
