Steady-state properties of Bloch domain wall (DW) in superconducting
ferromagnet (SCFM) are studied. The distribution of magnetic field above and
below the surface of the SCFM due to the permanent magnetization supercurrent
flowing in the DW plane is calculated by solving Maxwell equations supplemented
by London equation. It is shown that part of the magnetic flux of the two
neighboring domains closures in the nearest vicinity of the surface of the
sample giving rise to declination of the line of the force from being parallel
to the DW plane. As a result, the value of the normal component of magnetic
field at the surface of the sample reaches only half of the value of the bulk
magnetic flux. At the distances of the order of value of London penetration
depth the magnetic field decreases as inverse power law due to the long-range
character of dipole-dipole interaction. The last two circumstances are
important for comparison the calculated magnetic field with the data obtained
by the methods on measurement of normal component of magnetic field, e. g. Hall
probe technique, aimed to confirm the existence of magnetic order parameter in
unconventional superconductor.
