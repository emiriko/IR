The collective behaviour of statistical systems close to critical points is
characterized by an extremely slow dynamics which, in the thermodynamic limit,
eventually prevents them from relaxing to an equilibrium state after a change
in the thermodynamic control parameters. The non-equilibrium evolution
following this change displays some of the features typically observed in
glassy materials, such as ageing, and it can be monitored via dynamic
susceptibilities and correlation functions of the order parameter, the scaling
behaviour of which is characterized by universal exponents, scaling functions,
and amplitude ratios. This universality allows one to calculate these
quantities in suitable simplified models and field-theoretical methods are a
natural and viable approach for this analysis. In addition, if a statistical
system is spatially confined, universal Casimir-like forces acting on the
confining surfaces emerge and they build up in time when the temperature of the
system is tuned to its critical value. We review here some of the theoretical
results that have been obtained in recent years for universal quantities, such
as the fluctuation-dissipation ratio, associated with the non-equilibrium
critical dynamics, with particular focus on the Ising model with Glauber
dynamics in the bulk. The non-equilibrium dynamics of the Casimir force acting
in a film is discussed within the Gaussian model.
