A subset U of a group G is called k-universal if U contains a translate of
every k-element subset of G. We give several nearly optimal constructions of
small k-universal sets, and use them to resolve an old question of Erdos and
Newman on bases for sets of integers, and to obtain several extensions for
other groups.
