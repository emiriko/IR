Polydispersity is found to have a significant effect on the potential energy
landscape; the the average inherent structure energy with temperature decreases
with polydispersity. Increasing polydispersity at fixed volume fraction
decreases the glass transition temperature and the fragility of glass formation
analogous to the antiplasticization seen in some polymeric melts. An
interesting temperature dependent crossover of heterogeneity with
polydispersity is observed at low temperature due to the faster build-up of
dynamic heterogeneity at lower polydispersity.
