We explore a new framework for describing the kinetics of a heterogeneous
chemical reaction where two particles of the same chemical species form a
reaction product of another chemical species on the surface of a seed particle.
Traditional treatments neglect the effect of statistical fluctuations in
populations. We employ techniques in a manner analogous to the treatment of
quantum systems to develop a stochastic description of processes beyond the
mean field approximation.
