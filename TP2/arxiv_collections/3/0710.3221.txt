Dual superconductivity is believed to be a promising mechanism for quark
confinement and has been investigated on a lattice effectively by a particular
gauge called the maximal Abelian (MA) gauge. We propose a new formulation of
SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on a lattice based on a non-linear change of variables
where the new field variables are expected to reduce to those of the
Cho-Faddeev-Niemi- Shabanov decomposition in the continuum limit. By
introducing a new variable, say color field, carrying the color direction with
it, this formulation enables us to restore and maintain color symmetry that was
lost in the conventional MA gauge due to the naive separation of the gauge
potential into diagonal and off-diagonal components. An advantage of this
formulation is that we can define gaugeinvariant magnetic monopoles without
relying on specific gauges to investigate quark confinement from the viewpoint
of dual superconductivity. In this talk, we will present the relevant lattice
formulation to realize the above advantages and preliminary results of
numerical simulations to demonstrate the validity of this formulation. This
SU(3) formulation is an extension of the SU(2) version already proposed by us
in the previous conference.
