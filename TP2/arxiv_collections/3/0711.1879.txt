Loop quantum gravity admits a kind of area quantization that is characterized
by three quantum numbers. We show the complete spectrum of area is the union of
equidistant subsets and a universal reformulation with fewer parameters is
possible. Associated with any area there is also another number that determines
its degeneracy. One application is that a quantum horizon manifests harmonic
modes in vacuum fluctuations. It is discussed the physical fluctuations of a
space-time horizon should include all the excluded area eigenvalues, where
quantum amplification effect occurs. Due to this effect the uniformity of
transition matrix elements between near levels could be assumed. Based on
these, a modification to the previous method of analyzing the radiance
intensities in hep-th/0607081 is presented that makes the result one step
further precise. A few of harmonic modes appear to be extremely amplified on
top of the Hawking's radiation. They are expected to form a few brightest lines
with the wavelength not larger than the black hole size.
