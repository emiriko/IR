We investigate Laughlin's fractional quantum Hall effect wave function on a
cylinder. We show that it displays translational symmetry breaking in the axial
direction for sufficiently thin cylinders. At filling factor 1/p, the period is
p times the period of the filled lowest Landau level. The proof uses a
connection with one-dimensional polymer systems and discrete renewal equations.
