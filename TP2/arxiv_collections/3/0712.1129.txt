Some useful kinematical relations for the absorption of a photon by a nucleus
and its recoil are derived for the relativistic incident energies. These
expressions provided for the relativistic kinematics of photoabsorption
reactions, though simple, will be immensely useful for experimentalists as well
as theoreticians.
