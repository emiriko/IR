We introduce "microdeflectometry", a novel technique for measuring the
microtopography of specular surfaces. The primary data is the local slope of
the surface under test. Measuring the slope instead of the height implies high
information efficiency and extreme sensitivity to local shape irregularities.
The lateral resolution can be better than one micron whereas the resulting
height resolution is in the range of one nanometer. Microdeflectometry can be
supplemented by methods to expand the depth of field, with the potential to
provide quantitative 3D imaging with SEM-like features.
