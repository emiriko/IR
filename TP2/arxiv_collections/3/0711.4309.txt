This book proposes to separate knowledge from software and to make it a
commodity that is called knowware. The architecture, representation and
function of Knowware are discussed. The principles of knowware engineering and
its three life cycle models: furnace model, crystallization model and spiral
model are proposed and analyzed. Techniques of software/knowware co-engineering
are introduced. A software component whose knowledge is replaced by knowware is
called mixware. An object and component oriented development schema of mixware
is introduced. In particular, the tower model and ladder model for mixware
development are proposed and discussed. Finally, knowledge service and knowware
based Web service are introduced and compared with Web service. In summary,
knowware, software and hardware should be considered as three equally important
underpinnings of IT industry.
