The spin transfer torque (STT) can lead to steady precession of magnetization
without any external applied field in magnetic spin valve where the magnetic
layer have very different spin diffusion length. This effect is associated with
an unusual angular dependence of the STT, called "wavy" (WAD-STT), predicted in
the frame of diffusive models of spin transfer. In this article, we present a
complete experimental characterization of the magnetization dynamics in the
presence of a WAD-STT. The results are compared to the prediction of the
magnetization dynamics obtained by single domain magnetic simulations
(macrospin approximation). The macrospin simulations well reproduced the main
static and dynamical experimental features (phase diagram, R(I) curves,
dependence of frequency with current and field) and suggest that the dynamical
excitations observed experimentally are associated with a large angle
out-of-plane precession mode. The present work validates the diffusive models
of the spin transfer and underlines the role of the spin accumulation and the
spin relaxation effects on the STT.
