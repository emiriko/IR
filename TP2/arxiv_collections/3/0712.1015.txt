In this report we consider the three dimensional subset of the space of
states of two qubits that may be written in the so called standard form. For
those states we show that different measures of entanglement, specifically
concurrence, negativity and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance are proportional to
the euclidean distance between the point representing the state in the three
dimensional parameter space and the set of separable states.
