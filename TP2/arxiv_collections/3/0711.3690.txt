We demonstrate a new technique for calculating proton-proton inelastic
cross-section, which allows one by application of the Laplace' method replace
the integrand in the integral for the scattering amplitude in the vicinity of
the maximum point by expression of Gaussian type. This in turn, allows one to
overcome the computational difficulties for the calculation of the integrals
expressing the cross section to sufficiently large numbers of particles. We
have managed to overcome these problems in calculating the proton-proton
inelastic cross-section for production (n \le 8) number of secondary particles
in within the framework of \phi^3 model. As the result the obtained dependence
of inelastic cross-section and total scattering cross-section on the energy
\sqrt{s} are qualitative agrees with the experimental data. Such description of
total cross-section behavior differs considerably from existing now
description, where reggeons exchange with the intercept greater than unity is
considered.
