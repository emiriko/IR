Using a canonical formalism, we determine the equation of state and the phase
diagram of eight-flavour QCD, as a function of temperature and isospin density.
Two mechanisms are at work: Bose condensation of pions at high density, and
deconfinement at high temperature. We study their interplay and find that on
our small and coarse lattice the first order deconfinement transition appears
to end at a critical point at finite density. We investigate the strength of
the overlap and of the sign problems and discuss implications for the baryonic
density case.
