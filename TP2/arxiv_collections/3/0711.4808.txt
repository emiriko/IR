At present, MAJORANA is a research and development (R&D) project to
investigate the feasibility and cost of constructing and operating a one ton
decay experiment with ~1000 kg of Ge detectors fabricated from germanium
enriched to 86% in . The study will include three separate cryostats with
various types of detectors: un-segmented, un-segmented point-contact, minimally
segmented, and highly segmented. One cryostat will contain at least 30 kg of
enriched (preferably point-contact) detectors. The performance of the cryostats
and detectors as well as background levels will be investigated. The goal of
the demonstrator project is to reach a discovery sensitivity of ~ 1026 y.
