We consider the two-dimensional uniformly frustrated XY model in the limit of
small frustration, which is equivalent to an XY system, for instance a
Josephson junction array, in a weak uniform magnetic field applied along a
direction orthogonal to the lattice. We show that the uniform frustration
(equivalently, the magnetic field) destabilizes the line of fixed points which
characterize the critical behaviour of the XY model for T <= T_{KT}, where
T_{KT} is the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature: the system is
paramagnetic at any temperature for sufficiently small frustration. We predict
the critical behaviour of the correlation length and of gauge-invariant
magnetic susceptibilities as the frustration goes to zero. These predictions
are fully confirmed by the numerical simulations.
