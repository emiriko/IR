We present measurements on penguin dominated B decays which are sensitive to
new physics, such as CP-violation parameters and branching fractions in $b \to
s q\bar{q}$ and $b \to d q\bar{q}$ gluonic and radiative decays using a large
sample of $B\bar{B}$ pairs recorded at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the
Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ collider.
