In order to express specific genes at the right time, the transcription of
genes is regulated by the presence and absence of transcription factor
molecules. With transcription factor concentrations undergoing constant
changes, gene transcription takes place out of equilibrium. In this paper we
discuss a simple mapping between dynamic models of gene expression and
stochastic systems driven out of equilibrium. Using this mapping, results of
nonequilibrium statistical mechanics such as the Jarzynski equality and the
fluctuation theorem are demonstrated for gene expression dynamics. Applications
of this approach include the determination of regulatory interactions between
genes from experimental gene expression data.
