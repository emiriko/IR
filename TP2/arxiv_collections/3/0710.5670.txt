Generating multivariate Poisson data is essential in many applications.
Current simulation methods suffer from limitations ranging from computational
complexity to restrictions on the structure of the correlation matrix. We
propose a computationally efficient and conceptually appealing method for
generating multivariate Poisson data. The method is based on simulating
multivariate Normal data and converting them to achieve a specific correlation
matrix and Poisson rate vector. This allows for generating data that have
positive or negative correlations as well as different rates.
