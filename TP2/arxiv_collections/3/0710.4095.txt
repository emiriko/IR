We study conformational transitions of simple coarse-grained models for
protein-like heteropolymers on the simple cubic lattice and off-lattice,
respectively, by means of multicanonical sampling algorithms. The effective
hydrophobic/polar models do not require the knowledge of the native topology
for a given sequence of residues as input. Therefore these models are eligible
to investigate general properties of the tertiary folding behaviour of such
protein-like heteropolymers.
