Stationary distributions of complex Langevin equations are shown to be the
complexified path integral solutions of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the
associated quantum field theory. Specific examples in zero dimensions and on a
lattice are given. Relevance to the study of quantum field theory phase space
is discussed.
