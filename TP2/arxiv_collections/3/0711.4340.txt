We prove an identity [Eq. (1) below] among SU(2) 6j and 9j symbols that
generalizes the Biedenharn-Elliott sum rule. We prove the result using
diagrammatic techniques (briefly reviewed here), and then provide an algebraic
proof. This identity is useful for studying meson-baryon scattering in which an
extra isoscalar meson is produced.
