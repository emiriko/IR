The oxygen-isotope (^{16}O/^{18}O) effect (OIE) on the zero-temperature
superconducting energy gap \Delta_0 was studied for a series of
Y_{1-x}Pr_xBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta} samples (0.0\leq x\leq0.45). The OIE on
\Delta_0 was found to scale with the one on the superconducting transition
temperature. These experimental results are in quantitative agreement with
predictions from a polaronic model for cuprate high-temperature superconductors
and rule out approaches based on purely electronic mechanisms.
