The physics program of the future FAIR facility covers a wide range of topics
that address central issues of strong interactions and QCD. The antiproton beam
of unprecedented quality in the momentum range from 1 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c will
allow the PANDA experiment to make high precision, high statistics
measurements, which include charmonium and open charm spectroscopy, the search
for exotic hadrons and the study of in-medium modifications of hadron masses.
