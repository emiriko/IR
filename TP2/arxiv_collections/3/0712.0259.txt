The radiation emitted by a single-electron wave packet in an intense laser
field is considered. A relation between the exact quantum formulation and its
classical counterpart is established via the electron's Wigner function. In
particular we show that the wave packet, even when it spreads to the scale of
the wavelength of the driving laser field, cannot be treated as an extended
classical charge distribution but rather behaves as a point-like emitter
carrying information on its initial quantum state. We outline an experimental
setup dedicated to put this conclusion to the test.
