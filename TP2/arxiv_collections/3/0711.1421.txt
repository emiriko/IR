The long-time behaviors of the velocity autocorrelation function $C(t)$ for
sheared fluids ^M are investigated theoretically and numerically. It is found
the existence of the cross-overs of^M $C(t)$ from $t^{-d/2}$ to $t^{-d}$ ^M in
sheared fluids of elastic particles without any thermostat, and from $t^{-d/2}$
to $t^{-(d+2)/2}$ ^M in both sheared fluids of elastic particles with a
thermostat and sheared granular fluids,^M where $d$ is the spatial dimension.
^M The validity of the predictions has been confirmed by^M our numerical
simulations.
