We study the coupled dynamics of two populations of random replicators by
means of statistical mechanics methods, and focus on the effects of relative
population size, strategy correlations and heterogeneities in the respective
co-operation pressures. To this end we generalise existing path-integral
approaches to replicator systems with random asymmetric couplings. This
technique allows one to formulate an effective dynamical theory, which is exact
in the thermodynamic limit and which can be solve for persistent order
parameters in a fixed-point regime regardless of the symmetry of the
interactions. The onset of instability can be determined self-consistently. We
calculate quantities such as the diversity of the respective populations and
their fitnesses in the stationary state, and compare results with data from a
numerical integration of the replicator equations
