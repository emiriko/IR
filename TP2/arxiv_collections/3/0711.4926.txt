We report on a frequency measurement of the $(3s^2)^1S_0\to(3s3p)^3P_1$ clock
transition of $^{24}$Mg on a thermal atomic beam. The intercombination
transition has been referenced to a portable primary Cs frequency standard with
the help of a femtosecond fiber laser frequency comb. The achieved uncertainty
is $2.5\times10^{-12}$ which corresponds to an increase in accuracy of six
orders of magnitude compared to previous results. The measured frequency value
permits the calculation of several other optical transitions from $^1S_0$ to
the $^3P_J$-level system for $^{24}$Mg, $^{25}$Mg and $^{26}$Mg. We describe in
detail the components of our optical frequency standard like the stabilized
spectroscopy laser, the atomic beam apparatus used for Ramsey-Bord\'e
interferometry and the frequency comb generator and discuss the uncertainty
contributions to our measurement including the first and second order Doppler
effect. An upper limit of $3\times10^{-13}$ in one second for the short term
instability of our optical frequency standard was determined by comparison with
a GPS disciplined quartz oscillator.
