Employing a new experimental technique to measure magnetoelectric response
functions, we have measured the magnetoelectric effect in composite films of
nano granular metallic iron in anatase titanium dioxide at temperatures below
50 K. A magnetoelectric resistance is defined as the ratio of a transverse
voltage to bias current as a function of the magnetic field. In contrast to the
anomalous Hall resistance measured above 50 K, the magnetoelectic resistance
below 50 K is significantly larger and exhibits an even symmetry with respect
to magnetic field reversal $H\to -H$. The measurement technique required
attached electrodes in the plane of the film composite in order to measure
voltage as a function of bias current and external magnetic field. To our
knowledge, the composite films are unique in terms of showing magnetoelectric
effects at low temperatures, $<$ 50 K, and anomalous Hall effects at high
temperatures, $>$ 50 K.
