Electric dipole-forbidden transitions of nuclei interacting with
super-intense laser fields are investigated considering stable isotopes with
suitable low-lying first excited states. Different classes of transitions are
identified, and all magnetic sublevels corresponding to the near-resonantly
driven nuclear transition are included in the description of the nuclear
quantum system. We find that large transition matrix elements and convenient
resonance energies qualify nuclear M1 transitions as good candidates for the
coherent driving of nuclei. We discuss the implications of resonant interaction
of intense laser fields with nuclei beyond the dipole approximation for the
controlled preparation of excited nuclear states and important aspects of
possible experiments aimed at observing these effects.
