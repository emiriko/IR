The universal enveloping algebra of any simple Lie algebra g contains a
family of commutative subalgebras, called the quantum shift of argument
subalgebras math.RT/0606380, math.QA/0612798. We prove that generically their
action on finite-dimensional modules is diagonalizable and their joint spectra
are in bijection with the set of monodromy-free opers for the Langlands dual
group of G on the projective line with regular singularity at one point and
irregular singularity of order two at another point. We also prove a
multi-point generalization of this result, describing the spectra of commuting
Hamiltonians in Gaudin models with irregular singulairity. In addition, we show
that the quantum shift of argument subalgebra corresponding to a regular
nilpotent element of g has a cyclic vector in any irreducible
finite-dimensional g-module. As a byproduct, we obtain the structure of a
Gorenstein ring on any such module. This fact may have geometric significance
related to the intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties in the affine
Grassmannian.
