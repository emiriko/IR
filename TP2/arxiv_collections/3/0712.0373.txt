In this work we propose an extension to the analytical one-dimensional model
proposed by E. Gnecco (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84:1172) to describe friction. Our
model includes normal forces and the dependence with the angular direction of
movement in which the object is dragged over a surface. The presence of the
normal force in the model allow us to define judiciously the friction
coefficient, instead of introducing it as an {\sl a posteriori} concept. We
compare the analytical results with molecular dynamics simulations. The
simulated model corresponds to a tip sliding over a surface. The tip is
simulated as a single particle interacting with a surface through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. The surface is considered as consisting of a
regular BCC(001) arrangement of particles interacting with each other through a
Lennard-Jones $(6-12)$ potential. We investigate the system under several
conditions of velocity, temperature and normal forces. Our analytical results
are in very good agreement with those obtained by the simulations and with
experimental results from E. Riedo (Phys. Rev. Lett. 91:084502) and Eui-Sung
Yoon (Wear 259:1424-1431) as well.
