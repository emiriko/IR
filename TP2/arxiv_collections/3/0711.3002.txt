In this article we study the effects of a partial substitution of Ba with the
smaller cation Ca in the layered cobaltites YBaCo_2O_{5+\delta} for \delta
\approx 0.5. Neutron thermodiffractograms are reported for the compounds
YBa_{0.95}Ca_{0.05}Co_2O_{5.5} (x_{Ca}=0.05) and YBa_{0.90}Ca_{0.10}Co_2O_{5.5}
(x_{Ca}=0.10) in the temperature range 20 K \leq T \leq 300 K, as well as high
resolution neutron diffraction experiments at selected temperatures for the
samples x_{Ca}=0.05, x_{Ca}=0.10 and the parent compound x_{Ca}=0. We have
found the magnetic properties to be strongly affected by the cationic
substitution. Although the "122" perovskite structure seems unaffected by Ca
addition, the magnetic arrangements of Co ions are drastically modified: the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order is destroyed, and a ferrimagnetic
phase with spin state order is stabilized below T \sim 290 K. For the sample
with x_{Ca}=0.05 a fraction of AFM phase coexists with the ferrimagnetic one
below T \sim 190 K, whereas for x_{Ca}=0.10 the AFM order is completely lost.
The systematic refinement of the whole series has allowed for a better
understanding of the observed low-temperature diffraction patterns of the
parent compound, YBaCo_2O_{5.5}, which had not yet been clarified. A two-phase
scenario is proposed for the x_{Ca}=0 compound which is compatible with the
phase coexistence observed in the x_{Ca}=0.05 sample.
