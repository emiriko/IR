We try to find a possible origin of the holographic principle in the
Lorentz-covariant Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YSTA). YSTA, which is
intrinsically equipped with short- and long-scale parameters, $\lambda$ and
$R$, gives a finite number of spatial degrees of freedom for any bounded
spatial region, providing a basis for divergence-free quantum field theory.
Furthermore, it gives a definite kinematical reduction of spatial degrees of
freedom, compared with the ordinary lattice space. On account of the latter
fact, we find a certain kind of kinematical holographic relation in YSTA, which
may be regarded as a primordial form of the holographic principle suggested so
far in the framework of the present quantum theory that appears now in the
contraction limit of YSTA, $\lambda \to 0$ and $R \to \infty.$
