A GaAs/AlGaAs based two-qubit quantum device that allows the controlled
generation and straightforward detection of entanglement by measuring a
stationary current-voltage characteristic is proposed. We have developed a
two-particle Green's function method of open systems and calculate the
properties of three-dimensional interacting entangled systems
non-perturbatively. We present concrete device designs and detailed, charge
self-consistent predictions. One of the qubits is an all-electric Mach-Zehnder
interferometer that consists of two electrostatically defined quantum wires
with coupling windows, whereas the second qubit is an electrostatically defined
double quantum dot located in a second two-dimensional electron gas beneath the
quantum wires. We find that the entanglement of the device can be controlled
externally by tuning the tunneling coupling between the two quantum dots.
