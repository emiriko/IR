Non-trivial spin effects do not die out with energy growth. Here, we discuss
one example of such effects -- production of spin-3 mesons in diffractive DIS.
Using both explicit k_t-factorization calculations and their
vector-dominance-model interpretation, we argue that diffractive production of
rho_3(1690) is a unique probe of several novel aspects of diffraction.
