"Electromagnetic mass" where gravitational mass and other physical quantities
originate from the electromagnetic field alone has a century long distinguished
history. In the introductory chapter we have divided this history into three
broad categories -- classical, quantum mechanical and general relativistic.
Each of the categories has been described at a length to get the detailed
picture of the physical background. Recent developments on Repulsive
Electromagnetic Mass Models are of special interest in this introductory part
of the thesis. In this context we have also stated motivation of our work. In
the subsequent chapters we have presented our results and their physical
significances. It is concluded that the electromagnetic mass models which are
the sources of purely electromagnetic origin ``have not only heuristic flavor
associated with the conjecture of Lorentz but even a physics having
unconventional yet novel features characterizing their own contributions
independent of the rest of the physics".
