From the large-N_c QCD point of view, baryonia, tetra-quark states, hybrids,
and glueballs are studied. The existence of these states is argued for. They
are constructed from baryons. In N_f=1 large N_c QCD, a baryonium is always
identical to a glueball with N_c valence gluons. The ground state 0^{-+}
glueball has a mass about 2450 MeV. f_0(1710) is identified as the lowest
0^{++} glueball. The lowest four-quark nonet should be f_0(1370), a_0(1450),
K^*_0(1430) and f_0(1500). Combining with the heavy quark effective theory,
spectra of heavy baryonia and heavy tetra-quark states are predicted. 1/N_c
corrections are discussed.
