Counterstreaming plasmas exhibits an electromagnetic unstable mode of
filamentation type, which is responsible for the magnetization of plasma
system. It is shown that filamentation instability becomes significantly faster
when plasma is hotter in the streaming direction. This is relevant for
astrophysical sources, where strong magnetic fields are expected to exist and
explain the nothermal emission observed.
