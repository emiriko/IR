It has been remarked that a fair measure of the impact of Atle Selberg's work
is the number of mathematical terms which bear his name. One of these is the
Selberg integral, an n-dimensional generalization of the Euler beta integral.
We trace its sudden rise to prominence, initiated by a question to Selberg from
Enrico Bombieri, more than thirty years after publication. In quick succession
the Selberg integral was used to prove an outstanding conjecture in random
matrix theory, and cases of the Macdonald conjectures. It further initiated the
study of q-analogues, which in turn enriched the Macdonald conjectures. We
review these developments and proceed to exhibit the sustained prominence of
the Selberg integral, evidenced by its central role in random matrix theory,
Calogero-Sutherland quantum many body systems, Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations, and multivariable orthogonal polynomial theory.
