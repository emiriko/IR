We will give a short introduction to the one-nucleon sector of chiral
perturbation theory and will address the issue of a consistent power counting
and renormalization. We will discuss the infrared regularization and the
extended on-mass-shell scheme. Both allow for the inclusion of further degrees
of freedom beyond pions and nucleons and the application to higher-loop
calculations. As applications we consider the chiral expansion of the nucleon
mass to order O(q^6) and the inclusion of vector and axial-vector mesons in the
calculation of nucleon form factors.
