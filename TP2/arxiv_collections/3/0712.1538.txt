It is shown that geometric connection field excitations acquire mass terms
from a geometric background substratum related to the structure of space-time.
Commutation relations in the electromagnetic su(2) sector of the connection
limit the number of possible masses. Calculated results, within corrections of
order alpha, are very close to the experimental masses of the intermediate W, Z
bosons.
