Very deep submicron and nanometer technologies have increased notably
integrated circuit (IC) sensitiveness to radiation. Soft errors are currently
appearing into ICs working at earth surface. Hardened circuits are currently
required in many applications where Fault Tolerance (FT) was not a requirement
in the very near past. The use of platform FPGAs for the emulation of
single-event upset effects (SEU) is gaining attention in order to speed up the
FT evaluation. In this work, a new emulation system for FT evaluation with
respect to SEU effects is proposed, providing shorter evaluation times by
performing all the evaluation process in the FPGA and avoiding emulator-host
communication bottlenecks.
