We find a biorthogonal expansion of the Cayley transform of the non-symmetric
Jack functions in terms of the non-symmetric Jack polynomials, the coefficients
being Meixner-Pollaczek type polynomials. This is done by computing the
Cherednik-Opdam transform of the non-symmetric Jack polynomials multiplied by
the exponential function.
