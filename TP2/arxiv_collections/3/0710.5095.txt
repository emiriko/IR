Polaron dephasing processes are investigated in InAs/GaAs dots using
far-infrared transient four wave mixing (FWM) spectroscopy. We observe an
oscillatory behaviour in the FWM signal shortly (< 5 ps) after resonant
excitation of the lowest energy conduction band transition due to coherent
acoustic phonon generation. The subsequent single exponential decay yields long
intraband dephasing times of 90 ps. We find excellent agreement between our
measured and calculated FWM dynamics, and show that both real and virtual
acoustic phonon processes are necessary to explain the temperature dependence
of the polarization decay.
