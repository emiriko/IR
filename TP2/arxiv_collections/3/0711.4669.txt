DFT calculation of various atomic species on graphene sheet is investigated
as prototypes for formation of nano-structures on carbon nanotube (CNT) wall.
We investigate computationally adsorption energies and adsorption sites on
graphene sheet for a lot of atomic species including transition metals, noble
metals, nitrogen and oxygen, using the DFT calculation as a prototype for CNT.
The suitable atomic species can be chosen as each application from those
results. The calculated results show us that Mo and Ru are bounded strongly on
graphene sheet with large diffusion barrier energy. On the other hand, some
atomic species has large binding energies with small diffusion barrier energies
