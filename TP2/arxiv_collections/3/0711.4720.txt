We demonstrate the functionality of spin-wave logic XNOR and NAND gates based
on a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer which has arms implemented as sections of
ferrite film spin-wave waveguides. Logical input signals are applied to the
gates by varying either the phase or the amplitude of the spin waves in the
interferometer arms. This phase or amplitude variation is produced by Oersted
fields of dc current pulses through conductors placed on the surface of the
magnetic films.
