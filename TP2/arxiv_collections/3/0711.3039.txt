In the color glass condensate framework the saturation scale measured in deep
inelastic scattering of high energy hadrons and nuclei can be determined from
the correlator of Wilson lines in the hadron wavefunction. These same Wilson
lines give the initial condition of the classical field computation of the
initial gluon multiplicity and energy density in a heavy ion collision. In this
paper the Wilson line correlator in both adjoint and fundamental
representations is computed using exactly the same numerical procedure that has
been used to calculate gluon production in a heavy ion collision. In particular
the discretization of the longitudinal coordinate has a large numerical effect
on the relation between the color charge density parameter g^2 mu and the
saturation scale Qs. Our result for this relation is Qs = 0.6 g^2 mu, which
results in the classical Yang-Mills value for the "gluon liberation
coefficient" c = 1.1.
