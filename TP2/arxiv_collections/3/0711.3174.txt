In quantum gravity, one seeks to combine quantum mechanics and general
relativity. In attempting to do so, one comes across the `problem of time'
impasse: the notion of time is conceptually different in each of these
theories. In this seminar, I consider the timeless records approach toward
resolving this. Records are localized, information-containing subconfigurations
of a single instant. Records theory is the study of these and of how science
(or history) is to be abstracted from correlations between them. I explain how
to motivate this approach, provide a ground-level structure for it and discuss
what kind of further tools are needed. For a more comprehensive account with
many more references, see [1].
