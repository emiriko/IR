We study the radiative charmless $B_{(s)}\to V(A)\gamma $ decays in
perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach to the leading order in $\alpha_s$ (here $V$
and $A$ denotes vector mesons and two kinds of axial-vector mesons: $^3P_1$ and
$^1P_1$ states, respectively.). Our predictions of branching ratios are
consistent with the current available experimental data. We update all
$B_{(s)}\to V$ form factors and give the predictions for $B\to A$ form factors
using the recent hadronic inputs. In addition to the dominant factorizable
spectator diagrams, which is form factor like, we also calculate the so-called
``power suppressed'' annihilation type diagrams, the gluonic penguin, charming
penguin, and two photon diagrams. These diagrams give the main contributions to
direct CP asymmetries, mixing-induced CP asymmetry variables, the isospin
asymmetry and U-spin asymmetry variables. Unlike the branching ratios, these
ratios or observables possess higher theoretical precision in our pQCD
calculation, since they do not depend on the input hadronic parameters too
much. Most of the results still need experimental tests in the on-going and
forthcoming experiments.
