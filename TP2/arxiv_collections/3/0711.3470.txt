We develop an approach to utilize anisotropic metamaterials to solve one of
the fundamental problems of modern plasmonics -- parasitic scattering of
surface waves into free-space modes, opening the road to truly two-dimensional
plasmonic optics. We illustrate the developed formalism on examples of
plasmonic refractor and plasmonic crystal, and discuss limitations of the
developed technique and its possible applications for sensing and imaging
structures, high-performance mode couplers, optical cloaking structures, and
dynamically reconfigurable electro-plasmonic circuits.
