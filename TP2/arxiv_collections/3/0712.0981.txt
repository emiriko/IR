In this note, we discuss implications of the results obtained in [MTV4]. It
was shown there that eigenvectors of the Bethe algebra of the quantum gl_N
Gaudin model are in a one-to-one correspondence with Fuchsian differential
operators with polynomial kernel. Here, we interpret this fact as a separation
of variables in the gl_N Gaudin model. Having a Fuchsian differential operator
with polynomial kernel, we construct the corresponding eigenvector of the Bethe
algebra. It was shown in [MTV4] that the Bethe algebra has simple spectrum if
the evaluation parameters of the Gaudin model are generic. In that case, our
Bethe ansatz construction produces an eigenbasis of the Bethe algebra.
