We show that effective superconducting orders generally emerge at low energy
in the superconducting state of graphene with conventionally defined pairing
symmetry .
  We study such a particular interesting example, the $d_{x^2-y^2}+id'_{xy}$
spin singlet pairing superconducting state in graphene, which can be generated
by electronic correlation as well as induced through a proximity effect with a
d-wave superconductor. We find that effectively the d-wave state is a state
with mixed s-wave and exotic $p+ip$-wave pairing orders at low energy. This
remarkable property leads to distinctive superconducting gap functions and
novel behavior of the Andreev conductance spectra.
