In this paper, we calculate the stable Wigner-Seitz (W-S) cells in the inner
crust of neutron stars and we discuss the nuclear shell effects. A distinction
is done between the shell effects due to the bound states and those induced by
the unbound states, which are shown to be spurious. We then estimate the
effects of the spurious shells on the total energy and decompose it into a
smooth and a residual part. We propose a correction to the Hartree-Fock binding
energy in Wigner-Seitz cell (HF-WS).
