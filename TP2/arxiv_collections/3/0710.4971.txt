Gaudin algebras form a family of maximal commutative subalgebras in the
tensor product of $n$ copies of the universal enveloping algebra $U(\g)$ of a
semisimple Lie algebra $\g$. This family is parameterized by collections of
pairwise distinct complex numbers $z_1,...,z_n$. We obtain some new commutative
subalgebras in $U(\g)^{\otimes n}$ as limit cases of Gaudin subalgebras. These
commutative subalgebras turn to be related to the hamiltonians of bending flows
and to the Gelfand--Tsetlin bases. We use this to prove the simplicity of
spectrum in the Gaudin model for some new cases.
