Superconducting behavior has been observed in the Sr2RuO4-Sr3Ru2O7 eutectic
system as grown by the flux-feeding floating zone technique. A supercurrent
flows across a single interface between Sr2RuO4 and Sr3Ru2O7 areas at distances
that are far beyond those expected in a conventional proximity scenario. The
current-voltage characteristics within the Sr3Ru2O7 macrodomain, as extracted
from the eutectic, exhibit signatures of superconductivity in the bilayered
ruthenate. Detailed microstructural, morphological and compositional analyses
address issues on the concentration and the size of Sr2RuO4 inclusions within
the Sr3Ru2O7 matrix. We speculate on the possibility of inhomogeneous
superconductivity in the eutectic Sr3Ru2O7 and exotic pairing induced by the
Sr2RuO4 inclusions.
