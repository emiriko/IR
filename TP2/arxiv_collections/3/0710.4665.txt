Application of Microelectronic to bioanalysis is an emerging field which
holds great promise. From the standpoint of electronic and system design,
biochips imply a radical change of perspective, since new, completely different
constraints emerge while other usual constraints can be relaxed. While
electronic parts of the system can rely on the usual established design-flow,
fluidic and packaging design, calls for a new approach which relies
significantly on experiments. We hereby make some general considerations based
on our experience in the development of biochips for cell analysis.
