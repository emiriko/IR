Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures aim to achieve both goals of high
performance and flexibility. However, existing reconfigurable array
architectures require many resources without considering the specific
application domain. Functional resources that take long latency and/or large
area can be pipelined and/or shared among the processing elements. Therefore
the hardware cost and the delay can be effectively reduced without any
performance degradation for some application domains. We suggest such
reconfigurable array architecture template and design space exploration flow
for domain-specific optimization. Experimental results show that our approach
is much more efficient both in performance and area compared to existing
reconfigurable architectures.
