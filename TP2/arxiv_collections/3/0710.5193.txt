Spin-polarized electron transport driven by inhomogeneous magnetic dynamics
is discussed in the limit of a large exchange coupling. Electron spins rigidly
following the time-dependent magnetic profile experience spin-dependent
fictitious electric and magnetic fields. We show that the electric field
acquires important corrections due to spin dephasing, when one relaxes the
spin-projection approximation. Furthermore, spin-flip scattering between the
spin bands needs to be taken into account in order to calculate voltages and
spin accumulations induced by the magnetic dynamics. A phenomenological
approach based on the Onsager reciprocity principle is developed, which allows
us to capture the effect of spin dephasing and make a connection to the well
studied problem of current-driven magnetic dynamics. A number of results that
recently appeared in the literature are related and generalized.
