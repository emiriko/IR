We present a unified approach, based on the use of quantum uncertainty
relations, for arriving at criteria for the demonstration of the EPR paradox
and macroscopic superpositions. We suggest to view each criterion as a means to
demonstrate an EPR-type paradox, where there is an inconsistency between the
assumptions of a form of realism, either macroscopic realism (MR) or local
realism (LR), and the completeness of quantum mechanics.
