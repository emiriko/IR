We study the properties of the giant connected component in random graphs
with arbitrary degree distribution. We concentrate on the degree-degree
correlations. We show that the adjoining nodes in the giant connected component
are correlated and derive analytic formulas for the joint nearest-neighbor
degree probability distribution. Using those results we describe the
correlations in maximal entropy connected random graphs. We show that connected
graphs are disassortative and that correlations are strongly related to the
presence of one-degree nodes (leaves). We propose an efficient algorithm for
generating connected random graphs. We illustrate our results with several
examples.
