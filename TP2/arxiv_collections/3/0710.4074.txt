The density of states contains all informations on energetic quantities of a
statistical system, such as the mean energy, free energy, entropy, and specific
heat. As a specific application, we consider in this work a simple lattice
model for heteropolymers that is widely used for studying statistical
properties of proteins. For short chains, we have derived exact results from
conformational enumeration, while for longer ones we developed a multicanonical
Monte Carlo variant of the nPERM-based chain growth method in order to directly
simulate the density of states. For simplification, only two types of monomers
with respective hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues are regarded and only
the next-neighbour interaction between hydrophobic monomers, being nonadjacent
along the chain, is taken into account. This is known as the HP model for the
folding of lattice proteins.
