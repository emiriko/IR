The paper analyses the ground antenna echo using microwave frequency detector
and high speed sampling technology and a new method detecting buried object in
time domain near-field is presented. The method detecting particular reflection
echo frequency of microwave pulse via digital signal processing is to reduce
the false alarm rate. Simulation results show that this method has advantages
of easy identification and high precision.
