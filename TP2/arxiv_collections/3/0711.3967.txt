The large body of experimental data on nuclear fission is analyzed with a
semi-empirical ordering scheme based on the macro-microscopic approach and the
separability of compound-nucleus and fragment properties on the fission path.
We apply the statistical model to the non-equilibrium descent from saddle to
scission, taking the influence of dynamics into account by an early freeze out.
The present approach reveals a large portion of common features behind the
variety of the complex observations made for the different systems. General
implications for out-of-equilibrium processes are mentioned.
