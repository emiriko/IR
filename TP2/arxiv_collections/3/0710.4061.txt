We point out that density matrices can only be used to describe quantum
states, so the entanglement contained in a density matrix is just quantum
entanglement. This means a bipartite state described by a density matrix
contains quantum entanglement, unless the density matrix has the form
$\rho_{AB}=\rho_A\otimes \rho_B$.
