Performance of Wang-Landau (W-L) algorithm in two continuous spin models is
tested by determining the fluctuations in energy histogram. Finite size scaling
is performed on a modified XY-model using different W-L sampling schemes.
Difficulties faced in simulating relatively large continuous systems using W-L
algorithm are discussed.
