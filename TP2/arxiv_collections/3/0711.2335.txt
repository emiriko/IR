It is shown that the observed small value of the integrated spin structure
function for protons could be naturally understood within the naive quark model
by considering the effect from Melosh rotation. The key to this problem lies in
the fact that the deep inelastic process probes the light-cone quarks rather
than the instant-form quarks, and that the spin of the proton is the sum of the
Melosh rotated light-cone spin of the individual quarks rather than simply the
sum of the light-cone spin of the quarks directly.
