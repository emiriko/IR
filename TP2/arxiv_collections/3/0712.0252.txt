The constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method is used with the Gogny
interaction D1S to calculate potential energy surfaces of fissioning nuclei
${}^{226}$Th and ${}^{256,258,260}$Fm up to very large deformations. The
constraints employed are the mass quadrupole and octupole moments. In this
subspace of collective coordinates, many scission configurations are identified
ranging from symmetric to highly asymmetric fragmentations. Corresponding
fragment properties at scission are derived yielding fragment deformations,
deformation energies, energy partitioning, neutron binding energies at
scission, neutron multiplicities, charge polarization and total fragment
kinetic energies.
