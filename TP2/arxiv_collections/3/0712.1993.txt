Measurements of the differential and total cross sections for the $p d \to
  ^3$He $\eta$ reaction at five energies were recently reported [Phys. Rev. C
{\bf 75}, 014004 (2007)] and comparisons with theoretical models were made. We
point out that these comparisons involved a model based on ad hoc assumptions
and hence the conclusions regarding the reaction mechanism as well as the role
of the higher partial waves drawn in the above work are misleading. Revised
conclusions based on better model calculations are presented.
