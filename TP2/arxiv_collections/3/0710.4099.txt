We show that one-dimensional Bohmian mechanics is unique, in that, the Bohm
trajectories are the only solutions that conserve total left (or right)
probability. In Brandt et al., Phys. Lett. A, 249 (1998) 265--270, they define
quantile motion--unique trajectories are solved by assuming that the total
probability on each side of the particle is conserved. They argue that the
quantile trajectories are identical to the Bohm trajectories. Their argument,
however, fails to notice the gauge freedom in the definition of the quantum
probability current. Our paper sidesteps this under-determinedness of the
probability current. The one-dimensional probability conservation can be used
for higher dimensional problems if the wave function is separable. Several
examples are given using total left probability conservation, most notably, the
two-slit experiment.
