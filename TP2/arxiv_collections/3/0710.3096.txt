Virtual gravitons effects at the LHC in scenarios with large extra dimensions
and low-scale gravity are sensitive to the ultraviolet completion of the
Kaluza-Klein effective theory. We study implications of a gravitational fixed
point at high energies on gravitational Drell-Yan lepton production in hadron
collisions. The fixed point behaviour leads to finite LHC cross sections. We
determine the reach for the fundamental Planck scale. An observation of these
signals might shed light on the fundamental quantum theory of gravity.
