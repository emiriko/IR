A "clique minor" in a graph G can be thought of as a set of connected
subgraphs in G that are pairwise disjoint and pairwise adjacent. The "Hadwiger
number" h(G) is the maximum cardinality of a clique minor in G. This paper
studies clique minors in the Cartesian product G*H.
  Our main result is a rough structural characterisation theorem for Cartesian
products with bounded Hadwiger number. It implies that if the product of two
sufficiently large graphs has bounded Hadwiger number then it is one of the
following graphs:
  - a planar grid with a vortex of bounded width in the outerface,
  - a cylindrical grid with a vortex of bounded width in each of the two `big'
faces, or
  - a toroidal grid.
  Motivation for studying the Hadwiger number of a graph includes Hadwiger's
Conjecture, which states that the chromatic number chi(G) <= h(G). It is open
whether Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for every Cartesian product. We prove that
if |V(H)|-1 >= chi(G) >= chi(H) then Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for G*H. On
the other hand, we prove that Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for all Cartesian
products if and only if it holds for all G * K_2. We then show that h(G * K_2)
is tied to the treewidth of G.
  We also develop connections with pseudoachromatic colourings and connected
dominating sets that imply near-tight bounds on the Hadwiger number of grid
graphs (Cartesian products of paths) and Hamming graphs (Cartesian products of
cliques).
