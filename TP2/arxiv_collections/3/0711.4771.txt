We examine the pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in moduli
stabilization, where an uplifting potential is provided by spontaneously broken
supersymmetry in a generic sequestered sector. From stationary conditions, we
derive the relation between moduli F-term vacuum expectation values which does
not depend on the details of sequestered uplifting. This moduli F-term relation
is crucial for identifying the dominant source of soft terms of visible fields.
