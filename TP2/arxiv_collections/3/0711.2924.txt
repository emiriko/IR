In this paper, we study the localization phenomena in a slender cylinder
composed of an incompressible hyperelastic material subjected to axial tension.
We aim to construct the analytical solutions based on a three-dimensional
setting and use the analytical results to describe the key features observed in
the experiments by others. Using a novel approach of coupled series-asymptotic
expansions, we derive the normal form equation of the original governing
nonlinear partial differential equations. By writing the normal form equation
into a first-order dynamical system and with the help of the phase plane, we
manage to solve two boundary-value problems analytically. The explicit solution
expressions (in terms of integrals) are obtained. By analyzing the solutions,
we find that the width of the localization zone depends on the material
parameters but remains almost unchanged for the same material in the post-peak
region. Also, it is found that when the radius-length ratio is relatively small
there is a snap-back phenomenon. These results are well in agreement with the
experimental observations. Through an energy analysis, we also deduce the
preferred configuration and give a prediction when a snap-through can happen.
Finally, based on the maximum-energy-distortion theory, an analytical criterion
for the onset of material failure is provided.
