I point out that if one defines the operator $U_R(t)$ as done by M. Znojil in
his reply [arXiv:0711.0514v1] to my comment [arXiv:0711.0137v1] and also
accepts the validity of the defining relation of $U_R(t)$ as given in his paper
[arXiv:0710.5653v1], one finds that the time-evolution of the associated
quantum system is not governed by the Schr\"odinger equation for the
Hamiltonian operator $H$ but an operator $H'$ which differs from $H$ if the
metric operator is time-dependent. In the latter case this effective
Hamiltonian $H'$ is not observable. This is consistent with the conclusions of
my paper [Phys. Lett. B 650, 208 (2007), arXiv:0706.1872v2] which allow for
unitary time-evolution generated by unobservable Hamiltonians.
