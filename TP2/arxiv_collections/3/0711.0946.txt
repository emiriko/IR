The solution of a boundary-value problem formulated for a modified
Kretschmann configuration shows that the phase speed of a surface-plasmon wave
guided by the planar interface of a sufficiently thin metal film and a chiral
sculptured thin film (STF) depends on the vapor incidence angle used while
fabricating the chiral STF by physical vapor depoistion. Therefore, it may be
possible to engineer the phase speed quite simply by selecting an appropriate
value of the vapor deposition angle (in addition to the metal and the evaporant
species).
