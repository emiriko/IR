We have studied intersubband decay of E22 excitons in semiconducting carbon
nanotubes experimentally and theoretically. Photoluminescence excitation line
widths of semiconducting nanotubes with chiral indicess (n, m) can be mapped
onto a connectivity grid with curves of constant (n-m) and (2n+m). Moreover,
the global behavior of E22 linewidths is best characterized by a strong
increase with energy irrespective of their (n-m) mod(3)= \pm 1 family
affiliation. Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equations shows that the E22
linewidths are dominated by phonon assisted coupling to higher momentum states
of the E11 and E12 exciton bands. The calculations also suggest that the
branching ratio for decay into exciton bands vs free carrier bands,
respectively is about 10:1.
