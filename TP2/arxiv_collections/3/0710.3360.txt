We present a magnetization study of low density YBCO ceramics carried out in
magnetic fields 0.5 Oe < H < 50 kOe. It was demonstrated that superconducting
links between grains may be completely suppressed either by a magnetic field of
the order of 100 Oe (at low temperatures) or by an increase of temperature
above 70 K. This property of present samples allowed to evaluate the ratio
between an average grain size and the magnetic field penetration depth lambda.
Furthermore, at temperatures T > 85 K, using low-field magnetization
measurements, we could evaluate the temperature dependence of lambda, which
turned out to be very close to predictions of the conventional Ginzburg-Landau
theory. Although present samples consisted of randomly oriented grains,
specifics of magnetization measurements allowed for evaluation of lambda_ab(T).
Good agreement between our estimation of the grain size with the real sample
structure provides evidence for the validity of this analysis of magnetization
data. Measurements of equilibrium magnetization in high magnetic fields were
used for evaluation of Hc2(T). At temperatures close to T_c, the Hc2(T)
dependence turned out to be linear in agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau
theory. The value of temperature, at which Hc2 vanishes, coincides with the
superconducting critical temperature evaluated from low-field measurements.
