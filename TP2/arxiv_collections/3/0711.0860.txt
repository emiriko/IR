By analyzing B -> X_u l nu_l spectra with a model based on soft-gluon
resummation and an analytic time-like QCD coupling, we obtain |V_ub| = (3.76
+-0.13 +- 0.22)*10^(-3), where the first and the second error refers to
experimental and theoretical errors, respectively. The V_ub value is obtained
from the available measured semileptonic branching fractions in limited regions
of the phase-space. The distributions in the lepton energy E_l, the hadron
invariant mass m_X, the light-cone momentum P_+ = E_X - p_X, together with the
double distributions in (m_X,q^2) and (E_l,s_h^max), are used to select the
phase-space regions. The q^2 is the dilepton squared momentum and s_h^max is
the maximal m_X^2 at fixed q^2 and E_l. The V_ub value obtained is in complete
agreement with the value coming from exclusive B decays and from an over-all
fit to the Standard Model parameters. We show that the slight disagreement (up
to +2 sigma) with respect to previous inclusive measurements is not related to
different choices for the b (and c) masses but to a different modelling of the
threshold (Sudakov) region.
