With growing computational needs of many real-world applications, frequently
changing specifications of standards, and the high design and NRE costs of
ASICs, an algorithm-agile FPGA based co-processor has become a viable
alternative. In this article, we report about the general design of an
algorith-agile co-processor and the proof-of-concept implementation.
