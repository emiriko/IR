We report on experimental data of the three-dimensional bulk Fermi surfaces
of the layered strongly correlated Ca1.5Sr0.5RuO4 system. The measurements have
been performed by means of hn-depndent bulk-sensitive soft x-ray angle-resolved
photoemission technique. Our experimental data evinces the bulk Fermi surface
topology at kz~0 to be qualitatively different from the one observed by
surface-sensitive low-energy ARPES. Furthermore, stronger kz dispersion of the
circle-like gamma Fermi surface sheet is observed compared with Sr2RuO4. Thus
in the paramagnetic metal phase, Ca1.5Sr0.5RuO4 compound is found to have
rather three-dimensional electronic structure.
