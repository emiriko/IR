Intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions can produce a spin polarization of
the projectile-like species. Spin polarization has been observed for both
nucleon removal and nucleon pickup processes. Qualitative agreement with
measured spin polarization as a function of the momentum of the projectile-like
fragment is found in a kinematical model that considers conservation of linear
and angular momentum and assumes peripheral interactions between the fast
projectile and target. Better quantitative agreement was reached by including
more realistic angular distributions, de-orientation caused by gamma-ray
emission, and by correcting for the out-of-plane acceptance. The newly
introduced corrections were found to apply to both nucleon removal and nucleon
pickup processes.
