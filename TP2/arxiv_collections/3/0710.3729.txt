A direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a channel flow with one curved surface
was performed at moderate Reynolds number (Re_tau = 395 at the inlet). The
adverse pressure gradient was obtained by a wall curvature through a
mathematical mapping from physical coordinates to Cartesian ones. The code,
using spectral spanwise and normal discretization, combines the advantage of a
good accuracy with a fast integration procedure compared to standard numerical
procedures for complex geometries. The turbulent flow slightly separates on the
profile at the lower curved wall and is at the onset of separation at the
opposite flat wall. The thin separation bubble is characterized with a reversal
flow fraction. Intense vortices are generated near the separation line on the
lower wall but also at the upper wall. Turbulent normal stresses and kinetic
energy budget are investigated along the channel.
