We consider mode coupling in multimode optical fibers using either two Bragg
gratings or a Bragg grating and a long-period grating. We show that the
magnitude of the band edge curvature can be controlled leading to a flat,
quartic band-edge or to two band edges at distinct, nonequivalent $k$-values,
allowing precise control of slow light propagation.
