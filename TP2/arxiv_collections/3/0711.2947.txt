We describe the construction and operation of a segmented linear Paul trap,
fabricated in printed-circuit-board technology with an electrode segment width
of 500 microns. We prove the applicability of this technology to reliable ion
trapping and report the observation of Doppler cooled ion crystals of Ca-40
with this kind of traps. Measured trap frequencies agree with numerical
simulations at the level of a few percent from which we infer a high
fabrication accuracy of the segmented trap. To demonstrate its usefulness and
versatility for trapped ion experiments we study the fast transport of a single
ion. Our experimental results show a success rate of 99.0(1)% for a transport
distance of 2x2mm in a round-trip time of T=20us, which corresponds to 4 axial
oscillations only. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the
excitation of oscillations caused by fast ion transports with error-function
voltage ramps: For a slightly slower transport (a round-trip shuttle within
T=30us) we observe non-adiabatic motional excitation of 0.89(15)meV.
