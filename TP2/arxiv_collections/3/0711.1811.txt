In order to provide scalability to quantum information processors utilizing
trapped atoms or ions as quantum bits (qubits), the capability to address
multiple individual qubits in a large array is needed. Micro-electromechanical
systems (MEMS) technology can be used to create a flexible and scalable optical
system to direct the necessary laser beams to multiple qubit locations. We
developed beam steering optics using controllable MEMS mirrors that enable one
laser beam to address multiple qubit locations in a 2 dimensional trap lattice.
MEMS mirror settling times of 10 us were demonstrated which allow for fast
access time between qubits.
