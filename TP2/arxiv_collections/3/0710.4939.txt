We re-examine constraints from the recent evidence for observation of the
lifetime difference in D^0 - \bar{D}^0 mixing on the parameters of
supersymmetric models with R-parity violation (RPV). We find that RPV SUSY can
give large negative contribution to the lifetime difference. We also discuss
the importance of the choice of weak or mass basis when placing the constraints
on RPV-violating couplings from flavor mixing experiments.
