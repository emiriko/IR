We review the physics potential of the GigaZ option of the International
Linear Collider (ILC) for probing the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) via the sensitivity of the electroweak precision observables measured at
the ILC to quantum corrections. A particular focus is put on the effective
leptonic weak mixing angle, sin^2_theta_eff. The MSSM predictions take into
account the complete one-loop results including the full complex phase
dependence, all available MSSM two-loop corrections as well as the full
Standard Model (SM) results. We find that the anticipated experimental accuracy
at the ILC with GigaZ option may resolve the virtual effects of SUSY particles
even in scenarios where the SUSY particles are so heavy that they escape direct
detection at the LHC and the first phase of the ILC.
