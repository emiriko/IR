The rate at which dependencies between future and past observations decay in
a random process may be quantified in terms of mixing coefficients. The latter
in turn appear in strong laws of large numbers and concentration of measure
results for dependent random variables. Questions regarding what rates are
possible for various notions of mixing have been posed since the 1960's, and
have important implications for some open problems in the theory of strong
mixing conditions.
  This paper deals with $\eta$-mixing, a notion defined in [Kontorovich and
Ramanan], which is closely related to $\phi$-mixing. We show that there exist
measures on finite sequences with essentially arbitrary $\eta$-mixing
coefficients, as well as processes with arbitrarily slow mixing rates.
