We report first principles calculations, within density functional theory, of
copper intercalated titanium diselenides, CuxTiSe2, for values of x ranging
from 0 to 0.11. The effect of intercalation on the energy bands and densities
of states of the host material is studied in order to better understand the
cause of the superconductivity that was recently observed in these structures.
We find that charge transfer from the copper atoms to the metal dichalcogenide
host layers causes a gradual reduction in the number of holes in the otherwise
semi-metallic pristine TiSe2, thus suppressing the charge density wave
transition at low temperatures, and a corresponding increase in the density of
states at the Fermi level. These effects are probably what drive the
superconducting transition in the intercalated systems.
