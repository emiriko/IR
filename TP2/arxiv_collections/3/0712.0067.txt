A bimetric description of the universe is proposed, which explains cosmic
acceleration deduced from optically observed high-redshift objects. This
phenomenon is classically charged to a mysterious repulsive "dark energy" whose
true nature is unknown. This is identified in this model with a set of
particles having negative mass and energy. These negative mass particles,
emitting negative energy photons, are not observable using optical instruments.
