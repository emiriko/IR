In RF-MEMS packaging, next to the protection of movable structures,
optimization of package electrical performance plays a very important role. In
this work, a wafer-level packaging process has been investigated and optimized
in order to minimize electrical parasitic effects. The RF-MEMS package concept
used is based on a wafer-level bonding of a capping silicon substrate to an
RF-MEMS wafer. The capping silicon substrate resistivity, substrate thickness
and the geometry of through-substrate electrical interconnect vias have been
optimized using finite-element electromagnetic simulations (Ansoft HFSS). Test
structures for electrical characterization have been designed and after their
fabrication, measurement results will be compared with simulations.
