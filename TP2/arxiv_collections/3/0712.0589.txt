We have performed a detailed dielectric investigation of the relaxational
dynamics of glass-forming benzophenone. Our measurements cover a broad
frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 120 GHz and temperatures from far below the glass
temperature well up into the region of the small-viscosity liquid. With respect
to the alpha relaxation this material can be characterized as a typical
molecular glass former with rather high fragility. A good agreement of the
alpha relaxation behavior with the predictions of the mode coupling theory of
the glass transition is stated. In addition, at temperatures below and in the
vicinity of Tg we detect a well-pronounced beta relaxation of Johari-Goldstein
type, which with increasing temperature develops into an excess wing. We
compare our results to literature data from optical Kerr effect and depolarized
light scattering experiments, where an excess-wing like feature was observed in
the 1 - 100 GHz region. We address the question if the Cole-Cole peak, which
was invoked to describe the optical Kerr effect data within the framework of
the mode coupling theory, has any relation to the canonical beta relaxation
detected by dielectric spectroscopy.
