We study the phase diagram of the three flavor Polyakov-Nambu-Jona Lasinio
(PNJL) model and in particular the interplay between chiral symmetry
restoration and deconfinement crossover. We compute chiral condensates, quark
densities and the Polyakov loop at several values of temperature and chemical
potential. Moreover we investigate on the role of the Polyakov loop dynamics in
the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter.
