Quantum Lie algebras (an important class of quadratic algebras arising in the
Woronowicz calculus on quantum groups) are generalizations of Lie (super)
algebras. Many notions from the theory of Lie (super)algebras admit ``quantum''
generalizations. In particular, there is a BRST operator Q (Q^2=0) which
generates the differential in the Woronowicz theory and gives information about
(co)homologies of quantum Lie algebras. In our previous papers a recurrence
relation for the operator Q for quantum Lie algebras was given and solved. Here
we consider the bar complex for q-Lie algebras and its subcomplex of
q-antisymmetric chains. We establish a chain map (which is an isomorphism) of
the standard complex for a q-Lie algebra to the subcomplex of the antisymmetric
chains. The construction requires a set of nontrivial identities in the group
algebra of the braid group. We discuss also a generalization of the standard
complex to the case when a q-Lie algebra is equipped with a grading operator.
