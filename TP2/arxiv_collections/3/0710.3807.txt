Recent demonstrations of extraordinary stabilization of proteins in mobile
protic [1] and aprotic [2] ionic liquid solutions at ambient temperatures have
raised hopes of new biopreservation and drug transportation technologies. Here
we examine the relation of folded protein stability to the state of the
transferred proton [1], as determined by the N-H proton chemical shift, d(N-H).
We identify a range of d(N-H) in which the unfolded lysozyme refolds 97%.
Exceeding the stability range in the acid direction leads to the sudden
formation and stabilization of a small, soluble, amyloid form of lysozyme which
has its own stability range and which can again unfold/refold many times before
an irreversible process, fibrillization, occurs. The tightly bound amyloid form
of the lysozyme molecule, identified by circular dichroism spectra and dynamic
light scattering, must be of very low energy since the unfolding process
absorbs almost three times the enthalpy of normal lysozyme unfolding.
alpha-lactalbumin shows similar behavior.
