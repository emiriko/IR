We study the stability of layered structures in a variational model for
diblock copolymer-homopolymer blends. The main step consists of calculating the
first and second derivative of a sharp-interface Ohta-Kawasaki energy for
straight mono- and bilayers. By developing the interface perturbations in a
Fourier series we fully characterise the stability of the structures in terms
of the energy parameters.
  In the course of our computations we also give the Green's function for the
Laplacian on a periodic strip and explain the heuristic method by which we
found it.
