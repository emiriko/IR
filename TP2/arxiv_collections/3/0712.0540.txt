In the QCD context, the non-singlet structure functions of u and d -quarks
are identical, save the initial quark densities. Electroweak radiative
corrections, being flavor-dependent, bring further difference between the
non-singlets. This difference is calculated in the double-logarithmic
approximation and the impact of the electroweak corrections on the non-singlet
intercepts is estimated numerically.
