The tetraquark assignement for light scalar states below 1 GeV is discussed
on the light of strong decays. The next-to-leading order in the large-N
expansion for the strong decays is considered. Mixing with quarkonia states
above 1 GeV is investigated within a chiral approach and the inclusion of
finite-width effects is taken into account.
