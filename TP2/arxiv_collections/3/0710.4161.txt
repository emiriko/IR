Supersymmetry will be searched for in a variety of final states at the LHC.
It is crucial that a robust, efficient and unbiased trigger selection for SUSY
is implemented from the very early days of data taking. After a brief
description of the ATLAS and the CMS trigger systems, and a more in-depth
discussion of the ATLAS High-Level Trigger, a triggering strategy is outlined
for early SUSY searches at the LHC.
