Heavy-tailed or power-law distributions are becoming increasingly common in
biological literature. A wide range of biological data has been fitted to
distributions with heavy tails. Many of these studies use simple fitting
methods to find the parameters in the distribution, which can give highly
misleading results. The potential pitfalls that can occur when using these
methods are pointed out, and a step-by-step guide to fitting power-law
distributions and assessing their goodness-of-fit is offered.
