Tracking data of user's activities resulting from Computer Mediated
Communication (CMC) tools (forum, chat, etc.) is often carried out in an ad-hoc
manner, which either confines the reusability of data in different purposes or
makes data exploitation difficult. Our research works are biased toward
methodological challenges involved in designing and developing a generic system
for tracking user's activities while interacting with asynchronous
communication tools like discussion forums. We present in this paper, an
approach for building a Web-based system for observing and analyzing user
activity on any type of discussion forums.
