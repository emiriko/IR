We demonstrate optically detected spin resonance of a single electron
confined to a self-assembled quantum dot. The dot is rendered dark by resonant
optical pumping of the spin with a coherent laser. Contrast is restored by
applying a radio frequency (rf) magnetic field at the spin resonance. The
scheme is sensitive even to rf fields of just a few micro-T. In one case, the
spin resonance behaves exactly as a driven 3-level quantum system (a
lambda-system) with weak damping. In another, the dot exhibits remarkably
strong (67% signal recovery) and narrow (0.34 MHz) spin resonances with
fluctuating resonant positions, evidence of unusual dynamic processes of
non-Markovian character.
