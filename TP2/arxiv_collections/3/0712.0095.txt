We compute the couplings of the zero modes and first excited states of
gluons, $W$'s, $Z$ gauge bosons, as well as the Higgs, to the zero modes and
first excited states of the third generation quarks, in an RS Gauge-Higgs
unification scenario based on a bulk $SO(5)\times U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry, with
gauge and fermion fields propagating in the bulk. Using the parameter space
consistent with electroweak precision tests and radiative electroweak symmetry
breaking, we study numerically the dependence of these couplings on the
parameters of our model. Furthermore, after emphasizing the presence of light
excited states of the top quark, which couple strongly to the Kaluza Klein
gauge bosons, the associated collider phenomenology is analyzed. In particular,
we concentrate on the possible detection of the first excited state of the top,
$t^1$, which tends to have a higher mass than the ones accessible via regular
QCD production processes. We stress that the detection of these particles is
still possible due to an increase in the pair production of $t^1$ induced by
the first excited state of the gluon, $G^1$.
