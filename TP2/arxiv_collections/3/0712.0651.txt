The group structure of the variant chiral symmetry discovered by Luscher in
the Ginsparg-Wilson description of lattice chiral fermions is analyzed. It is
shown that the group contains an infinite number of linearly independent
symmetry generators, and the Lie algebra is given explicitly. CP is an
automorphism of the chiral group, and the CP transformation properties of the
symmetry generators is found. Features of the currents associated with these
symmetries are discussed, including the fact that some different, non-commuting
symmetry generators lead to the same Noether current. These strange features
occur in all implementations of lattice fermions based on the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation, including overlap, domain-wall, and perfect-action chiral fermions.
The conclusions are illustrated in a solvable example, free overlap fermions.
