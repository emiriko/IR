The standard analytic solution to the DGLAP equation in Mellin space is
improved by resumming the large x divergences. Explicit results are given to
next-to-leading order and next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. Numerically,
the theoretical error is found to be reduced by the resummation for a large
range of x.
