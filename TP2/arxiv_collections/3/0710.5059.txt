It has recently been shown that plane-plate heat effusion methods devised for
wide-frequency specific-heat spectroscopy do not give the isobaric specific
heat, but rather the so-called longitudinal specific heat. Here it is shown
that heat effusion in a spherical symmetric geometry also involves the
longitudinal specific heat.
