We observe a distinct anomaly in dielectric permittivity (epsilon') as well
as relaxation time (tao_0) versus temperature (T) pattern at the
antiferromagnetic transition point (T_N) in single crystal of LaMnO3. The
equivalent circuit analysis of the impedance spectra across T_N reveals clear
anomaly in the capacitive component C_0 at T_N. Since no structural transition
takes place across T_N, the anomaly in tao_0 and C_0 at T_N possibly signifies
multiferroicity stemming from coupling between orbital and spin order in
LaMnO3.
