The custodial Randall-Sundrum model based on SU(2)_L X SU(2)_R X U(1)_(B-L)
generates new flavor-changing-neutral-current (FCNC) phenomena at tree level,
mediated by Kaluza-Klein neutral gauge bosons. Based on two natural assumptions
of universal 5D Yukawa couplings and no-cancellation in explaining the observed
standard model fermion mixing matrices, we determine the bulk Dirac mass
parameters. Phenomenological constraints from lepton-flavor-violations are also
used to specify the model. From the comprehensive study of B->K* l+ l'-, we
found that only the B->K*ee decay has sizable new physics effects. The zero
value position of the forward-backward asymmetry in this model is also
evaluated, with about 5% deviation from the SM result. Other effective
observables are also suggested such as the ratio of two differential (or
partially integrated) decay rates of B->K*ee and B->K*mu mu. For the first KK
gauge boson mass of M_A^(1)=2-4 TeV, we can have about 10-20% deviation from
the SM results.
