We study the influence of three laser beams on the center of mass motion of
cold atoms with internal energy levels in a tripod configuration. We show that
similar to electrons in graphene the atomic motion can be equivalent to the
dynamics of ultra-relativistic two-component Dirac fermions. We propose and
analyze an experimental setup for observing such a quasi-relativistic motion of
ultracold atoms. We demonstrate that the atoms can experience negative
refraction and focussing by Veselago-type lenses. We also show how the chiral
nature of the atomic motion manifests itself as an oscillation of the atomic
internal state population which depends strongly on the direction of the center
of mass motion. For certain directions an atom remains in its initial state,
whereas for other directions the populations undergo oscillations between a
pair of internal states.
