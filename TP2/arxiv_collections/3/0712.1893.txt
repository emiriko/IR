The influence of random surface roughness of Au films on the Casimir force is
explored with atomic force microscopy in the plate-sphere geometry. The
experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions for separations
ranging between 20 and 200 nm. The optical response and roughness of the Au
films were measured and used as input in theoretical predictions. It is found
that at separations below 100 nm, the roughness effect is manifested through a
strong deviation from the normal scaling of the force with separation distance.
Moreover, deviations from theoretical predictions based on perturbation theory
can be larger than 100%.
