The anti-de Sitter space/conformal field theory correspondence (AdS/CFT) can
potentially provide a complete formulation of string theory on a landscape of
stable and metastable vacua that naturally give rise to eternal inflation. As a
model for this process, we consider bubble solutions with de Sitter interiors,
obtained by patching together dS and Schwarzschild-AdS solutions along a bubble
wall. For an interesting subclass of these solutions the bubble wall reaches
spacelike infinity in the black hole interior. Including the effects of
perturbations leads to a null singularity emanating from this point. Such
solutions are interpreted as states in a single CFT, and are shown to be
compatible with holographic entropy bounds. The construction suggests de Sitter
entropy be interpreted as the total number of degrees of freedom in effective
field theory, with a novel adaptive stepsize cutoff.
