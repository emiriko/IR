In lattice QCD spectrum calculations, it is desirable to obtain multiple
excited state energies in each symmetry channel. Typically, one constructs
several interpolating operators for the symmetry channel of interest, forms the
`correlator matrix' of all possible two-point functions, and uses the
variational method to obtain as many energy levels as possible. We present a
detailed look at this last step, starting from a discussion of the symmetry
properties and spectral structure of the correlator matrix. We continue by
motivating and describing the variational method, before discussing some
conceptual and practical challenges concerning the light baryon sector. We
conclude by mentioning some alternate spectrum extraction methods currently
under study. Throughout, we attempt to quantify all approximations and
assumptions, and we illustrate our points using a nucleon correlator matrix
estimated on dynamical two-flavor lattice data.
