We present a comprehensive numerical study on the ground state phase diagram
of the two-dimensional hardcore boson extended Hubbard model with nearest
($V_1$) and next nearest neighbor ($V_2$) repulsions. In addition to the
quantum solid and superfluid phases, we report the existence of striped
supersolid and three-quarter (quarter) filled supersolid at commensurate
density $\rho=0.75$ (0.25) due to the interplay of $V_1$ and $V_2$
interactions. The nature of three-quarter filled supersolid and the associated
quantum solid will be discussed. Quantum phase transition between the two
supersolids of different symmetries is observed and is clearly of first order.
