We study an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game with two layered graphs,
where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure on which the interactions
are taking place and the upper layer represents the connections for the
strategy adoption (learning) mechanism. This system is investigated by means of
Monte Carlo simulations and an extended pair-approximation method. We consider
the average density of cooperators in the stationary state for a fixed
interaction graph, while varying the number of edges in the learning graph.
According to the Monte Carlo simulations, the cooperation is modified
substantially in a way resembling a coherence-resonance-like behavior when the
number of learning edges is increased. This behavior is reproduced by the
analytical results.
