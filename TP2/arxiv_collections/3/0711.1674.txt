We present an approach of the kicked rotor quantum resonances in
position-space, based on its analogy with the optical Talbot effect. This
approach leads to a very simple picture of the physical mechanism underlying
the dynamics and to analytical expressions for relevant physical quantities,
such as mean momentum or kinetic energy. The ballistic behavior, which is
closely associated to quantum resonances, is analyzed and shown to emerge from
a coherent adding of successive kicks applied to the rotor thanks to a periodic
reconstruction of the spatial wavepacket.
