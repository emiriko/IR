The ability to predict the morphology of crystals formed by chemical
reactions is of fundamental importance for the shape-controlled synthesis of
nanostructures. Based on the atomistic mechanism for crystal growth under
different driving forces, we have developed morphology diagrams to predict
regimes for the growth of two-dimensional crystals. By using controlled
reactions for crystal growth in the absence of surfactants/capping agents, we
demonstrate the validity of this approach for the formation of 2-D structures
of Au, Ag, Pt, Pd and hydroxyapatite.
