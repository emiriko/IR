In this paper we show that it is possible to derive non-perturbative
superpotential terms from a stringy instanton without introducing orientifold
planes. The instanton is realized by a Euclidean D brane wrapping a non-trivial
cycle upon which we also wrap a single space-filling D brane. The standard
problem of unwanted neutral fermionic zero modes is evaded by the appearance of
couplings to charged bosonic zero modes in the instanton moduli action. Since
the Euclidean D brane wraps a cycle which is not associated to any low energy
gauge dynamics, it can not be interpreted as an ordinary gauge instanton, but
rather as a stringy one. By considering such a brane configuration at an
orbifold singularity, we can explicitly evaluate the instanton moduli space
integral and find a holomorphic superpotential term with the structure of a
baryonic mass term.
