The growth in number and nature of dynamical attractors in Kauffman NK
network models are still not well understood properties of these important
random boolean networks. Structural circuits in the underpinning graph give
insights into the number and length distribution of attractors in the NK model.
We use a fast direct circuit enumeration algorithm to study the NK model and
determine the growth behaviour of structural circuits. This leads to an
explanation and lower bound on the growth properties and the number of
attractor loops and a possible K-relationship for circuit number growth with
network size N. We also introduce a mixed-K model that allows us to explore <K>
between pairs of integer K values in Kauffman-like systems. We find that the
circuits' behaviour is a useful metric in identifying phase transitional
behaviour around the critical connectivity in that model too. We identify an
intermediate phase transition in circuit growth behaviour at K_S approximately
1.5, that is distinct from both the percolation transition at K_P = 1 and the
Kauffman transition at K_C = 2. We relate this transition to mutual node
reachability within the giant component of nodes.
