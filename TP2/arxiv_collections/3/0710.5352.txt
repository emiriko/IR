The hybrid meson is one of the most interesting new hadron specie beyond the
naive quark model. It acquire a great attention both from the theoretical and
experimental efforts. Many good candidates have been claimed to be observed,
but there is no absolute confirmation about existence of hybrid mesons. In the
present work we propose new calculations of the masses and decay widths of the
hybrid mesons in the context of constituent gluon model.
