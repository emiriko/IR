We point out a limitation of the existing supergravity tensor calculus on the
$S^1/Z_2$ orbifold that prevents its use for constructing general
supersymmetric bulk-plus-brane actions. We report on the progress achieved in
removing this limitation via the development of ``supersymmetry without
boundary conditions.''
