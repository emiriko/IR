We show that qubits coupled sequentially to a mesoscopic static completely
mixed spin bath via the Heisenberg interaction can become highly entangled.
Straightforward protocols for the generation of multipartite entangled
(Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-)states are presented. We show the feasibility of
an experimental realization in a quantum dot by the hyperfine interaction of an
electron with the nuclear spins.
