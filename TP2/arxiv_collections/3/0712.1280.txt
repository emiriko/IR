The MINOS experiment at Fermilab has released an updated result on muon
disappearance based upon 2.5 x 10^20 protons on target. The experiment utilizes
the intense source of muon neutrinos provided by the NuMI beam line. This note
summarizes the systematic uncertainties in the experiment's knowledge of the
flux and energy spectrum of the neutrinos from NuMI.
