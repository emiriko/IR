Is there an approach to quantum gravity which is conceptually simple, relies
on very few fundamental physical principles and ingredients, emphasizes
geometric (as opposed to algebraic) properties, comes with a definite numerical
approximation scheme, and produces robust results, which go beyond showing mere
internal consistency of the formalism? The answer is a resounding yes: it is
the attempt to construct a nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity, valid on
all scales, with the technique of so-called Causal Dynamical Triangulations.
Despite its conceptual simplicity, the results obtained up to now are far from
trivial. Most remarkable at this stage is perhaps the fully dynamical emergence
of a classical background (and solution to the Einstein equations) from a
nonperturbative sum over geometries, without putting in any preferred geometric
background at the outset. In addition, there is concrete evidence for the
presence of a fractal spacetime foam on Planckian distance scales. The
availability of a computational framework provides built-in reality checks of
the approach, whose importance can hardly be overestimated.
