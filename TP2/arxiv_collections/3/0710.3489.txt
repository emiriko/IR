The proposal is submitted for the measurement of the relativistic length
contraction using the nanoscopic dumbbell moving in LHC or ILC. Some paradoxes
concerning the length contraction and simultaneity are discussed. The dynamical
states of rods and strings accelerated by the gravitational field and
non-gravitational field are discussed. The realizaton of the acceleration of
the nanotube charged dumbbell in LHC, ILC and other accelerators is evidently
the prestige problem for the experts working in the accelerator physiocs.
