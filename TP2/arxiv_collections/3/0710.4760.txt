Low power oriented circuit optimization consists in selecting the best
alternative between gate sizing, buffer insertion and logic structure
transformation, for satisfying a delay constraint at minimum area cost. In this
paper we used a closed form model of delay in CMOS structures to define metrics
for a deterministic selection of the optimization alternative. The target is
delay constraint satisfaction with minimum area cost. We validate the design
space exploration method, defining maximum and minimum delay bounds on logical
paths. Then we adapt this method to a "constant sensitivity method" allowing to
size a circuit at minimum area under a delay constraint. An optimisation
protocol is finally defined to manage the trade-off performance constraint -
circuit structure. These methods are implemented in an optimization tool (POPS)
and validated by comparing on a 0.25$\mu$m process, the optimization efficiency
obtained on various benchmarks (ISCAS?85) to that resulting from an industrial
tool.
