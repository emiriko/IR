Femtosecond multiphoton pump-probe photoionization is applied to helium
nanodroplets doped with rubidium (Rb). The yield of Rb+ ions features
pronounced quantum interference (QI) fringes demonstrating the coherence of a
superposition of electronic states on a time scale of tens of picoseconds.
Furthermore, we observe QI in the yield of formed RbHe exciplex molecules. The
quantum interferogram allows to determine the vibrational structure of these
unstable molecules. From a sliced Fourier analysis one can not only extract the
population dynamics of vibrational states but also follow their energetic
evolution during the RbHe formation.
