Characterization of semiconductor devices is used to gather as much data
about the device as possible to determine weaknesses in design or trends in the
manufacturing process. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple trip point
characterization concept to overcome the constraint of single trip point
concept in device characterization phase. In addition, we use computational
intelligence techniques (e.g. neural network, fuzzy and genetic algorithm) to
further manipulate these sets of multiple trip point values and tests based on
semiconductor test equipments, Our experimental results demonstrate an
excellent design parameter variation analysis in device characterization phase,
as well as detection of a set of worst case tests that can provoke the worst
case variation, while traditional approach was not capable of detecting them.
