We discuss recent results on a new analysis regarding models showing
Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), and in particular on the OFC one. We show
that Probability Density Functions (PDFs) for the avalanche size differences at
different times have fat tails with a q-Gaussian shape. This behavior does not
depend on the time interval adopted and it is also found when considering
energy differences between real earthquakes.
