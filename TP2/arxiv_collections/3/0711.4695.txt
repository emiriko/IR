The transit times are obtained for a symmetrized (two identical bosons) and
an antisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.
Considering two identical particles symmetrically impinging on a
one-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that the phase time and the dwell time
give connected results where, however, the exact position of the scattered
particles is explicitly determined by the phase time (group delay). For the
antisymmetrized wave function configuration, an unusual effect of {\em
accelerated} transmission is clearly identified in a simultaneous tunneling of
two identical fermions.
