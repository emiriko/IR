Simple coarse-grained hydrophobic-polar models for heteropolymers as the
lattice HP and the off-lattice AB model allow a general classification of
characteristic behaviors for hydrophobic-core based tertiary folding. The
strongly reduced computational efforts enable one to reveal systematically the
thermodynamic properties of comparatively long sequences in a wide temperature
range of conformational activity. Based on a suitable cooperativity parameter,
characteristic folding channels and free-energy landscapes, which have strong
similarities with realistic folding paths, can be analysed.
