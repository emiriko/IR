Dirac equation written on the boundary of the Nutku helicoid space consists
of a system of ordinary differential equations. We tried to analyze this system
and we found that it has a higher singularity than those of the Heun's
equations which give the solutions of the Dirac equation in the bulk. We also
lose an independent integral of motion on the boundary. This facts explain why
we could not find the solution of the system on the boundary in terms of known
functions. We make the stability analysis of the helicoid and catenoid cases
and end up with an appendix which gives a new example where one encounters a
form of the Heun equation.
