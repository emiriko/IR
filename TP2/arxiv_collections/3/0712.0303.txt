Baryon-strangeness correlation (C$_{BS}$) has been investigated with a
multi-phase transport model (AMPT) in $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The centrality dependence of C$_{BS}$ is presented
within the model, from partonic phase to hadronic matter. We find that the
system still reserve partial predicted signatures of C$_{BS}$ after parton
coalescence. But after hadronic rescattering, the predicted signatures will be
obliterated completely. So it seems that both coalescence hadronization process
and hadronic rescattering are responsible for the disappearance of the C$_{BS}$
signatures.
