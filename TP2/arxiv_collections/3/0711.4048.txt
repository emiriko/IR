Traditional close-coupling methods suppose an expansion of the total wave
function in terms of inner stationary states of colliding subsystems. In the
case of hadronic atoms, a similar expansion has to involve, \emph{inter alia},
low angular momentum states (ns, np) with large annihilation or nuclear
absorbtion widths. The life times of these states are small as compared with
the collision time and mean time between subsequent collisions, therefore the
close-coupling approach has to be modified for the similar problems.
  In this paper we propose a generalization of the close-coupling method with
annihilating states included in the basis. The correct asymptotic behaviour of
the wave function in the annihilating channels suppose that the annihilating
states can not be presented in the incoming channels whereas the corresponding
components of the wave function of relative motion in outgoing channels have to
damp out at large distances. The S-matrix of the transitions in the subspace of
all other (non-annihilating) states is not unitary, because the hamiltonian of
the problem is non-hermitian. The unitary defect gives the cross section of
induced annihilation. The scheme of the numerical solving of the generalized
close-coupling equations is proposed. It includes the calculations of two types
of solution, from the origin to an intermediate sewing point R=a and from a
large R to the point a.
