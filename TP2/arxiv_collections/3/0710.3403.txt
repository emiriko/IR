We shortly report on the two-photon decay width of the light $\sigma$-meson
interpreted as a quarkonium state. Results are given in dependence on the
$\sigma$-mass and the constituent mass of the light quark. The triangle
quark-loop diagram, responsible for the two-photon transition, is carefully
evaluated: a term in the transition amplitude, often omitted in literature,
results in destructive interference with the leading term. As a result we show
that the two-photon decay width of the $\sigma $ in the quarkonium picture is
less than 1 keV for the physical range of parameters.
