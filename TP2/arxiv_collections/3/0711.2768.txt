In Phys. Rev. A. 76, 056301 (2007), He claimed that the proof in my earlier
paper [Phys. Rev. A 75, 012327 (2007)] is insufficient to conclude the
insecurity of all quantum string seals because my measurement strategy cannot
obtain non-trivial information on the sealed string and escape detection at the
same time. Here, I clarify that our disagreement comes from our adoption of two
different criteria on the minimum amount of information a quantum string seal
can reveal to members of the public. I also point out that He did not follow my
measurement strategy correctly.
