For the free group $F_{N}$ of finite rank $N \geq 2$ we construct a canonical
Bonahon-type continuous and $Out(F_N)$-invariant \emph{geometric intersection
form} \[ <, >: \bar{cv}(F_N)\times Curr(F_N)\to \mathbb R_{\ge 0}. \]
  Here $\bar{cv}(F_N)$ is the closure of unprojectivized Culler-Vogtmann's
Outer space $cv(F_N)$ in the equivariant Gromov-Hausdorff convergence topology
(or, equivalently, in the length function topology). It is known that
$\bar{cv}(F_N)$ consists of all \emph{very small} minimal isometric actions of
$F_N$ on $\mathbb R$-trees. The projectivization of $\bar{cv}(F_N)$ provides a
free group analogue of Thurston's compactification of the Teichm\"uller space.
  As an application, using the \emph{intersection graph} determined by the
intersection form, we show that several natural analogues of the curve complex
in the free group context have infinite diameter.
