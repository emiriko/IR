We study a slow relaxation process in a frustrated spin system in which a
type of screening effect due to a frustrated environment plays an important
role. This screening effect is attributed to the highly degenerate
configurations of the frustrated environment. This slow relaxation is due to an
entropy effect and is different from those due to the energy barrier observed
in systems such as random ferromagnets. In the present system, even if there is
no energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this
phenomenon ``entropic slowing down''. Here, we study the mechanism of entropic
slowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated
bonds. The spins included in decorated bonds (decoration spins) cause a
peculiar density of states, which causes on entropy-induced screening effect.
We analytically estimate the time scale of the system that increases
exponentially with the number of decoration spins. We demonstrate the scaling
of relaxation processes using the time scale at all temperatures including the
critical point.
