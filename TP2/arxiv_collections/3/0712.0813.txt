We describe a new, parallel programming version of the scalar field
simulation program LATTICEEASY. The new C++ program, CLUSTEREASY, can simulate
arbitrary scalar field models on distributed-memory clusters. The speed and
memory requirements scale well with the number of processors. As with the
serial version of LATTICEEASY, CLUSTEREASY can run simulations in one, two, or
three dimensions, with or without expansion of the universe, with customizable
parameters and output. The program and its full documentation are available on
the LATTICEEASY website at
http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Physics/fstaff/gfelder/latticeeasy/.
In this paper we provide a brief overview of what CLUSTEREASY does and the ways
in which it does and doesn't differ from the serial version of LATTICEEASY.
