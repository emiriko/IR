The ${\bm E}\times{\bm B}$ drift motion of charged test particle dynamics in
the Scrape Off Layer (SOL)is analyzed to investigate a transport control
strategy based on Hamiltonian dynamics. We model SOL turbulence using a 2D
non-linear fluid code based on interchange instability which was found to
exhibit intermittent dynamics of the particle flux. The effect of a small and
appropriate modification of the turbulent electric potential is studied with
respect to the chaotic diffusion of test particle dynamics. Over a significant
range in the magnitude of the turbulent electrostatic field, a three-fold
reduction of the test particle diffusion coefficient is achieved.
