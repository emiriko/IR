We give an overview of state-of-the-art multi-loop Feynman diagram
computations, and explain how we use symbolic manipulation to generate
renormalized integrals that are then evaluated numerically. We explain how we
automate BPHZ renormalization using "henges" and "sectors", and give a brief
description of the symbolic tensor and Dirac gamma-matrix manipulation that is
required. We shall compare the use of general computer algebra systems such as
Maple with domain-specific languages such as
  FORM, highlighting in particular memory management issues.
