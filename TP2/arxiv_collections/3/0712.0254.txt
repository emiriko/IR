We study the role of diquarks in light baryons through point to point baryon
correlators. We contrast results from quenched simulations with ones with two
flavors of dynamical overlap fermions. The scalar, pseudoscalar and axial
vector diquarks are combined with light quarks to form color singlets. The
quenched simulation shows large zero mode effects in correlators containing the
scalar and pseudoscalar diquark. The two scalar diquarks created by gamma_5 and
gamma_0gamma_5 lead to different behavior in baryon correlators, showing that
the interaction of diquarks with the third light quark matters: we do not see
an isolated diquark. In our quark mass range, the scalar diquark created by
gamma_5 seems to play a greater role than the others.
