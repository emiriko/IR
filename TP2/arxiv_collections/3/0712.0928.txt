We study the Galois actions on the l-adic schematic and Artin-Mazur homotopy
groups of algebraic varieties. For proper varieties of good reduction over a
local field K, we show that the l-adic schematic homotopy groups are mixed
representations explicitly determined by the Galois action on cohomology of
Weil sheaves, whenever l is not equal to the residue characteristic p of K. For
quasi-projective varieties of good reduction, there is a similar
characterisation involving the Gysin spectral sequence. When l=p, a slightly
weaker result is proved by comparing the crystalline and p-adic schematic
homotopy types. Under favourable conditions, a comparison theorem transfers all
these descriptions to the Artin-Mazur homotopy groups.
