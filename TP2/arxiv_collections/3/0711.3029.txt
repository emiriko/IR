The MINERvA neutrino interaction experiment in the NuMI beam at Fermilab will
measure several aspects of neutrino interactions in the few GeV energy region.
We will make cross section and form factor measurements using a fine-grained
fully active scintillator (CH) target, and also investigate nuclear effects on
neutrino interactions as well as hadron rescattering using integral nuclear
targets made of helium, carbon, iron, and lead. We will improve or add to
existing measurements and address some specific questions that are important
for current and upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments. This paper reports
on the progress toward the design, construction, and calibration of the
detector, which we expect will get its first neutrino beam in 2009.
