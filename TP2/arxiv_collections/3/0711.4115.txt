The semi-classical approximation to black hole partition functions is not
well-defined, because the classical action is unbounded and the first variation
of the uncorrected action does not vanish for all variations preserving the
boundary conditions. Both problems can be solved by adding a Hamilton-Jacobi
counterterm. I show that the same problem and solution arises in quantum
mechanics for half-binding potentials.
