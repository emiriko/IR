This work introduces a method for constructing polyphase alternating codes in
which the length of a code transmission cycle can be $p^m$ or $p-1$, where $p$
is a prime number and $m$ is a positive integer. The relevant properties
leading to the construction alternating codes and the algorithm for generating
alternating codes is described. Examples of all practical and some not that
practical polyphase code lengths are given.
