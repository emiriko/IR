We study damping of a dipole oscillation in a Bose-Condensed gas in a
combined cigar-shaped harmonic trap and one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice
potential at finite temperatures. In order to include the effect of thermal
excitations in the radial direction, we derive a quasi-1D model of the
Gross-Pitaeavskii equation and the Bogoliubov equations. We use the Popov
approximation to calculate the temperature dependence of the condensate
fraction with varying lattice depth. We then calculate the Landau damping rate
of a dipole oscillation as a function of the lattice depth and temperature. The
damping rate increases with increasing lattice depth, which is consistent with
experimental observations. The magnitude of the damping rate is in reasonable
agreement with experimental data. We also find that the damping rate has a
strong temperature dependence, showing a sharp increase with increasing
temperature. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the radial thermal
excitations in both equilibrium properties and the Landau damping.
