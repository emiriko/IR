We present the results of searches by the CDF and D\O{} Collaborations for
Higgs boson production in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96 {\rm TeV}$.
The searches are performed in the $WW^*$ channel with $1 {\rm fb}^{-1}$ of
data. In the absence of signal the results are used to set a limit on the Higgs
production cross section times branching ratio.
