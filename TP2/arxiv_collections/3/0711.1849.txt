We study numerically the maximal and minimal height distributions (MAHD,
MIHD) of the nonlinear interface growth equations of second and fourth order
and of related lattice models in two dimensions. MAHD and MIHD are different
due to the asymmetry of the local height distribution, so that, in each class,
the sign of the relevant nonlinear term determines which one of two universal
curves is the MAHD and the MIHD. The average maximal and minimal heights scale
as the average roughness, in contrast to Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) growth. All
extreme height distributions, including the EW ones, have tails that cannot be
fit by generalized Gumbel distributions.
