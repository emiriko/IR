We examine the structure of the insertion-elimination Lie algebra on rooted
trees introduced in \cite{CK}. It possesses a triangular structure $\g = \n_+
\oplus \mathbb{C}.d \oplus \n_-$, like the Heisenberg, Virasoro, and affine
algebras. We show in particular that it is simple, which in turn implies that
it has no finite-dimensional representations. We consider a category of
lowest-weight representations, and show that irreducible representations are
uniquely determined by a "lowest weight" $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$. We show that
each irreducible representation is a quotient of a Verma-type object, which is
generically irreducible.
