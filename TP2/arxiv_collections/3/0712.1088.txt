A series of endofullerenes Ag@C60 with different symmetry are calculated at
ab initio level. The lowest energy structure is completely asymmetrical one
(C1), in which the endo-atom has noticeably off-centre position. The
symmetrical structures are less stable. Silver atom in the Ag@C60 (C1)
endofullerene has the low negative charge and high spin density.
