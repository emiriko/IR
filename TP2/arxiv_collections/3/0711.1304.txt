The proliferation and migration dichotomy of the tumor cell invasion is
examined within a two-component continuous time random walk (CTRW) model. The
balance equations for the cancer cells of two phenotypes with random switching
between cell proliferation and migration are derived. The transport of tumor
cells is formulated in terms of the CTRW with an arbitrary waiting time
distribution law, while proliferation is modelled by a logistic growth. The
overall rate of tumor cell invasion for normal diffusion and subdiffusion is
determined.
