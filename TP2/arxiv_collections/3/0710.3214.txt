Using the density functional theory, we have demonstrated the chemical
functionalization of semiconducting graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with
Stone-Wales (SW) defects by carboxyl (COOH) groups. It is found that the
geometrical structures and electronic properties of the GNRs changed
significantly, and the electrical conductivity of the system could be
considerably enhanced by mono-adsorption and double-adsorption of COOH, which
sensitively depends upon the axial concentration of SW defects COOH pairs
(SWDCPs). With the increase of the axial concentration of SWDCPs, the system
would transform from semiconducting behavior to p-type metallic behavior. This
fact makes GNRs a possible candidate for chemical sensors and nanoelectronic
devices based on graphene nanoribbons.
