We present a study of excited charm-strange baryon states produced in
$e^+e^-$ annihilations at or near a center-of-mass energy of
$10.58\mathrm{Ge\kern -0.1em V}$, in a data sample with an integrated
luminosity of $384 fb^{-1}$ recorded with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II
$e^+e^-$ storage rings at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We study
strong decays of charm-strange baryons to $\Lambda_c^+K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle
S}$, $\Lambda_c^+K^-$, $\Lambda_c^+K^-\pi^+$,
$\Lambda_c^+K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}\pi^-$,
$\Lambda_c^+K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S}\pi^-\pi^+$, and
$\Lambda_c^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$. This study confirms the existence of the states
$\Xi_c(2980)^+$, $\Xi_c(3077)^+$, and $\Xi_c(3077)^0$, with a more accurate
determination of the $\Xi_c(2980)^+$ mass and width. We also present evidence
for two new states, $\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and $\Xi_c(3123)^+$, decaying through the
intermediate resonant modes $\Sigma_c(2455)^{++}K^-$ and
$\Sigma_c(2520)^{++}K^-$, respectively. For each of these baryons, we measure
the yield in each final state, determine the statistical significance, and
calculate the product of the production cross-section and branching fractions.
We also measure the masses and widths of these excited charm-strange baryons.
