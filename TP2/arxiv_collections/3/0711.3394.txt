Fermions play an essential role in many areas of quantum physics and it is
desirable to understand the nature of entanglement within systems that consists
of fermions. Whereas the issue of separability for bipartite fermions has
extensively been studied in the present literature, this paper is concerned
with maximally entangled fermions. A complete characterization of maximally
entangled quasifree (gaussian) fermion states is given in terms of the
covariance matrix. This result can be seen as a step towards distillation
protocols for maximally entangled fermions.
