Electric field gradient effects induced by an asymmetrically in-plane shaped
GaAs/AlGaAs modulation-doped structures of various design are investigated
within 4-300 K temperature range. It is demonstrated that current-voltage
characteristics of such structures at low, 4-80 K, temperatures exhibit
well-pronounced asymmetry arising due to a presence of two different gradients
of the electric field in a two dimensional electron gas. This phenomenon is
caused by both, different accumulation of two-dimensional electrons due to
asymmetrical shape of the structure and nonlocality in the electron drift
velocity. Experiments are illustrated by a phenomenological model and Monte
Carlo simulation. Possible applications of the effect to detect electromagnetic
radiation of GHz and THz frequencies are discussed as well.
