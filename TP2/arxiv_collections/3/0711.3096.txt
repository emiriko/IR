Let B be the generalized braid group associated to some finite complex
reflection group. We define a representation of B of dimension the number of
reflections of the corresponding reflection group, which generalizes the
Krammer representation of the classical braid groups, and is thus a good
candidate in view of proving the linearity of these groups. We decompose this
representation in irreducible components and compute its Zariski closure, as
well as its restriction to parabolic subgroups. We prove that it is faithful
when W is a Coxeter group of type ADE and odd dihedral types, and conjecture
its faithfulness when W has a single class of reflections. If true, this
conjecture would imply various group-theoretic properties for these groups,
that we prove separately to be true for the other groups.
