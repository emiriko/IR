Two delocalized states of metallic zigzag carbon nanotubes near the Dirac
point can be localized by the Aharanov-Bohm magnetic field around 20 Tesla. The
dependence of the localization on the length and diameter of the nanotubes
shows that the localization-delocalization transition can be observed for 2 nm
diameter tube. The mechanism of the localization is explained in terms of the
deformation-induced gauge field, which shows a topological nature of the
localization. The transition from the delocalized states to the localized
states can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. A
similarity between the transition and the spin Hall effect is discussed.
