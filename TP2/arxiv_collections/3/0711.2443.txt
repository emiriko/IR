In this note we investigate the connection between polylogarithms on curves
and abelian schemes. The main result shows that the polylogarithm on the
abelian scheme can be obtained as the push-forward of the polylogarithm on a
suitable sub-curve. If the abelian scheme is the Jacobian of a smooth
projective curve, this push-forward can also be written as a cup-product with
the fundamental class of the curve.
