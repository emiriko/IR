With the scaling of technology and higher requirements on performance and
functionality, power dissipation is becoming one of the major design
considerations in the development of network processors. In this paper, we use
an assertion-based methodology for system-level power/performance analysis to
study two dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) techniques, traffic-based DVS and
execution-based DVS, in a network processor model. Using the automatically
generated distribution analyzers, we analyze the power and performance
distributions and study their trade-offs for the two DVS policies with
different parameter settings such as threshold values and window sizes. We
discuss the optimal configurations of the two DVS policies under different
design requirements. By a set of experiments, we show that the assertion-based
trace analysis methodology is an efficient tool that can help a designer easily
compare and study optimal architectural configurations in a large design space.
