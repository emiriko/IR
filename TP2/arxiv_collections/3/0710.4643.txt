Detailed modeling of processors and high performance cycle-accurate
simulators are essential for today's hardware and software design. These
problems are challenging enough by themselves and have seen many previous
research efforts. Addressing both simultaneously is even more challenging, with
many existing approaches focusing on one over another. In this paper, we
propose the Reduced Colored Petri Net (RCPN) model that has two advantages:
first, it offers a very simple and intuitive way of modeling pipelined
processors; second, it can generate high performance cycle-accurate simulators.
RCPN benefits from all the useful features of Colored Petri Nets without
suffering from their exponential growth in complexity. RCPN processor models
are very intuitive since they are a mirror image of the processor pipeline
block diagram. Furthermore, in our experiments on the generated cycle-accurate
simulators for XScale and StrongArm processor models, we achieved an order of
magnitude (~15 times) speedup over the popular SimpleScalar ARM simulator.
