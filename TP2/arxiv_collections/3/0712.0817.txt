We continue the study of spherically symmetric vacuum space-times in loop
quantum gravity by treating the interior of a black hole. We start from a
midi-superspace approach, but a simple gauge fixing leads to a Kantowski--Sachs
form for the variables. We show that one can solve the quantum theory exactly
in the (periodic) connection representation, including the inner product. The
evolution can be solved exactly by de-parameterizing the theory and can be
easily interpreted as a semi-classical evolution plus quantum corrections. A
relational evolution can also be introduced in a precise manner, suggesting
what may happen in situations where it is not possible to de-parameterize. We
show that the singularity is replaced by a bounce at which quantum effects are
important and that the extent of the region at the bounce where one departs
from classical general relativity depends on the initial data.
