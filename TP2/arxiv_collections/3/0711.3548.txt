New interlayer intermolecular potential model was proposed and it represented
``ABAB'' staking of graphite. Hydrogen atom sputtering on graphite surface was
investigated using molecular dynamics simulation. In the initial short time
period, maintaining the flat structure of graphenes, hydrogen atoms brought
about the difference interaction process in each incident energy. The first
graphene often adsorbed 5 eV hydrogen atoms and reflected almost all of 15 eV
hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms which were injected at 30 eV penetrated into
the inside of the graphite surface and were adsorbed between interlayer. The
desorption of C2H2 on the clear graphite surface was observed in only the case
incident at 5 eV. The animation of the MD simulation and radial distribution
function indicated that the graphenes were peeled off one by one at regular
interval. In common to the incident energy, the yielded molecules often had
chain structures terminated by hydrogen atoms. The erosion yield increased
compared with the case of no interlayer intermolecular force.
