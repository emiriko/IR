A "carpet" of torsional Alfven waves, resonantly excited in an annulus inside
a toroidal conducting vessel, could maintain magnetized plasma inside of the
annulus against the inherent outward expansion. Such toroidal magnetic
confinement for fusion could present some advantages over conventional
tokamaks. The idea could also be used to stabilize interchange and ballooning
modes in tokamaks and other interchange-limited fusion devices.
