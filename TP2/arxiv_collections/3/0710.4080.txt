Many of the classic problems of particle physics appear in a very different
light when viewed from the perspective of the multiverse. Most importantly the
two great ``fine tuning'' problems that motivate the field are far less serious
when one accounts for the required anthropic constraints which exist in a
multiverse. However, the challenge then becomes to construct a realistic
physical theory of the multiverse and test it. I describe some phenomenology of
the quark and lepton masses that may provide a window to the theory that
underlies the multiverse.
