Iterated dynamical maps offer an ideal setting to investigate quantum
dynamical bifurcations and are well adapted to few-qubit quantum computer
realisations. We show that a single trapped ion, subject to periodic impulsive
forces, exhibits a rich structure of dynamical bifurcations derived from the
Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian flow model. We show that the entanglement between the
oscillator and electronic degrees of freedom reflects the underlying dynamical
bifurcation in a Floquet eigenstate.
