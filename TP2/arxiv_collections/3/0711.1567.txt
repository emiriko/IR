In the case of large 1-3 mixing angle as sin^2(2theta13 > 0.03, we
investigate the possibility for measuring the leptonic CP phase by using only
nu_mu --> nu_mu oscillations independently of nu_mu --> nu_e oscillations. As
the result, we find that the CP phase can be measured best around the energy
E=0.43 GeV and the baseline length L=5000km without strongly depending on the
uncertainties of other parameters. In this region, the CP phase effect remains
even after averaging over neutrino energy. We also find that there is the CP
sensitivity even in the short baseline length L < 1000 km if Delta m_{31}^2 is
determined with the uncertainty of about 0.1 . In the T2KK experiment, we
explore the possibility for determining Delta m_{31}^2 by using one baseline
from Tokai to Korea and then measuring the CP phase by using the baseline to
Kamioka. As the result, we find that some information of the CP phase can be
obtained from both measurements.
