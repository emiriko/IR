We calculate the nucleon strangeness $y_N$ in the chiral quark model and the
meson cloud model. With the internal relation between the sigma term of
$\pi$$N$ ($\sigma_{\pi N}$) and $y_N$, we present the results of $\sigma_{\pi
N}$ in these two models. Our calculations show that $y_N$ from the chiral quark
model is significant larger than that from the meson cloud model, whereas the
difference of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ between the two models is relatively small. We
also present the results of $\sigma_{K N}$ and $\sigma_{\eta N}$, which could
be determined by $\sigma_{\pi N}$ and $y_N$ from their definition in the
current algebra, and find that these two physical parameters are quite
sensitive to $y_N$. The results indicate the necessity to restrict the
parameters of the two models from more precision measurements.
