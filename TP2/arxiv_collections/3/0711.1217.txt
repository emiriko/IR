Given a space it is easy to obtain the system of geodesic equations on it. In
this paper the inverse problem of reconstructing the space from the geodesic
equations is addressed. A procedure is developed for obtaining the metric
tensor from the Christoffel symbols. The procedure is extended for determining
if a second order quadratically semi-linear system can be expressed as a system
of geodesic equations, provided it has terms only quadratic in the first
derivative apart from the second derivative term. A computer code has been
developed for dealing with larger systems of geodesic equations.
