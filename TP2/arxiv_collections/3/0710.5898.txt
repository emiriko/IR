In this short paper, we shall provide a dynamical systems' proof of the
famous Kraft-McMillan inequality and its converse. Kraft-McMillan inequality is
a basic result in information theory which gives a necessary and sufficient
condition for the lengths of the codewords of a code to be uniquely decodable.
