This review deals with the structure of hadrons, strongly interacting
many-body systems consisting of quarks and gluons. These systems have a size of
about 1 fm, which shows up in scattering experiments at low momentum transfers
$Q$ in the GeV region. At this scale the running coupling constant of Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD), the established theory of the strong interactions,
becomes divergent. It is therefore highly intriguing to explore this theory in
the realm of its strong interaction regime. However, the quarks and gluons can
not be resolved at the GeV scale but have to be studied through their
manifestations in the bound many-body systems, for instance pions, nucleons and
their resonances. The review starts with a short overview of QCD at low
momentum transfer and a summary of the theoretical apparatus describing the
interaction of hadrons with electrons and photons. In the following sections we
present the experimental results for the most significant observables studied
with the electromagnetic probe: form factors, polarizabilities, excitation
spectra, and sum rules. These experimental findings are compared and
interpreted with various theoretical approaches to QCD, such as
phenomenological models with quarks and pions, dispersion relations as a means
to connect observables from different experiments, and, directly based on the
QCD lagrangian, chiral perturbation theory and lattice gauge theory.
