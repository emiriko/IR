The elastic backward proton-deuteron scattering is analyzed including both
relativistic effects in the deuteron and the reaction mechanism. It is shown
that inclusion of the graphs corresponding to the emission, rescattering and
absorption of the virtual pion by a deuteron nucleon in addition to the
one-nucleon exchange graph allows a rather satisfactory description of all the
experimental data on the differential cross section, tensor analyzing power of
the deuteron and transfer polarization in this reaction.
