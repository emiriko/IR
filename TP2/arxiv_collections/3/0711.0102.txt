Defect lines in conformal field theory can be perturbed by chiral defect
fields. If the unperturbed defects satisfy su(2)-type fusion rules, the
operators associated to the perturbed defects are shown to obey functional
relations known from the study of integrable models as T-systems. The procedure
is illustrated for Virasoro minimal models and for Liouville theory.
