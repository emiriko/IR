We compute the three-body decays of charged sleptons and sneutrinos into
other sleptons. These decays are of particular interest in SUSY-breaking models
with non-universal Higgs mass parameters, where the left-chiral sleptons can be
lighter than the right-chiral ones, and lighter than the lightest neutralino.
We present the formulas for the three-body decay widths together with a
numerical analysis in the context of gaugino-mediated SUSY breaking with a
gravitino LSP.
