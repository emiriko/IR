The aim of this paper is to generalize the PAC-Bayesian theorems proved by
Catoni in the classification setting to more general problems of statistical
inference. We show how to control the deviations of the risk of randomized
estimators. A particular attention is paid to randomized estimators drawn in a
small neighborhood of classical estimators, whose study leads to control the
risk of the latter. These results allow to bound the risk of very general
estimation procedures, as well as to perform model selection.
