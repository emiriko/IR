In this paper we propose a method which provides a full description of
solitary wave solutions of the Schroedinger equation with periodically varying
dispersion. This method is based on analysis and polynomial deformation of the
spectrum of an iterative map. Using this method we discover a new family of
antisymmetric bisoliton solutions. In addition to the fact that these solutions
are of interest for nonlinear fiber optics and the theory of nonlinear
Schroedinger equations with periodic coefficients, they have potential
applications for increasing of bit-rate in high speed optical fiber
communications.
