Thermalcycler were extensively used machine for amplify DNA sample. One of
the major problems in the working time was that it spent most of time for
cooling and heating. In order to improve the efficient, this study presented a
novel method for amplify DNA sample. For this concept, the DNA sample in the
silicon chamber which was pushed by a beam through three temperature regions
around a center and then the DNA segments could be amplified rapidly after 30
cycles. The polymerase chain reaction platform was composed of thin-film
heaters, copper plates, DC powers, and temperature controllers. The
photolithography and bulk etching technologies were utilized to construct the
thin-film heater and DNA reaction chambers. Finally, 1 pound gL 100bp DNA
segment of E. coli K12 was amplified successfully within 36 minutes on this PCR
platform.
