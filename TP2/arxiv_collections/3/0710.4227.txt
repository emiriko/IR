The present status of the physics program, which led to the development of
the Monte Carlo event generator PHOKHARA is described. The possibility of using
the radiative return method in various aspects of hadronic physics, from the
measurement of the hadronic cross section, to detailed investigations of the
hadronic dynamics is emphasized. New results are presented showing how to
measure baryon form factors using the knowledge of their spin in
baryon-antibaryon production with subsequent decay.
