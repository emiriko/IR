A two level system resonantly coupled to a single mode cavity field and
subject to ground state occupancy measurement like interaction is considered.
For this situation, the solution to the Lindblad master equation for the
density matrix is obtained with respect to the Jaynes Cummings eigenstate
representation. It is seen that, the rate of decoherence of the superposition
of the Jaynes Cummings eigenstates increases monotonically with the increase in
the occupancy measurement coupling up to a certain critical value (already
reported in the literature in a different context), whereas the rate decreases
with the increase in the measurement coupling beyond the same critical value.
