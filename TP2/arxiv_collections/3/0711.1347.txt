We present a universal Dirac operator for noncommutative spin and spin^c
bundles over fuzzy complex projective spaces. We give an explicit construction
of these bundles, which are described in terms of finite dimensional matrices,
calculate the spectrum and explicitly exhibit the Dirac eigenspinors. To our
knowledge the spin^c spectrum for CP^n with n>=3 is new.
