The HERA collider with its center of mass energy of 318 GeV makes it possible
to study a wide range of electroweak physics as well as to search for physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this article, recent results, obtained by
the two collider experiments H1 and ZEUS, are reviewed. The cross sections for
inclusive neutral current and charged current processes are shown, and results
from a combined electroweak and QCD analysis of the data are discussed.
Selected results from searches for physics beyond the SM are presented.
