A CMOS harmonic signal LC oscillator driver for automotive applications
working in a harsh environment with high safety critical requirements is
described. The driver can be used with a wide range of external components
parameters (LC resonance network of a sensor). Quality factor of the external
LC network can vary two decades. Amplitude regulation of the driver is
digitally controlled and the DAC is constructed as exponential with
piece-wise-linear (PWL) approximation. Low current consumption for high quality
resonance networks is achieved. Realized oscillator is robust, used in safety
critical application and has low EMC emissions.
