Relativistic Hartree-Fock method together with many-body perturbation theory
and configuration interaction techniques are used to calculate relativistic
energy shifts for frequencies of the strong electric dipole transitions of C
III, C IV, Na I, Mg I, Mg II, Al II, Al III, Si IV, Ca II and Zn II. These
transitions are used for search of the variation of the fine structure constant
in quasar absorption spectra. The results are in good agreement with previous
calculations. The analysis of Breit contributions is also presented.
