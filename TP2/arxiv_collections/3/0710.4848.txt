Formal verification techniques have been playing an important role in
pre-silicon validation processes. One of the most important points considered
in performing formal verification is to define good verification scopes; we
should define clearly what to be verified formally upon designs under tests. We
considered the following three practical requirements when we defined the scope
of formal verification. They are (a) hard to verify (b) small to handle, and
(c) easy to understand. Our novel approach is to break down generic properties
for system into stereotype properties in block level and to define requirements
for Verifiable RTL. Consequently, each designer instead of verification experts
can describe properties of the design easily, and formal model checking can be
applied systematically and thoroughly to all the leaf modules. During the
development of a component chip for server platforms, we focused on RAS
(Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) features and described more
than 2000 properties in PSL. As a result of the formal verification, we found
several critical logic bugs in a short time with limited resources, and
successfully verified all of them. This paper presents a study of the
functional verification methodology.
