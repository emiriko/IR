A tetra of sets which elements are time series of interbeats has been
obtained from the databank Physionet-MIT-BIH, corresponding to the following
failures at the humans' heart: Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Congestive Heart
Failure, and Atrial Fibrillation. Those times series has been analyzed
statistically using an already known technique based on the Wavelet and Hilbert
Transforms. That technique has been applied to the time series of interbeats
for 87 patients, in order to find out the dynamics of the heart. The size of
the times series varies around 7 to 24 h. while the kind of wavelet selected
for this study has been any one of: Daubechies, Biortoghonal, and Gaussian. The
analysis has been done for the complet set of scales ranging from: 1-128
heartbeats. Choosing the Biorthogonal wavelet: bior3.1, it is observed: (a)
That the time series hasn't to be cutted in shorter periods, with the purpose
to obtain the collapsing of the data, (b) An analytical, universal behavior of
the data, for the first and second diseases, but not for the third.
