Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model are based on extended gauge
symmetries and predict the existence of new heavy particles, often at the TeV
scale. Such particles include heavy W and Z bosons, doubly charged higgses,
heavy majorana neutrinos, leptoquarks and heavy fermions. The discovery
potential of the LHC, which will start in 2008, for various particles predicted
in extended gauge theories will be described in this paper.
