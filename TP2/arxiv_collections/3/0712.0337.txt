The existence of a phase transition with diverging susceptibility in batch
Minority Games (MGs) is the mark of informationally efficient regimes and is
linked to the specifics of the agents' learning rules. Here we study how the
standard scenario is affected in a mixed population game in which agents with
the `optimal' learning rule (i.e. the one leading to efficiency) coexist with
ones whose adaptive dynamics is sub-optimal. Our generic finding is that any
non-vanishing intensive fraction of optimal agents guarantees the existence of
an efficient phase. Specifically, we calculate the dependence of the critical
point on the fraction $q$ of `optimal' agents focusing our analysis on three
cases: MGs with market impact correction, grand-canonical MGs and MGs with
heterogeneous comfort levels.
