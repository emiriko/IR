Let $(W,S)$ be an arbitrary Coxeter system. For each word $\omega$ in the
generators we define a partial order--called the {\sf $\omega$-sorting
order}--on the set of group elements $W_\omega\subseteq W$ that occur as
subwords of $\omega$. We show that the $\omega$-sorting order is a
supersolvable join-distributive lattice and that it is strictly between the
weak and Bruhat orders on the group. Moreover, the $\omega$-sorting order is a
"maximal lattice" in the sense that the addition of any collection of Bruhat
covers results in a nonlattice. Along the way we define a class of structures
called {\sf supersolvable antimatroids} and we show that these are equivalent
to the class of supersolvable join-distributive lattices.
