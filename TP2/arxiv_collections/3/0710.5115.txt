We report the results obtained by cavitating water solutions of iron salts
(iron chloride and iron nitrate) with different concentrations at different
ultrasound powers. In all cases we detected a neutron radiation well higher
than the background level. The neutron production is perfectly reproducible and
can at some extent be controlled. These evidences for neutron emission
generated by cavitation support some preliminary clues for the possibility of
piezonuclear reactions (namely nuclear reactions induced by pressure and shock
waves) obtained in the last ten years. We have been able for the first time to
state some basic features of such a neutron emission induced by cavitation,
namely: 1) a marked threshold behavior in power, energy and time; 2) its
occurring without a concomitant production of gamma radiation.
