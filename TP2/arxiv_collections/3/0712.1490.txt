A Fabry-Perot-type interferometer is experimentally realized for electrons in
a semiconductor device. A special experimental geometry creates interference
conditions for co-propagating electrons in quantum Hall edge states, which
results in oscillations of the current through the device. The visibility of
these oscillations is found to increase at the high-field edge of the quantum
Hall plateau.
