It is a challenge to manage complex systems efficiently without confronting
NP-hard problems. To address the situation we suggest to use self-organization
processes of prime integer relations for information processing.
Self-organization processes of prime integer relations define correlation
structures of a complex system and can be equivalently represented by
transformations of two-dimensional geometrical patterns determining the
dynamics of the system and revealing its structural complexity. Computational
experiments raise the possibility of an optimality condition of complex systems
presenting the structural complexity of a system as a key to its optimization.
  From this perspective the optimization of a system could be all about the
control of the structural complexity of the system to make it consistent with
the structural complexity of the problem. The experiments also indicate that
the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of the
structural complexity. Therefore, once the structural complexity could be
controlled as a single entity, the optimization of a complex system would be
potentially reduced to a one-dimensional concave optimization irrespective of
the number of variables involved its description. This might open a way to a
new type of information processing for efficient management of complex systems.
