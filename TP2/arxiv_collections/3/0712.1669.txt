We discuss solution concepts for linear hyperbolic equations with
coefficients of regularity below Lipschitz continuity. Thereby our focus is on
theories which are based either on a generalization of the method of
characteristics or on refined techniques concerning energy estimates. We
provide a series of examples both as simple illustrations of the notions and
conditions involved but also to show logical independence among the concepts.
