Forbidden ordinal patterns are ordinal patterns (or `rank blocks') that
cannot appear in the orbits generated by a map taking values on a linearly
ordered space, in which case we say that the map has forbidden patterns. Once a
map has a forbidden pattern of a given length $L_{0}$, it has forbidden
patterns of any length $L\ge L_{0}$ and their number grows superexponentially
with $L$. Using recent results on topological permutation entropy, we study in
this paper the existence and some basic properties of forbidden ordinal
patterns for self maps on n-dimensional intervals. Our most applicable
conclusion is that expansive interval maps with finite topological entropy have
necessarily forbidden patterns, although we conjecture that this is also the
case under more general conditions. The theoretical results are nicely
illustrated for n=2 both using the naive counting estimator for forbidden
patterns and Chao's estimator for the number of classes in a population. The
robustness of forbidden ordinal patterns against observational white noise is
also illustrated.
