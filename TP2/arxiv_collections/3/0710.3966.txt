Recent progress in neutrino scattering experiments with few GeV neutrino
beams is reviewed, focusing on new experimental input since the beginning of
the NuInt workshop series in 2001. Progress in neutrino quasi-elastic
scattering, resonance production, coherent pion production, scattering in the
transition region between the resonance and deep inelastic regimes, and nuclear
effects in neutrino-nucleus scattering, is discussed.
