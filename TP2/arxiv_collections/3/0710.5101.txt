Using experiments with anisotropic vibrated rods and quasi-2D numerical
simulations, we show that shape plays an important role in the collective
dynamics of self-propelled (SP) particles. We demonstrate that SP rods exhibit
local ordering, aggregation at the side walls, and clustering absent in round
SP particles. Furthermore, we find that at sufficiently strong excitation SP
rods engage in a persistent swirling motion in which the velocity is strongly
correlated with particle orientation.
