Pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles produced in heavy ion
collisions are a powerful tool to characterize the global properties of the
created system. They have been measured in a wide range of energies at the GSI,
AGS, SPS and RHIC accelerators and will be one of the first measurements at
ALICE at the LHC. The various analysis techniques developed by SPS and RHIC
experiments are reviewed and the presently available results from SPS and RHIC
are presented, focusing in particular on the scaling of charged particle yield
with centrality and with center-of-mass energy. Finally the perspectives for
the multiplicity measurement in the ALICE experiment at the LHC are discussed.
