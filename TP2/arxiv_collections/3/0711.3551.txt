The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem was one of the first computational experiments.
It has stirred the physics community since, and resisted a simple solution for
half a century. The combination of straightforward simulations, efficient
computational schemes for finding periodic orbits, and analytical estimates
allows us to achieve significant progress. Recent results on $q$-breathers,
which are time-periodic solutions that are localized in the space of normal
modes of a lattice and maximize the energy at a certain mode number, are
discussed, together with their relation to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem. The
localization properties of a $q$-breather are characterized by intensive
parameters, that is, energy densities and wave numbers. By using scaling
arguments, $q$-breather solutions are constructed in systems of arbitrarily
large size. Frequency resonances in certain regions of wave number space lead
to the complete delocalization of $q$-breathers. The relation of these features
to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem are discussed.
