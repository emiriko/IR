We present recent results on heavy flavour production at Tevatron Run II for
typically ~1/fb of analysed proton-antiproton data at a c.m. energy of 1.96
TeV. This includes results on single and correlated open charm and bottom cross
sections, charm pair production kinematics, J/psi, psi(2S) and chi cross
sections and polarisation measurements in J/psi, psi(2S), Upsilon(1S), and
Upsilon(2S).
