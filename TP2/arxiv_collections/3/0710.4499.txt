In 2002 Jurdzinski and Lorys settled a long-standing conjecture that
palindromes are not a Church-Rosser language. Their proof required a
sophisticated theory about computation graphs of 2-stack automata. We present
their proof in terms of 1-tape Turing machines.We also provide an alternative
proof of Buntrock and Otto's result that the set of non-square bitstrings,
which is context-free, is not Church-Rosser.
