The hadron spectrum of one flavor QCD is studied by Monte Carlo simulations.
The Symanzik tree-level-improved Wilson action is used for the gauge field and
the Wilson action for the fermion. The theory is simulated by a polynomial
hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (PHMC). The mass spectrum of hadronic bound states
is investigated at two different lattice spacings: a ~ 0.37r_0 and a ~ 0.27r_0,
corresponding to ~0.19fm and ~0.13fm in ordinary QCD. The lattice extension is
fixed to L ~ 4.4r_0 (~2.2fm). The lightest simulated quark mass corresponds to
a pion with mass ~270MeV. Properties of the theory are analyzed by making use
of the ideas of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (PQChPT). The
symmetry of the single flavor theory can be artificially enhanced by adding
extra valence quarks, which can be interpreted as u and d quarks. Operators in
the valence pion sector can be built. Masses and decay constants are analyzed
by using PQChPT formulae at next-to-leading order.
