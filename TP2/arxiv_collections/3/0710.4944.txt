A new lowest order QED calculation for RHIC e+ e- pair production has been
carried out with a phenomenological treatment of the Coulomb dissociation of
the heavy ion nuclei observed in the STAR ZDC triggers. The lowest order QED
result for the experimental acceptance is nearly two standard deviations larger
than the STAR data. A corresponding higher order QED calculation is consistent
with the data.
