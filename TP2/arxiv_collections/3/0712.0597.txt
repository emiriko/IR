Recent successes in manufacturing of atomically thin graphite samples
(graphene) have stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity. The
key feature of graphene is the massless Dirac type of low-energy electron
excitations. This gives rise to a number of unusual physical properties of this
system distinguishing it from conventional two-dimensional metals. One of the
most remarkable properties of graphene is the anomalous quantum Hall effect. It
is extremely sensitive to the structure of the system; in particular, it
clearly distinguishes single- and double-layer samples. In spite of the
impressive experimental progress, the theory of quantum Hall effect in graphene
has not been established. This theory is a subject of the present paper. We
demonstrate that the Landau level structure by itself is not sufficient to
determine the form of the quantum Hall effect. The Hall quantization is due to
Anderson localization which, in graphene, is very peculiar and depends strongly
on the character of disorder. It is only a special symmetry of disorder that
may give rise to anomalous quantum Hall effects in graphene. We analyze the
symmetries of disordered single- and double-layer graphene in magnetic field
and identify the conditions for anomalous Hall quantization.
