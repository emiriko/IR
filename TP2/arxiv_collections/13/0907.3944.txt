Reliability (survival analysis, to biostatisticians) is a key ingredient for
mak- ing decisions that mitigate the risk of failure. The other key ingredient
is utility. A decision theoretic framework harnesses the two, but to invoke
this framework we must distinguish between chance and probability. We describe
a functional form for the utility of chance that incorporates all dispositions
to risk, and pro- pose a probability of choice model for eliciting this
utility. To implement the model a subject is asked to make a series of binary
choices between gambles and certainty. These choices endow a statistical
character to the problem of utility elicitation. The workings of our approach
are illustrated via a live example in- volving a military planner. The material
is general because it is germane to any situation involving the valuation of
chance.
