By applying a highly sensitive homemade AC susceptibility technique to
Pr_{x}Y_{1-x}Ba_2Cu_3O_7 polycrystals (with x=0.0, 0.1 and 0.3), we observed
very sharp Fraunhofer type low-field periodic oscillations of the real part of
the AC susceptibility which were attributed to Josephson vortices penetrating
intergranular regions of grain-boundary Josephson network in our samples.
Assuming the Lorentz type distribution of single-junction contact areas, we
were able to successfully fit the experimental data.
