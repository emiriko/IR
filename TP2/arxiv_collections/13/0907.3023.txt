We predict the appearance of a persistent spin current in a two-dimensional
electron gas formed at the interface of multiferroic oxides with a transverse
helical magnetic order. No charge current is generated. This is the result of
an effective spin-orbit coupling generated by the topology of the oxide local
magnetic moments. The effective coupling and the generated spin current depend
linearly on the magnetic spiral helicity which, due to the magneto-electric
coupling, is tunable by a transverse electric field offering thus a new mean
for the generation of electrically controlled persistent spin currents.
