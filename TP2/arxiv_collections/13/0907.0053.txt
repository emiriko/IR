We propose an efficient faithful polarization-state transmission scheme by
utilizing frequency degree of freedom besides polarization and an additional
qubit prepared in a fixed polarization. An arbitrary single-photon polarization
state is protected against the collective noise probabilistically. With the
help of frequency beam splitter and frequency shifter, the success probability
of our faithful qubit transmission scheme with frequency degree of freedom can
be 1/2 in principle.
