Recently it was discovered that the jump in the specific heat at the
superconducting transition in pnictide superconductors is proportional to the
superconducting transition temperature to the third power, with the
superconducting transition temperature varying from 2 to 25 Kelvin including
underdoped and overdoped cases. Relying on standard scaling notions for the
thermodynamics of strongly interacting quantum critical states, it is pointed
out that this behavior is consistent with a normal state that is a quantum
critical metal undergoing a pairing instability.
