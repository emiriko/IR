We analyze the breaking of the Wandzura-Wilczek relation for the g_2
structure function, emphasizing its connection with transverse momentum
dependent parton distribution functions. We find that the relation is broken by
two distinct twist-3 terms, and clarify how these can be separated in
measurements of double-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering. Through a quantitative analysis of available g_2 data we also show
that the breaking of the Wandzura-Wilczek relation can be as large as 15-30% of
the size of g_2.
