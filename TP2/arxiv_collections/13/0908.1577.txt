I argue that the conventional BCS-London theory of superconductivity does not
explain the most fundamental property of superconductors, the Meissner effect:
how is the Meissner current generated, and how is it able to defy Faraday's
law? How is its mechanical angular momentum compensated? I propose that
superconductivity is impossible unless the metal expels charge from its
interior towards the surface in the transition to superconductivity. As a
consequence, superconductors in their ground state are predicted to possess a
macroscopic electric field in their interior, as well as excess negative charge
and a macroscopic spin current near the surface. The system is driven normal
when the applied magnetic field is strong enough to bring the spin current to a
stop. High temperature superconductivity occurs in systems that have too much
negative charge.
