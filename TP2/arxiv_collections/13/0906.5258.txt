A rigorous evaluation of the complete gauge-invariant set of the screened
one-loop QED corrections to the hyperfine structure and g factor in lithiumlike
heavy ions is presented. The calculations are performed in both Feynman and
Coulomb gauges for the virtual photon mediating the interelectronic
interaction. As a result, the most accurate theoretical predictions for the
specific difference between the hyperfine splitting values of H- and Li-like Bi
ions as well as for the g factor of Li-like Pb ion are obtained.
