We present an approach that combines the local density approximation (LDA)
and the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) in the framework of the
full-potential linear augmented plane waves (FLAPW) method. Wannier-like
functions for the correlated shell are constructed by projecting local orbitals
onto a set of Bloch eigenstates located within a certain energy window. The
screened Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling are calculated from a
first-principle constrained RPA scheme. We apply this LDA+DMFT implementation,
in conjunction with continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo, to study the
electronic correlations in LaFeAsO. Our findings support the physical picture
of a metal with intermediate correlations. The average value of the mass
renormalization of the Fe 3d bands is about 1.6, in reasonable agreement with
the picture inferred from photoemission experiments. The discrepancies between
different LDA+DMFT calculations (all technically correct) which have been
reported in the literature are shown to have two causes: i) the specific value
of the interaction parameters used in these calculations and ii) the degree of
localization of the Wannier orbitals chosen to represent the Fe 3d states, to
which many-body terms are applied. The latter is a fundamental issue in the
application of many-body calculations, such as DMFT, in a realistic setting. We
provide strong evidence that the DMFT approximation is more accurate and more
straightforward to implement when well-localized orbitals are constructed from
a large energy window encompassing Fe-3d, As-4p and O-2p, and point out several
difficulties associated with the use of extended Wannier functions associated
with the low-energy iron bands. Some of these issues have important physical
consequences, regarding in particular the sensitivity to the Hund's coupling.
