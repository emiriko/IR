We study the classical and quantum models of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) cosmology, coupled to a perfect fluid, in the context of the $f(R)$
gravity. Using the Schutz' representation for the perfect fluid, we show that,
under a particular gauge choice, it may lead to the identification of a
time-parameter for the corresponding dynamical system. Moreover, this formalism
gives rise to a Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the
quantum-mechanical description of the model under consideration, the
eigenfunctions of which can be used to construct the wavefunction of the
Universe. In the case of $f(R)=R^2$ (pure quadratic model), for some particular
choices of the perfect fluid source, exact solutions to the SWD equation can be
obtained and the corresponding results are compared to the usual $f(R)=R$
model.
