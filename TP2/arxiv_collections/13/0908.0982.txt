Context as the dynamic information describing the situation of items and
users and affecting the users decision process is essential to be used by
recommender systems in mobile commerce to guarantee the quality of
recommendation. This paper proposes a novel multidimensional approach for
context aware recommendation in mobile commerce. The approach represents users,
items, context information and the relationship between them in a
multidimensional space. It then determines the usage patterns of each user
under different contextual situations and creates a new 2 dimensional
recommendation space and does the final recommendation in that space. This
paper also represents an evaluation process by implementing the proposed
approach in a restaurant food recommendation system considering day, time,
weather and companion as the contextual information and comparing the approach
with the traditional 2 dimensional one. The results of comparison illustrates
that the multidimensional approach increases the recommendation quality.
