We investigate a two-species Fermi gas in which one species is confined in
two parallel layers and interacts with the other species in the
three-dimensional space by a tunable short-range interaction. Based on the
controlled weak coupling analysis and the exact three-body calculation, we show
that the system has a rich phase diagram in the plane of the effective
scattering length and the layer separation. Resulting phases include an
interlayer s-wave pairing, an intralayer p-wave pairing, a dimer Bose-Einstein
condensation, and a Fermi gas of stable Efimov-like trimers. Our system
provides a widely applicable scheme to induce long-range interlayer
correlations in ultracold atoms.
