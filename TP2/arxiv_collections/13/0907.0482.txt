A simple gauged linear sigma model with several parameters to take the
symmetry breaking and the mass differences between the vector meson and the
axial vector meson into account is considered here as a possibly useful
template for the role of a light scalar in QCD as well as for (at a different
scale) an effective Higgs sector for some recently proposed walking technicolor
models. An analytic procedure is first developed for relating the Lagrangian
parameters to four well established (in the QCD application) experimental
inputs. One simple equation distinguishes three different cases:1. QCD with
axial vector particle heavier than vector particle, 2. possible technicolor
model with vector particle heavier than the axial vector one, 3. the unphysical
QCD case where both the KSRF and Weinberg relations hold. The model is applied
to the s-wave pion-pion scattering in QCD. Both the near threshold region and
(with an assumed unitarization) theglobal region up to about 800 MeV are
considered. It is noted that there is a little tension between the choice of
bare sigma mass parameter for describing these two regions. If a reasonable
globa fit is made, there is some loss of precision in the near threshold
region.
