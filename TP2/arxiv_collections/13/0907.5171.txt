Photometric observations of 235 extragalactic objects that are potential
targets for the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) are presented. Mean B, V, R,
I magnitudes at the 5% level are obtained at 1 - 4 epochs between 2005 and 2007
using the 1-m telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and Naval
Observatory Flagstaff Station. Of the 134 sources which have V magnitudes in
the Veron & Veron-Cetty catalog a difference of over 1.0 mag is found for the
observed-catalog magnitudes for about 36% of the common sources, and 10 sources
show over 3 mag difference. Our first set of observations presented here form
the basis of a long-term photometric variability study of the selected
reference frame sources to assist in mission target selection and to support in
general QSO multi-color photometric variability studies.
