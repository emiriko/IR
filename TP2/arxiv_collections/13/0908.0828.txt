We study a two-dimensional cellular automaton (CA), called Diffusion Rule
(DR), which exhibits diffusion-like dynamics of propagating patterns. In
computational experiments we discover a wide range of mobile and stationary
localizations (gliders, oscillators, glider guns, puffer trains, etc), analyze
spatio-temporal dynamics of collisions between localizations, and discuss
possible applications in unconventional computing.
