We analyze small-x DVCS data using flexible GPD models and compare our
outcome with the full Shuvaev transformation. We point out that the full
Shuvaev transform is a model that is equivalent to a conformal GPD and a
minimalist ``dual'' parameterization. Some mathematical subtleties of conformal
representations are recalled. We also comment on a speculation of a
factorization breakdown in DVCS.
