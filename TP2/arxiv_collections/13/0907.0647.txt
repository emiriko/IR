We have measured the magnetic field and temperature dependence of specific
heat on $Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+\delta}$ single crystals in wide doping and
temperature regions. The superconductivity related specific heat coefficient
$\gamma_{sc}$ and entropy $S_{sc}$ are determined. It is found that
$\gamma_{sc}$ has a hump-like anomaly at $T_c$ and behaves as a long tail which
persists far into the normal state for the underdoped samples, but for the
heavily overdoped samples the anomaly ends sharply just near $T_c$.
Interestingly, we found that the entropy associated with superconductivity is
roughly conserved when and only the long tail part in the normal state is taken
into account for the underdoped samples, indicating the residual
superconductivity above T$_c$.
