We study the vector-vector interaction within the framework of the hidden
gauge formalism for the channels with quantum numbers Charm C=0 and Strangeness
S=0 in the energy region around 4000 MeV. By looking for poles in the complex
plane we find three resonances that could be identified by the mass, width and
quantum numbers with the Y(3940), Z(3940) and X(4160), these poles appear with
isospin I=0 and J^{PC}=0^{++}, 2^{++} and 2^{++} respectively. Whereas the
Y(3940) and Z(3940) are coupled more strongly to D^*\bar{D}^*, the X(4160) is
basically a D^*_s \bar{D}^*_s molecular state. Another two extra resonances
appear in our approach with I=0, 1 and J^{PC}=1^{+-}, 2^{++} which are not
found in the PDG with masses M=3945, 3912 MeV and widths \Gamma=0, 120 MeV
respectively.
