Soft-x-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopies are employed to
investigate the electronic structures of Sr_{1-x}Rh_{2}O_{4}. Similarly to the
layered cobaltates such as Na_{1-x}CoO_{2}, a valence-band satellite feature
(VBS) occurs at higher binding energy to the O 2p band. We find that the VBS
resonates at the O 1s edge. Additionally, core absorption shows clear x
dependence in the O 1s edge rather than in the Rh 3p edge. These results
indicate that the holes in the initial state mainly have O 2p character
presumably due to d-p rehybridizations affected by Sr^{2+} vacancy potentials.
The resultant inhomogenous charge texture may have impact on the TE transport
properties at low x.
