We study the effect of long range particle exchange in bosonic arrangements.
We show that by combining the solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion
with matrix product state representation it is possible to investigate the
dynamics as well as the ground state while including particle exchange beyond
next-neighbours sites. These ideas are then applied to study the emergence of
entanglement as a result of scattering in boson chains. We propose a scheme to
generate highly entangled multi-particle states that exploits collision as a
powerful entangling mechanism.
