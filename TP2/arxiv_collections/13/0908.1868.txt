Exotic stable massive particles (SMP) are proposed in a number of scenarios
of physics beyond the Standard Model. It is important that LHC experiments are
able both to detect and extract the quantum numbers of any SMP with masses
around the TeV scale. To do this, an understanding of the interactions of SMPs
in matter is required. In this paper a Regge-based model of R-hadron scattering
is extended and implemented in Geant-4. In addition, the implications of
$R$-hadron scattering for collider searches are discussed.
