We report the results from a computational study of the self-assembly of
amphiphilic ditethered nanospheres using molecular simulation. We explore the
phase behavior as a function of nanosphere diameter, interaction strength, and
directionality of the tether-tether interactions. We predict the formation of
seven distinct ordered phases. We compare these structures with those observed
in linear and star triblock copolymer systems.
