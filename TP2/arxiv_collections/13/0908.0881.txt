We present an effective medium theory that explains the disorder-induced
transition into a phase of quantized conductance, discovered in computer
simulations of HgTe quantum wells. It is the combination of a random potential
and quadratic corrections proportional to p^2 sigma_z to the Dirac Hamiltonian
that can drive an ordinary band insulator into a topological insulator (having
an inverted band gap). We calculate the location of the phase boundary at weak
disorder and show that it corresponds to the crossing of a band edge rather
than a mobility edge. Our mechanism for the formation of a topological Anderson
insulator is generic, and would apply as well to three-dimensional
semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling.
