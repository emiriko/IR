We report on the magnetic hyperthermia properties of chemically synthesized
ferromagnetic 11 and 16 nm Fe(0) nanoparticles of cubic shape displaying the
saturation magnetization of bulk iron. The specific absorption rate measured on
16 nm nanocubes is 1690+-160 W/g at 300 kHz and 66 mT. This corresponds to
specific losses-per-cycle of 5.6 mJ/g, largely exceeding the ones reported in
other systems. A way to quantify the degree of optimization of any system with
respect to hyperthermia applications is proposed. Applied here, this method
shows that our nanoparticles are not fully optimized, probably due to the
strong influence of magnetic interactions on their magnetic response. Once
protected from oxidation and further optimized, such nano-objects could
constitute efficient magnetic cores for biomedical applications requiring very
large heating power.
