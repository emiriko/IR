The MAGIC collaboration reports the detection of the blazar S50716+714
(redshift uncertain) in very high energy gamma-rays. The observations were
performed in November 2007 and in April 2008, and were triggered by the KVA
telescope due to the high optical state of the object. The blazar S50716+714 is
the third low frequency BL Lac detected at energies above 100 GeV until today.
Here, we present the results of the MAGIC observations.
