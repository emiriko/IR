Pulsed field magnetization experiments extend the typical metamagnetic
staircase of CuFeO2 up to 58 T to reveal an additional first order phase
transition at high field for both the parallel and perpendicular field
configuration. Virtually complete isotropic behavior is retrieved only above
this transition, indicating the high-field recovery of the undistorted
triangular lattice. A consistent phenomenological rationalization for the field
dependence and metamagnetism crossover of the system is provided, demonstrating
the importance of both spin-phonon coupling and a small field-dependent
easy-axis anisotropy in accurately describing the magnetization process of
CuFeO2.
