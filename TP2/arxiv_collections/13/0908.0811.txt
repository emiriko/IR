The data acquisition system of the Antares neutrino telescope is based on the
unique "all-data-to-shore" concept. In this, all signals from the
photo-multiplier tubes are digitised, and all digital data are sent to shore
where they are processed in real time by a PC farm. This data acquisition
system showed excellent stability and flexibility since the detector became
operational in March 2006. The applied concept enables to operate different
physics triggers to the same data in parallel, each optimized for a specific
(astro)physics signal. The list of triggers includes two general purpose muon
triggers, a Galactic Centre trigger, and a gamma-ray burst trigger. The
performance of the data acquisition system is evaluated by its operational
efficiency and the data filter capabilities. In addition, the efficiencies of
the different physics triggers are quantified.
