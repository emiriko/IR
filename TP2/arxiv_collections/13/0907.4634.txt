A hole spin is a potential solid-state q-bit, that may be more robust against
nuclear spin induced dephasing than an electron spin. Here we propose and
demonstrate the sequential preparation, control and detection of a single hole
spin trapped on a self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot. The dot is embedded
in a photodiode structure under an applied electric-field. Fast, triggered,
initialization of a hole spin is achieved by creating a spin-polarized
electron-hole pair with a picosecond laser pulse, and in an applied
electric-field, waiting for the electron to tunnel leaving a spin-polarized
hole. Detection of the hole spin with picosecond time resolution is achieved a
second picosecond laser pulse to probe the positive trion transition, where a
trion is created conditional on the hole spin to be detected as a change in
photocurrent. Finally, using this setup we observe a Rabi rotation of the
hole-trion transition that is conditional on the hole spin, which for a
pulse-area of $2\pi$ can be used to impart a phase-shift of $\pi$ between the
hole spin states, a non-general manipulation of the hole spin.
