In this paper we present chromospheric emission levels of the solar-type
stars in the young open clusters IC 2391 and IC 2602. High resolution
spectroscopic data were obtained for over 50 F, G, and K stars from these
clusters over several observing campaigns using the University College London
Echelle Spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope. Unlike older
clusters, the majority (28/52) of the solar-type stars in the two clusters are
rapid-rotators (vsini > 20 km/s) with five of the stars being classified as
ultra-rapid rotators (vsini > 100 km/s). The emission levels in the Calcium
infrared triplet lines were then used as a measure of the chromospheric
activity of the stars. When plotted against Rossby number (NR) the star's
chromospheric emission levels show a plateau in the emission for Log(NR) < -1.1
indicating chromospheric saturation similar to the coronal saturation seen in
previously observed X-ray emission from the same stars. However, unlike the
coronal emission, the chromospheric emission of the stars show little evidence
of a reduction in emission (i.e. supersaturation) for the ultra-rapid rotators
in the clusters. Thus we believe that coronal supersaturation is not the result
of an overall decrease in magnetic dynamo efficiency for ultra-rapid rotators.
