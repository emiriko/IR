Electrons most often organize into Fermi-liquid states in which
electron-electron interactions play an inessential role. A well known exception
is the case of one-dimensional (1D) electron systems (1DES). In 1D the electron
Fermi-surface consists of points, and divergences associated with low-energy
particle-hole excitations abound when electron-electron interactions are
described perturbatively. In higher space dimensions, the corresponding
divergences occur only when Fermi lines or surfaces satisfy idealized nesting
conditions. In this article we discuss electron-electron interactions in 2D
graphene bilayer systems which behave in many ways as if they were
one-dimensional, because they have Fermi points instead of Fermi lines and
because their particle-hole energies have a quadratic dispersion which
compensates for the difference between 1D and 2D phase space. We conclude, on
the basis of a perturbative RG calculation similar to that commonly employed in
1D systems, that interactions in neutral graphene bilayers can drive the system
into a strong-coupling broken symmetry state with layer-pseudospin
ferromagnetism and an energy gap.
