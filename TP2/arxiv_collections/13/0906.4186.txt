The theoretical analysis of the energetics of mechanically-stirred horizontal
convection for a Boussinesq fluid yields the formula:
  G(APE) = \gamma_{mixing} G(KE) + (1+\gamma_{mixing})
  W_{r,laminar} where G(APE) and G(KE) are the work rate done by the buoyancy
and mechanical forcing respectively, \gamma_{mixing} is the mixing efficiency,
and W_{r,laminar} is the background rate of increase in gravitational potential
energy due to molecular diffusion. The formula shows that mechanical stirring
can easily induce a very strong buoyancy-driven overturning cell (meaning a
large G(APE)) even for a relatively low mixing efficiency, whereas this is only
possible in absence of mechanical stirring if \gamma_{mixing} >> 1. Moreover,
the buoyancy-driven overturning becomes mechanically controlled when
$\gamma_{mixing} G(KE) >> (1+\gamma_{mixing}) W_{r,laminar}$. This result
explains why the buoyancy-driven overturning cell in the laboratory experiments
by \cite{Whitehead2008} is amplified by the lateral motions of a stirring rod.
The formula implies that the thermodynamic efficiency of the ocean heat engine,
far from being negligibly small as is commonly claimed, might in fact be as
large as can be thanks to the stirring done by the wind and tides. These ideas
are further illustrated by means of idealised numerical experiments. A
non-Boussinesq extension of the above formula is also given.
