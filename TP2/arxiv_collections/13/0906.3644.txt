We found parity-violating Majorana fermions in a chiral superconductor
Sr2RuO4. The current-voltage curves show an anomalous behavior: The induced
voltage is an even function of the bias current. The magnetic field dependent
results suggest the excitation of the Majorana fermions along the closed chiral
edge current of the single domain under bias current. We also discuss the
relationship between a change of the chirality and spontaneous magnetization of
the single domain Sr2RuO4.
