I review how "classical SUGRA" embeddability establishes positive energy E
for D=3 topologically massive gravity (TMG), with or without a cosmological
term, a procedure familiar from D=4 Einstein gravity (GR). It also provides
explicit expressions for E. In contrast to GR, E is not manifestly positive,
due to the peculiar two-term nature of TMG.
