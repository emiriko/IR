Codeword stabilized (CWS) codes are a general class of quantum codes that
includes stabilizer codes and many families of non-additive codes with good
parameters. For such a non-additive code correcting all t-qubit errors, we
propose an algorithm that employs a single measurement to test all errors
located on a given set of t qubits. Compared with exhaustive error screening,
this reduces the total number of measurements required for error recovery by a
factor of about 3^t.
