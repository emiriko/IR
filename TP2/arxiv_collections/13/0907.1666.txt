We study classical and quantum phases in the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer
context. These include a classical astronomical case, the general dual
description of the phases, a new "Paradox" connected to scattering Berry phase
and its resolution and various elaboration of
topological/geometrical/non-abelian phases.
