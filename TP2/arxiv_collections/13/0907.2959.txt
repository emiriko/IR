Schrodinger's equation predicts something very peculiar about the electron in
the Hydrogen atom: its total energy must be equal to zero. Unfortunately, an
analysis of a zero-energy wavefunction for the electron in the Hydrogen atom
has not been attempted in the published literature. This paper provides such an
analysis for the first time and uncovers a few interesting facts, including the
fact that a "zero-energy wavefunction" is actually a quantized version of the
classical wavefunction that has been known for decades.
