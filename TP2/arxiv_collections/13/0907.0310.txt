We consider a process of the Andreev reflection between a normal metal and
the s-wave superconductor in the FFLO state. It is shown that the process takes
place if the energy of the incoming electron is bound within the finite
interval called the Andreev window. The position of the window determines the
value of the non-zero total momentum of Cooper pairs and the value of the gap.
