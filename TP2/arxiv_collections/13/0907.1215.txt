A three-level atom in a $\Lambda$ configuration trapped in an optical cavity
forms a basic unit in a number of proposed protocols for quantum information
processing. Through control with an appropriate laser, this system allows for
efficient storage of cavity photons into long-lived atomic excitations, and
their retrieval with high fidelity. This process presumes an adiabatic transfer
through the `dark state', a coherent superposition of the two lower levels of
the $\Lambda$ system, by a slow variation of the intensity of the control
laser. We study the full quantum mechanics of this transfer process with a view
to examine the nonadiabatic effects, as the control laser is varied in time.
The nonadiabatic effects arise due to inevitable excitations of the system to
states involving the highest level of the $\Lambda$ configuration, which is
radiative. We formulate the problem in terms of the instantaneous eigenstates
and solve it numerically, allowing for spontaneous decays from the excited
level. We present detailed results for both storage and retrieval for a
suitable range of variation rates and intensity of the control laser, and
examine optimum conditions for the transfer process.
