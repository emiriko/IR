The latest two- and three-particle correlation measurements obtained by the
PHENIX collaboration are presented. Three-particle correlations are consistent
with the presence of conical emission patterns in the data. Two-particle
correlations relative to the collision geometry reveal strong shape and yield
modifications of the away-side jet, that depend on the orientation of the
trigger particle with respect to the event plane. A difference in the geometry
dependence of the per trigger yields in the regions around $\Delta\phi \approx
\pi$ and $\Delta\phi \approx \pi \pm 1.1$ can be understood by a different
geometry dependence of jet energy loss and the medium response to the deposited
energy.
