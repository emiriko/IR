We study the classical anisotropic ferromagnetic spin chain with frustration.
The behavior of soliton and kink solutions in the vicinity of the ground state
phase transition from the ferromagnetic to the spiral phase is studied. The
dependence of the soliton energy on small anisotropy parameter is established
using scaling estimates and numerical minimization of the energy functional.
Conditions of the existence of the solitons are determined. It is shown that
solitons survive in the spiral phase though with some restrictions on their
size. A comparison of the energies of the classical solitons and the bound
magnon complexes in the quantum model shows the functional similarity between
them. The influence of the finite-size effects on the soliton states is studied
and it is shown that the localized solitons originate from the uniform state
when the system size exceeds some critical value depending on the anisotropy.
