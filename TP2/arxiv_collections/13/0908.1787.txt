The quantum mechanical formalism doesn't support our intuition, nor does it
elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are
subject to the laws of quantum physics. The arrays of complex numbers are kin
to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice.
In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative
for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows
for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many
otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations
such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As
a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying
theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the
required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum
theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific
applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum
computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of
quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level
diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a
fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only
provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory,
logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to
discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict
genuine quantum phenomena.
