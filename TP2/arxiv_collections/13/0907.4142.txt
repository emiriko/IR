If the X(3872) resonance is a shallow boundstate of a the charm mesons $D^{0}
\bar D^{*0}$ and $D^{*0} \bar D^{0}$, it can be described by an effective
theory of nonrelativistic D mesons coupled to nonrelativistic pions (X-EFT). In
this talk, I give a brief overview of the X(3872), followed by a short review
of X-EFT. I end my talk with results from calculations of the
next-to-leading-order correction to the partial decay width $\Gamma[X\to D^0
\bar D^{0} \pi^0]$, and the decay of X(3872) to P-wave quarkonia.
