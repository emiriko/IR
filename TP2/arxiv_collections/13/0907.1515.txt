We introduce thermometers to define the local temperature of an electronic
system driven out-of-equilibrium by local AC fields. We also define the
effective temperature in terms of a local fluctuation-dissipation-relation. We
show that within the weak driving regime these two temperatures coincide. We
also discuss the behavior of the local temperature along the sample. We show
that it exhibits spatial fluctuations following an oscillatory pattern. For
weak driving, regions of the sample become heated, while others become cooled
as a consequence of the driving.
