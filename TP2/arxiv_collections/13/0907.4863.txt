We discuss the scalable parallel solution of the Poisson equation within a
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code for the simulation of electron beams in particle
accelerators of irregular shape. The problem is discretized by Finite
Differences. Depending on the treatment of the Dirichlet boundary the resulting
system of equations is symmetric or `mildly' nonsymmetric positive definite. In
all cases, the system is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient
algorithm with smoothed aggregation (SA) based algebraic multigrid (AMG)
preconditioning. We investigate variants of the implementation of SA-AMG that
lead to considerable improvements in the execution times. We demonstrate good
scalability of the solver on distributed memory parallel processor with up to
2048 processors. We also compare our SAAMG-PCG solver with an FFT-based solver
that is more commonly used for applications in beam dynamics.
