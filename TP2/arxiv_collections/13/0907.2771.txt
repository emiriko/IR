POLAR is a compact polarimeter dedicated to measure the polarization of GRBs
between 50-300 keV. The light collection of 200*6*6mm3 plastic bars has been
simulated and optimized in order to get uniform response to x-rays at different
points of one single bar. According to the Monte Carlo results, the amplitude
uniformity strongly depends on the polishing level of scintillator surface and
the covering. A uniformity of 89% is achieved with a prototype constructed by a
non position-sensitive PMT and an array of 4X4 bars.
