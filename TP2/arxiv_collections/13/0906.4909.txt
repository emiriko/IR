The symmetry energy coefficients, incompressibility, and single-particle and
isovector potentials of clusterized dilute nuclear matter are calculated at
different temperatures employing the $S$-matrix approach to the evaluation of
the equation of state. Calculations have been extended to understand the
aforesaid properties of homogeneous and clusterized supernova matter in the
subnuclear density region. Comparison of the results in the $S$-matrix and
mean-field approach reveals some subtle differences in the density and
temperature region we explore.
