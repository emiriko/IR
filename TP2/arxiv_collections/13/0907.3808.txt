In 1970, Kobayashi and Maskawa concluded that an effective six-quark vertex
with a determinantal form is necessary in the chiral effective models to
account for the large mass of $X$ meson, which is now called the $\eta'$. The
determinantal interaction has an $SU(3)_L \otimes SU(3)_R$ symmetry but not
$U(3)_L \otimes U(3)_R$, and, hence accounts for the explicit breaking of
$U(1)_A$ symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD); the vertex was later derived
by 't Hooft as an instanton-induced quark interaction. The vertex, which may be
called the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term, is widely used in
quantitative analyses of hadron physics and QCD phase transitions at finite
temperature and density. An account is made for the KMT term with recent
extensive applications. Described are also personal experiences with Professor
Maskawa and Professor Kobayashi,including an encounter with Professor Maskawa
when the author first presented his work on the KMT term.
