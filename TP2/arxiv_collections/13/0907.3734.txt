In a previous paper "Anomalies in Quantum Field Theory and Cohomologies of
Configuration Spaces" (arXiv:0903.0187) we presented a new method for
renormalization in Euclidean configuration spaces based on certain
renormalization maps. This approach is aimed to serve for developing an
algebraic algorithm for computing the Gell--Mann--Low renormalization group
action. In the present work we introduce a modification of the theory of
renormalization maps for the case of Minkowski space and we give the way how it
is combined with the causal perturbation theory.
