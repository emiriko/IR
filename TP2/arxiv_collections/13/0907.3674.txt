In the framework of the Standard Model we calculate the flavour non-universal
correction for neutrino refraction in a neutrino background and verify a
similar previous result for the case of ordinary-matter background. The
dominant term arises at loop level and involves tau leptons circulating in the
loop. These O(G_F m_tau^2) corrections to the tree-level potential provide the
dominant refractive difference between nu_mu and nu_tau unless the medium
contains mu or tau leptons. Our results affect the flavour evolution of dense
neutrino gases and may be of interest for collective three-flavour oscillations
of supernova neutrinos. We spell out explicitly how these non-universal
neutrino-neutrino interactions enter the flavour oscillation equations.
