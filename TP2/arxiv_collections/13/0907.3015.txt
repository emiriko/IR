Data on J/Psi -> gamma (eta-piplus-piminus) and gamma
(Kcharged-Kshort-picharged) from 58M J/Psi hadronic interactions in the BES II
detector are analysed. They throw new light on J^P = 0^- mesons throughout the
mass range up to 2 GeV, notably eta(1440). For the first time, this state is
fitted including the full s-dependence of decays to a0(980)-pi, eta-sigma,
Kstar-K, kappa-K and f0(980)-eta, including the dispersive term associated with
this s-dependence. Two types of fit are reported. The first uses a single
eta(1440). The second uses separate eta(1405) and eta(1475). The strong
s-dependence of P-wave production of Kstar-K shifts the fitted mass of
eta(1475) down to 1440 MeV. As a result, the two types of fit give almost
identical results and the conclusion from these data is that there is no
significant evidence for two separate resonances. In KKpi, there are definite
though small contributions from f1(1420) and f1(1285). The optimum fit requires
either a small additional f1(1510) or alternatively a small perturbation to the
high mass tail of f1(1420). At higher masses, there is a broad J^P=0^- peak in
eta-pi-pi at 1850 MeV. There is also a weak but definite signal consistent with
eta2 (1870) -> eta-pi-pi.
