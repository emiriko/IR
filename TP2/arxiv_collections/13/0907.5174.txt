Based on the unrestricted Gutzwiller approximation we study the possibility
that the diagonal incommensurate spin scattering in the spin glass phase of
lanthanum cuprates originates from stripe formation. Similar to the metallic
phase two types of diagonal stripe structures appear to be stable: (a)
site-centered textures which have one hole per site along the stripe and (b)
ferromagnetic stair-case structures which are the diagonal equivalent to
bond-centered stripes in the metallic phase and which on average have a filling
of 3/4 holes per stripe site. We give a detailed analysis of the stability of
both diagonal textures with regard to the vertical ones.
