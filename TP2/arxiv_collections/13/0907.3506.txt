This is the first in a series of papers which ultimately aims on improving on
the present estimates on the axion mass by modeling the topological
non-perturbative QCD dynamics. Axions couple to instantons and their mass is
set by the topological susceptibility whose temperature dependence we estimate
with the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM). Since accurate finite
temperature instanton calculations have problems and do not consider
fluctuations in the topological charge, we develop an improved grand canonical
version of the IILM to study topological fluctuations in the quark gluon
plasma. In this first paper we will calibrate the model against the topological
susceptibility at zero temperature, in the chiral regime of physical quark
masses.
