Core-collapse supernovae are among Nature's most energetic events. They mark
the end of massive star evolution and pollute the interstellar medium with the
life-enabling ashes of thermonuclear burning. Despite their importance for the
evolution of galaxies and life in the universe, the details of the
core-collapse supernova explosion mechanism remain in the dark and pose a
daunting computational challenge. We outline the multi-dimensional,
multi-scale, and multi-physics nature of the core-collapse supernova problem
and discuss computational strategies and requirements for its solution.
Specifically, we highlight the axisymmetric (2D) radiation-MHD code VULCAN/2D
and present results obtained from the first full-2D angle-dependent neutrino
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the post-core-bounce supernova
evolution. We then go on to discuss the new code Zelmani which is based on the
open-source HPC Cactus framework and provides a scalable AMR approach for 3D
fully general-relativistic modeling of stellar collapse, core-collapse
supernovae and black hole formation on current and future massively-parallel
HPC systems. We show Zelmani's scaling properties to more than 16,000 compute
cores and discuss first 3D general-relativistic core-collapse results.
