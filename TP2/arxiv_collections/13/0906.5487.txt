Charged particles of extensive air showers (EAS), mainly electrons and
positrons, initiate the emission of fluorescence light in the Earth's
atmosphere. This light provides a calorimetric measurement of the energy of
cosmic rays. For reconstructing the primary energy from an observed light track
of an EAS, the fluorescence yield in air has to be known in dependence on
atmospheric conditions, like air temperature, pressure, and humidity. Several
experiments on fluorescence emission have published various sets of data
covering different parts of the dependence of the fluorescence yield on
atmospheric conditions. Using a compilation of published measurements, a
calculation of the fluorescence yield in dependence on altitude is presented.
The fluorescence calculation is applied to simulated air showers and different
atmospheric profiles to estimate the influence of the atmospheric conditions on
the reconstructed shower parameters.
