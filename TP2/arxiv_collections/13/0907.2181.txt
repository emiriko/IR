Recently, Dressel et al determined the vertical deflection of a light ray in
a medium, with a strong frequency-dependent dispersion, at rest in a uniform
gravitational field. We take up this question within the general relativistic
theory of the propagation of light in a dispersive medium, due to Synge.
