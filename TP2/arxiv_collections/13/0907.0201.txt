We simulate the localized surface plasmon resonances of an Au nanoparticle
within tunneling proximity of a Au substrate and demonstrate that the modes may
be identified with those responsible for light emission from a scanning
tunneling microscope. Relative to the modes of an isolated nanoparticle these
modes show significant red-shifting, extending further into the infrared with
increasing radius, primarily due to a proximity-induced lowering of the
effective bulk plasmon frequency. Spatial mapping of the field enhancement
factor shows an oscillatory variation of the field, absent in the case of a
dielectric substrate; also the degree of localization of the modes, and thus
the resolution achievable electromagnetically, is shown to depend primarily on
the nanoparticle radius with only a weak dependence on wavelength.
