A mechanism for the transition between low/hard, high/soft, and steep power
law (SPL) spectral states in black hole X-ray binaries is proposed. The
low/hard state is explained by the development of a magnetically arrested
accretion disk attributable to the accumulation of a vertical magnetic field in
a central bundle. This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral
accretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot,
magnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard
X-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random
inversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the
secondary star. The inward advection of the inverted field results in a
temporal disappearance of the central bundle caused by the annihilation of the
opposed fields and restoration of the optically thick disk in the innermost
region. This disk represents the high/soft state. The SPL state develops at the
period of intensive field annihilation and precedes the high/soft state. The
continuous supply of the inverted field leads to a new low/hard state because
of the formation of another magnetically arrested disk.
