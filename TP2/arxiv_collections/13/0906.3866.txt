Reliable data from the very recent high-precision measurements on the
antiproton fluxes and the antiproton-to-proton ratios by the PAMELA
Collaboration at relatively much higher energies are now available. The results
with regard to antiproton production phenomena spring no special surprises;
rather they are sharply in contrast with and contradiction to the case of
positron production at the same energy-range. However, the totality of data on
antiproton production from the past experiments to the very recent PAMELA
outburst seem to be a very challenging exercise for interpretation in terms of
the secondary production mechanisms alone, the galactic propagation model etc
against the background of the `dark-matter'-related controversy. In the present
work we assume the validity of the simple leaky box model, choose a simple
particle production model and attempt at providing a comprehensive
interpretation of the totality of data on both antiproton flux measurements and
the $\overline{P}/P$ ratio-values for the various experiments ranging from
BESS, CAPRICE to the latest PAMELA experiment. With the assumption of no
contribution from the exotic sources to the antiproton production process, our
model and the method describe the totality of the measured data with a fair
degree of success.
