We extend in several ways a recently proposed method to construct
one-dimensional chaotic maps with exactly known natural invariant measure [Sogo
1999, 2009]. First, we assume that the given invariant measure depends on a
continuous parameter and show how to construct maps with robust chaos --i.e.,
chaos that is not destroyed by arbitrarily small changes of the parameter-- and
prescribed invariant measure and constant Lyapunov exponent. Then, by relaxing
one condition in the approach of Refs. \cite{Sogo1,Sogo2}, we describe a method
to construct robust chaos with prescribed constant invariant measure and
varying Lyapunov exponent. Another extension of a condition in Refs. [Sogo
1999, 2009] provides a new method to get robust chaos with known varying
Lyapunov exponent. In this third approach the invariant measure can be computed
exactly in many particular cases. Finally we discuss how to use diffeomorphisms
to construct maps with robust chaos, any number of parameters and prescribed
invariant measure and Lyapunov exponent.
