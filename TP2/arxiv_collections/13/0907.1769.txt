Amputation of external legs is carried out explicitly for the conformal
invariant three-point function involving two spinors and one vector field. Our
results are consistent with the general result that amputing an external leg in
a conformal invariant Green function replaces a field by its conformal partner
in the Green function. A new star-triangle relation, involving two spinors and
one vector field, is derived and used for the calculation.
