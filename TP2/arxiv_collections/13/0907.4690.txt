In this paper, we construct an effective model that describes the electroweak
symmetry breaking sector by means of composite Higgs-like scalars, following
the ideas of Minimal Walking Technicolor (MWT). We argue that, because of the
general failure of Extended Technicolor (ETC) to explain the mass of the top
quark, it is necessary to introduce two composite Higgs bosons: one of them
originated by a MWT-ETC sector and the other one produced by a Topcolor sector.
We focus on the phenomenological differences between the light composite Higgs
present in our model and the fundamental Higgs boson predicted by the Standard
Model and their production at the LHC. We show that in this scheme the main
production channel of the lighter Higgs boson are the associated production
with a gauge boson and $WW$ fusion but not the gluon-gluon fusion channel which
is substantially suppressed.
