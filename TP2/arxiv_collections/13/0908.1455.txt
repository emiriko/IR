We numerically study the orientation deformations in nematic liquid crystals
around charged particles. We set up a Ginzburg-Landau theory with inhomogeneous
electric field. If the dielectric anisotropy varepsilon_1 is positive, Saturn
ring defects are formed around the particles. For varepsilon_1<0, novel "ansa"
defects appear, which are disclination lines with their ends on the particle
surface. We find unique defect structures around two charged particles. To
lower the free energy, oppositely charged particle pairs tend to be aligned in
the parallel direction for varepsilon_1>0 and in the perpendicular plane for
varepsilon_1<0 with respect to the background director . For identically
charged pairs the preferred directions for varepsilon_1>0 and varepsilon_1<0
are exchanged. We also examie competition between the charge-induced anchoring
and the short-range anchoring. If the short-range anchoring is sufficiently
strong, it can be effective in the vicinity of the surface, while the director
orientation is governed by the long-range electrostatic interaction far from
the surface.
