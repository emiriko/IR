We present and test a new, special-relativistic formulation of Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our approach benefits from several improvements
with respect to earlier relativistic SPH formulations. It is self-consistently
derived from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid and accounts for
special-relativistic "grad-h terms". In our approach, we evolve the canonical
momentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the
problems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further
use a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme
local eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks
and b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative
density slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that
is applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still
avoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each
particle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to
special relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH. The
performance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests
where it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor,
though worthwhile, improvements. The scheme performs close to perfect in
supersonic advection tests, but also in strong relativistic shocks, usually
considered a particular challenge for SPH, the method yields convincing
results. For example, due to its perfect conservation properties, it is able to
handle Lorentz-factors as large as $\gamma= 50 \; 000$ in the so-called wall
shock test. Moreover, we find convincing results in a rarely shown, but
challenging test that involves so-called relativistic simple waves and also in
multi-dimensional shock tube tests.
