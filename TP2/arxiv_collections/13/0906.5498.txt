We study the TE polarized electromagnetic surface wave propagating along the
interface between materials with positive and negative magnetic permeability.
Contrary to the TM polarized surface wave, the TE surface wave exhibits almost
no radiation losses when scattered at semi-infinite dielectric interfaces.
