Spinodal instabilities and early growth of baryon density fluctuations in
symmetric nuclear matter are investigated in the basis of stochastic extension
of relativistic mean-field approach in the semi-classical approximation.
Calculations are compared with the results of non-relativistic calculations
based on Skyrme-type effective interactions under similar conditions. A
qualitative difference appears in the unstable response of the system: the
system exhibits most unstable behavior at higher baryon densities around
$\rho_{b}=0.4 ~\rho_{0}$ in the relativistic approach while most unstable
behavior occurs at lower baryon densities around $\rho_{b}=0.2 ~\rho_{0}$ in
the non-relativistic calculations
