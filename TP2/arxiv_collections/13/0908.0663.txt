We present the asymptotically AdS solutions of Gauss-Bonnet gravity with
hyperbolic horizon in the presence of a non-Abelian Yang-Mills field with the
gauge semisimple group $So(n(n-1)/2-1,1)$. We investigate the properties of
these solutions and find that the non-negative mass solutions in 6 and higher
dimensions are real everywhere with spacelike singularities. They present black
holes with one horizon and have the same causal structure as the Schwarzschild
spacetime. The solutions in 5 dimensions or the solutions in higher dimensions
with negative mass are not real everywhere. In these cases, one needs a
transformation to make the solutions real. These solutions may present a naked
singularity, an extreme black hole, a black hole with two horizons, or a black
hole with one horizon.
