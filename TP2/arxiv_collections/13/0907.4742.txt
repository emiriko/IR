The BRAHMS experiment was designed to measure and characterize in particular
the properties of rapidity dependence of particle production in heavy ion
collisions. The data-taking is now over, results of several years of analysis
have been published and demonstrates several important features of the rapidity
dependence, not envisioned from the start of the RHIC program. The bulk
properties of the system formed at high rapidity resemble that of systems at
lower energies at mid-rapidity when referenced via the baryo-chemical
potential. New physics in AA are essentially observed at mid-rapidity including
the demonstration that high-\pT suppression is a final state effect. Another
key result is that in d+A collisions at forward rapidities where the very low-x
region of the nucleus was probed, a strong suppression of pion production was
observed consistent with the picture of gluon saturation. The latest results
examines the centrality and rapidity dependence of nuclear stopping, the
particle production of pions, collective expansion vs. rapidity, and the baryon
enhancement at intermediate values of \pT .
