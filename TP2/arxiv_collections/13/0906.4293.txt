In a recent Brief Report by Shalaby a new first-order perturbative
calculation of the metric operator for an $i\phi^3$ scalar field theory is
given. It is claimed that the result is an improvement on a previous
calculation by Bender, Brody and Jones because it is local. Unfortunately
Shalaby's calculation is not valid because of sign errors.
