We address an important issue as to whether bulk-sensitive data of Raman
scattering, optical conductivity, magnetic penetration depth, directional
point-contact tunneling spectra, and nonmagnetic pair-breaking effect in
optimally electron-doped Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-y} support a nodeless s-wave
or d-wave superconducting gap. We numerically calculate Raman intensities,
directional point-contact tunneling spectra, and nonmagnetic pair-breaking
effect in terms of both s-wave and d-wave gap symmetries. We find that all
these bulk-sensitive data are in quantitative agreement with a nearly isotropic
s-wave gap. The fact that T_{c} is nearly independent of the residual
resistivity rules out any d-wave gap symmetry.
