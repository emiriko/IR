Entanglement is the central resource of quantum information processing and
the precise characterization of entangled states is a crucial issue for the
development of quantum technologies. This leads to the necessity of a precise,
experimental feasible measure of entanglement. Nevertheless, such measurements
are limited both from experimental uncertainties and intrinsic quantum bounds.
Here we present an experiment where the amount of entanglement of a family of
two-qubit mixed photon states is estimated with the ultimate precision allowed
by quantum mechanics.
