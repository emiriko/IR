2D axis-symmetric hydrodynamical simulations are presented which explore the
interaction of stellar and disk winds with surrounding infalling cloud
material. The star, and its accompanying disk, blow winds inside a cavity
cleared out by an earlier jet. The collision of the winds with their
surroundings generates shock heated plasma which reaches temperatures up to
~10^8 K. Attenuated X-ray spectra are calculated from solving the equation of
radiative transfer along lines-of-sight. This process is repeated at various
epochs throughout the simulations to examine the evolution of the intrinsic and
attenuated flux. We find that the dynamic nature of the wind-cavity interaction
fuels intrinsic variability in the observed emission on timescales of several
hundred years. This is principally due to variations in the position of the
reverse shock which is influenced by changes in the shape of the cavity wall.
The collision of the winds with the cavity wall can cause clumps of cloud
material to be stripped away. Mixing of these clumps into the winds mass-loads
the flow and enhances the X-ray emission measure. The position and shape of the
reverse shock plays a key role in determining the strength and hardness of the
X-ray emission. In some models the reverse shock is oblique to much of the
stellar and disk outflows, whereas in others it is closely normal over a wide
range of polar angles. For reasonable stellar and disk wind parameters the
integrated count rate and spatial extent of the intensity peak for X-ray
emission agree with \textit{Chandra} observations of the deeply embedded MYSOs
