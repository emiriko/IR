We describe the effective and the big cones of a projective symmetric
variety. Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient combinatorial criterion
for the bigness of a nef divisor on a projective symmetric variety. When the
variety is toroidal and the divisor is $G$-stable, such criterion has an
explicit geometric interpretation. Finally, we describe the spherical closure
of a symmetric subgroup.
