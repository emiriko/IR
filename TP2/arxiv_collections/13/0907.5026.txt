Epitaxial graphene films were grown in vacuo by silicon sublimation from the
(0001) and (000-1) faces of 4H- and 6H-SiC. Hall effect mobilities and sheet
carrier densities of the films were measured at 300 K and 77 K and the data
depended on the growth face. About 40% of the samples exhibited holes as the
dominant carrier, independent of face. Generally, mobilities increased with
decreasing carrier density, independent of carrier type and substrate polytype.
The contributions of scattering mechanisms to the conductivities of the films
are discussed. The results suggest that for near-intrinsic carrier densities at
300 K epitaxial graphene mobilities will be ~150,000 cm2V-1s-1 on the (000-1)
face and ~5,800 cm2V-1s-1 on the (0001) face.
