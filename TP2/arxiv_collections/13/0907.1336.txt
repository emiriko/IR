We study the structure of a family of algebras which encodes a generalization
of the Pieri Rule for the complex orthogonal group. In particular, we show that
each of these algebras has a standard monomial basis and has a flat deformation
to a Hibi algebra. There is also a parallel theory for the complex symplectic
group.
