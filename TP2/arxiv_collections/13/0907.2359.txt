We compute the distribution of the partition functions for a class of
one-dimensional Random Energy Models (REM) with logarithmically correlated
random potential, above and at the glass transition temperature. The random
potential sequences represent various versions of the 1/f noise generated by
sampling the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field (2dGFF) along various planar
curves. Our method extends the recent analysis of Fyodorov Bouchaud from the
circular case to an interval and is based on an analytical continuation of the
Selberg integral. In particular, we unveil a {\it duality relation} satisfied
by the suitable generating function of free energy cumulants in the
high-temperature phase. It reinforces the freezing scenario hypothesis for that
generating function, from which we derive the distribution of extrema for the
2dGFF on the $[0,1]$ interval. We provide numerical checks of the circular and
the interval case and discuss universality and various extensions. Relevance to
the distribution of length of a segment in Liouville quantum gravity is noted.
