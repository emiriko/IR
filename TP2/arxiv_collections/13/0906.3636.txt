The aim of this paper is to continue the research of JMP 46, 042501 (2005) of
regular static spherically symmetric spacetimes in Einstein-Born-Infeld
theories from the point of view of the spacetime geometry and the
electromagnetic structure. The energy conditions, geodesic completeness and the
main features of the horizons of this spacetime are explicitly shown. A new
static spherically symmetric dyonic solution in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory
with similar good properties as in the regular pure electric and magnetic cases
of our previous work, is presented and analyzed. Also, the circumvention of a
version of "no go" theorem claiming the non existence of regular electric black
holes and other electromagnetic static spherically configurations with regular
center is explained by dealing with a more general statement of the problem.
