We develop superembedding approach to multiple D-particle (D0-brane) system.
In flat target D=10 type IIA superspace this produces the supersymmetric and
Lorentz covariant version of the Matrix model equations. The equations
following from our superembedding approach to multiple D0 in curved type IIA
superspace shows the Myers 'dielectric brane effect', i.e. interaction with
higher form gauge fields which do not interact with a single D0-brane.
