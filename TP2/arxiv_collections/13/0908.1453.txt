Learning is the important property of Back Propagation Network (BPN) and
finding the suitable weights and thresholds during training in order to improve
training time as well as achieve high accuracy. Currently, data pre-processing
such as dimension reduction input values and pre-training are the contributing
factors in developing efficient techniques for reducing training time with high
accuracy and initialization of the weights is the important issue which is
random and creates paradox, and leads to low accuracy with high training time.
One good data preprocessing technique for accelerating BPN classification is
dimension reduction technique but it has problem of missing data. In this
paper, we study current pre-training techniques and new preprocessing technique
called Potential Weight Linear Analysis (PWLA) which combines normalization,
dimension reduction input values and pre-training. In PWLA, the first data
preprocessing is performed for generating normalized input values and then
applying them by pre-training technique in order to obtain the potential
weights. After these phases, dimension of input values matrix will be reduced
by using real potential weights. For experiment results XOR problem and three
datasets, which are SPECT Heart, SPECTF Heart and Liver disorders (BUPA) will
be evaluated. Our results, however, will show that the new technique of PWLA
will change BPN to new Supervised Multi Layer Feed Forward Neural Network
(SMFFNN) model with high accuracy in one epoch without training cycle. Also
PWLA will be able to have power of non linear supervised and unsupervised
dimension reduction property for applying by other supervised multi layer feed
forward neural network model in future work.
