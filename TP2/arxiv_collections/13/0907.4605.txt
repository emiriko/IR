A Gelfand model for a finite group $G$ is a complex linear representation of
$G$ that contains each of its irreducible representations with multiplicity
one. For a finite group $G$ with a faithful representation $V$, one constructs
a representation which we call the polynomial model for $G$ associated to $V$.
Araujo and others have proved that the polynomial models for certain
irreducible Weyl groups associated to their canonical representations are
Gelfand models.
  In this paper, we give an easier and uniform treatment for the study of the
polynomial model for a general finite Coxeter group associated to its canonical
representation. Our final result is that such a polynomial model for a finite
Coxeter group $G$ is a Gelfand model if and only if $G$ has no direct factor of
the type $W(D_{2n}), W(E_7)$ or $W(E_8)$.
