The quantum Hall effect in a single-layer graphene sample is studied in
strong magnetic fields up to 28 T. Our measurements reveal the existence of a
metal- insulator transition from filling factor $\nu=-2$ to $\nu=0$. The value
of the universal scaling exponent is found to be $\kappa=0.57 $ in graphene and
therefore in a truly two-dimensional system. This value of $\kappa$ is in
agreement with the accepted universal value for the plateau-insulator
transitions in standard quasi two-dimensional electron and hole gases.
