Group field theories are higher dimensional generalizations of matrix models.
Their Feynman graphs are fat and in addition to vertices, edges and faces, they
also contain higher dimensional cells, called bubbles. In this paper, we
propose a new, fermionic Group Field Theory, posessing a color symmetry, and
take the first steps in a systematic study of the topological properties of its
graphs. Unlike its bosonic counterpart, the bubbles of the Feynman graphs of
this theory are well defined and readily identified. We prove that this graphs
are combinatorial cellular complexes. We define and study the cellular homology
of this graphs. Furthermore we define a homotopy transformation appropriate to
this graphs. Finally, the amplitude of the Feynman graphs is shown to be
related to the fundamental group of the cellular complex.
