N=Z nuclei above Ni are understood to be waiting-point nuclei in the
rp-process nucleosynthesis. Investigating the experimental isotope shifts in Kr
isotopes near the proton drip-line, we have discovered that N=Z rp-process
nuclei $^{68}$Se, $^{72}$Kr, $^{76}$Sr and $^{80}$Zr exhibit a significant
shell gap both at the proton and neutron numbers in the deformed space with the
consequence that pairing correlations for protons and neutrons vanish, thus
lending a double-magic character to these nuclei. A significant number of
nuclei in this region are also shown to exhibit neutron magicity at N = 34, 36,
38, and 40 in the deformed space.
