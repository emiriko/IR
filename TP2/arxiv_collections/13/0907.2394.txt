Following Herranz and Santander [Herranz F.J., Santander M., Mem. Real Acad.
Cienc. Exact. Fis. Natur. Madrid 32 (1998), 59-84, physics/9702030] we will
construct homogeneous spaces based on possible kinematical algebras and groups
[Bacry H., Levy-Leblond J.-M., J. Math. Phys. 9 (1967), 1605-1614] and their
contractions for 2-dimensional spacetimes. Our construction is different in
that it is based on a generalized Clifford fibration: Following Penrose
[Penrose R., Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 2005] we will call our fibration
a Clifford fibration and not a Hopf fibration, as our fibration is a
geometrical construction. The simple algebraic properties of the fibration
describe the geometrical properties of the kinematical algebras and groups as
well as the spacetimes that are derived from them. We develop an algebraic
framework that handles all possible kinematic algebras save one, the static
algebra.
