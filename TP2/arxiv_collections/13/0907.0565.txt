Despite a century of cosmic-ray measurements there seems to have been no
attempt to collect these data systematically for use by the CR community. The
result is that everyone makes their own collection as required, a large
duplication of effort. Therefore we have started a project to place published
Galactic CR measurements in a database available online. It currently addresses
energies up to 100 TeV, including elemental spectra, secondary/primary nuclei
ratios, antiprotons, electrons and positrons. It is updated regularly as data
appears in the literature. It is supported by access software. The community is
encouraged to participate by providing data, pointing out errors or omissions,
and suggestions for improvements.
