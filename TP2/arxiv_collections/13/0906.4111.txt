We introduce a notion of essential hyperbolic Coxeter polytope as a polytope
which fits some minimality conditions. The problem of classification of
hyperbolic reflection groups can be easily reduced to classification of
essential Coxeter polytopes. We determine a potentially large combinatorial
class of polytopes containing, in particular, all the compact hyperbolic
Coxeter polytopes of dimension at least 6 which are known to be essential, and
prove that this class contains finitely many polytopes only. We also construct
an effective algorithm of classifying polytopes from this class, realize it in
four-dimensional case, and formulate a conjecture on finiteness of the number
of essential polytopes.
