We introduce the first entire-sky catalog of the most isolated nearby
galaxies with radial velocities VLG<3500 km/s. This kind of cosmic "orphans"
amounts to 4% among all known galaxies within the same velocity range. We
describe a criterion of isolation applied to select our sample, the "Local
Orphan Galaxies", and discuss their basic optical and HI properties.
