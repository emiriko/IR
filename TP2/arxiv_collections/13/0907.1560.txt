Supersymmetric B-L extension of the Standard Model (SM) is one of the best
candidate for physics beyond the SM that accounts for TeV scale seesaw
mechanism and provides an attractive solution for the Higgs naturalness
problem. We analyze the charged lepton flavor violation (LFV) in this class of
models. We show that due to the smallness of Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling,
the decay rates of l_i -> l_j gamma and l_i -> 3 l_j, generated by the
renormalization group evolution of soft SUSY breaking terms from GUT to seesaw
scale, are quite suppressed. Therefore, this model is free from the stringent
LFV constraints usually imposed on the supersymmetric seesaw model. We also
demonstrate that the right-sneutrino is a long-lived particle and can be pair
produced at the LHC through the B-L gauge boson. Then, they decay into
same-sign dilepton, with a total cross section of order O(1) pb. This signal is
one of the striking signatures of supersymmetric B-L extension of the SM.
