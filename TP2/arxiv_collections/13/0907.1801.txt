A fraction of massive stars are expected to collapse into compact objects
(accreting black holes or rapidly rotating neutron stars) that successfully
produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We examine the possibility of directly
observing these gamma-ray burst compact objects (GCOs) using post-explosion
observations of past and future GRB sites. In particular, we present a search
for early pulsations from the nearby (z=0.0335) gamma-ray burst GRB 060218,
which exhibited features possibly consistent with a rapidly spinning neutron
star as its underlying GCO. We also consider alternative techniques that could
potentially achieve a detection of GCOs either in the Local Volume or near the
plane of our own Galaxy.
