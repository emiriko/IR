Deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments using indirect time-of-flight
spectrometers have reported a smaller cross section for the hydrogen atom than
expected from conventional scattering theory. Typically, at large momentum
transfers, a deficit of 20-40% in the neutron scattering intensity has been
measured and several theories have been developed to explain these results. We
present a different approach to this problem by investigating the hydrogen
cross section in polyethylene using the direct geometry time-of-flight
spectrometer MARI with the incident energy fixed at a series of values ranging
from Ei=0.5 eV to 100 eV. These measurements span a much broader range in
momentum than previous studies and with varying energy resolutions. We observe
no momentum dependence to the cross section with an error of 4% and through a
comparison with the scattering from metal foil standards measure the absolute
bound cross section of the hydrogen atom to be sigma(H)= 80 +/- 4 barns. These
results are in agreement with conventional scattering theory but contrast with
theories invoking quantum entanglement and neutron experiments supporting them.
Our results also illustrate a unique use of direct geometry chopper instruments
at high incident energies and demonstrate their capability for conducting
high-energy spectroscopy.
