We have examined the recently detected very high energy (VHE) pulsed
radiation from the Crab pulsar. According to the observational evidence, the
observed emission (>25GeV) peaks at the same phase with the optical spectrum.
Considering the cyclotron instability, we show that the pitch angle becomes
non-vanishing leading to the efficient synchrotron mechanism near the light
cylinder surface. The corresponding spectral index of the emission equals -1/2.
By studying the inverse Compton scattering and the curvature radiation, it is
argued that the aforementioned mechanisms do not contribute to the VHE
radiation detected by MAGIC.
