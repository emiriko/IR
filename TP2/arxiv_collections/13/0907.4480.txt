Electron transport characteristics are investigated through some molecular
chains attached to two non-superconducting electrodes by the use of Green's
function method. Here we do parametric calculations based on the tight-binding
formulation to characterize the electron transport through such bridge systems.
The transport properties are significantly influenced by (a) the length of the
molecular chain and (b) the molecule-to-electrodes coupling strength and here
we focus are results in these aspects. In this context we also discuss the
steady state current fluctuations, the so-called shot noise, which is a
consequence of the quantization of charge and is not directly available through
conductance measurements.
