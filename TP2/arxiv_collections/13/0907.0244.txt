We estimate the $D$, $\overline{D}$ and $J/\Psi$ meson potentials in nuclei.
$J/\Psi$-nuclear potential (self-energy) is calculated based on the
color-singlet mechanism, by the $DD$ and $DD^*$ meson loops. This consistently
includes the in-medium properties of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The potential
obtained for the $J/\Psi$ meson is attractive, and it is complementary to the
attraction obtained from the color-octet gluon-based mechanism. We predict that
the $D^-$ and $J/\Psi$ mesons will be bound in nuclei under proper conditions.
