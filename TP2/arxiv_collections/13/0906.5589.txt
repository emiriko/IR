We study photoabsorption reaction and real Compton scattering (RCS) within
the color dipole model. We rely on a photon wave function derived in the
instanton vacuum model, and on the energy dependent phenomenological elastic
dipole amplitude. Data for the photoabsorption cross section at high energies
agree with our parameter free calculations. We also provide predictions for the
differential RCS cross section. Although no data for small angle Compton
scattering are available so far, this process can be measured in
ultra-peripheral hadronic and nuclear collisions at the LHC.
