We report the detection of an unusually high lithium content in HD 232862, a
field giant classified as a G8II star, and hosting a magnetic field. With the
spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at CFHT and NARVAL at TBL, we have collected high
resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra of three giants : HD 232862, KU Peg
and HD 21018. From spectral synthesis we have inferred stellar parameters and
measured lithium abundances that we have compared to predictions from
evolutionary models. We have also analysed Stokes V signatures, looking for a
magnetic field on these giants. HD 232862, presents a very high abundance of
lithium (ALi = 2.45 +/- 0.25 dex), far in excess of the theoretically value
expected at this spectral type and for this luminosity class (i.e, G8II). The
evolutionary stage of HD 232862 has been precised, and it suggests a mass in
the lower part of the [1.0 Msun ; 3.5 Msun ] mass interval, likely 1.5 to 2.0
solar mass, at the bottom of the Red Giant Branch. Besides, a time variable
Stokes V signature has been detected in the data of HD 232862 and KU Peg,
pointing to the presence of a magnetic field at the surface of these two
rapidly rotating active stars.
