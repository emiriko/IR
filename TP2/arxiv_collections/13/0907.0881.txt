Equilibrium and non-equilibrium growth phenomena, e.g., surface growth,
generically yields self-affine distributions. Analysis of statistical
properties of these distributions appears essential in understanding
statistical mechanics of underlying phenomena. Here, we analyze scaling
properties of the cumulative distribution of iso-height loops (i.e., contour
lines) of rough self-affine surfaces in terms of loop area and system size.
Inspired by the Coulomb gas methods, we find the generating function of the
area of the loops. Interestingly, we find that, after sorting loops with
respect to their perimeters, Zipf-like scaling relations hold for ranked loops.
Numerical simulations are also provided in order to demonstrate the proposed
scaling relations.
