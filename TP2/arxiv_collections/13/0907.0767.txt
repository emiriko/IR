Mainstream interpretations of quantum theory maintain that violations of the
Bell inequalities deny at least either realism or Einstein locality. Here we
investigate the premises of the Bell-type inequalities by returning to earlier
inequalities presented by Boole and the findings of Vorob'ev as related to
these inequalities. These findings together with a space-time generalization of
Boole's elements of logic lead us to a completely transparent Einstein local
counterexample from everyday life that violates certain variations of the Bell
inequalities. We show that the counterexample suggests an interpretation of the
Born rule as a pre-measure of probability that can be transformed into a
Kolmogorov probability measure by certain Einstein local space-time
characterizations of the involved random variables.
