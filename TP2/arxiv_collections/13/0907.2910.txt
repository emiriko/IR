We consider the $M/M/1$ queue with processor sharing. We study the
conditional sojourn time distribution, conditioned on the customer's service
requirement, in various asymptotic limits. These include large time and/or
large service request, and heavy traffic, where the arrival rate is only
slightly less than the service rate. The asymptotic formulas relate to, and
extend, some results of Morrison \cite{MO} and Flatto \cite{FL}.
