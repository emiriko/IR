A model where the inflationary phase emerges as a response to protect the
Fischler-Susskind holographic bound is described. A two fluid model in a closed
universe inflation picture is assumed, and a discussion on conditions under
which is possible to obtain an additional exponential expansion phase as those
currently observed is given.
