We consider rational surface automorphisms with positive entropy. A Fatou
component is said to be a rotation domain if the automorphism induces a torus
action on it. Here we construct a rational surface automorphism with positive
entropy with the following property: it has a rotation domain which contains
both a curve of fixed points and isolated fixed points. This Fatou component
cannot be imbedded into complex euclidean space, so we introduce a global
linear model space and show that it can be globally linearized in this model.
