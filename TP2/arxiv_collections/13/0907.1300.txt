We have used the new 90GHz MUSTANG camera on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT) to map the bright Huygens region of the star-forming region M42
with a resolution of 9" and a sensitivity of 2.8mJy/beam. 90GHz is an
interesting transition frequency, as MUSTANG detects both the free-free
emission characteristic of the HII region created by the Trapezium stars,
normally seen at lower frequencies, and thermal dust emission from the
background OMC1 molecular cloud, normally mapped at higher frequencies. We also
present similar data from the 150GHz GISMO camera taken on the IRAM telescope.
This map has 15" resolution. By combining the MUSTANG data with 1.4, 8, and
21GHz radio data from the VLA and GBT, we derive a new estimate of the emission
measure (EM) averaged electron temperature of Te = 11376K by an original method
relating free-free emission intensities at optically thin and optically thick
frequencies. Combining ISO-LWS data with our data, we derive a new estimate of
the dust temperature and spectral emissivity index within the 80" ISO-LWS beam
toward OrionKL/BN, Td = 42K and Beta=1.3. We show that both Td and Beta
decrease when going from the HII region and excited OMC1 interface to the
denser UV shielded part of OMC1 (OrionKL/BN, Orion S). With a model consisting
of only free-free and thermal dust emission we are able to fit data taken at
frequencies from 1.5GHz to 854GHz.
