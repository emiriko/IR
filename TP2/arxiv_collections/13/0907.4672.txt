It is often observed in the ground state of spatially-extended quantum
systems with local interactions that the entropy of a large region is
proportional to its surface area. In some cases, this area law is corrected
with a logarithmic factor. This contrasts with the fact that in almost all
states of the Hilbert space, the entropy of a region is proportional to its
volume. This paper shows that low-energy states have (at most) an area law with
the logarithmic correction, provided two conditions hold: (i) the state has
sufficient decay of correlations, (ii) the number of eigenstates with vanishing
energy-density is not exponential in the volume. These two conditions are
satisfied by many relevant systems. The central idea of the argument is that
energy fluctuations inside a region can be observed by measuring the exterior
and a superficial shell of the region.
