Long distance (1.4 micron) interaction of two different InAs/GaAs quantum
dots in a photonic crystal microcavity is observed. Resonant optical excitation
in the p-state of any of the quantum dots, results in an increase of the
s-state emission of both quantum dots and the cavity mode. The cavity-mediated
coupling can be controlled by varying the excitation intensity. These results
represent an experimental step towards the realization of quantum logic
operations using distant solid state qubits.
