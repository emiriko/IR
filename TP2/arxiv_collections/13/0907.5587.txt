In this work we will investigate Lagrangians of the standard model extended
by three right-handed neutrinos, and the consequences of invariance under
finite groups G for lepton masses and mixing matrices are studied. The main
part of this work is the systematic analysis of finite subgroups of SU(3). The
analysis of these groups may act as a toolkit for future model building.
