A coin is just a two sided dice. Recently, Mochon proved that quantum weak
coin flipping with an arbitrarily small bias is possible. However, the use of
quantum resources to allow N remote distrustful parties to roll an N-sided dice
has yet to be addressed. In this paper we show that contrary to the classical
case, N-sided dice rolling with arbitrarily small bias is possible for any N.
In addition, we present a six-round three-sided dice rolling protocol,
achieving a bias of 0.181, which incorporates weak imbalanced coin flipping.
