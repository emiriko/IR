We discuss tests of the charged Higgs sector of the Two Higgs Doublet Model
(2HDM) of Type II in the light of recent flavour physics data. Particular
attention is paid to recent measurement of purely leptonic decays of
heavy-light mesons, which depart more or less significantly from the Standard
Model (SM) predictions. We derive constraints on the parameters of the 2HDM
type II from leptonic and semileptonic $\Delta F=1$ decays as well as loop
processes ($b \to s \gamma$, $B\bar{B}$ mixing or $Z\to\bar{b}b$) sensitive to
charged Higgs contributions.
  The outcome of this work is that while 2HDM Type II can fit individual
observable through fine-tuning schemes, in a combined analysis it does not
perform better than the SM by favouring a decoupling solution. Assuming that
2HDM Type II is realized in Nature, constraints on its parameters ($m_{H^+}$
and $\tan \beta$) are derived. A limit on the charged Higgs mass $m_{H^+} > 316
\; {\rm GeV}$ at $95\%$~CL is obtained irrespective of the value of $\tan
\beta$. This limit is dominated by the $b\rightarrow s \gamma$ branching ratio
measurement.
  All results have been obtained with the \ckmfitter\ analysis package,
featuring the frequentist statistical approach \rfit\ to handle theoretical
uncertainties.
