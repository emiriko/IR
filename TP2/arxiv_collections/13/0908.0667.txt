Nowadays, mobile users wish to use their multi-interface mobile devices to
access the Internet through network points of attachment (PoA) based on
heterogeneous wireless technologies. They also wish to seamlessly change the
PoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce
monetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a
potential solution to this issue. In this sense, the management of multihomed
mobile nodes in heterogeneous environment is a key research topic. In this
paper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call
mobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in
heterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate
user identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses).
The multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a
priority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of
mobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus
saving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called
hard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to
minimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile
node. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous
testbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully
controlled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance
and the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures.
