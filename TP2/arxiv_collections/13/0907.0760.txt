The combination of quintessence and phantom energy in a joint model is
referred to as quintom dark energy. This paper discusses traversable wormholes
supported by such quintom matter. Two particular solutions are explored, a
constant redshift function and a specific shape function. Both isotropic and
anisotropic pressures are considered.
