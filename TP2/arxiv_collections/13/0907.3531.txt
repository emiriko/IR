In this article it is shown that a careful analysis of Kant's "Thoughts on
the True Estimation of Living Forces" leads to a conclusion that does not match
the usually accepted interpretation of Kant's reasoning in 1747, according to
which the Young Kant supposedly establishes a relationship between the
tridimensionality of space and Newton's law of universal gravitation. Indeed,
it is argued that this text does not yield a satisfactory explanation of space
dimensionality, actually restricting itself to justify the tridimensionality of
extension.
