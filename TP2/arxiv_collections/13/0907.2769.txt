The antiferromagnetic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (AFM-FFLO) state of
coexisting d-wave FFLO superconductivity and incommensurate AFM order is
studied on the basis of Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations. We show that the
incommensurate AFM order is stabilized in the FFLO state by the appearance of
the Andreev bound state localized around the zeros of the FFLO order parameter.
The AFM-FFLO state is further enhanced by the induced \pi-triplet
superconductivity (pair density wave). The AFM order occurs in the FFLO state
even when it is neither stable in the normal state nor in the BCS state. The
order parameters of the AFM order, d-wave superconductivity, and \pi-triplet
pairing are investigated by focusing on their spatial structures. Roles of the
spin fluctuations beyond the BdG equations are discussed. Their relevance to
the high-field superconducting phase of CeCoIn_5 is discussed.
