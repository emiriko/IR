Satellites that are capable of detecting gamma-ray bursts can trigger the
Antares neutrino telescope via the real-time gamma-ray bursts coordinates
network. Thanks to the "all-data-to-shore" concept that is implemented in the
data acquisition system of Antares, the sensitivity to neutrinos from gamma-ray
bursts is significantly increased when a gamma-ray burst is detected by these
satellites. The performance of the satellite-triggered data taking is shown, as
well as the resulting gain in detection efficiency. Different search methods
can be applied to the data taken in coincidence with gamma-ray bursts. For
gamma-ray bursts above the Antares horizon, for which a neutrino signal is more
difficult to find, an analysis method is applied to detect muons induced by the
high-energy gamma rays from the source.
