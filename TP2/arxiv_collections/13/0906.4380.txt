We study the entropy of black holes in the deformed Horava-Lifshitz gravity
with coupling constant lambda. For lambda=1, the black hole resembles the
Reissner-Norstrom black hole with a geometric parameter acting like the
electric charge. Therefore, we obtain some differences in the entropy when
comparing with the Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we study the heat
capacity and the thermodynamical stability of this solution.
