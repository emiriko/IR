In this paper, we investigate the single mode quantum properties of the
codirectional Kerr nonlinear coupler when the frequency mismatch is involved
and a condition for an exact solution of equations of motion is fulfilled.
Particularly, we investigate quadrature and principal squeezing, Wigner
function, quadrature distribution, phase distribution and phase variance. We
show that the quadrature squeezing and the phase variance can exhibit
collapse-revival and collapse-revival-subrevival phenomena, respectively, based
on the values of the detuning parameter. Furthermore, we analytically
demonstrate that the system can generate cat states, in particular,
Yurke-Stoler states.
