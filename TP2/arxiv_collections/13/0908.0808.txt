We study the evolution of circumstellar massive disks around the primary star
of a binary system focusing on the computation of disk eccentricity. In
particular, we concentrate on its dependence on the binary eccentricity.
Self-gravity is included in our numerical simulations. Our standard model
assumes a semimajor axis for the binary of 30 AU, the most probable value
according to the present binary statistics.
