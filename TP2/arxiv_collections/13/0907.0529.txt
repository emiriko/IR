1/N_c baryon mass relations are compared with lattice simulations of baryon
masses using different values of the light-quark masses, and hence different
values of SU(3) flavor-symmetry breaking. The lattice data clearly display both
the 1/N_c and SU(3) flavor-symmetry breaking hierarchies. The validity of 1/N_c
baryon mass relations derived without assuming approximate SU(3)
flavor-symmetry also can be tested by lattice data at very large values of the
strange quark mass. The 1/N_c expansion constrains the form of discretization
effects; these are suppressed by powers of 1/N_c by taking suitable
combinations of masses. This 1/N_c scaling is explicitly demonstrated in the
present work.
