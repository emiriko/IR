We perform a multilepton channel analysis in the context of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) for Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) compatible
points in a model with non-universal scalar masses, which admits a Higgs funnel
region of supersymmetry dark matter even for a small $\tan\beta$. In addition
to two and three-lepton final states, four-lepton events, too, are shown to be
useful for this purpose. We also compare the collider signatures in similar
channels for WMAP compatible points in the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA)
framework with similar gluino masses. Some definite features of such
non-universal scenario emerge from the analysis.
