We report a four-years experiment in teaching reasoning to undergraduate
students, ranging from weak to gifted, using Gentzen-Prawitz's style natural
deduction. We argue that this pedagogical approach is a good alternative to the
use of Boolean algebra for teaching reasoning, especially for computer
scientists and formal methods practionners.
