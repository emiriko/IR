We study the stability of static black holes in Lovelock theory which is a
natural higher dimensional generalization of Einstein theory. We derive a
master equation for tensor perturbations in general Lovelock theory. It turns
out that the resultant equation is characterized by one functional which
determines the background black hole solutions. Thus, the stability issue of
static black holes under tensor perturbations in general dimensions is reduced
to an algebraic problem. We show that small Lovelock black holes in
even-dimensions are unstable.
