In this paper we shall study vacuum fluctuations of a single scalar field
with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a finite but very long line. The spectral
heat kernel, the heat partition function and the spectral zeta function are
calculated in terms of Riemann Theta functions, the error function, and
hypergeometric PFQ functions.
