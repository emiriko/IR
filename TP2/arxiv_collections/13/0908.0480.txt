We describe in a qualitative way a possible picture of the Measurement
Process in Quantum Mechanics, which takes into account: 1. the finite and non
zero time duration T of the interaction between the observed system and the
microscopic part of the measurement apparatus; 2. the finite space size R of
that apparatus; 3. the fact that the macroscopic part of the measurement
apparatus, having the role of amplifying the effect of that interaction to a
macroscopic scale, is composed by a very large but finite number N of
particles. The conventional picture of the measurement, as an instantaneous
action turning a pure state into a mixture, arises only in the limit in which N
and R tend to infinity, and T tends to 0. We sketch here a proposed scheme,
which still ought to be made mathematically precise in order to analyse its
implications and to test it in specific models, where we argue that in Quantum
Field Theory this picture should apply to the unique time evolution expressing
the dynamics of a given theory, and should comply with the Principle of
Locality. We comment on the Einstein Podolski Rosen thought experiment (partly
modifying the discussion on this point in an earlier version of this note),
reformulated here only in terms of local observables (rather than global ones,
as one particle or polarisation observables). The local picture of the
measurement process helps to make it clear that there is no conflict with the
Principle of Locality.
