We report on the discovery and initial observations of the energetic type IIn
supernova (SN), 2008fz. The optical energy emitted by SN 2008fz (based on the
light curve over a 88 day period), is possibly the most ever observed for a
supernova (1.4 x 10^51 erg). The event was more luminous than the type IIn SN
2006gy, but exhibited same smooth, slowly evolving light curve. As is
characteristic of type IIn SN, the early spectra of 2008fz initially exhibited
narrow Balmer lines which were replaced by a broader component at later times.
The spectra also show a blue continuum with no signs of Ca or Na absorption,
suggesting that there is little extinction due to intragalatic dust in the host
or circumstellar material. No host galaxy is identified in prior coadded images
reaching R ~ 22. From the supernova's redshift, z=0.133, we place an upper
limit on the host of M_R=-17. The presence of the SN within such a faint host
follows the majority of recently discovered highly luminous SN. A possible
reason for this occurrence is the very high star formation rate occurring in
low-mass galaxies in combination with the low metallicity environment, which
makes the production of very massive stars possible. We determine the peak
absolute magnitude of the event to be M_V = -22.3 from the initial photometry
and the redshift distance, placing it among the most luminous supernovae
discovered.
