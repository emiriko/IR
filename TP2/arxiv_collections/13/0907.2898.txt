We present numerical $N$-body simulation studies of large-scale structure
formation. The main purpose of these studies is to analyze the several models
of dark matter and the role they played in the process of large-scale structure
formation. We analyze the standard and more successful case, i.e., the cold
dark matter with cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). We compare the results
of this model with the corresponding results of other alternative models, in
particular, the models that can be built from the Newtonian limit of
alternative theories of gravity like scalar-tensor theories. An specific model
is the one that considers that the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the
Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian that gives, in the Newtonian
limit an effective gravitational force that is given by two contributions: the
standard Newtonian potential plus a Yukawa potential that comes from a massive
scalar field. Comparisons of the models are done by analyzing the snapshots of
the $N$-body system at z=0 for several values of the SF parameters.
