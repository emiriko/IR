This brief paper describes the single-player card game called "Perpetual
Motion" and reports on a computational analysis of the game's outcome. The
analysis follows a Monte Carlo methodology based on a sample of 10,000 randomly
generated games. The key result is that 54.55% +/- 0.89% of games can be
completed (by a patient player!) but that the remaining 45.45% result in
non-terminating cycles. The lengths of these non-terminating cycles leave some
outstanding questions.
