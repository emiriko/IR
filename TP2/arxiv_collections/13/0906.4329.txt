For the ANOVA model, we propose a new g-prior based Bayes factor without
integral representation, with reasonable model selection consistency for any
asymptotic situations (either number of levels of the factor and/or number of
replication in each level goes to infinity). Exact analytic calculation of the
marginal density under a special choice of the priors enables such a Bayes
factor.
