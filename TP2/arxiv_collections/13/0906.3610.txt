Analysis of presolar grains in primitive meteorites has shown isotopic ratios
largely characteristic of the conditions thought to prevail in various
astrophysical environments. A possible indicator for a grain of ONe nova origin
is a large 33S abundance: nucleosynthesis calculations predict as much as 150
times the solar abundance of 33S in the ejecta of nova explosions on massive
ONe white dwarfs. This overproduction factor may, however, vary by factors of
at least 0.01 - 3 because of uncertainties of several orders of magnitude in
the 33S(p,gamma)34Cl reaction rate at nova peak temperatures (Tpeak ~ 0.1 - 0.4
GK). These uncertainties arise due to the lack of nuclear physics information
for states within ~ 600 keV of the 33S+p threshold in 34Cl (Sp(34Cl) = 5143
keV). To better constrain this rate we have measured, for the first time, the
34S(3He,t)34Cl reaction over the region Ex(34Cl) = 4.9 - 6 MeV. We confirm
previous states and find 15 new states in this energy region. New
33S(p,gamma)34Cl resonances at ER = 281(2), 301(2) and 342(2) keV may dominate
this rate at relevant nova temperatures. Our results could affect predictions
of sulphur isotopic ratios in nova ejecta (e.g., 32S/33S) that may be used as
diagnostic tools for the nova paternity of grains.
