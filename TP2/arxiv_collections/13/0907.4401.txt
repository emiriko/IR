We present the first evidence from a hadron collider of WW+WZ production with
semi-leptonic decays. The data were recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron and correspond to 1.07 inverse femtobarn of integrated luminosity
obtained in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The cross
section observed for WW+WZ production is 20.2 +- 4.5 pb with a significance of
4.4 standard deviations.
