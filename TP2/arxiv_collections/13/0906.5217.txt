We construct dark soliton solutions in a holographic model of a relativistic
superfluid. We study the length scales associated with the condensate and the
charge density depletion, and find that the two scales differ by a non-trivial
function of the chemical potential. By adjusting the chemical potential, we
study the variation of the depletion of charge density at the interface.
