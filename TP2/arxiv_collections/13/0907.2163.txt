The dielectric susceptibility of a wide class of dielectric materials
follows, over extended frequency ranges, a fractional power-law frequency
dependence that is called the "universal" response. The electromagnetic fields
in such dielectric media are described by fractional differential equations
with time derivatives of non-integer order. An exact solution of the fractional
equations for a magnetic field is derived. The electromagnetic fields in the
dielectric materials demonstrate fractional damping. The typical features of
"universal" electromagnetic waves in dielectric are common to a wide class of
materials, regardless of the type of physical structure, chemical composition,
or of the nature of the polarizing species, whether dipoles, electrons or ions.
