We report measurements of the exclusive cross section for e+e- --> D0D*-pi+
as function of center-of-mass energy from the D0D*-pi+ threshold to 5.2 GeV
with initial-state radiation. No evidence is found for Y(4260)-->D0D*-pi+
decays. The analysis is based on a data sample collected with the Belle
detector at or near a center-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV with an integrated
luminosity of 695 1/fb at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider.
