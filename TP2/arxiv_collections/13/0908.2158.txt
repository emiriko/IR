We propose a new strategy for detecting the CP-violating phases and the
effective mass of muon Majorana neutrinos by measuring observables associated
with neutrino-antineutrino oscillations in $\pi^{\pm}$ decays. Within the
generic framework of quantum field theory, we compute the non-factorizable
probability for producing a pair of same-charged muons in $\pi^{\pm}$ decays as
a distinctive signature of $\nu_{\mu}-\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$ oscillations. We show
that an intense neutrino beam through a long baseline experiment is favored for
probing the Majorana phases. Using the neutrino-antineutrino oscillation
probability reported by MINOS collaboration, a new stringent bound on the
effective muon-neutrino mass is derived.
