We propose a Randall-Sundrum model with a bulk family symmetry based on the
double tetrahedral group, T', which generates the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing
pattern and a realistic CKM matrix, including CP violation. Unlike 4D models
where the generation of mass hierarchy requires additional symmetry, the warped
geometry naturally gives rise to the fermion mass hierarchy through
wavefunction localization. The T' symmetry forbids tree-level flavor changing
neutral currents in both the quark and lepton sectors, as different generations
of fermions are unified into multiplets of T'. This results in a low first KK
mass scale and thus the model can be tested at collider experiments.
