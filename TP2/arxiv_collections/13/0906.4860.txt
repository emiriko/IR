The aim of this paper is to extend linear quantum dynamical network theory to
include static Bogoliubov components (such as squeezers). Within this
integrated quantum network theory we provide general methods for cascade or
series connections, as well as feedback interconnections using linear
fractional transformations. In addition, we define input-output maps and
transfer functions for representing components and describing convergence. We
also discuss the underlying group structure in this theory arising from series
interconnection. Several examples illustrate the theory.
