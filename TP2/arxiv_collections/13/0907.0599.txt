We have used density functional theory calculations based on the projector
augmented wave method to investigate the electronic structure of
Au-incorporated anatase TiO$_2$(001) surface. Due to the coordination with
several level oxygens, Au atoms can be encapsulated inside TiO$_2$ slab. Au is
adsorbed over the surface Ti--O bond, so called the bridge site on anatase
TiO$_2$(001)--1$\times$1 surface. However, for 0.25 ML coverage, Au atoms
energetically prefer to stay at 0.64 {\AA} above the midpoint of the two
surface oxygens which is significantly closer to the surface layer. When
implanted inside the slab for full coverage, Au forms parallel metallic wires
inside TiO$_2$ lattice where interlayer distances increase due to local
segregation. Au brings half-filled impurity states into the band gap leading to
metallization, in addition to other filled surface and impurity bands within
the gap. These Au-driven Fermi-level-pinning gap states are close to, or even
in some cases inside, the conduction band of the host slab. On the other hand,
if Au is substituted for the surface Ti atom, Fermi level falls lower in the
gap closer to the valence band top.
