Entanglement, a non-trivial phenomena manifested in composite quantum system,
can be served as a new type of physical resource in the emerging technology of
quantum information and quantum computation. However, a quantum entanglement is
fragile to the environmental-induced decoherence. Here, we present a novel way
to prepare a high-concurrence steady-state entanglement of two hole spins in a
quantum dot molecular via optical pumping of trion levels. In this scheme, the
spontaneous dispassion is used to induce and stabilize the entanglement with
rapid rate. It is firstly shown that under certain conditions, two-qubit
singlet state can be generated without requiring the state initialization. Then
we study the effect of acoustic phonons and electron tunnelings on the scheme,
and show that the concurrence of entangled state can be over 0.95 at
temperature $T = 1 $K.
