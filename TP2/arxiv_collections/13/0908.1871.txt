Massive stars end their life in an explosion event with kinetic energies of
the order 1 Bethe. Immediately after the explosion has been launched, a region
of low density and high entropy forms behind the ejecta which is continuously
subject to neutrino heating. The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the
center, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.
This heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates
to an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind. For the first time, we
simulate the collapse, bounce, explosion and the neutrino driven wind phases
consistently over more than 20 seconds. Our numerical model is based on
spherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics using
spectral three flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. In simulations where no
explosions are obtained naturally, we model neutrino driven explosions for low
and intermediate mass Fe-core progenitor stars by enhancing the charged current
reaction rates. In the case of a special progenitor star, the O-Ne-Mg-core, the
explosion in spherical symmetry was obtained without enhanced opacities. The
post explosion evolution is in qualitative agreement with static steady-state
and parametrized dynamic models of the neutrino driven wind. On the other hand,
we find generally smaller neutrino luminosities and mean neutrino energies as
well as a different evolutionary behavior of the neutrino luminosities and mean
neutrino energies. The neutrino driven wind is proton-rich for more than 10
seconds and the contraction of the PNS differs from the assumptions made for
the conditions at the inner boundary in previous neutrino driven wind studies.
Despite the moderately large entropies per baryon of about 100 and the fast
expansion timescale, the conditions found in our model are unlikely to favor...
