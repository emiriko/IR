We present a factorization formula for the production of pairs of heavy
coloured particles in hadronic collisions at the production threshold, which
forms the basis for the resummation of soft gluons and Coulomb gluons. We
construct a basis in colour space that diagonalizes the soft function appearing
in the factorization formula to all orders in perturbation theory. This extends
recent results on the structure of soft anomalous dimensions and allows us to
determine an analytic expression for the two-loop soft anomalous dimension at
threshold for all production processes of interest.
