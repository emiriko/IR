In this paper, we have first given an intuitive definition of "Consciousness"
as realized by us. Next, from this intuitive definition we derived the physical
definition of quantum consciousness (Quantum Consciousness Parameter or QCP).
This QCP is the elementary level of consciousness in quantum particles, which
are the most elementary particles in nature. Thus QCP can explain both the
perceptible and non-perceptible nature and some existing postulates of physics.
We conceptualize that the level of human consciousness is most complex having
highest fractal dimension of 4.85 in the electroencephalographs experiment done
by other research groups. On the other hand, other species are having lesser
consciousness level, which can be reflected by lesser fractal dimensions. We
have also explored the bio informatics of consciousness from genome viewpoints
where we tried to draw an analogy of neurons with electrons and photons.
Lastly, we refine the quantum mechanics in terms of QCP; we all know that in
Einstein's special theory of relativity, Einstein has used the postulate
"Consistency of the velocity of light irrespective of all frames of reference
(inertial or non-inertial frames)". In our theoretical revelation QCP can be
directly applied to get a confirmatory proof of this postulate. Thus the
postulate can be framed as a law.
