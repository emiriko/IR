Aims. The statistical equilibrium of neutral and ionized silicon in the
atmospheres of metal-poor stars is discussed. Non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium effects are investigated and the silicon abundances in metal-poor
stars determined. Methods. We have used high resolution, high signal to noise
ratio spectra from the UVES spectragraph at the ESO VLT telescope. Line
formation calculations of Si i and Si ii in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars
are presented for atomic models of silicon including 174 terms and 1132 line
transitions. Recent improved calculations of Si i and Si ii photoionization
cross-sections are taken into account, and the influence of the free-free
quasi-molecular absorption in the Ly alpha wing is investigated by comparing
theoretical and observed fluxes of metal-poor stars. All abundance results are
derived from LTE and NLTE statistical equilibrium calculations and spectrum
synthesis methods. Results. It is found that the extreme ultraviolet radiation
is very important for metal-poor stars, especially for the high temperature,
very metal-poor stars. The radiative bound-free cross-sections also play a very
important role for these stars. Conclusions. NLTE effects for Si are found to
be important for metal-poor stars, in particular for warm metal-poor stars. It
is found that these effects depend on the temperature. For warm metal-poor
stars, the NLTE abundance correction reaches ~ 0.2 dex relative to standard LTE
calculations. Our results indicate that Si is overabundant for metal-poor
stars.
