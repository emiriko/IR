We present an Initial Value Representation for the semiclassical coherent
state propagator based on complex trajectories. We map the complex phase space
into a real phase space with twice as many dimensions and use a simple
procedure to automatically eliminate non-contributing trajectories. The
resulting semiclassical formulas do not show divergences due to caustics and
provide accurate results.
