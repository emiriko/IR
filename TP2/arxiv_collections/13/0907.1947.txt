The ALICE experiment will be able to detect hadrons containing charm and
beauty quarks in proton-proton and heavy ion collisions in the new energy
regime of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Open charmed mesons are a
powerful tool to study the medium produced in heavy ion collisions, since charm
quarks are produced on a very short time scale and they experience the whole
history of the collision. In addition, the measurements of heavy flavour yield
provide a natural normalization for those of charmonia and bottomonia
production at LHC. In this talk, after a general overview of ALICE perspectives
for heavy flavour physics, we will report some study of D-meson reconstruction
through their hadronic decay channels with Monte Carlo simulated data.
