We extend results developed by Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 65, 2925 (1976)] for
the dielectric constant of neutral site-site molecular models to mixtures of
both charged and uncharged molecules. This provides a unified derivation
connecting the Stillinger-Lovett moment conditions for ions to standard results
for the dielectric constant for polar species and yields exact expressions for
the small-k expansion of the two-point intermolecular charge-density function
used to determine the total Coulomb energy. The latter is useful in determining
corrections to the thermodynamics of uniform site-site molecular models
simulated with spherically truncated Coulomb interactions.
