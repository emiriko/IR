Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, ground state
properties of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain with exchange and quadratic
single-ion anisotropies in an external field are studied, for special choices
of the two kinds of anisotropies. In particular, the phase diagram includes
antiferromagnetic, spin-liquid (or spin-flop), (10), and supersolid (or
biconical) phases. Especially, new features of the spin-liquid and supersolid
phases are discussed. Properties of the quantum chains are compared to those of
corresponding classical spin chains.
