We discuss the geometry of orbit closures and the asymptotic behavior of
Kronecker coefficients in the context of the Geometric Complexity Theory
program to prove a variant of Valiant's algebraic analog of the P not equal to
NP conjecture. We also describe the precise separation of complexity classes
that their program proposes to demonstrate.
