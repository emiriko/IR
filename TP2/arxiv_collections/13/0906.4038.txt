From the first stages of star and galaxy formation, non-gravitational
processes such as ram pressure stripping, SNs, galactic winds, AGNs,
galaxy-galaxy mergers, etc... lead to the enrichment of the IGM in stars,
metals as well as dust, via the ejection of galactic material into the IGM. We
know now that these processes shape, side by side with gravitation, the
formation and the evolution of structures. We present here hydrodynamic
simulations of structure formation implementing the effect of the cooling by
dust on large scale structure formation. We focus on the scale of galaxy
clusters and study the statistical properties of clusters. Here we present our
results on the $T_X-M$ and the $L_X-M$ scaling relations which exhibit changes
on both the slope and normalization when adding cooling by dust to the standard
radiative cooling model. For example, the normalization of the $T_X-M$ relation
changes only by a maximum of 2% at $M=10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ whereas the
normalization of the $L_X-T_X$ changes by as much as 10% at $T_X=1$ keV for
models that including dust cooling. Our study shows that the dust is an added
non-gravitational process that contributes shaping the thermodynamical state of
the hot ICM gas.
