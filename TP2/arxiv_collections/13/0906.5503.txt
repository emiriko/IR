Very high energy gamma rays coming from extra-galactic sources can interact
with intergalactic radiation fields. This process may result in electromagnetic
cascades with the following cycle: the production of electron-positron pairs
and then secondary gamma-rays due to inverse Compton scattering. Since
electrons and positrons will be scattered in the intergalactic magnetic field,
under certain conditions their radiation may be redirected towards the
observer. Thus one can anticipate that the secondary gamma-ray emission may
produce an apparent extended halo around the source.
  MAGIC is an Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescope located on Canary island
of La Palma at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (2200 m.a.s.l). Various
source sizes and extended emission profiles within $1^\circ$ diameter have been
studied by using dedicated Monte Carlo simulations for the MAGIC telescope. We
present results of the study of a possible extended emission for Mrk 421 and
Mrk501 done with the MAGIC telescope.
