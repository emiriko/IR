A fermionic operator circuit is a product of fermionic operators of usually
different and partially overlapping support. Further elements of fermionic
operator circuits (FOCs) are partial traces and partial projections. The
presented framework allows for the introduction of fermionic versions of known
qudit operator circuits (QUOC), important for the simulation of strongly
correlated d-dimensional systems: The multiscale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA), tree tensor networks (TTN), projected entangled pair states
(PEPS), or their infinite-size versions (iPEPS etc.). After the definition of a
FOC, we present a method to contract it with the same computation and memory
requirements as a corresponding QUOC, for which all fermionic operators are
replaced by qudit operators of identical dimension. A given scheme for
contracting the QUOC relates to an analogous scheme for the corresponding
fermionic circuit, where additional marginal computational costs arise only
from reordering of modes for operators occurring in intermediate stages of the
contraction. Our result hence generalizes efficient schemes for the simulation
of d-dimensional spin systems, as MERA, TTN, or PEPS to the fermionic case.
