Aims : Following the advent of increasingly sensitive X-ray observatories,
deep observations of early-type stars became possible. However, the results for
only a few objects or clusters have until now been reported and there has been
no large survey comparable to that based upon the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS).
Methods : A limited survey of X-ray sources, consisting of all public XMM
observations (2XMMi) and slew survey data (XMMSL1), is now available. The X-ray
counterparts to hot, massive stars have been searched for in these catalogs.
Results : About 300 OB stars were detected with XMM. Half of them were bright
enough for a spectral analysis to be possible, and we make available the
detailed spectral properties that were derived. The X-ray spectra of O stars
are represented well by low (<1keV) temperature components and seem to indicate
that an absorption column is present in addition to the interstellar
contribution. The X-ray fluxes are well correlated with the bolometric fluxes,
with a scatter comparable to that of the RASS studies and thus larger than
found previously with XMM for some individual clusters. These results contrast
with those of B stars that exhibit a large scatter in the L_X-L_BOL relation,
no additional absorption being found, and the fits indicate a plasma at higher
temperatures. Variability (either within one exposure or between multiple
exposures) was also investigated whenever possible: short-term variations are
far more rare than long-term ones (the former affects a few percent of the
sample, while the latter concerns between one third and two thirds of the
sources). Conclusions : This paper presents the results of the first
high-sensitivity investigation of the overall high-energy properties of a
sizable sample of hot stars.
