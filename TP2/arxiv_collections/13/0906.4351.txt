We study the conductance through two types of graphene nanostructures:
nanoribbon junctions in which the width changes from wide to narrow, and curved
nanoribbons. In the wide-narrow structures, substantial reflection occurs from
the wide-narrow interface, in contrast to the behavior of the much studied
electron gas waveguides. In the curved nanoribbons, the conductance is very
sensitive to details such as whether regions of a semiconducting armchair
nanoribbon are included in the curved structure -- such regions strongly
suppress the conductance. Surprisingly, this suppression is not due to the band
gap of the semiconducting nanoribbon, but is linked to the valley degree of
freedom. Though we study these effects in the simplest contexts, they can be
expected to occur for more complicated structures, and we show results for
rings as well. We conclude that experience from electron gas waveguides does
not carry over to graphene nanostructures. The interior interfaces causing
extra scattering result from the extra effective degrees of freedom of the
graphene structure, namely the valley and sublattice pseudospins.
