We present the first observational limits to the ultra-high energy (UHE)
neutrino flux from the Galactic Center, and from Centaurus A which is the
nearest active galactic nucleus (AGN). These results are based on our "Lunar
UHE Neutrino Astrophysics using the Square Kilometer Array" (LUNASKA) project
experiments at the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We also derive
limits for the previous experiments and compare these limits with expectations
for acceleration and super-heavy dark matter models of the origin of UHE cosmic
rays.
