Over the past two decades, helioseismology has revolutionized our
understanding of the interior structure and dynamics of the Sun.
Asteroseismology will soon place this knowledge into a broader context by
providing structural data for hundreds of Sun-like stars. Solar-like
oscillations have already been detected from the ground in several stars, and
NASA's Kepler mission is poised to unleash a flood of stellar pulsation data.
Deriving reliable asteroseismic information from these observations demands a
significant improvement in our analysis methods. We report the initial results
of our efforts to develop an objective stellar model-fitting pipeline for
asteroseismic data. The cornerstone of our automated approach is an
optimization method using a parallel genetic algorithm. We describe the details
of the pipeline and we present the initial application to Sun-as-a-star data,
yielding an optimal model that accurately reproduces the known solar
properties.
