Gaussian white noise is frequently used to model fluctuations in physical
systems. In Fokker-Planck theory, this leads to a vanishing probability density
near the absorbing boundary of threshold models. Here we derive the boundary
condition for the stationary density of a first-order stochastic differential
equation for additive finite-grained Poisson noise and show that the response
properties of threshold units are qualitatively altered. Applied to the
integrate-and-fire neuron model, the response turns out to be instantaneous
rather than exhibiting low-pass characteristics, highly non-linear, and
asymmetric for excitation and inhibition. The novel mechanism is exhibited on
the network level and is a generic property of pulse-coupled systems of
threshold units.
