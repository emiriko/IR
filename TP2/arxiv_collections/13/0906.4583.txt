In this paper, we study exactly the thermal conductance for a low dimensional
system represented by two coupled massive Brownian particles, both directly and
via a Green-Kubo expression. Both approaches give exactly the same result. We
also obtain exactly the steady state probability distribution for that system
by means of time-averaging.
