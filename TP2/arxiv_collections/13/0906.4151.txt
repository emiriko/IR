Einstein Telescope (ET) is a 3rd generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector
that is currently undergoing a design study. ET can detect millions of compact
binary mergers up to redshifts 2-8. A small fraction of mergers might be
observed in coincidence as gamma-ray bursts, helping to measure both the
luminosity distance and red-shift to the source. By fitting these measured
values to a cosmological model, it should be possible to accurately infer the
dark energy equation-of-state, dark matter and dark energy density parameters.
ET could, therefore, herald a new era in cosmology.
