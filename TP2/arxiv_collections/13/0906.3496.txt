We explore the high-dimensional chaotic dynamics of the Lorenz-96 model by
computing the variation of the fractal dimension with system parameters. The
Lorenz-96 model is a continuous in time and discrete in space model first
proposed by Edward Lorenz to study fundamental issues regarding the forecasting
of spatially extended chaotic systems such as the atmosphere. First, we explore
the spatiotemporal chaos limit by increasing the system size while holding the
magnitude of the external forcing constant. Second, we explore the strong
driving limit by increasing the external forcing while holding the system size
fixed. As the system size is increased for small values of the forcing we find
dynamical states that alternate between periodic and chaotic dynamics. The
windows of chaos are extensive, on average, with relative deviations from
extensivity on the order of 20%. For intermediate values of the forcing we find
chaotic dynamics for all system sizes past a critical value. The fractal
dimension exhibits a maximum deviation from extensivity on the order of 5% for
small changes in system size and decreases non-monotonically with increasing
system size. The length scale describing the deviations from extensivity and
the natural chaotic length scale are approximately equal in support of the
suggestion that deviations from extensivity are due to the addition of chaotic
degrees of freedom as the system size is increased. As the forcing is increased
at constant system size the fractal dimension exhibits a power-law dependence.
The power-law behavior is independent of the system size and quantifies the
decreasing size of chaotic degrees of freedom with increased forcing which we
compare with spatial features of the patterns.
