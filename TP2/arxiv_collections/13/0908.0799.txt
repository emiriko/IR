We study the foliation of a $D$-dimensional spherically symmetric black-hole
spacetime with $D\ge 5$ by two kinds of one-parameter family of maximal
hypersurfaces: a reflection-symmetric foliation with respect to the wormhole
slot and a stationary foliation that has an infinitely long trumpet-like shape.
As in the four-dimensional case, the foliations by the maximal hypersurfaces
have the singularity avoidance nature irrespective of dimensionality. This
indicates that the maximal slicing condition will be useful for simulating
higher-dimensional black-hole spacetimes in numerical relativity. For the case
of D=5, we present analytic solutions of the intrinsic metric, the extrinsic
curvature, the lapse function, and the shift vector for the foliation by the
stationary maximal hypersurfaces. This data will be useful for checking
five-dimensional numerical relativity codes based on the moving puncture
approach.
