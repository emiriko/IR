Using new four-loop results for the heavy quark vacuum polarization and new
data for bottom quark production in electron-positron annihilation, an update
on the determination of charm- and bottom-quark masses through sum rules has
been performed. The previous result for the charm-quark mass, $m_c(3 {\rm
GeV})= 0.986(13) {\rm GeV}$, based on the lowest moment, is supported by the
new results from higher moments which lead to consistent values with comparable
errors. The new value for the bottom quark, $m_b(10 {\rm GeV})= 3.610(16) {\rm
GeV}$, corresponding to $m_b(m_b)= 4.163(16) {\rm GeV}$, makes use both of the
new data and the new perturbative results and is consistent with the earlier
determination.
