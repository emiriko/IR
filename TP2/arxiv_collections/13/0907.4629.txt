The reduced dynamics of two interacting qubits coupled to two independent
bosonic baths is investigated. The one-excitation dynamics is derived and
compared with that based on the resolution of appropriate non-Markovian master
equations. The Nakajima-Zwanzig and the time-convolutionless projection
operator techniques are exploited to provide a description of the non-Markovian
features of the dynamics of the two-qubits system. The validity of such
approximate methods and their range of validity in correspondence to different
choices of the parameters describing the system are brought to light.
