Parafermions of order two and three are shown to be the fundamental tool to
construct superspaces related to cubic and quartic extensions of the Poincar\'e
algebra. The corresponding superfields are constructed, and some of their main
properties analyzed in detail. In this context, the existence problem of
operators acting like covariant derivatives is analyzed, and the associated
operators are explicitly constructed.
