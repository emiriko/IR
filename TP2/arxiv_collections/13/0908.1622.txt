When protoplanets growing by accretion of planetesimals have atmospheres,
small planetesimals approaching the protoplanets lose their energy by gas drag
from the atmospheres, which leads them to be captured within the Hill sphere of
the protoplanets. As a result, growth rates of the protoplanets are enhanced.
In order to study the effect of an atmosphere on planetary growth rates, we
performed numerical integration of orbits of planetesimals for a wide range of
orbital elements and obtained the effective accretion rates of planetesimals
onto planets that have atmospheres. Numerical results are obtained as a
function of planetesimals' eccentricity, inclination, planet's radius, and
non-dimensional gas-drag parameters which can be expressed by several physical
quantities such as the radius of planetesimals and the mass of the protoplanet.
Assuming that the radial distribution of the gas density near the surface can
be approximated by a power-law, we performed analytic calculation for the loss
of planetesimals' kinetic energy due to gas drag, and confirmed agreement with
numerical results. We confirmed that the above approximation of the power-law
density distribution is reasonable for accretion rate of protoplanets with one
to ten Earth-masses, unless the size of planetesimals is too small. We also
calculated the accretion rates of planetesimals averaged over a Rayleigh
distribution of eccentricities and inclinations, and derived a semi-analytical
formula of accretion rates, which reproduces the numerical results very well.
Using the obtained expression of the accretion rate, we examined the growth of
protoplanets in nebular gas. We found that the effect of atmospheric gas drag
can enhance the growth rate significantly, depending on the size of
planetesimals.
