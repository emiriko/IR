We consider the Sivers, Collins and transversity functions as extracted from
SIDIS and e+e- experimental data and investigate to what extent they might
explain the large Single Spin Asymmetries (SSA) observed in proton-proton
inclusive processes. This phenomenological study is performed within the TMD
factorization scheme. As the SIDIS data cover only a limited range of x values
(x < 0.3), we allow for different large $x$ behaviours of the SIDIS Sivers
functions and transversity distributions. We conclude that, within the
available experimental constraints, one cannot observe any clear universality
breaking effect for the Sivers functions.
