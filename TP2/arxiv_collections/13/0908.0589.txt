We study the finite size effect of the Kondo screening cloud in a
double-quantum-dot setup via a large-N slave-boson mean-field theory. In this
setup, one of the dots is embedded in a close metallic ring with a finite size
$L$ and the other dot is side-coupled to the embedded dot via an
anti-ferromagnetic spin-spin exchange coupling with the strength K. The
antiferromagnetic coupling favors the local spin-singlet and suppresses the
Kondo screening. The effective Kondo temperature T_k (proptotional to the
inverse of the Kondo screening cloud size) shows the Kosterlitz--Thouless (KT)
scaling at finite sizes, indicating the quantum transition of the KT type
between the Kondo screened phase for K < K_c and the local spin-singlet phase
for K > K_c in the thermodynamic limit with K_c being the critical value. The
mean-field phase diagram as a function of 1/L and K shows a crossover between
Kondo and local spin-singlet ground states for K < K_c (L=4n, 4n+1, 4n+3) and
for K>K_c (L=4n+2). To look into the crossover region more closely, the local
density of states on the quantum dot and the persistent current at finite sizes
with different values of $K$ are also calculated.
