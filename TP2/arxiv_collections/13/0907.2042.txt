We study the Josephson effect and pairing correlations in SFFS junctions that
consist of conventional superconductors (S) connected through two metallic
monodomain ferromagnets (F) with transparent and spin inactive interfaces. We
solve the Eilenberger equations for arbitrary relative orientation of
magnetizations of the two F layers in the clean limit and for moderate disorder
in ferromagnets. Spatial variation of pair amplitudes, singlet $f_s$, and odd
in frequency triplet $f_{t0}$ and $f_{t1}$, with 0 and $\pm1$ spin projections,
as well as the Josephson current-phase relations are calculated for different
values of the ferromagnetic layers thickness and angle $\alpha$ between
in-plane magnetizations. In contrast to the dirty limit case, we find that for
$0<\alpha<\pi$ both spin singlet and triplet pair amplitudes in F layers
power-law decay in the same oscillatory manner with distance from the FS
interfaces. This decay gets faster as the impurity-scattering rate in
ferromagnets is increased. The computed triplet amplitude $f_{t1}$ has opposite
signs in the two magnet regions, penetrates into the superconductors and
monotonically decays over the same distance, which is the superconducting
coherence length, as the singlet amplitude $f_s$ saturates to the bulk value.
We point out that influence of misorientation of magnetizations on the
Josephson current can not be attributed directly to the appearance of odd
triplet correlations.
