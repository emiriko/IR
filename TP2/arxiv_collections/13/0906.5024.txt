We present an experimental realization of a low-noise, phase-insensitive
optical amplifier using a four-wave mixing interaction in hot Rb vapor.
Performance near the quantum limit for a range of amplifier gains, including
near unity, can be achieved. Such low-noise amplifiers are essential for
so-called quantum cloning machines and are useful in quantum information
protocols. We demonstrate that amplification and ``cloning'' of one half of a
two-mode squeezed state is possible while preserving entanglement.
