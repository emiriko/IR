Recent lattice measurements have given accurate estimates of the light and
strange quark condensates in the proton. We use these new results to
significantly improve the dark matter predictions in a set of benchmark models
that represent different scenarios in the constrained minimal supersymmetric
standard model (CMSSM). Because the predicted cross sections are at least an
order of magnitude smaller than previously suggested, our results have
significant consequences for dark matter searches.
