In the context of the induced matter theory of gravity, we investigate the
possibility of deriving a 4D quintessential scenario where an interaction
between dark energy and dark matter is allowed, and the dark energy component
is modeled by a minimally coupled scalar field. Regarding the Ponce de Leon
metric, we found that it is possible to obtain such scenario on which the
energy densities of dark matter and dark energy, are both depending of the
fifth extra coordinate. We obtain that the 4D induced scalar potential for the
quintessence scalar field, has the same algebraic form to the one found by
Zimdahl and Pavon in the context of usual 4D cosmology.
