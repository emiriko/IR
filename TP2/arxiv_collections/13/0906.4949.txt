We present a fully quantum many-body treatment of dark solitons formed by
ultracold bosonic atoms in one-dimensional optical lattices. Using
time-evolving block decimation to simulate the single-band Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian, we consider the quantum dynamics of density and phase engineered
dark solitons as well as the quantum evolution of mean-field dark solitons
injected into the quantum model. The former approach directly models how one
may create quantum entangled dark solitons in experiment. While we have already
presented results regarding the latter approach elsewhere [Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 103}, 140403 (2009)], we expand upon those results in this work. In both
cases, quantum fluctuations cause the dark soliton to fill in and may induce an
inelasticity in soliton-soliton collisions. Comparisons are made to the
Bogoliubov theory which predicts depletion into an anomalous mode that fills in
the soliton. Our many-body treatment allows us to go beyond the Bogoliubov
approximation and calculate explicitly the dynamics of the system's natural
orbitals.
