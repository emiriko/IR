We report a comparative study of the series Fe1.1Te1-xSex and the
stoichiometric FeTe1-xSex to bring out the difference in their magnetic,
superconducting and electronic properties. The Fe1.1Te1-xSex series is found to
be magnetic and its microscopic properties are elucidated through Moessbauer
spectroscopy. The magnetic phase diagram of Fe1.1Te1-xSex is traced out and it
shows the emergence of spin-glass state when the antiferromagnetic state is
destabilized by the Se substitution. The isomer shift and quadrupolar splitting
obtained from the Moessbauer spectroscopy clearly brings out the electronic
differences in these two series.
