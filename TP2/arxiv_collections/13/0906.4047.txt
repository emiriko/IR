We study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of random Hermitian
periodic band matrices, focusing on the spectral edges. The eigenvalues close
to the edges converge in distribution to the Airy point process if (and only
if) the band is sufficiently wide (W >> N^{5/6}.) Otherwise, a different
limiting distribution appears.
