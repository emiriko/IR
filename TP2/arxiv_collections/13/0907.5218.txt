Microwave pinning-mode resonances found around integer quantum Hall effects,
are a signature of crystallized quasiparticles or holes. Application of
in-plane magnetic field to these crystals, increasing the Zeeman energy, has
negligible effect on the resonances just below Landau level filling $\nu=2$,
but increases the pinning frequencies near $\nu=1$, particularly for smaller
quasiparticle/hole densities. The charge dynamics near $\nu=1$, characteristic
of a crystal order, are affected by spin, in a manner consistent with a Skyrme
crystal.
