The studies focused on the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch phase
experienced by low- and intermediate-mass stars are extremely important in many
astrophysical contexts. In particular, a detailed computation of their chemical
yields is essential for several issues, ranging from the chemical evolution of
galaxies, to the mechanisms behind the formation of globular clusters. Among
all the uncertainties affecting the theoretical modelling of this phase, and
described in the literature, it remains to be fully clarified which results are
severely affected by the use of inadequate low-temperature opacities, that are
in most cases calculated on the basis of the original chemical composition of
the stars, and do not consider the changes in the surface chemistry due to the
occurrence of the third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. Our investigation is
aimed at investigating this point. By means of full evolutionary models
including new set of molecular opacities computed specifically with the AESOPUS
tool, we highlight which stellar models, among those present in the literature,
need a substantial revision, mainly in relation to the predicted chemical
yields. The interplay among convection, hot bottom burning and the
low-temperature opacity treatment is also discussed
