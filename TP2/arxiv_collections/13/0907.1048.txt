A search for pair production of first-generation leptoquarks LQ is performed
with data collected by the D0 experiment in p pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. In a sample of data corresponding to ~1
fb-1, the search has been performed on the final states with two electrons and
two jets or one electron, two jets and missing transverse energy. We find our
data consistent with standard model expectations. The results are combined with
those found in a previous analysis of events with two jets and missing
transverse energy to obtain scalar LQ mass limits. We set 95% C.L. lower limits
on a scalar LQ mass of 299 GeV, 284 GeV and 216 GeV for beta=1, beta=0.5 and
beta=0.02 respectively, where beta is the LQ branching ratio in the eq channel.
This improves the results obtained with a lower luminosity sample from Run II
of the Tevatron. Lower limits on vector LQ masses with different couplings from
357 GeV to 464 GeV for beta=0.5 are also set using this analysis.
