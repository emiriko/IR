We present the identification of the most likely near-infrared/optical
counterparts of five low-luminosity X-ray pulsators (AX J1700.1-4157, AX
1740.1-2847, AX J1749.2-2725, AX J1820.5-1434 and AX J1832.3-0840) which have
long pulse periods (> 150 s). The X-ray properties of these systems suggest
that they are likely members of persistent high mass X-ray binaries or
intermediate polars. Using our Chandra observations, we detected the most
likely counterparts of three sources (excluding AX J1820.5-1434 and AX
J1832.3-0840) in their ESO - NTT near-infrared observations, and a possible
counterpart for AX J1820.5-1434 and AX J1832.3-0840 in the 2MASS and DSS
observations respectively. We also performed the X-ray timing and spectral
analysis for all the sources using our XMM-Newton observations, which further
helped us to constrain the nature of these systems. Our multiwavelength
observations suggest that AX J1749.2-2725 and AX J1820.5-1434 most likely
harbor accreting neutron stars while AX J1700.1-4157, AX J1740.1-2847 and AX
J1832.3-0840 could be intermediate polars.
