Although there exist very accurate hardware systems for measuring traffic on
the internet, their widespread use for analysis tasks is limited by their high
cost. On the other hand, less expensive, software-based systems exist that are
widely available and can be used to perform a number of simple analysis tasks.
The caveat with using such software systems is that application of standard
analysis methods cannot proceed blindly because inherent distortions exist in
the measurements obtained from software systems. The goal of this paper is to
analyze common Internet measurement systems to discover the effect of these
distortions on common analysis tasks. Then by selecting one specific task,
periodic signal detection, a more in-depth analysis is conducted which derives
a signal representation to capture the salient features of the measurement and
develops a periodic detection mechanism designed for the measurement system
which outperforms an existing detection method not optimized for the
measurement system. Finally, through experiments the importance of
understanding the relationship between the input traffic, measurement system
configuration and detection method performance is emphasized.
