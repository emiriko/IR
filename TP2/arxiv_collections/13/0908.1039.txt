Spin transport experiments in graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms,
indicate spin relaxation times that are significantly shorter than the
theoretical predictions. We investigate experimentally whether these short spin
relaxation times are due to extrinsic factors, such as spin relaxation caused
by low impedance contacts, enhanced spin flip processes at the device edges or
the presence of an aluminium oxide layer on top of graphene in some samples.
Lateral spin valve devices using a field effect transistor geometry allowed for
the investigation of the spin relaxation as a function of the charge density,
going continuously from metallic hole to electron conduction (charge densities
of $n\sim 10^{12}$cm$^{-2}$) via the Dirac charge neutrality point ($n \sim
0$). The results are quantitatively described by a one dimensional spin
diffusion model where the spin relaxation via the contacts is taken into
account. Spin valve experiments for various injector/detector separations and
spin precession experiments reveal that the longitudinal (T$_1$) and the
transversal (T$_2$) relaxation times are similar. The anisotropy of the spin
relaxation times $\tau_\parallel$ and $\tau_\perp$, when the spins are injected
parallel or perpendicular to the graphene plane, indicates that the effective
spin orbit fields do not lie exclusively in the two dimensional graphene plane.
Furthermore, the proportionality between the spin relaxation time and the
momentum relaxation time indicates that the spin relaxation mechanism is of the
Elliott-Yafet type. For carrier mobilities of 2-5$\times 10^3$ cm$2^$/Vs and
for graphene flakes of 0.1-2 $\mu$m in width, we found spin relaxation times of
the order of 50-200 ps, times which appear not to be determined by the
extrinsic factors mentioned above.
