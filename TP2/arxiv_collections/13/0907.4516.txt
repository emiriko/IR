The calculation of the spectrum of QCD is key to an understanding of the
strong interactions, and vital if we are to capitalize on the experimental
study of the spectrum. In this paper, we describe progress towards
understanding the spectrum of resonances of both mesons and baryons from
lattice QCD, focusing in particular on the resonances of the $I=1/2$ nucleon
states, and of charmonium mesons composed of the heavy charmed quarks.
