We investigate two multi-shell galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), Kes79 and
G352.7-0.1, to understand the causes of such morphology. The research was
carried out based on new and reprocessed archival VLA observations and
XMM-Newton archival data. The surrounding was investigated based on data
extracted from the HI Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the 13^CO Galactic Ring
Survey and the HI Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The present study revealed
that the overall morphology of both SNRs is the result of the mass-loss history
of their respective progenitor stars. Kes79 would be the product of the
gravitational collapse of a massive O9 star evolving near a molecular cloud and
within the precursor's wind-driven bubble, while G352.7-0.1 would be the result
of interactions of the SNR with an asymmetric wind from the progenitor together
with projection effects. No radio point source or pulsar wind nebula was found
associated with the X-ray pulsar CXOU J185238.6+004020 in Kes79. The X-ray
study of G352.7-0.1, on its hand, revealed that most of the thermal X-ray
radiation completely fills in the interior of the remnant and originates in
heated ejecta. Characteristic parameters, like radio flux, radio spectral
index, age, distance, shock velocity, initial energy and luminosity, were
estimated for both SNRs.
