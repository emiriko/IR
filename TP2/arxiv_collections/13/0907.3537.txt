The structure of the genetic code is discussed in formal terms. A rectangular
table of the code ("the code matrix"), whose properties reveal its arithmetical
content tagged with the information symbols in several notations. New
parameters used to analyze of the code matrix, the serial numbers of the
encoded products and coding elements, ordered by molecular mass. The structural
similarity of the amino acid sequences corresponding to two aminoacyl tRNA
synthetases classes is found. The code matrix shows how can be organized the
so-called second genetic code. The symmetrical pattern of the matrix is
supported with the other parameters; it also serves as a basis to construct a
3D model of the genetic code which follows the structure of the simplest Plato
solid, tetrahedron. The reasons for this unusual structure of the genetic code
remains unclear.
