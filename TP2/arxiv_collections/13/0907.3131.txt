The SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) technique has been used to determine
the fundamental structure of conducting thin films fabricated by implanting
gold ions into PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) polymer. We present a brief review
of the SAXS theories necessary to determine the structural properties of our
nanoheterogeneous films.
