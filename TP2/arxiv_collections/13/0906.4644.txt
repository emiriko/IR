We report the 75As nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and specific heat
measurements of the heavily hole-doped superconductor KFe2As2 (Tc = 3.5 K). The
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the superconducting state exhibits quite
gradual temperature dependence with no coherence peak below Tc. The
quasi-particle specific heat C_QP/T shows small specific heat jump which is
about 30% of electronic specific heat coefficient just below Tc. In addition,
it suggests the existence of low-energy quasi-particle excitation at the lowest
measurement temperature T = 0.4 K \simeq Tc/10. These temperature dependence of
1/T1 and C_QP/T can be explained by multiple nodal superconducting gap scenario
rather than multiple fully-gapped s_\pm-wave one within simple gap analysis.
