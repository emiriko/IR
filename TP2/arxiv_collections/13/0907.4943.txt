In this paper, we investigate protection strategies of sensitive body anatomy
against the irradiation to the cancerous moving tumors in intensity modulated
radiation therapy. Inspired by optimization techniques developed in statistical
physics and dynamical systems, we deploy a method based on variational
principles and formulate an efficient genetic algorithm which enable us to
search for global minima in a complex landscape of irradiation dose delivered
to the radiosensitive organs at risk. We take advantage of the internal motion
of body anatomy during radiation therapy to reduce the unintentional delivery
of the radiation to sensitive organs. We show that the accurate optimization of
the control parameters, compare to the conventional IMRT and widely used
delivery based on static anatomy assumption, leads to a significant reduction
of the dose delivered to the organs at risk.
