We determine the general structure of the partition function of the $q$-state
Potts model in an external magnetic field, $Z(G,q,v,w)$ for arbitrary $q$,
temperature variable $v$, and magnetic field variable $w$, on cyclic, M\"obius,
and free strip graphs $G$ of the square (sq), triangular (tri), and honeycomb
(hc) lattices with width $L_y$ and arbitrarily great length $L_x$. For the
cyclic case we prove that the partition function has the form $Z(\Lambda,L_y
\times L_x,q,v,w)=\sum_{d=0}^{L_y} \tilde c^{(d)} Tr[(T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d})^m]$,
where $\Lambda$ denotes the lattice type, $\tilde c^{(d)}$ are specified
polynomials of degree $d$ in $q$, $T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d}$ is the corresponding
transfer matrix, and $m=L_x$ ($L_x/2$) for $\Lambda=sq, tri (hc)$,
respectively. An analogous formula is given for M\"obius strips, while only
$T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d=0}$ appears for free strips. We exhibit a method for
calculating $T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d}$ for arbitrary $L_y$ and give illustrative
examples. Explicit results for arbitrary $L_y$ are presented for
$T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d}$ with $d=L_y$ and $d=L_y-1$. We find very simple formulas
for the determinant $det(T_{Z,\Lambda,L_y,d})$. We also give results for
self-dual cyclic strips of the square lattice.
