We report measurements of magnetoresistance in bilayer graphene as a function
of gate voltage (carrier density) and temperature. We examine multiple
contributions to the magnetoresistance, including those of weak localization
(WL), universal conductance fluctuations (UCF), and inhomogeneous charge
transport. A clear WL signal is evident at all measured gate voltages (in the
hole doped regime) and temperature ranges (from 0.25 K to 4.3 K), and the phase
coherence length extracted from WL data does not saturate at low temperatures.
The WL data is fit to demonstrate that electron-electron Nyquist scattering is
the major source of phase decoherence. A decrease in UCF amplitude with
increasing gate voltage and temperature is shown to be consistent with a
corresponding decrease in the phase coherence length. In addition, a weak
positive magnetoresistance at higher magnetic fields is observed, and
attributed to inhomogeneous charge transport.
