Recent experiment [S.I. Dorozhkin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 036602
(2009)] on quantum Hall structures with strongly asymmetric contact
configuration discovered microwave-induced photocurrent and photovoltage
magnetooscillations in the absence of dc driving. We show that in an irradiated
sample the Landau quantization leads to violation of the Einstein relation
between the dc conductivity and diffusion coefficient. Then, in the presence of
a built-in electric field in a sample, the microwave illumination causes
photo-galvanic signals which oscillate as a function of magnetic field with the
period determined by the ratio of the microwave frequency to the cyclotron
frequency, as observed in the experiment.
