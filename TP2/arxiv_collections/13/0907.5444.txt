We investigate baryon transport in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at
energies reached at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, BNL Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and CERN LHC in the model of saturation. An
analytical scaling law is derived within the color glass condensate framework
based on small-coupling QCD. Transverse momentum spectra, net-baryon rapidity
distributions and their energy, mass and centrality dependences are well
described. In a comparison with RHIC data in Au + Au collisions at sqrt (s_NN)
= 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, the gradual approach to the gluon saturation regime is
investigated, and limits for the saturation-scale exponent are determined.
Predictions for net-baryon rapidity spectra and the mean rapidity loss in
central Pb + Pb collisions at LHC energies of sqrt (s_NN) = 5.52 TeV are made.
