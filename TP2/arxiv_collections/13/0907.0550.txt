MAGIC has been performing optically triggered Target of Opportunity
observations of flaring blazars since the beginning of its scientific
operations. The alerts of flaring blazars originate from Tuorla blazar
monitoring program, which started the optical monitoring of the candidate TeV
blazars in 2002 and has now collected up to six years of data on 30 blazars.
These Target of Opportunity observations have resulted in the discovery of
three new VHE gamma-ray emitting blazars (Mrk180, 1ES1011+496 and S50716+714)
and in addition the discoveries of BLLac and 3C279 were made during a high
optical state. In this talk we present a detailed analysis of the optical light
curves which are then compared to MAGIC observations of the same sources. We
aim to answer the question "Is there a connection between optical and VHE
gamma-ray high states in blazars or have we just been lucky?"
