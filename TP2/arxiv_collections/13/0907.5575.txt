A polynomial identity testing algorithm must determine whether a given input
polynomial is identically equal to 0. We give a deterministic black-box
identity testing algorithm for univariate polynomials of the form $\sum_{j=0}^t
c_j X^{\alpha_j} (a + b X)^{\beta_j}$. From our algorithm we derive an
exponential lower bound for representations of polynomials such as
$\prod_{i=1}^{2^n} (X^i-1)$ under this form. It has been conjectured that these
polynomials are hard to compute by general arithmetic circuits. Our result
shows that the "hardness from derandomization" approach to lower bounds is
feasible for a restricted class of arithmetic circuits. The proof is based on
techniques from algebraic number theory, and more precisely on properties of
the height function of algebraic numbers.
