Derangements are a popular topic in combinatorics classes. We study a
generalization to face derangements of the n-dimensional hypercube. These
derangements can be classified as odd or even, depending on whether the
underlying isometry is direct or indirect, providing a link to abstract
algebra. We emphasize the interplay between the geometry, algebra and
combinatorics of these sequences, with lots of pretty pictures.
