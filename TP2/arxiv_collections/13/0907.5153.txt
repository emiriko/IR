Stripe width variation in ultrathin magnetic films is a well known phenomenon
still not well understood. We analyze this problem considering a 2D Heisenberg
model with ferromagnetic exchange interactions, dipolar interactions and
perpendicular anisotropy, relevant e.g. in Fe/Cu(001) films. By extending a
classic result of Yafet & Gyorgy (YG) and using Monte Carlo simulations we
calculate the complete zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Through
this calculation we analyze the correlation between domain walls structure and
stripe width variation, as the perpendicular anisotropy changes. In particular,
we found evidences that the recently detected canted state becomes the ground
state of the system close to the Spin Reorientation Transition (SRT) for any
value of the exchange to dipolar couplings ratio. Far away of the SRT the
canted ground state is replaced by a saturated stripes state, in which
in--plane magnetization components are only present inside the walls. We find
that the domain wall structure strongly depends on the perpendicular
anisotropy: close to SRT it is well described by YG approximation, but a strong
departure is observed in the large anisotropy limit. Moreover, we show that
stripe width variation is directly related to domain wall width variation with
the anisotropy.
