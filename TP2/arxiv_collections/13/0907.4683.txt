We demonstrate the possibility of dynamic imaging of magnetic fields using
electromagnetically induced transparency in an atomic gas. As an experimental
demonstration we employ an atomic Rb gas confined in a glass cell to image the
transverse magnetic field created by a long straight wire. In this arrangement,
which clearly reveals the essential effect, the field of view is about 2 x 2
mm^2 and the field detection uncertainty is 0.14 mG per 10 um x 10 um image
pixel.
