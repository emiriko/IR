The Rouse (J. Chem. Phys. 21, 1272 (1953)) and Zimm (J. Chem. Phys. 24}, 269
(1956)) treatments of the dynamics of a polymer chain are shown to contain a
fundamental mathematical error, which causes them to lose the
zero-relaxation-rate, whole-body rotation motions dominant in viscosity and
dielectric relaxation. As a result, the oft-cited mode solutions for these
models are qualitatively incorrect. Comparison with the Wilson-Decius-Cross
treatment of vibrational modes of polyatomic molecules reveals qualitatively
the correct form for the solutions to the Rouse model.
