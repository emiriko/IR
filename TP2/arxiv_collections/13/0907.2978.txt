In this paper we would like to present a few characteristics of the Resistive
Plate Chambers (RPC) made of a particular grade of bakelite paper laminates
(P-120, NEMA LI-1989 Grade XXX), produced and commercially available in India.
This particular grade is used for high voltage insulation in humid conditions.
The chambers are tested with cosmic rays in the streamer mode using argon,
tetrafluroethane and isobutane in 34:59:7 mixing ratio. In the first set of
detectors made with such grade, a thin coating of silicone fluid on the inner
surfaces of the bakelite was found to be necessary for operation of the
detector. Those silicone coated RPCs were found to give satisfactory
performance with stable efficiency of >90% continuously for a long period as
reported earlier. Results of the crosstalk measurement of these silicone coated
RPC will be presented in this paper. Very recently RPCs made with the same
grade of bakelite but having better surface finish, are found to give
equivalent performance even without any coating inside. Preliminary results of
this type of RPCs are also being presented.
