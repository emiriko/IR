We present an exact mapping of models of interacting fermions onto boson
models. The bosons correspond to collective excitations in the initial
fermionic models. This bosonization is applicable in any dimension and for any
interaction between fermions. We show schematically how the mapping can be used
for Monte Carlo calculations and argue that it should be free from the sign
problem. Introducing superfields we derive a field theory that may serve as a
new way of analytical study.
