We present new central stellar velocity dispersion measurements for 428
galaxies in the Palomar spectroscopic survey of bright, northern galaxies. Of
these, 142 have no previously published measurements, most being relatively
late-type systems with low velocity dispersions (< 100 km/s). We provide
updates to a number of literature dispersions with large uncertainties. Our
measurements are based on a direct pixel-fitting technique that can accommodate
composite stellar populations by calculating an optimal linear combination of
input stellar templates. The original Palomar survey data were taken under
conditions that are not ideally suited for deriving stellar velocity
dispersions for galaxies with a wide range of Hubble types. We describe an
effective strategy to circumvent this complication and demonstrate that we can
still obtain reliable velocity dispersions for this sample of well-studied
nearby galaxies.
