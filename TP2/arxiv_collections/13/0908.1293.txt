The temperature dependence of phonon-induced resistance oscillations has been
investigated in two-dimensional electron system with moderate mobility at large
filling factors at temperature range T = 7.4 - 25.4 K. The amplitude of
phonon-induced oscillations has been found to be governed by quantum relaxation
time which is determined by electron-electron interaction effects. This is in
agreement with results recently obtained in ultra-high mobility two-dimensional
electron system with low electron density [A. T. Hatke et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 086808 (2009)]. The shift of the main maximum of the magnetophonon
resistance oscillations to higher magnetic fields with increasing temperature
is observed.
