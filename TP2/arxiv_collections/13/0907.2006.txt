We have studied $\Delta(54)\times Z_2$ flavor model for leptons and sleptons.
The tri-bimaximal mixing can be reproduced for arbitrary neutrino masses if
vacuum alignments of scalar fields are guaranteed. The deviation from the
tri-bimaximal mixing of leptons is predicted. The predicted upper bound for
$\sin\theta_{13}$ is 0.06. The magnitude of $\sin\theta_{23}$ could be deviated
from the maximal mixing considerably, but $\sin\theta_{12}$ is hardly deviated
from the tri-maximal mixing. We have also studied SUSY breaking terms in the
slepton sector. Three families of left-handed and right-handed slepton masses
are degenerate. Even although flavor symmetry breaking effects are taken into
account, our model leads to smaller values of flavor changing neutral currents
than the present experimental bounds.
