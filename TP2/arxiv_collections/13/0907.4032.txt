Inter-layer excitonic coherence in a quantum Hall bilayer with negligible
tunneling is monitored by measurements of low-lying spin excitations. At $\nu_T
=1$ new quasiparticle excitations are observed above a transition temperature
revealing a competing metallic phase. For magnetic fields above an onset Zeeman
energy this metallic phase has full spin polarization. A phase diagram in the
parameter space of temperature and Zeeman energy reveals that the transition
temperature increases at higher fields. This unexpected result suggests
intriguing impacts of spin polarization in the highly correlated phases.
