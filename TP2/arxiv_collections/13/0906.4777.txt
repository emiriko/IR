We study the doping driven Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the
periodic Anderson model set in the Mott-Hubbard regime. A striking asymmetry
for electron or hole driven transitions is found. The electron doped MIT at
larger U is similar to the one found in the single band Hubbard model, with a
first order character due to coexistence of solutions. The hole doped MIT, in
contrast, is second order and can be described as the delocalization of
Zhang-Rice singlets.
