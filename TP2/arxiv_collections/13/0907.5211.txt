We use observations of six "blazars" with the Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA), at eight frequencies (4.6, 5.1, 7.9, 8.9, 12.9, 15.4, 22.2, 43.1 GHz),
to investigate the frequency-dependent position of their VLBI cores
("core-shift") and their overall jet spectral distribution. By
cross-correlating the optically thin jet emission, we are able to accurately
align the multi-frequency images of three of the jets (1418+546, 2007+777,
2200+420), whose core-shifts and spectra we find consistent with the
equipartition regime of the Blandford & Konigl conical jet model, where the
position of the radio core from the base of the jet follows
$r_{core}\propto\nu^{-1}$. For the jet of 0954+658, we align the higher
frequency images using our lower frequency measurements assuming equipartition
in the radio core from 4.6-43 GHz. The jet emission of the other two sources in
our sample (1156+295, 1749+096) is too sparse for our alignment technique to
work. Using our measured core-shifts, we calculate equipartition magnetic field
strengths of the order of 10's to 100's of mG in the radio cores of these four
AGN from 4.6-43 GHz. Extrapolating our results back to the accretion disk and
black hole jet-launching distances, we find magnetic field strengths consistent
with those expected from theoretical models of magnetically powered jets.
