Quantum critical points are characterized by scale invariant correlations and
correspondingly long ranged entanglement. As such, they present fascinating
examples of quantum states of matter, the study of which has been an important
theme in modern physics. Nevertheless very little is known about the fate of
quantum criticality under non equilibrium conditions. In this paper we
investigate the effect of external noise sources on quantum critical points. It
is natural to expect that noise will have a similar effect to finite
temperature, destroying the subtle correlations underlying the quantum critical
behavior. Surprisingly we find that in many interesting situations the
ubiquitous 1/f noise preserves the critical correlations. The emergent states
show intriguing interplay of intrinsic quantum critical and external noise
driven fluctuations. We demonstrate this general phenomenon with specific
examples in solid state and ultracold atomic systems. Moreover our approach
shows that genuine quantum phase transitions can exist even under non
equilibrium conditions.
