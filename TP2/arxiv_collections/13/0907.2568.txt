Spatial characteristics of the optical-vortex (OV) beams created during the
Gaussian beam diffraction by a grating with groove bifurcation are analyzed
theoretically and numerically. In contrast to previous works, condition of
small-angle diffraction is no longer required and the diffracted beam can be
strongly deformed. This causes the intensity profile rotation and the
high-order OV decomposition into a set of secondary single-charged OVs. These
effects are studied quantitatively and confronted with similar properties of a
Laguerre-Gaussian beam that undergoes astigmatic telescopic transformation. In
contrast to the latter case, the secondary OVs do not lie on a single straight
line within the beam cross section, and morphology parameters of the individual
secondary OVs carried by the same beam are, in general, different. Conditions
for maximum relative separation of the secondary OVs with respect to the beam
transverse size are specified. The results can be used for practical generation
of OV beams and OV arrays with prescribed properties.
