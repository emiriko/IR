We study the possibility to test the Type I seesaw mechanism for neutrino
masses at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The inclusion of three generations of
right-handed neutrinos (N_i) provides an attractive option of gauging the B-L
accidental symmetry in the Standard Model (as well as an extended symmetry
X=Y-5(B-L)/4). The production mechanisms for the right-handed neutrinos through
the Z' gauge boson in the U(1)_{B-L} and U(1)_X extensions of the Standard
Model are studied. We discuss the flavor combinations of the charged leptons
from the decays of N_i in the Delta L=2 channels. We find that the clean
channels with dilepton plus jets and possible secondary vertices of the N decay
could provide conclusive signals at the LHC in connection with the hierarchical
pattern of the light neutrino masses and mixing properties within the Type I
seesaw mechanism.
