We investigate which non-Gaussian resources are needed, in addition to
Gaussian operations and measurements, for implementation of arbitrary quantum
gates on multimode quantum states of light. We show that an arbitrary set of
states with finite expansion in Fock basis is sufficient for this task. As an
illustration we present an explicit scheme for probabilistic implementation of
the nonlinear sign gate using resource non-Gaussian states and Gaussian
operations.
