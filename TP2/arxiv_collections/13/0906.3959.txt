Various aspects of the connection between cloud cover (CC) and cosmic rays
(CR) are analysed. We argue that the anticorrelation between the temporal
behaviour of low (LCC) and middle (MCC) clouds evidences against causal
connection between them and CR. Nevertheless, if a part of low clouds (LCC) is
connected and varies with CR, then its most likely value averaged over the
Globe should not exceed 20% at the two standard deviation level.
