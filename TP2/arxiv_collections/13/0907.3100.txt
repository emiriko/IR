We recently found that crystallization of monodisperse hard spheres from the
bulk fluid faces a much higher free energy barrier in four than in three
dimensions at equivalent supersaturation, due to the increased geometrical
frustration between the simplex-based fluid order and the crystal [J.A. van
Meel, D. Frenkel, and P. Charbonneau, Phys. Rev. E 79, 030201(R) (2009)]. Here,
we analyze the microscopic contributions to the fluid-crystal interfacial free
energy to understand how the barrier to crystallization changes with dimension.
We find the barrier to grow with dimension and we identify the role of
polydispersity in preventing crystal formation. The increased fluid stability
allows us to study the jamming behavior in four, five, and six dimensions and
compare our observations with two recent theories [C. Song, P. Wang, and H. A.
Makse, Nature 453, 629 (2008); G. Parisi and F. Zamponi, Rev. Mod. Phys, in
press (2009)].
