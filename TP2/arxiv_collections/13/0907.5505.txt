The mysterious solar system object 133P/(7968) Elst-Pizarro is dynamically
asteroidal, yet displays recurrent comet-like dust emission. Two scenarios were
hypothesized to explain this unusual behavior: (1) 133P is a classical comet
from the outer solar system that has evolved onto a main-belt orbit, or (2)
133P is a dynamically ordinary main-belt asteroid on which subsurface ice has
recently been exposed. If (1) is correct, the expected rarity of a dynamical
transition onto an asteroidal orbit implies that 133P could be alone in the
main belt. In contrast, if (2) is correct, other icy main-belt objects should
exist and could also exhibit cometary activity. Believing 133P to be a
dynamically ordinary, yet icy main-belt asteroid, I set out to test the primary
prediction of the hypothesis: that 133P-like objects should be common and could
be found by an appropriately designed observational survey. I conducted just
such a survey -- the Hawaii Trails Project -- of selected main-belt asteroids
in a search for objects displaying cometary activity. I made 657 observations
of 599 asteroids, discovering one active object now known as 176P/LINEAR,
leading to the identification of the new cometary class of main-belt comets.
These results suggest that there could be ~100 currently active main-belt
comets among low-inclination, kilometer-scale outer belt asteroids. Physically
and statistically, main-belt comet activity is consistent with initiation by
meter-sized impactors. The estimated rate of impacts and sizes of resulting
active sites, however, imply that 133P-sized bodies should become significantly
devolatilized over Gyr timescales, suggesting that 133P, and possibly the other
MBCs as well, could be secondary, or even multigenerational, fragments from
recent breakup events.
