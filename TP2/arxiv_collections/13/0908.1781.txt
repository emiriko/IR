We develop a gluing construction which adds scaled and truncated
asymptotically Euclidean solutions of the Einstein constraint equations to
compact solutions with potentially non-trivial cosmological constants. The
result is a one-parameter family of initial data which has ordinary and scaled
"point-particle" limits analogous to those of Gralla and Wald ("A rigorous
derivation of gravitational self-force," Class. Quantum Grav. 2008). In
particular, we produce examples of initial data which generalize Schwarzschild
- de Sitter initial data and gluing theorems of IMP-type.
