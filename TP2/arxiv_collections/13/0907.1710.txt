We study the energetics of Gutzwiller projected BCS states of various
symmetries for the triangular lattice antiferromagnet with a four particle ring
exchange using variational Monte Carlo methods. In a range of parameters the
energetically favored state is found to be a projected $d_{x^2-y^2}$ paired
state which breaks lattice rotational symmetry. We show that the properties of
this nematic or orientationally ordered paired spin liquid state as a function
of temperature and pressure can account for many of the experiments on organic
materials. We also study the ring-exchange model with ferromagnetic Heisenberg
exchange and find that amongst the studied ans\"atze, a projected $f-$wave
state is the most favorable.
