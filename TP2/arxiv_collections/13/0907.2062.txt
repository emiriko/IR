A brief survey of the theory of soliton perturbations is presented. The focus
is on the usefulness of the so-called Generalised Fourier Transform (GFT). This
is a method that involves expansions over the complete basis of `squared
olutions` of the spectral problem, associated to the soliton equation. The
Inverse Scattering Transform for the corresponding hierarchy of soliton
equations can be viewed as a GFT where the expansions of the solutions have
generalised Fourier coefficients given by the scattering data.
  The GFT provides a natural setting for the analysis of small perturbations to
an integrable equation: starting from a purely soliton solution one can
`modify` the soliton parameters such as to incorporate the changes caused by
the perturbation.
  As illustrative examples the perturbed equations of the KdV hierarchy, in
particular the Ostrovsky equation, followed by the perturbation theory for the
Camassa- Holm hierarchy are presented.
