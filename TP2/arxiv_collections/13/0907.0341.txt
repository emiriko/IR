We give a simple characterization of the totally wild ramified valuations in
a Galois extension of fields of characteristic p. This criterion involves the
valuations of Artin-Schreier cosets of the F_{p^r}^\times-translation of a
single element. We apply the criterion to construct some interesting examples.
