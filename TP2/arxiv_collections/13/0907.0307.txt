The PICASSO experiment at SNOLAB reports new results for spin-dependent WIMP
interactions on $^{19}$F using the superheated droplet technique. A new
generation of detectors and new features which enable background discrimination
via the rejection of non-particle induced events are described. First results
are presented for a subset of two detectors with target masses of $^{19}$F of
65 g and 69 g respectively and a total exposure of 13.75 $\pm$ 0.48 kgd. No
dark matter signal was found and for WIMP masses around 24 GeV/c$^2$ new limits
have been obtained on the spin-dependent cross section on $^{19}$F of
$\sigma_F$ = 13.9 pb (90% C.L.) which can be converted into cross section
limits on protons and neutrons of $\sigma_p$ = 0.16 pb and $\sigma_n$ = 2.60 pb
respectively (90% C.L). The obtained limits on protons restrict recent
interpretations of the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulations in terms of spin-dependent
interactions.
