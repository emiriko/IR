We show how time-dependent magnetic fields lead to spin motive forces and
spin drag in a spinor Bose gas. We propose to observe these effects in a
toroidal trap and analyze this particular proposal in some detail. In the
linear-response regime we define a transport coefficient that is analogous to
the usual drag resistivity in electron bilayer systems. Due to Bose enhancement
of atom-atom scattering, this coefficient strongly increases as temperature is
lowered. We also investigate the effects of heating.
