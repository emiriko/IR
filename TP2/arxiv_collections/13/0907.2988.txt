We present a simple formulation of non-linear supersymmetry where superfields
and partnerless fields can coexist. Using this formalism, we propose a
supersymmetric Standard Model without the Higgsino as an effective model for
the TeV-scale supersymmetry breaking scenario. We also consider an application
of the Hidden Local Symmetry in non-linear supersymmetry, where we can
naturally incorporate a spin-two resonance into the theory in a manifestly
supersymmetric way. Possible signatures at the LHC experiments are discussed.
