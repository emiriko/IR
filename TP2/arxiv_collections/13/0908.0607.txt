We report on the growth by evaporation under high vacuum of high-quality thin
films of Fe(phen)2(NCS)2 (phen=1,10-phenanthroline) that maintain the expected
electronic structure down to a thickness of 10 nm and that exhibit a
temperature-driven spin transition. We have investigated the current-voltage
characteristics of a device based on such films. From the space charge-limited
current regime, we deduce a mobility of 6.5x10-6 cm2/V?s that is similar to the
low-range mobility measured on the widely studied
tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium organic semiconductor. This work paves the
way for multifunctional molecular devices based on spin-crossover complexes.
