A focused crawler traverses the web selecting out relevant pages to a
predefined topic and neglecting those out of concern. While surfing the
internet it is difficult to deal with irrelevant pages and to predict which
links lead to quality pages. In this paper a technique of effective focused
crawling is implemented to improve the quality of web navigation. To check the
similarity of web pages w.r.t. topic keywords a similarity function is used and
the priorities of extracted out links are also calculated based on meta data
and resultant pages generated from focused crawler. The proposed work also uses
a method for traversing the irrelevant pages that met during crawling to
improve the coverage of a specific topic.
