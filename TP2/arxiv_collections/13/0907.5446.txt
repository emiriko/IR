Recently Hastings proved the existence of random unitary channels which
violate the additivity conjecture. In this paper we use Hastings' method to
derive new bounds for the entanglement of random subspaces of bipartite
systems. As an application we use these bounds to prove the existence of
non-unital channels which violate additivity of minimal output entropy.
