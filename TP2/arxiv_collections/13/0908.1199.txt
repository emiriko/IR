We study a one-dimensional model of microtubule assembly/disassembly in which
GTP bound to tubulins within the microtubule undergoes stochastic hydrolysis.
In contrast to models that only consider a cap of GTP-bound tubulin, stochastic
hydrolysis allows GTP-bound tubulin remnants to exist within the microtubule.
We find that these buried GTP remnants enable an alternative mechanism of
recovery from shrinkage, and enhances fluctuations of filament lengths. Under
conditions for which this alternative mechanism dominates, an increasing
depolymerization rate leads to a decrease in dissociation rate and thus a net
increase in assembly.
