We present an in-depth analysis on the strength of the almost 10,000
passwords from users of an instant messaging server in Italy. We estimate the
strength of those passwords, and compare the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
attack methods such as dictionaries and Markov chain-based techniques.
  We show that the strength of passwords chosen by users varies enormously, and
that the cost of attacks based on password strength grows very quickly when the
attacker wants to obtain a higher success percentage. In accordance with
existing studies we observe that, in the absence of measures for enforcing
password strength, weak passwords are common. On the other hand we discover
that there will always be a subset of users with extremely strong passwords
that are very unlikely to be broken.
  The results of our study will help in evaluating the security of
password-based authentication means, and they provide important insights for
inspiring new and better proactive password checkers and password recovery
tools.
