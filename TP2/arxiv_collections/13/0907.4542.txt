We present the STAR preliminary results on mid-rapidity and low transverse
momentum mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of net-charge and
net-proton distributions in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200
GeV for various collision centralities. All the measured high moments of these
distributions can be scaled by the number of participating nucleons, consistent
with the soft process emissions. The ratios of fourth to second order cumulants
of both the net-charge and net-proton distributions are consistent with models
without QCD critical point.
