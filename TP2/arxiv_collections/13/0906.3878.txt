When a colloidal sessile droplet dries on a substrate, the particles
suspended in it usually deposit in a ring-like pattern. This phenomenon is
commonly referred to as the "coffee-ring" effect. One paradigm for why this
occurs is as a consequence of the solutes being transported towards the pinned
contact line by the flow inside the drop, which is induced by surface
evaporation. From this perspective, the role of the liquid-gas interface in
shaping the deposition pattern is somewhat minimized. Here, we propose an
alternative mechanism for the coffee-ring deposition. It is based on the bulk
flow within the drop transporting particles to the interface where they are
captured by the receding free surface and subsequently transported along the
interface until they are deposited near the contact line. That the interface
captures the solutes as the evaporation proceeds is supported by a Lagrangian
tracing of particles advected by the flow field within the droplet. We model
the interfacial adsorption and transport of particles as a one-dimensional
advection-generation process in toroidal coordinates and show that the theory
reproduces ring-shaped depositions. Using this model, deposition patterns on
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are examined in which the evaporation
is modeled as being either diffusive or uniform over the surface.
