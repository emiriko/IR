This paper is dedicated to Oleg Viro on his 60-th birthday. The paper is
about Khovanov homology and its relationships with statistical mechanics models
such as the Ising model and the Potts model. We give a relatively
self-contained introduction to Khovanov homology, and also a reformulation of
the Potts model in terms of a bracket state sum expansion on a knot diagram
K(G) related to a planar graph G via the medial construction. We consider the
original Khovanov homology and also the homology defined by Stosic via the
dichromatic polynomial, and examine those values of the Potts model where the
partition function can be expressed in terms of homological Euler
characteristics. These points occur at imaginary temperature. The last part of
the paper reformulates, via a Wick rotation, the Potts model at imaginary
temperature as a quantum amplitude and uses the same formalism to give a new
quantum algorithm for the Jones polynomial for values of the variable that lie
on the unit circle in the complex plane.
