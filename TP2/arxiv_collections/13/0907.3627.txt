Events with at least two high transverse momentum leptons (electrons or
muons) are studied using the H1 and ZEUS detectors at HERA with an integrated
luminosity of 0.94 fb^{-1}. The observed numbers of events are in general
agreement with the Standard Model predictions. Seven di- and tri-lepton events
are observed in e^+p collision data with a scalar sum of the lepton transverse
momenta above 100 GeV while 1.94+-0.17 events are expected. Such events are not
observed in e^-p collisions for which 1.19+-0.12 are predicted. Total visible
and differential di-electron and di-muon photoproduction cross sections are
extracted in a restricted phase space dominated by photon-photon collisions.
