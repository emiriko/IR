The coupled nonlinear coordinate and spin dynamics of an electron in a double
quantum dot with spin-orbit interaction is studied semiclassically. The system
is driven by an electric field with the frequency matching the orbital or the
Zeeman resonance in magnetic field. Calculated evolution of the spin state is
crucially sensitive to the irregularities in the spatial motion and the
geometry of the host nanostructure. The resulting spin-flip Rabi frequency has
an unusual dependence on the field amplitude, demonstrating approach to the
chaotic spin motion. In turn, the orbital dynamics depends strongly on the spin
evolution due to the spin-dependent term in the electron velocity.
