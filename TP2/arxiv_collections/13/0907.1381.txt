The influence of spontaneous emission channel and generalized Pauli channel
on quantum Monty Hall Game is analysed. The scheme of Flittney and Abbott is
reformulated using the formalism of density matrices. Optimal classical
strategies for given quantum strategies are found. The whole presented scheme
illustrates how quantum noise may change the odds of a zero-sum game.
