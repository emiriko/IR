This paper presents a general framework how controlled natural languages can
be evaluated and compared on the basis of user experiments. The subjects are
asked to classify given statements (in the language to be tested) as either
true or false with respect to a certain situation that is shown in a graphical
notation called "ontographs". A first experiment has been conducted that
applies this framework to the language Attempto Controlled English (ACE).
