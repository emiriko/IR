We find that the confinement potential of a few electron quantum dot can be
tuned to significantly increase the overlap with certain quantum Hall trial
wave functions. Besides manipulating inter-electron interaction, this approach
may prove useful in quantum point contact experiments, which involve narrow
constrictions.
