Co-doped iron arsenic single crystal of BaFe1.87Co0.13As2 with dimension up
to 20 x 10 x 2 mm3 were grown by a nucleation pole: an alumina stick served as
nucleation center during growth. The high quality of crystalline was
illustrated by the measurements of neutron rocking curve and X-ray diffraction
pattern. A very sharp superconducting transition temperature Tc~25 K was
revealed by both resistivity and susceptibility measurements. A nearly 100%
shielding fraction and bulk nature of the superconductivity for the single
crystal were confirmed using magnetic susceptibility data.
