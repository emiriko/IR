We calculate numerically the emissivity and surface flux of electron-electron
bremsstrahlung radiation from the surface of a bare quark star. The restricted
electronic phase space due to the presence of an effective photon mass results
in a strong suppression. The emissivity and surface flux are found to be
substantially smaller than those found in previous work, to the point where
electron-positron pair production would remain the dominant mechanism at all
temperatures in the relativistic regime. As a consequence, pair production
remains a dominant process even at low surface temperatures as originally
suggested by Usov in arXiv:astro-ph/9712304.
