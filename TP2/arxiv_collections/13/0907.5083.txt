We consider parallel communicating pushdown automata systems (PCPA) and
define a property called known communication for it. We use this property to
prove that the power of a variant of PCPA, called returning centralized
parallel communicating pushdown automata (RCPCPA), is equivalent to that of
multi-head pushdown automata. The above result presents a new sub-class of
returning parallel communicating pushdown automata systems (RPCPA) called
simple-RPCPA and we show that it can be written as a finite intersection of
multi-head pushdown automata systems.
