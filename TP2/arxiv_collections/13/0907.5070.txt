We study the optical absorption spectra in a polar ferrimagnet GaFeO_3. We
consider the E1, E2 and M1 processes on Fe atoms. It is shown that the
magnetoelectric effect on the absorption spectra arises from the E1-M1
interference process through the hybridization between the 4p and 3d states in
the noncentrosymmetry environment of Fe atoms. We perform a microscopic
calculation of the spectra on a cluster model of FeO_6 consisting of an
octahedron of O atoms and an Fe atom displaced from the center with reasonable
values for Coulomb interaction and hybridization. We obtain the magnetoelectric
spectra, which depend on the direction of magnetization, as a function of
photon energy in the optical region 1.0-2.5 eV, in agreement with the
experiment.
