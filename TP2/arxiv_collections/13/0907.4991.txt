We present Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared transit photometry of the
nearby hot-Jupiter HD189733b. The observations were taken with the NICMOS
instrument during five transits, with three transits executed with a narrowband
filter at 1.87 microns and two performed with a narrowband filter at 1.66
microns. Our observing strategy using narrowband filters is insensitive to the
usual HST intra-orbit and orbit-to-orbit measurement of systematic errors,
allowing us to accurately and robustly measure the near-IR wavelength
dependance of the planetary radius. Our measurements fail to reproduce the
Swain et al. absorption signature of atmospheric water below 2 microns at a
5-sigma confidence level. We measure a planet-to-star radius contrast of
0.15498+/-0.00035 at 1.66 microns and a contrast of 0.15517+/-0.00019 at 1.87
microns. Both of our near-IR planetary radii values are in excellent agreement
with the levels expected from Rayleigh scattering by sub-micron haze particles,
observed at optical wavelengths, indicating that upper-atmospheric haze still
dominates the near-IR transmission spectra over the absorption from gaseous
molecular species at least below 2 microns.
