We discuss results for n-gluon correlations that form the basis of the Glasma
flux tube picture of early times in heavy ion collisions. Our formalism is
valid to all orders in perturbation theory at leading logarithmic accuracy in x
and includes both QCD bremsstrahlung and the many body screening and
recombination effects that are important at large parton densities. Long range
rapidity correlations, as seen in the near-side ridge in heavy ion collisions,
are a chronometer of these early time strong color field dynamics. They also
contain information on how radial flow develops in heavy ion collisions.
