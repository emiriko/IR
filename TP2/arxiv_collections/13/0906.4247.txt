In this paper we give sufficient conditions on a sequence of multipole
moments for a static spacetime to exist with precisely these moments. The proof
is constructive in the sense that a metric having prescribed multipole moments
up to a given order can be calculated. Since these sufficient conditions agree
with already known necessary conditions, this completes the proof of a long
standing conjecture due to Geroch.
