(Abridged) The observed radial velocity (RV) eccentricity distribution for
extrasolar planets in single-planet systems shows that a significant fraction
of planets are eccentric ($e > 0.1$). Here we investigate the effects on an RV
planet's eccentricity produced by undetected outer companions. We have carried
out Monte Carlo simulations of mock RV data to understand this effect and
predict its impact on the observed distribution. We first quantify the
statistical effect of undetected outer companions and show that this alone
cannot explain the observed distribution. We then modify the simulations to
consist of two populations, one of zero-eccentricity planets in double-planet
systems and the other of single planets drawn from an eccentric distribution.
Our simulations show that a good fit to the observed distribution is obtained
with 45% zero-eccentricity double-planets and 55% single eccentric planets.
Matching the observed distribution allows us to determine the probability that
a known RV planet's orbital eccentricity has been biased by an undetected
wide-separation companion. Our simulations show that moderately-eccentric
planets, with $0.1 < e < 0.3$ and $0.1 < e < 0.2$, have a $\sim 13%$ and $\sim
19%$ probability, respectively, of having an undetected outer companion. We
encourage both high-contrast direct imaging and RV follow-up surveys of known
RV planets with moderate eccentricities to test our predictions and look for
previously undetected outer companions.
