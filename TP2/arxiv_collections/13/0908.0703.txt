Despite the many implicit references to the social aspects of search within
Information Seeking and Retrieval research, there has been relatively little
work that has specifically investigated the additional requirements for
collaborative search software. In this paper we re-assess a recent evaluation
framework, designed for individual information seeking experiences, to see a)
how it could still be applied to collaborative search software; b) how it could
produce additional requirements for collaborative search; and c) how it could
be extended in future work to be even more appropriate for collaborative search
evaluation. The position held after the assessment is that it can be used to
evaluate collaborative search software, while providing new insights into their
requirements. Finally, future work will validate the frameworks applicability
to collaborative search and investigate roles within collaborative groups as a
means to extend the framework.
