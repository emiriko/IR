The multiplicity (N_ch) and pseudorapidity distribution (dN_ch/d\eta) of
primary charged particles in p+p collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
energies of \sqrt(s) = 10 and 14 TeV are obtained from extrapolation of
existing measurements at lower \sqrt(s). These distributions are then compared
to calculations from PYTHIA and PHOJET models. The existing \sqrt(s)
measurements are unable to distinguish between a logarithmic and power law
dependence of the average charged particle multiplicity (<N_ch>) on \sqrt(s),
and their extrapolation to energies accessible at LHC give very different
values. Assuming a reasonably good description of inclusive charged particle
multiplicity distributions by Negative Binomial Distributions (NBD) at lower
\sqrt(s) to hold for LHC energies, we observe that the logarithmic \sqrt(s)
dependence of <N_ch> are favored by the models at midrapidity. The dN_ch/d\eta
versus \eta for the existing measurements are found to be reasonably well
described by a function with three parameters which accounts for the basic
features of the distribution, height at midrapidity, central rapidity plateau
and the higher rapidity fall-off. Extrapolation of these parameters as a
function of \sqrt(s) is used to predict the pseudorapidity distributions of
charged particles at LHC energies. dN_ch/d\eta calculations from PYTHIA and
PHOJET models are found to be lower compared to those obtained from the
extrapolated dN_ch/d\eta versus \eta distributions for a broad \eta range.
