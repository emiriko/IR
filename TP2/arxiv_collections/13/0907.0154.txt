We show that much of the structure of the 2-sphere as a complex curve
survives the q-deformation and has natural generalizations to the quantum
2-sphere - which, with additional structures, we identify with the quantum
projective line. Notably among these is the identification of a quantum
homogeneous coordinate ring with the coordinate ring of the quantum plane. In
parallel with the fact that positive Hochschild cocycles on the algebra of
smooth functions on a compact oriented 2-dimensional manifold encode the
information for complex structures on the surface, we formulate a notion of
twisted positivity for twisted Hochschild and cyclic cocycles and exhibit an
explicit twisted positive Hochschild cocycle for the complex structure on the
sphere.
