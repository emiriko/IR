For a strictly stationary sequence of random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we
study convergence of partial sum processes to L\'evy stable process in the
Skorohod space with $J_1$-topology. We identify necessary and sufficient
conditions for such convergence and provide sufficient conditions when the
stationary sequence is strongly mixing.
