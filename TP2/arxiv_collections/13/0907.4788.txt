Measurements of inclusive hadron suppression and di-hadron azimuthal
correlations have provided important insights into jet quenching in hot QCD
matter. However, they do not provide access to the energy of the hard
scattering and are limited in their sensitivity since they can be affected by
biases toward hard fragmentation and small energy loss. Full jet reconstruction
in heavy-ion collisions enables a complete study of the modification of jet
structure due to energy loss, but is challenging due to the high-multiplicity
environment. We present measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets at
mid-rapidity in 200 GeV p+p and central Au+Au collisions performed with the
STAR detector. We compare fragmentation functions measured in 200 GeV p+p and
central Au+Au collisions and assess the systematic uncertainties of their
ratio.
