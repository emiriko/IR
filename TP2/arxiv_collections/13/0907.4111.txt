We present results for collisional energy loss and momentum broadening of
high momentum partons in a hot and dense non-Abelian plasma obtained by solving
the coupled system of Yang-Mills-Wong equations on a lattice in real time.
Including hard elastic collisions among the particles we obtain cutoff
independent results for the collisional energy loss dE/dx and the transport
coefficient q-hat. The latter is found to receive a sizable contribution from a
power-law tail in the transverse momentum distribution of high-momentum
partons. We further argue that the effect of instabilities on jet broadening
should be accessible by experiment when employing jet cones with elliptical
bases or studying correlations within the cone in full jet reconstruction
methods.
