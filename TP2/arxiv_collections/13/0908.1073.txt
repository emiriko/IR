Using numerical simulation based on a density-functional equation for a
trapped Fermi super-fluid valid along the BCS-unitarity crossover, we establish
robust scaling over many orders of magnitude in the observables of the system
as a function of fermion number. This scaling allows to predict the static
properties of the system, such as energy, chemical potential, etc., for a large
number of fermions, over the crossover, from the knowledge of those for a small
number ($\sim 4-10$) of fermions.
