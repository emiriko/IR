The path from understanding a simple reaction problem of scattering or
tunneling to contemplating the quantum nuclear many-body system, where
structure and continuum of reaction-states meet, overlap and coexist, is a
complex and nontrivial one. In this presentation we discuss some of the
intriguing aspects of this route.
