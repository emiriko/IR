Observations of gravitational waves from massive binary black hole systems at
cosmological distances can be used to search for a dependence of the speed of
propagation of the waves on wavelength, and thereby to bound the mass of a
hypothetical graviton. We study the effects of precessions of the spins of the
black holes and of the orbital angular momentum on the process of parameter
estimation using matched filtering of gravitational-wave signals vs.
theoretical template waveforms. For the proposed space interferometer LISA, we
show that precessions, and the accompanying modulations of the gravitational
waveforms, are effective in breaking degeneracies among the parameters being
estimated, and effectively restore the achievable graviton-mass bounds to
levels obtainable from binary inspirals without spin. For spinning, precessing
binary black hole systems of equal masses (10^6 solar masses) at 3 Gpc, the
bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength achievable are of the order of 5 X
10^{16} km.
