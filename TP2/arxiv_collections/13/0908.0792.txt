Herein I discuss and propose updated satellite composites of the total solar
irradiance covering the period 1978-2008. The composites are compiled from
measurements made with the three ACRIM experiments. Measurements from the
NIMBUS7/ERB and the ERBS/ERBE satellite experiments are used to fill the gap
from June 1989 to October 1991 between ACRIM1 and ACRIM2 experiments. The
climate implications of the alternative satellite composites are discussed by
using a phenomenological climate model for reconstructing the total solar
irradiance signature on climate during the last four centuries.
