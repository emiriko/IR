An iterative decoding algorithm for convolutional codes is presented. It
successively processes $N$ consecutive blocks of the received word in order to
decode the first block. A bound is presented showing which error configurations
can be corrected. The algorithm can be efficiently used on a particular class
of convolutional codes, known as doubly cyclic convolutional codes. Due to
their highly algebraic structure those codes are well suited for the algorithm
and the main step of the procedure can be carried out using Reed-Solomon
decoding. Examples illustrate the decoding and a comparison with existing
algorithms is being made.
