We present new low resolution Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample
of 20 ROSAT selected local Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). We detect
strong AGN continuum in all and clear PAH emission in 70% of the sources. The
6.2 micron PAH luminosity spans three orders of magnitudes, from ~10^(39) erg/s
to ~10^(42) erg/s providing strong evidence for intense ongoing star formation
in the circumnuclear regions of these sources. Using the IRS/Spitzer archive we
gather a large number of additional NLS1s and their broad line counterparts
(BLS1s) and constructed NLS1 and BLS1 sub-samples to compare them in various
ways. The comparison shows a clear separation according to FWHM(H_beta) such
that objects with narrower broad H_beta lines are the strongest PAH emitters.
We test this division in various ways trying to remove biases due to luminosity
and aperture size. Specifically, we find that star formation activity around
NLS1 AGN is larger than around BLS1 of the same AGN luminosity. The above
result seems to hold over the entire range of distance and luminosity. Moreover
the star formation rate is higher in low black hole mass and high L/L_Edd
systems indicating that black hole growth and star formation are occurring
simultaneously.
