We propose a simple model to describe the cavitation-induced breakage of
mesoscale filaments during their sonication in solution. The model predicts a
limiting length below which scission no longer occurs. This characteristic
length is a function of the tensile strength and diameter of the filament, as
well as the solvent viscosity and cavitation parameters. We show that the model
predicts accurately experimental results for materials ranging from carbon
nanotubes to protein fibrils, and discuss the use of sonication-induced
breakage as a probe for the strength of nanostructures.
