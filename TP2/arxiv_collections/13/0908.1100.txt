We perform numerical simulations of clouds in the Galactic Centre (GC)
engulfing the nuclear super-massive black hole and show that this mechanism
leads to the formation of gaseous accretion discs with properties that are
similar to the expected gaseous progenitor discs that fragmented into the
observed stellar disc in the GC. As soon as the cloud hits the black hole, gas
with opposite angular momentum relative to the black hole collides downstream.
This process leads to redistribution of angular momentum and dissipation of
kinetic energy, resulting in a compact gaseous accretion disc. A parameter
study using thirteen high resolution simulations of homogeneous clouds falling
onto the black hole and engulfing it in parts demonstrates that this mechanism
is able to produce gaseous accretion discs that could potentially be the
progenitor of the observed stellar disc in the GC. A comparison of simulations
with different equations of state (adiabatic, isothermal and full cooling)
demonstrates the importance of including a detailed thermodynamical
description. However the simple isothermal approach already yields good results
on the radial mass transfer and accretion rates, as well as disc eccentricities
and sizes. We find that the cloud impact parameter strongly influences the
accretion rate whereas the impact velocity has a small affect on the accretion
rate.
