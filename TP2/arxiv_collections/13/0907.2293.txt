We study the effect of decoherence on quantum Monty Hall problem under the
influence of amplitude damping, depolarizing and dephasing channels. It is
shown that under the effect of decoherence, there is a Nash equilibrium of the
game in case of depolarizing channel for Alice's quantum strategy. Where as in
case of dephasing noise, the game is not influenced by the quantum channel. For
amplitude damping channel, the Bob's payoffs are found symmetrical with maximum
at p=0.5 against his classical strategy. However, it is worth-mentioning that
in case of depolarizing channel, Bob's classical strategy remains always
dominant against any choice of Alice's strategy.
