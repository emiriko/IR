We investigate the impact of non-Gaussian scatter in the cluster
mass-observable scaling relation on the mass and redshift distribution of
clusters detected by wide area surveys. We parameterize non-Gaussian scatter by
incorporating the third and forth moments (skewness and kurtosis) into the
distribution P(Mobs|M). We demonstrate that for low scatter mass proxies the
higher order moments do not significantly affect the observed cluster mass and
redshift distributions. However, for high scatter mass indicators it is
necessary for the survey limiting mass threshold to be less than 10^14 h^-1
Msol to prevent the skewness from having a significant impact on the observed
number counts, particularly at high redshift. We also show that an unknown
level of non-Gaussianity in the scatter is equivalent to an additional
uncertainty on the variance in P(Mobs|M) and thus may limit the constraints
that can be placed on the dark energy equation of state parameter w.
Furthermore, positive skewness flattens the mass function at the high mass end,
and so one must also account for skewness in P(Mobs|M) when using the shape of
the mass function to constrain cluster scaling-relations.
