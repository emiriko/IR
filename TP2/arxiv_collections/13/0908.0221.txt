With application in the robotics and automation, more and more it becomes
necessary the development of applications based on methodologies that
facilitate future modifications, updates and enhancements in the original
projected system. This project presents a conception of mobile robots using
rapid prototyping, distributing the several control actions in growing levels
of complexity and computing proposal oriented to embed systems implementation.
This kind of controller can be tested on different platform representing the
mobile robots using reprogrammable logic components (FPGA). This mobile robot
will detect obstacle and also be able to control the speed. Different modules
will be Actuators, Sensors, wireless transmission. All this modules will be
interfaced using FPGA controller. I would like to construct a mechanically
simple robot model, which can measure the distance from obstacle with the aid
of sensor and accordingly should able to control the speed of motor. I would
