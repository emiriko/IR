We derive the complete form of the van der Waals dispersion interaction
between two infinitely long anisotropic semiconducting/insulating thin
cylinders at all separations. The derivation is based on the general theory of
dispersion interactions between anisotropic media as formulated in [J. N.
Munday, D. Iannuzzi, Yu. S. Barash and F. Capasso, {\sl Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 71},
042102 (2005)]. This formulation is then used to calculate the dispersion
interactions between a pair of single walled carbon nanotubes at all
separations and all angles. Non-retarded and retarded forms of the interactions
are developed separately. The possibility of repulsive dispersion interactions
and non-monotonic dispersion interactions is discussed within the framework of
the new formulation.
