Various aspects of the connection between cloud cover (CC) and cosmic rays
(CR) are analysed. Many features of this connection indicate that there is no
direct causal connection between low cloud cover (LCC) and CR in spite of the
evident long-term correlation between them. However, most of these features are
indirect. If only some part of the LCC is connected and varies with CR, then
its value, obtained from the joint analysis of their 11-year variations, and
averaged over the globe, should be most likely less than 20%.
  The most significant argument against a causal connection of CR and LCC is
the anticorrelation between LCC and the medium cloud cover (MCC). The scenario
of the parallel influence of the solar activity on the global temperature and
CC on one side and CR on the other, which can lead to the observed
correlations, is discussed and advocated.
