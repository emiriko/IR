We study the phase diagram of a frustrated spin-1/2 ferromagnetic chain with
anisotropic exchange interactions in an external magnetic field, using the
density matrix renormalization group method. We show that an easy-axis
anisotropy enhances the tendency towards multimagnon bound states, while an
easy-plane anisotropy favors chirally ordered phases. In particular, a moderate
easy-plane anisotropy gives rise to a quantum phase transition at intermediate
magnetization. We argue that this transition is related to the finite-field
phase transition experimentally observed in the spin-1/2 compound LiCuVO_4.
