For a few years now, cosmology has a standard model. By this term, we mean a
consistent theoretical background which is at the same time simple and broad
enough to offer coherent explanations for the vast majority of cosmological
phenomena. This review will briefly summarise the cosmological model, then
proceed to discuss what we know from observations about the evolution of the
Universe and its contents, and what we conclude about the origin and the future
of the Universe and the structures it contains.
