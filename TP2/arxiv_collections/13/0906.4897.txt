The moving light clock system was analyzed with respect to the orientation of
the wavefront of the light pulse observed in the moving and stationary frames
of reference. The plane wavefront of the light pulse was oriented horizontally
in both the frames. The wavefront observed in the stationary frame was not
perpendicular to the direction of the light pulse propagation. This showed
different characteristics of the light pulse than that assumed in the Lorentz
factor derivation. According to the horizontal orientation of the wavefront,
velocity c was determined as the vertical component of the light pulse motion
observed in the stationary frame. Application of this velocity distribution in
the Lorentz factor derivation showed the same travel time for the light pulse
observed in the moving and stationary frames of reference. The moving light
clock system was therefore found to be unsuitable for the Lorentz factor
derivation and illustration of time dilation, and shown to illustrate the
relativity of the observation of light rather than the relativity of time.
