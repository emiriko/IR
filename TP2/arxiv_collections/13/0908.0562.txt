Gravity modes in the Sun have been the object of a long and difficult search
in recent decades. Thanks to the data accumulated with the last generation of
instruments (BiSON, GONG and three helioseismic instruments aboard SoHO),
scientists have been able to find signatures of their presence. However, the
individual detection of such modes remains evasive. In this article, we study
the signal at 220.7 microHz which is a peak that is present in most of the
helioseismic data of the last 10 years. This signal has already been identified
as being one component of a g-mode candidate detected in the GOLF Doppler
velocity signal. The nature of this peak is studied in particular using the
VIRGO/SPM instrument aboard SoHO. First we analyse all the available
instrumental data of VIRGO and SoHO (housekeeping) to reject any possible
instrumental origin. No relation was found, implying that the signal has a
solar origin. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find, with more than 99%
confidence level, that the signal found in VIRGO/SPM is very unlikely to be due
to pure noise.
