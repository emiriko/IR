Spectra of phonons with out-of-plane polarization were studied experimentally
in a 2D plasma crystal. The dispersion relation was directly measured for the
first time using a novel method of particle imaging. The out-of-plane mode was
proven to have negative optical dispersion, comparison with theory showed good
agreement. The effect of the plasma wakes on the dispersion relation is briefly
discussed.
