We compare the observed symbiotic nebulae (SyN) luminosity function (SyNLF)
in the [O III] 5007A line to the planetary nebulae (PN) luminosity function
(PNLF) and find that the intrinsic SyNLF (ISyNLF) of galactic SyNs has - within
its uncertainty of 0.5-0.8mag - very similar cutoff luminosity and general
shape to those of the PNLF. The [O III]/(Halpha+[N II]) line ratios of SyNs and
PNs are shown to be also related. Possible implications of these results for
the universality of the PNLF are briefly outlined.
