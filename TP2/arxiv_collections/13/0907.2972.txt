We report on fundamental properties of superfluids with d-wave pairing
symmetry. We consider neutral atomic Fermi gases in a harmonic trap, the
pairing being produced by a Feshbach resonance via a d-wave interaction
channel. A Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional is constructed which is symmetry
constrained for five component order parameters (OP). We find OP textures in
the cyclic phase and stability conditions for a non-Abelian fractional
1/3-vortex under rotation. It is proposed how to create the intriguing
1/3-vortex experimentally in atomic gases via optical means.
