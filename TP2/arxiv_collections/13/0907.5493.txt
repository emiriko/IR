We report the synchronization behavior in a one-dimensional chain of
identical limit cycle oscillators coupled to a mass-spring load via a force
relation. We consider the effect of periodic parametric modulation on the final
synchronization states of the system. Two types of external parametric
excitations are investigated numerically: periodic modulation of the stiffness
of the inertial oscillator and periodic excitation of the frequency of the
self-oscillatory element. We show that the synchronization scenarios are ruled
not only by the choice of parameters of the excitation force but depend on the
initial collective state in the ensemble. We give detailed analysis of
entrainment behavior for initially homogeneous and inhomogeneous states. Among
other results, we describe a regime of partial synchronization. This regime is
characterized by the frequency of collective oscillation being entrained to the
stimulation frequency but different from the average individual oscillators
frequency.
