As semiconductor device dimensions are reduced to the nanometer scale,
effects of high defect density surfaces on the transport properties become
important to the extent that the metallic character that prevails in large and
highly doped structures is lost and the use of quantum dots for charge sensing
becomes complex. Here we have investigated the mechanism behind the detection
of electron motion inside an electrically isolated double quantum dot that is
capacitively coupled to a single electron transistor, both fabricated from
highly phosphorous doped silicon wafers. Despite, the absence of a direct
charge transfer between the detector and the double dot structure, an efficient
detection is obtained. In particular, unusually large Coulomb peak shifts in
gate voltage are observed. Results are explained in terms of charge
rearrangement and the presence of inelastic cotunneling via states at the
periphery of the single electron transistor dot.
