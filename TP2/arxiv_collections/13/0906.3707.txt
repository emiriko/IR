We study the thermal expansion of chains formed by self-assembly of magnetic
colloidal particles in a magnetic field. Using video-microscopy, complete
positional data of all the particles of the chains is obtained. By changing the
ionic strength of the solution and the applied magnetic field, the interaction
potential can be tuned. We analyze the thermal expansion of the chain using a
simple model of a one dimensional anharmonic crystal of finite size.
