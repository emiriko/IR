Cosmological and astrophysical measurements indicate that the universe
contains a large amount of dark matter. A number of weak scale dark matter
candidates have been proposed in extensions of the standard model. The
potential to discover the dark matter particle and determine its properties at
the upcoming LHC is summarized.
