Madam is a CMB map-making code, designed to make temperature and polarization
maps of time-ordered data of total power experiments like Planck. The algorithm
is based on the destriping technique, but it also makes use of known noise
properties in the form of a noise prior. The method in its early form was
presented in an earlier work by Keihanen et al. (2005). In this paper we
present an update of the method, extended to non-averaged data, and include
polarization. In this method the baseline length is a freely adjustable
parameter, and destriping can be performed at a different map resolution than
that of the final maps. We show results obtained with simulated data. This
study is related to Planck LFI activities.
