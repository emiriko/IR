We present a measurement of the W boson mass in W -> ev decays using 1 fb^-1
of data collected with the D0 detector during Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron
collider. With a sample of 499830 W -> ev candidate events, we measure M_W =
80.401 +- 0.043 GeV. This is the most precise measurement from a single
experiment.
