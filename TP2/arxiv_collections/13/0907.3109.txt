We present a type-III version of inverse seesaw or, equivalently an inverse
version of type-III seesaw. Naturally small neutrino masses arise at low-scale
from the exchange of neutral fermions transforming as hyperchargeless SU(2)
triplets. In order to implement tri-bimaximal lepton mixing we supplement the
minimal SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry with an A4-based flavor symmetry. Our
scenario induces lepton flavour violating (LFV) three body decays that can
proceed at the tree level, while radiative li to lj gamma decays and mu-e
conversion in nuclei are also expected to be sizeable. LFV decays are related
by the underlying flavor symmetry and the new fermions are also expected to be
accessible for study at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
