We present a global fit to single- and double-inclusive suppression data of
high-$p_T$ particles in central Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy. We also
include in this analysis data on heavy quarks via their D and B meson
semi-leptonic decays (i.e. non-photonic electrons). The analysis is based on
the parton quenching weights for medium-induced gluon radiation computed in the
BDMPS approximation then embedded in a hydrodynamical description of the bulk
medium. Our results indicate that values of the transport coefficient $\hat q$
more than four times larger than perturbative estimates are preferred by
experimental data. This confirms previous calculations based on simpler
implementations of the medium geometry or only the single-inclusive
suppression. We also comment on the statistical compatibility of the heavy
quark data within a radiative only energy loss scenario, and on the sensitivity
of the results to nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions
(PDFs) and to assumptions on the energy loss during times in the collision
prior to the hydrodynamical behavior.}
