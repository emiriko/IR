We use standard perturbation techniques originally formulated in quantum
(statistical) mechanics in the analysis of a toy model of a stock market which
is given in terms of bosonic operators. In particular we discuss the
probability of transition from a given value of the {\em portfolio} of a
certain trader to a different one. This computation can also be carried out
using some kind of {\em Feynman graphs} adapted to the present context.
