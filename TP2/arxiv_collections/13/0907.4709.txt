We explore general SUSY GUT models with exact third-generation Yukawa
unification, but where the requirement of universal soft terms at the GUT scale
is relaxed. We consider the scenario in which the breaking of universality
inherits from the Yukawa couplings, i.e. is of minimal flavor violating (MFV)
type. In particular, the MFV principle allows for a splitting between the
up-type and the down-type soft trilinear couplings.
  We explore the viability of this trilinear splitting scenario by means of a
fitting procedure to electroweak observables, quark masses as well as
flavor-changing neutral current processes. Phenomenological viability singles
out one main scenario. This scenario is characterized by a sizable splitting
between the trilinear soft terms and a large mu term. Remarkably, this scenario
does not invoke a partial decoupling of the sparticle spectrum, as in the case
of universal soft terms, but instead it requires part of the spectrum, notably
the lightest stop, the gluino and the lightest charginos and neutralinos to be
very close to the current experimental limits. The above mechanism is mostly
triggered by a non-trivial interplay between the requirements of negative,
sizable SUSY threshold corrections to mb and an instead negligible modification
of the B --> Xs gamma decay rate, in presence of various other constraints,
most notably a successful EWSB and a not too large BR(Bs --> mu^+ mu^-).
  We present a model-building interpretation of our discussed scenario and
emphasize the crucial role of SUSY spectrum determinations at the LHC for
either falsifying Yukawa unification or else providing important hints on the
mechanism of SUSY breaking at work.
