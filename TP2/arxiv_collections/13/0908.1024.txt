Recently, dispersionless (coherent) motion of (noninteracting) massive
Brownian particles, at intermediate time scales, was reported in a sinusoidal
potential with a constant tilt. The coherent motion persists for a finite
length of time before the motion becomes diffusive. We show that such coherent
motion can be obtained repeatedly by applying an external zero-mean square-wave
drive of appropriate period and amplitude, instead of a constant tilt. Thus,
the cumulative duration of coherent motion of particles is prolonged. Moreover,
by taking an appropriate combination of periods of the external field, one can
postpone the beginning of the coherent motion and can even have coherent motion
at a lower value of position dispersion than in the constant tilt case.
