The protostellar outflows have indispensable role in the formation of single
stars, because they carry off the excess angular momentum from the centre of
the shrinking gas cloud, and permits further collapse to form a star. On the
other hand, a significant fraction of stars is supposed to be born as binaries
with circumbinary disk that are frequently observed. Here, we investigate the
evolution of a magnetized rotating cloud using three-dimensional resistive MHD
nested-grid code, and show that the outflow is driven by the circumbinary disk
and has an important role even in the binary formation. After the adiabatic
core formation in the collapsing cloud core, the magnetic flux is significantly
removed from the centre of the cloud by the Ohmic dissipation. Since this
removal makes the magnetic braking ineffective, the adiabatic core continuously
acquires the angular momentum to induce fragmentation and subsequent binary
formation. The magnetic field accumulates in the circumbinary disk where the
removal and accretion of magnetic field are balanced, and finally drives
circumbinary outflow. This result explains the spectacular morphology of some
specific young stellar objects such as L1551 IRS5. We can infer that most of
the bipolar molecular outflows observed by low density tracers (i.e., CO) would
correspond to circumbinary or circum-multiple outflows found in this report,
since most of the young stellar objects are supposed to be binaries or
multiples.
