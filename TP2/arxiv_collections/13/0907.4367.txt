We discuss the quantum and classical dynamics of a particle with spin in the
gravitational field of a rotating source. A relativistic equation describing
the motion of classical spin in curved spacetimes is obtained. We demonstrate
that the precession of the classical spin is in a perfect agreement with the
motion of the quantum spin derived from the Foldy-Wouthuysen approach for the
Dirac particle in a curved spacetime. We show that the precession effect
depends crucially on the choice of a tetrad. The results obtained are compared
to the earlier computations for different tetrad gauges.
