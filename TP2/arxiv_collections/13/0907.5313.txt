It was shown in the early Seventies that, in Local Quantum Theory (that is
the most general formulation of Quantum Field Theory, if we leave out only the
unknown scenario of Quantum Gravity) the notion of Statistics can be grounded
solely on the local observable quantities (without assuming neither the
commutation relations nor even the existence of unobservable charged field
operators); one finds that only the well known (para)statistics of Bose/Fermi
type are allowed by the key principle of local commutativity of observables. In
this frame it was possible to formulate and prove the Spin and Statistics
Theorem purely on the basis of First Principles.
  In a subsequent stage it has been possible to prove the existence of a
unique, canonical algebra of local field operators obeying ordinary Bose/Fermi
commutation relations at spacelike separations. In this general guise the Spin
- Statistics Theorem applies to Theories (on the four dimensional Minkowski
space) where only massive particles with finite mass degeneracy can occur. Here
we describe the underlying simple basic ideas, and briefly mention the
subsequent generalisations; eventually we comment on the possible validity of
the Spin - Statistics Theorem in presence of massless particles, or of
violations of locality as expected in Quantum Gravity.
