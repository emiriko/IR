We consider the effect of the long range dipole-dipole interaction on the
excitation exchange dynamics of cold two-level atomic gase in the conditions
where the size of the atomic cloud is large as compared to the wavelength of
the dipole transition. We show that this interaction results in population
redistribution across the atomic cloud and in specific spectra of the
spontaneous photons emitted at different angles with respect to the direction
of atomic polarization.
