We study the reaction mechanism for the correlated $\pi^0\gamma$ emission in
the photon induced reaction on the proton target. Since this reaction is
studied in the GeV region, we assume that it proceeds through the formation of
the vector meson in the intermediate state. The vector meson, being an unstable
particle, decays into $\pi^0\gamma$ bosons after propagating certain distance.
Our analysis shows that the $\pi^0\gamma$ event seen in coincidence in the
final state dominantly arises due to the decay of $\omega$ meson. The
calculated results reproduce the measured $\pi^0\gamma$ invariant mass
distribution spectra very well.
