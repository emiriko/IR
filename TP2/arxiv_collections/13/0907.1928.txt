Supernovae have been confirmed to redshift z ~ 1.7 for type Ia (thermonuclear
detonation of a white dwarf) and to z ~ 0.7 for type II (collapse of the core
of the star). The subclass type IIn supernovae are luminous core-collapse
explosions of massive stars and, unlike other types, are very bright in the
ultraviolet, which should enable them to be found optically at redshifts z ~ 2
and higher. In addition, the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar
material creates strong, long-lived emission lines that allow spectroscopic
confirmation of many events of this type at z ~ 2 for 3 - 5 years after
explosion. Here we report three spectroscopically confirmed type IIn
supernovae, at redshifts z = 0.808, 2.013 and 2.357, detected in archival data
using a method designed to exploit these properties at z ~ 2. Type IIn
supernovae directly probe the formation of massive stars at high redshift. The
number found to date is consistent with the expectations of a locally measured
stellar initial mass function, but not with an evolving initial mass function
proposed to explain independent observations at low and high redshift.
