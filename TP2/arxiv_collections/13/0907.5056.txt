We show that the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectrum of $Z$ boson
production measured at Fermilab Tevatron can be well reproduced by
leading-order event generators if $Z$ + 1 jet processes are included with a
proper solution for the double-count problem and if the parton shower (PS)
branch kinematics are defined appropriately. The choice of the PS evolution
variable does not definitely determine the low-$p_{T}$ behavior. Our new event
generator employing the limited leading-log (LLL) subtraction and a built-in
leading-log PS reproduces the spectrum very well, not only in large $p_{T}$
regions but also at low $p_{T}$ down to $p_{T}$ = 0.
