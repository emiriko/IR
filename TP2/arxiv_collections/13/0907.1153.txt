An experiment using a prototype setup to search for the neutron electric
dipole moment by measuring spin-rotation in a non-centrosymmetric crystal
(quartz) was carried out to investigate statistical sensitivity and systematic
effects of the method. It has been demonstrated that the concept of the method
works. The preliminary result of the experiment is $d_{\rm n}=(2.5\pm 6.5)\cdot
10^{-24}$ e$\cdot $cm. The experiment showed that an accuracy of $\sim 2.5\cdot
10^{-26}$ e$\cdot $cm can be obtained in 100 days data taking, using available
quartz crystals and neutron beams.
