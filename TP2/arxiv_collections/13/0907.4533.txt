We report an overview of strangeness production in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions
at the energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 62.4 and 200 GeV. We show new mid-rapidly
$dN/dy$ results for the $K^{0}_{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ particles in
Cu+Cu \sNN{62} collisions and compare to results in Au+Au \sNN{62} collisions.
We show new results for mid-$p_T$ $\Lambda/K^{0}_{S}$ ratios in Cu+Cu \sNN{62}
collisions and again compare to ratios in Au+Au \sNN{62} collisions. Finally,
we show the high-$p_{T}$ ($\sim 6.2$ GeV/c) $R_{AA}(K^{0}_{S})$ as a function
of system size in Au+Au \sNN{200} collisions and compare to $R_{AA}(\pi)$.
