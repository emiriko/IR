The method of current extraction under linear increasing voltages (CELIV)
allows for the simultaneous determination of charge mobilities and charge
densities directly in thin films as used in organic photovoltaic cells (OPV).
In the past, it has been specifically applied to investigate the interrelation
of microstructure and charge transport properties in such systems. Numerical
and analytical calculations presented in this work show that the evaluation of
CELIV transients with the commonly used analysis scheme is error prone once
charge recombination and, possibly, field dependent charge mobilities are taken
into account. The most important effects are an apparent time-dependence of
charge mobilities and errors in the determined field dependencies. Our results
implicate that reports on time-dependent mobility relaxation in OPV materials
obtained by the CELIV technique should be carefully revisited and confirmed by
other measurement methods.
