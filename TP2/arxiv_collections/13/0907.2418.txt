We study flexible polymer macromolecules in a crowded (porous) environment,
modelling them as self-attracting self-avoiding walks (SASAW) on site-diluted
percolative lattices in space dimensions d=2, 3. The influence of stretching
force on the polymer folding and properties of globule-coil transitions are
analyzed. Applying the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth chain-growth method (PERM),
we estimate the transition temperature T_{\Theta} between collapsed and
extended polymer configurations and construct the phase diagrams of the
globule-coil coexistence when varying temperature and stretching force. The
transition to a completely stretched state, caused by applying force, is
discussed as well.
