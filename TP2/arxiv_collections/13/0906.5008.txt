A sum rule for determining |V_us| from a combination of hadronic tau decay
and electroproduction data is discussed. Indications of problems with
analogous, purely tau-decay-based analyses, most likely associated with slow
convergence of the relevant D=2 OPE series, are outlined, and advantages of the
mixed sum rule approach identified. With current data, one obtains |V_us|=
0.2208 (39)_exp (3)_th, a determination amenable to significant near-term
reduction in experimental error, and with the smallest theoretical error of all
current |V_us| determinations.
