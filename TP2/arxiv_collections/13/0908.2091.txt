We have been evaluated some observables of n-d systems by using pionless
Effective Field Theory(\EFTNoPion) and insertion of the three-body force up to
next-to-next to leading order(N$^2$LO). The evaluated data has been compared
with experimental and the three-nucleon calculation of the total cross section
with modern realistic two- and three-nucleon forces AV18/UrbIX potential models
calculations.
