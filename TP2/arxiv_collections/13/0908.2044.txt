We prove that a 3--dimensional hyperbolic cusp with convex polyhedral
boundary is uniquely determined by its Gauss image. Furthermore, any spherical
metric on the torus with cone singularities of negative curvature and all
closed contractible geodesics of length greater than $2\pi$ is the metric of
the Gauss image of some convex polyhedral cusp. This result is an analog of the
Rivin-Hodgson theorem characterizing compact convex hyperbolic polyhedra in
terms of their Gauss images.
  The proof uses a variational method. Namely, a cusp with a given Gauss image
is identified with a critical point of a functional on the space of cusps with
cone-type singularities along a family of half-lines. The functional is shown
to be concave and to attain maximum at an interior point of its domain. As a
byproduct, we prove rigidity statements with respect to the Gauss image for
cusps with or without cone-type singularities.
  In a special case, our theorem is equivalent to existence of a circle pattern
on the torus, with prescribed combinatorics and intersection angles. This is
the genus one case of a theorem by Thurston. In fact, our theorem extends
Thurston's theorem in the same way as Rivin-Hodgson's theorem extends Andreev's
theorem on compact convex polyhedra with non-obtuse dihedral angles.
  The functional used in the proof is the sum of a volume term and curvature
term. We show that, in the situation of Thurston's theorem, it is the potential
for the combinatorial Ricci flow considered by Chow and Luo.
  Our theorem represents the last special case of a general statement about
isometric immersions of compact surfaces.
