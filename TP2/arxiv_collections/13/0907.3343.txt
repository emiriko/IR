We construct quantum circuits for solving one-dimensional Schr\"odinger
equations. Simulations of three typical examples, i.e., harmonic oscillator,
square-well and Coulomb potential, show that reasonable results can be obtained
with eight qubits. Our simulations show that simple quantum circuits can solve
the standard quantum mechanical problems.
