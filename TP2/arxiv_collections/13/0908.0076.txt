Rapid and innovative improvement in wireless communication technologies has
led to an increase in the demand for mobile internet transactions. However,
internet access from mobile devices is very expensive due to limited bandwidth
available on wireless links and high mobility rate of mobile hosts. When a user
executes a transaction with a web portal from a mobile device, the
disconnection necessitates failure of the transaction or redoing all the steps
after reconnection, to get back into consistent application state. Thus
considering challenges in wireless mobile networks, a new log management scheme
is proposed for recovery of mobile transactions.
  In this proposed approach, the model parameters that affect application state
recovery are analyzed. The proposed scheme is compared with the existing Lazy
and Pessimistic scheme and a trade off analysis between the cost invested to
manage log and the return of investment in terms of improved failure
recoverability is made. From the analysis, the best checkpoint interval period
that yields the best return of investment is identified.
