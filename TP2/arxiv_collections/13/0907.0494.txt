The chiral magnetic effect is the generation of electric current of quarks
along external magnetic field in the background of topologically nontrivial
gluon fields. There is a recent evidence that this effect is observed by the
STAR Collaboration in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. In our paper we study
qualitative signatures of the chiral magnetic effect using quenched lattice
simulations. We find indications that the electric current is indeed enhanced
in the direction of the magnetic field both in equilibrium configurations of
the quantum gluon fields and in a smooth gluon background with nonzero
topological charge. In the confinement phase the magnetic field enhances the
local fluctuations of both the electric charge and chiral charge densities. In
the deconfinement phase the effects of the magnetic field become smaller,
possibly due to thermal screening. Using a simple model of a fireball we obtain
a good agreement between our data and experimental results of the STAR
Collaboration.
