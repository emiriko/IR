The inclusion of rotationally-induced mixing in stellar evolution can alter
the structure and composition of presupernova stars. We survey the effects of
progenitor rotation on nucleosynthetic yields in Population III and II
supernovae using the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code CASTRO. We examine
spherical explosions in 15, 25 and 40 solar mass stars at Z = 0 and 10^-4 solar
metallicity with three explosion energies and two rotation rates. Rotation in
the Z = 0 models resulted in primary nitrogen production and a stronger
hydrogen burning shell which led all models to die as red supergiants. On the
other hand, the Z=10^-4 solar metallicity models that included rotation ended
their lives as compact blue stars. Because of their extended structure, the
hydrodynamics favors more mixing and less fallback in the metal free stars than
the Z = 10^-4 models. As expected, higher energy explosions produce more
enrichment and less fallback than do lower energy explosions, and less massive
stars produce more enrichment and leave behind smaller remnants than do more
massive stars. We compare our nucleosynthetic yields to the chemical abundances
in the three most iron-poor stars yet found and reproduce the abundance pattern
of one, HE 0557-4840, with a zero metallicity 15 solar mass, 2.4 x 10^51 erg
supernova. A Salpeter IMF averaged integration of our yields for Z=0 models
with explosion energies of 2.4x10^51 ergs or less is in good agreement with the
abundances observed in larger samples of extremely metal-poor stars, provided
15 solar mass stars are included. Since the abundance patterns of extremely
metal-poor stars likely arise from a representative sample of progenitors, our
yields suggest that low-mass supernovae contributed the bulk of the metals to
the early universe.
