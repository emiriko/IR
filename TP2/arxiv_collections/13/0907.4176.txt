This paper presents several experimental findings related to the basic
discrete Hilbert transform. The errors in the use of a finite set of the
transform values have been tabulated for the more commonly used functions. The
error can be quite small and, for example, it is of the order of 10^{-17} for
the chirp signal. The use of the discrete Hilbert transform in hiding
information is presented.
