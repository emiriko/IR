We have presented an analytic theory for the Casimir force on a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) which is confined between two parallel plates. We have
considered Dirichlet boundary conditions for the condensate wave function as
well as for the phonon field. We have shown that, the condensate wave function
(which obeys the Gross-Pitaevskii equation) is responsible for the mean field
part of Casimir force, which usually dominates over the quantum (fluctuations)
part of the Casimir force.
