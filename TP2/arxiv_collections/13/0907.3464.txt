The current paradigm for the AGN phenomenon is a central engine that consists
of an inflow of material accreting in the form of a disk onto a supermassive
black hole. Observations in the UV and optical find high velocity ionized
material outflowing from the black hole. We present results from Suzaku and
XMM-Newton observations of a sample of intrinsic NAL quasars with high velocity
outflows. Our derived values of the intrinsic column densities of the X-ray
absorbers are consistent with an outflow scenario in which NAL quasars are
viewed at smaller inclination angles than BAL quasars. We find that the
distributions of alpha_ox and Dalpha_ox of the NAL quasars of our sample differ
significantly from those of BAL quasars and SDSS radio-quiet quasars. The NAL
quasars are not significantly absorbed in the X-ray band and the positive
values of Dalpha_ox suggest absorption in the UV band. The positive values of
Dalpha_ox of the intrinsic NAL quasars can be explained in a geometric scenario
where our lines of sight towards the compact X-ray hot coronae of NAL quasars
do not traverse the absorbing wind whereas lines of sight towards their UV
emitting accretion disks do intercept the outflowing absorbers.
