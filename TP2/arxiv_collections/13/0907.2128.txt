Silane (SiH4) is found to (partially) decompose at pressures above 50 GPa at
room temperature into pure Si and H2. The released hydrogen reacts with
surrounding metals in the diamond anvil cell to form metal hydrides. A
formation of rhenium hydride is observed after the decomposition of silane.
  From the data of a previous experimental report (Eremets et al., Science 319,
1506 (2008)), the claimed high-pressure metallic and superconducting phase of
silane is identified as platinum hydride, that forms after the decomposition of
silane. These observations show the importance of taking into account possible
chemical reactions that are often neglected in high-pressure experiments.
