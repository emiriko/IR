We present high resolution spectroscopy in the [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda$5007 and
H$\alpha$ lines of bright planetary nebulae in the Milky Way bulge and the
dwarf galaxies M32, Fornax, Sagittarius, and NGC 6822 obtained at the
Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in the Sierra San Pedro Martir using the
Manchester Echelle Spectrograph. We use the high signal-to-noise (S/N)
observations of Milky Way bulge planetary nebulae to explore what kinematic
information can be determined reliably when observing extragalactic planetary
nebulae in the [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda$5007 line at modest S/N. We find that the
intrinsic line widths measured in [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda$5007 and H$\alpha$ are
very similar. Over the range of S/N available in this sample, the line width we
measure is independent of the S/N. Finally, deviations from a Gaussian line
shape are small. Thus, the line width of the [\ion{O}{3}]$\lambda$5007 line in
bright extragalactic planetary nebulae should reflect the kinematics of most of
the mass in the ionized nebular shell.
