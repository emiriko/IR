Despite its probable occurrence in Nature, the accretion-induced collapse
(AIC) of a white dwarf has not yet been directly observed (or, at least, it has
not been unambiguously identified as such). In this contribution we summarize
the observational signatures of AIC, emphasizing its possible role as both an
optical and high-energy transient.
