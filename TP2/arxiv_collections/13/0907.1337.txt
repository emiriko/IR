A general theoretical framework for decoherence is proposed, which
encompasses formalisms originally devised to deal just with open or with closed
systems. The conditions for decoherence are clearly stated and the relaxation
and decoherence times are compared. Finally, the spin-bath model is developed
in detail from the new perspective.
