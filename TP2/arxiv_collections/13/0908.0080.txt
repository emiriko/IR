- In this paper a session based symmetric key encryption system has been
proposed and is termed as Permutated Cipher Technique (PCT). This technique is
more fast, suitable and secure for larger files. In this technique the input
file is broken down into blocks of various sizes (of 2 power n order) and
encrypted by shifting the position of each bit by a certain value for a certain
number of times. A key is generated randomly wherein the length of each block
is determined. Each block length generates a unique value of number of bits to
be skipped. This value determines the new position of the bits within the block
that are to be shifted. After the shifting and inverting each block is XORed
with SHA 512 digest of the key. The resultant blocks from the cipher text. The
key is generated according to the binary value of the input file size.
Decryption is done following the same process as the technique is symmetric.
