We consider limits of equilibrium distributions as temperature approaches
zero, for systems of infinitely many particles, and characterize the support of
the limiting distributions. Such results are known for particles with positions
on a fixed lattice; we extend these results to systems of particles on R^n,
with restrictions on the interaction.
