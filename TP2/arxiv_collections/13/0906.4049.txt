The discovery of neutrino masses implies the existence of new particles, the
sterile neutrinos. These particles can have important implications for
cosmology and astrophysics. A sterile neutrino with mass of a few keV can
account for the dark matter of the universe. Its relic abundance can be
produced via different mechanisms. A minimal extension of the Higgs sector of
the Standard Model, with a gauge-singlet boson coupled to sterile neutrinos,
can provide a consistent framework for the theory of neutrino masses, and can
produce relic keV sterile neutrinos via decays of the singlet Higgs. This
mechanism operates around the electroweak scale, and has interesting
consequences for the electroweak phase transition. The resulting dark matter is
"colder" than the one produced via oscillations. This property changes the
small-scale structure formation limits. Heavier sterile neutrinos can be
produced in supernova cores and affect the thermal evolution of the star. Being
short-lived, they decay inside the envelope and facilitate the energy transport
from the core to the vicinity of the supernova shock. This enhances the
probability for a successful explosion.
