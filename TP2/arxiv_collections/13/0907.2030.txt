We argue that topological meron excitations, which are in a strong coupling
phase (bound in pairs) in infinite quantum Hall ferromagnets, become deconfined
in finite size quantum Hall systems. Although effectively for larger systems
meron energy grows with the size of the system, when gyromagnetic ratio is
small meron becomes the lowest lying state of a quantum Hall droplet. This
comes as a consequence of the many-body correlations built in the meron
construction that minimize the interaction energy. We demonstrate this by using
mean field ansatzes for meron wave function. The ansatzes will enable us to
consider much larger system sizes than in the previous work [A. Petkovic and
M.V. Milovanovic, PRL 98, 066808 (2007)], where fractionalization into merons
was introduced.
