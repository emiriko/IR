We propose a simple phenomenological model predicting, through Lorentz
symmetry breaking, a CPT-violating asymmetry between particle and antiparticle
states in neutrino oscillations involving sterile neutrinos. Such a model is
able to explain the apparently observed anomalous excess of low-energy
\nu_e-like events, reported by the MiniBooNE collaboration, as well as the
non-observation of the corresponding anomalous excess of \ov{\nu}_e-like
events. The present model leads to very specific physical predictions in the
neutrino oscillations scenario, and account for the observed anomalies in terms
of only one CPT-Lorentz violation parameter of the order of the
Grand-Unification energy scale.
