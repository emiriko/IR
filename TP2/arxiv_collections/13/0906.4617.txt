In this paper, the notion of universal enveloping algebra introduced in [A.
Ardizzoni, \emph{A First Sight Towards Primitively Generated Connected Braided
Bialgebras}, submitted. (arXiv:0805.3391v3)] is specialized to the case of
braided vector spaces whose Nichols algebra is quadratic as an algebra. In this
setting a classification of universal enveloping algebras for braided vector
spaces of dimension not greater than 2 is handled. As an application, we
investigate the structure of primitively generated connected braided bialgebras
whose braided vector space of primitive elements forms a Nichols algebra which
is quadratic algebra.
