We carried out a NIR variable star survey toward the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds using the InfraRed Survey Facility (IRSF) at Sutherland,
South African Astronomical Observatory. This survey project was initiated in
Dember 2000, and since then, we kept monitoring a total area of 3 square
degrees along the LMC bar and also an area of 1 square degree around the center
of the SMC, sufficiently large to do statistical analysis and to make complete
catalog of variable red giants in the Magellanic Clouds. The detection limits
(S/N=10) of the survey are 17.0, 16.5 and 15.5 at J, H and Ks, respectively. In
this article, we present some results on infrared variables that are not
detected by the previous optical surveys. We show that they do not fall on the
standard period-Ks magnitude relation for Mira-type variables pulsating in the
fundamental mode.
