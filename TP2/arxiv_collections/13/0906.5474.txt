The effect of doping on the electronic structure at the Mn sites in the
La_{1-x}Sr_{1+x}MnO_4 series (x=0, 0.3 and 0.5) was studied by means of
non-resonant hard X- ray emission spectroscopy (XES). We observe a linear
dichroism in the Mn K-beta main lines (3p to 1s transitions) that is strongest
for x=0 and decreases with increasing x to 0.5. The Mn K-beta main lines in the
poly-crystalline samples change considerably less upon increasing the hole
doping (substitution of La by Sr) than it would be expected based on the change
of formal valence. From this we conclude that the charge and spin density at
the Mn sites are only little affected by doping. This implies that holes
injected in the La_{1-x}Sr_{1+x}MnO_4 series mainly result in a decrease of
charge density on the oxygen atoms, i.e. oxygen takes part in the charge
balancing. These findings are supported by many-body cluster calculations.
