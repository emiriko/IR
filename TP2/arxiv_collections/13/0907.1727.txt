Conventional kinesin is a homodimeric motor protein that unidirectionally
transports organelles along filamentous microtubule (MT) by hydrolyzing ATP
molecules. This study shows that the load modulations of ATP turnover and head
diffusion are both essential in determining the performance of the dimer under
loads. It is found that the consecutive run length of the dimer critically
depends upon a few pathways, leading to the detachment of individual heads from
MT. Modifying rates for these detachment pathways changes the run length but
not the velocity of the dimer, consistent with mutant experiments. The run
length may increase with or without the ATP concentration, depending upon a
single rate for pure mechanical detachment. This finding provides an
explanation to a previous controversy concerning ATP dependence of the run
length, and related quantitative predictions of this study can be tested by a
future experiment. This study also finds that the experimental observations for
assisting loads can be quantitatively explained by load-biased head diffusion.
We thus conclude that the dimer motility under resisting as well as assisting
loads is governed by essentially the same mechanisms.
