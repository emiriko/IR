We provide geometrical interpretation of the Master Theorem to solve
divide-and-conquer recurrences. We show how different cases of the recurrences
correspond to different kinds of fractal images. Fractal dimension and
Hausdorff measure are shown to be closely related to the solution of such
recurrences.
