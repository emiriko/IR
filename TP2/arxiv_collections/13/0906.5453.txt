In this work we review the status of tree-level vacuum stability in general
two-Higgs doublet models. We also discuss the problem of Normal minima in some
classes of potentials. In some of these potentials, Normal minima can coexist
leading to potentially dangerous physic scenarios as, for instance, a two step
spontaneous symmetry breaking.
