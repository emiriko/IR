In 1952 Bohm presented a theory about non-relativistic point-particles moving
along deterministic trajectories and showed how it reproduces the predictions
of standard quantum theory. This theory was actually presented before by de
Broglie in 1926, but Bohm's particular formulation of the theory inspired
Epstein to come up with a different trajectory model. The aim of this paper is
to examine the empirical predictions of this model. It is found that the
trajectories in this model are in general very different from those in the de
Broglie-Bohm theory. In certain cases they even seem bizarre and rather
unphysical. Nevertheless, it is argued that the model seems to reproduce the
predictions of standard quantum theory (just as the de Broglie-Bohm theory).
