We analyze analytically and numerically the origin of the singularity in the
course of the collapse of a wormhole with the exotic scalar field Psi with
negative energy density, and with this field Psi together with the ordered
magnetic field H. We do this under the simplifying assumptions of the spherical
symmetry and that in the vicinity of the singularity the solution of the
Einstein equations depends only on one coordinate (the homogeneous
approximation). In the framework of these assumptions we found the principal
difference between the case of the collapse of the ordinary scalar field Phi
with the positive energy density together with an ordered magnetic field H and
the collapse of the exotic scalar field Psi together with the magnetic field H.
The later case is important for the possible astrophysical manifestation of the
wormholes.
