The locally rotationally symmetric tilted perfect fluid Bianchi type V
cosmological model provides examples of future geodesically complete spacetimes
that admit a `kinematic singularity' at which the fluid congruence is
inextendible but all frame components of the Weyl and Ricci tensors remain
bounded. We show that for any positive integer n there are examples of Bianchi
type V spacetimes admitting a kinematic singularity such that the covariant
derivatives of the Weyl and Ricci tensors up to the n-th order also stay
bounded. We briefly discuss singularities in classical spacetimes.
