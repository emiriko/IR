Via molecular dynamics simulations, we unveil the hysteretic nature of the
jamming transition of soft repulsive frictionless spheres, as it occurs varying
the volume fraction or the shear stress. In a given range of control parameters
the system may be found both in a flowing and in an jammed state, depending on
the preparation protocol. The hysteresis is due to an underlying energy
landscape with many minima, as explained by a simple model, and disappears in
the presence of strong viscous forces and in the small $\sigma$ limit. In this
limit, structural quantities are continuous at the transition, while the
asymptotic values of two time quantities such as the self-intermediate
scattering function are discontinuous, giving to the jamming transition a mixed
first-order second-order character close to that found at the glass transition
of thermal systems.
