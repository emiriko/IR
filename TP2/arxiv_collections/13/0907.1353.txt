A review is given on phase-sensitive measurements, such as homodyne
detection, for radiation fields and material systems. Methods of quantum-state
reconstruction are considered for radiation fields, including multimode and
pulsed radiation. For matter systems, methods are reported for the
reconstruction of quantum states of molecular vibrations, the quantized motion
of trapped atoms, Bose-Einstein condensates, atomic matter waves, electron
motion, spin and angular momentum systems, and crystal lattices.
