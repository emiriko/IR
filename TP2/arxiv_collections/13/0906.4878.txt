The experimental survey of the water drops to different concentrations from
non ionic surfactant (C11E5) and set down anionic (SDS) on glass horizontal
surfaces has been made. The 1st step consisted in measuring the tension of
surface, the 2nd allowed us to determine the influence of these surfactants on
the physical parameters of wetting (contact angle ...).The numeric simulation
of the equation of profile of the drop allowed us to validate the empirical
results found.
