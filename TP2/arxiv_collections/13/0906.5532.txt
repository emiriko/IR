Though the entanglement-assisted formalism provides a universal connection
between a classical linear code and an entanglement-assisted quantum
error-correcting code (EAQECC), the issue of maintaining large amount of pure
maximally entangled states in constructing EAQECCs is a practical obstacle to
its use. It is also conjectured that the power of entanglement-assisted
formalism to convert those good classical codes comes from massive consumption
of maximally entangled states. We show that the above conjecture is wrong by
providing families of EAQECCs with an entanglement consumption rate that
diminishes linearly as a function of the code length. Notably, two families of
EAQECCs constructed in the paper require only one copy of maximally entangled
state no matter how large the code length is. These families of EAQECCs that
are constructed from classical finite geometric LDPC codes perform very well
according to our numerical simulations. Our work indicates that EAQECCs are not
only theoretically interesting, but also physically implementable. Finally,
these high performance entanglement-assisted LDPC codes with low entanglement
consumption rates allow one to construct high-performance standard QECCs with
very similar parameters.
