Electron interactions in undoped bilayer graphene lead to instability of the
gapless state, `which-layer' symmetry breaking, and energy gap opening at the
Dirac point. In contrast to single layer graphene, the bilayer system exhibits
instability even for arbitrarily weak interaction. A controlled theory of this
instability for realistic dynamically screened Coulomb interactions is
developed, with full acount of dynamically generated ultraviolet cutoff. This
leads to an energy gap that scales as a power law of the interaction strength,
making the excitonic instability readily observable.
