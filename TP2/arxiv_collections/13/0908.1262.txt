Using the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, we will develop a method for solving a
class of problems in which we need to determine parts of an array and then
apply a specified function to each independent part. Since present quantum
computers are not robust enough for code writing and execution, we will build a
model of a vector quantum computer that implements the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
from a machine language view using the APL2 programming language. The core of
the method is an operator (DJBOX) which allows evaluation of an arbitrary
function f by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Two key functions of the method are
GET_PARTITION and CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS. The GET_PARTITION function determines
parts of an array based on the function f. The CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS function
determines parts of an array based on the function f and then applies another
function to each independent part. We will imagine the method is implemented on
the above vector quantum computer. We will show that the method can be
successfully executed.
