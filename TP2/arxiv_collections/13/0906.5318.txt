We investigate the global nonaxisymmetric Rossby vortex instability in a
differentially rotating, compressible magnetized accretion disk with radial
density structures. Equilibrium magnetic fields are assumed to have only the
toroidal component. Using linear theory analysis, we show that the density
structure can be unstable to nonaxisymmetric modes. We find that, for the
magnetic field profiles we have studied, magnetic fields always provide a
stabilizing effect to the unstable Rossby vortex instability modes. We discuss
the physical mechanism of this stabilizing effect. The threshold and properties
of the unstable modes are also discussed in detail. In addition, we present
linear stability results for the global magnetorotational instability when the
disk is compressible.
