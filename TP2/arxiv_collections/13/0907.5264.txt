Building on a previous derivation of the local chiral projector for a two
dimensional superspace with eight real supercharges, we provide the complete
density projection formula required for locally supersymmetrical theories in
this context. The derivation of this result is shown to be very efficient using
techniques based on the Ectoplasmic construction of local measures in
superspace.
