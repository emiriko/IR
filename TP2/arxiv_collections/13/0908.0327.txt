A detailed analysis of the data from a high sampling rate, multi-month
reverberation mapping campaign, undertaken primarily at MDM Observatory with
supporting observations from telescopes around the world, reveals that the
Hbeta emission region within the broad line regions (BLRs) of several nearby
AGNs exhibit a variety of kinematic behaviors. While the primary goal of this
campaign was to obtain either new or improved Hbeta reverberation lag
measurements for several relatively low luminosity AGNs (presented in a
separate work), we were also able to unambiguously reconstruct
velocity-resolved reverberation signals from a subset of our targets. Through
high cadence spectroscopic monitoring of the optical continuum and broad Hbeta
emission line variations observed in the nuclear regions of NGC 3227, NGC 3516,
and NGC 5548, we clearly see evidence for outflowing, infalling, and virialized
BLR gas motions, respectively.
