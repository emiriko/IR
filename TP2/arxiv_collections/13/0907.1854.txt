As in the case of the hydrogen atom, bound-state wave functions are needed to
generate hadronic spectra. For this purpose, in 1971, Feynman and his students
wrote down a Lorentz-invariant harmonic oscillator equation. This differential
equation has one set of solutions satisfying the Lorentz-covariant boundary
condition. This covariant set generates Lorentz-invariant mass spectra with
their degeneracies. Furthermore, the Lorentz-covariant wave functions allow us
to calculate the valence parton distribution by Lorentz-boosting the
quark-model wave function from the hadronic rest frame. However, this boosted
wave function does not give an accurate parton distribution. The wave function
needs QCD corrections to make a contact with the real world. Likewise QCD needs
the wave function as a starting point for calculating the parton structure
function.
