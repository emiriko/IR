We prove that a plane domain which is almost isoperimetric (with respect to
the $L^1$ metric) is close to a square whose sides are parallel to the
coordinates axis. Closeness is measured either by $L^\infty$ Haussdorf distance
or Fraenkel asymmetry. In the first case, we determine the extremal domains.
