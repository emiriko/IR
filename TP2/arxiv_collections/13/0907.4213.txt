There has been disagreement currently about whether cooling in protoplanetary
disks can be sufficiently fast to induce the formation of gas giant
protoplanets via gravitational instabilities. Simulations by our own group and
others indicate that this method of planet formation does not work for disks
around young, low- mass stars inside several tens of AU, while simulations by
other groups show fragmentation into protoplanetary clumps in this region. To
allow direct comparison in hopes of isolating the cause of the differences, we
here present a high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulation of a
protoplanetary disk, where the disk model, initial perturbation, and simulation
conditions are essentially identical to those used in a set of simulations by
Boss. As in earlier papers by the same author, Boss (2007, hereafter B07)
purports to show that cooling is fast enough to produce protoplanetary clumps.
Here, we evolve the same B07 disk using an improved version of one of our own
radiative schemes and find that the disk does not fragment in our code but
instead quickly settles into a state with only low amplitude nonaxisymmetric
structure, which persists for at least several outer disk rotations. We see no
rapid radiative or convective cooling. We conclude that the differences in
results are due to different treatments of regions at and above the disk
photosphere, and we explain at least one way in which the scheme in B07 may
lead to artificially fast cooling.
