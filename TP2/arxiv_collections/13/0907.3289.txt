In the last months several ballon and satellite experiments improved
significantly our knowledge of cosmic rays (CR) spectra at high energy. In
particular CREAM allowed to measure B/C, C/O and N/O up to 1 TeV and PAMELA the
anti-p/p ratio up to 100 GeV with unprecedented accuracy. These measurements
offer a valuable probe of CR propagation properties. We performed a statistical
analysis to test the compatibility of these results, as well as other most
significant experimental data, with the predictions of a new numerical CR
diffusion package (DRAGON). We found that above 1 GeV all data are consistent
with a diffusion scenario in a well defined range of values of the diffusion
coefficient energy power index and normalization.
