Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Torigoe et al. Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 251101 (2009)], gravitational wave forms for a three-body
system in Lagrange's orbit are considered especially in an analytic method.
First, we derive an expression of the three-body wave forms at the mass
quadrupole, octupole and current quadrupole orders. By using the expressions,
we solve a gravitational-wave {\it inverse} problem of determining the source
parameters to this particular configuration (three masses, a distance of the
source to an observer, and the orbital inclination angle to the line of sight)
through observations of the gravitational wave forms alone. For this purpose,
the chirp mass to a three-body system in the particular configuration is
expressed in terms of only the mass ratios by deleting initial angle positions.
We discuss also whether and how a binary source can be distinguished from a
three-body system in Lagrange's orbit or others.
