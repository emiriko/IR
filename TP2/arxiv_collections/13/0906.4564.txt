Structural evolution of a prospective hydrogen storage material, ammonia
borane NH3BH3, has been studied at high pressures up to 12 GPa and at low
temperatures by synchrotron powder diffraction. At 293 K and above 1.1 GPa a
disordered I4mm structure reversibly transforms into a new ordered phase. Its
Cmc21 structure was solved from the diffraction data, the positions of N and B
atoms and the orientation of NH3 and BH3 groups were finally assigned with the
help of density functional theory calculations. Group-theoretical analysis
identifies a single two-component order parameter, combining ordering and
atomic displacement mechanisms, which link an orientationally disordered parent
phase I4mm with ordered distorted Cmc21, Pmn21 and P21 structures. We propose a
generic phase diagram for NH3BH3, mapping three experimentally found and one
predicted (P21) phases as a function of temperature and pressure, along with
the evolution of the corresponding structural distortions. Ammonia borane
belongs to the class of improper ferroelastics and we show that both
temperature- and pressure-induced phase transitions can be driven to be of the
second order. The role of N-H...H-B dihydrogen bonds and other intermolecular
interactions in the stability of NH3BH3 polymorphs is examined.
