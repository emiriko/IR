The bound-free electron-positron pair production is considered for
relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, cross sections are calculated
for the pair production with the simultaneous capture of the electron into the
1s ground state of one of the ions and for energies that are relevant for the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Colliders (LHC). In
the framework of perturbation theory, we applied Monte-Carlo integration
techniques to compute the lowest-order Feynman diagrams amplitudes by using
Darwin wave functions for the bound states of the elec- trons and
Sommerfeld-Maue wave functions for the continuum states of the positrons.
Calculations were performed especially for the collision of Au + Au at 100
GeV/nucleon and Pb + Pb at 3400 GeV/nucleon.
