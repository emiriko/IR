Fusion frame theory is an emerging mathematical theory that provides a
natural framework for performing hierarchical data processing. A fusion frame
is a frame-like collection of subspaces in a Hilbert space, thereby
generalizing the concept of a frame for signal representation. In this paper,
we study the existence and construction of fusion frames. We first present a
complete characterization of a special class of fusion frames, called Parseval
fusion frames. The value of Parseval fusion frames is that the inverse fusion
frame operator is equal to the identity and therefore signal reconstruction can
be performed with minimal complexity. We then introduce two general methods --
the spatial complement and the Naimark complement -- for constructing a new
fusion frame from a given fusion frame. We then establish existence conditions
for fusion frames with desired properties. In particular, we address the
following question: Given $M, N, m \in \NN$ and $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$, does
there exist a fusion frame in $\RR^M$ with $N$ subspaces of dimension $m$ for
which $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$ are the eigenvalues of the associated fusion
frame operator? We address this problem by providing an algorithm which
computes such a fusion frame for almost any collection of parameters $M, N, m
\in \NN$ and $\{\lambda_j\}_{j=1}^M$. Moreover, we show how this procedure can
be applied, if subspaces are to be added to a given fusion frame to force it to
become Parseval.
