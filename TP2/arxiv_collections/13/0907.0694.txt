We present a numerical method for calculation of Ruelle-Pollicott resonances
of dynamical systems. It constructs an effective coarse-grained propagator by
considering the correlations of multiple observables over multiple timesteps.
The method is compared to the usual approaches on the example of the perturbed
cat map and is shown to be numerically efficient and robust.
