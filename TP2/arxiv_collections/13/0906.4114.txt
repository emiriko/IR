Motivated by the recent challenging results from TeV astronomy, the VHE INAF
community asked a group of them to write this White Paper to summarize the
status and future of Cherenkov telescopes for gamma-ray astronomy and the INAF
perspectives in this field. This document wants to review both the scientific
topics and potential developments of the field as well as to point out both the
interests and the capacities (scientific and technical) of the VHE astrophysics
community in INAF. It is aimed at identifying the scientific and technological
areas where INAF should focus its efforts and resources so that Italian
researchers can achieve (or maintain) a leading position in this field.
