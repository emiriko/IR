We report on the design and results of the GammeV search for axion-like
particles and for chameleon particles. We also discuss plans for an improved
experiment to search for chameleon particles, one which is sensitive to both
cosmological and power-law chameleon models. Plans for an improved axion-like
particle search using coupled resonant cavities are also presented. This
experiment will be more sensitive to axion-like particles than stellar
astrophysical models or current helioscope experiments.
