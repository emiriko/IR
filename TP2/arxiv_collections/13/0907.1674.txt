An intense circularely polarised photon beam interacts with a cooled
antiproton beam in a storage ring. Due to spin dependent absorption cross
sections for the reaction gamma+antiproton > pi- + antineutron a built-up of
polarisation of the stored antiprotons takes place. Figures-of-merit around 0.1
can be reached in principle over a wide range of antiproton energies. In this
process antineutrons with Polarisation > 70% emerge. The method is presented
for the case of 300 MeV/c cooled antiproton beam.
