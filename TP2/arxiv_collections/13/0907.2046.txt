Traditionally, the single-band approximation for interacting many-body
systems is done with pre-determined single-particle Wannier functions, ignoring
the dependence of the Wannier function on interaction. We show that the
single-band approximation has to be done self-consistently to properly account
the interaction effect on the Wannier functions. This self-consistent
single-band approximation leads to a nonlinear equation for Wannier functions,
which can be recast into a set of nonlinear equations for Bloch functions.
These equations are simplified for two special cases, the superfluid regime and
deep in the Mott insulator regime. A simple example with double-well potential
is used to illustrate our results.
