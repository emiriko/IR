We analyze deficiencies of commonly used Coulomb approximations in
Generalized Born solvation energy calculation models and report a development
of a new fast surface-based method (FSBE) for numerical calculations of the
solvation energy of biomolecules with charged groups. The procedure is only a
few percents wrong for molecular configurations of arbitrary sizes, provides
explicit values for the reaction field potential at any point of the molecular
interior, water polarization at the surface of the molecule, both the solvation
energy value and its derivatives suitable for Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations. The method works well both for large and small molecules and thus
gives stable energy differences for quantities such as solvation energies
contributions to a molecular complex formation.
