The influence of the induced potential on photoelectron emission from metal
surfaces is studied for grazing incidence of ultrashort laser pulses. To
describe this process we introduce a distorted wave method, the Surface Jellium
Volkov approach, which includes the perturbation on the emitted electron
produced by both the laser and the induced fields. The method is applied to an
Al(111) surfaces, contrasting the results with the numerical solutions to the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE). We found that SJV approach
reproduces well the main features of emission spectra, accounting properly for
effects originated by the induced potential.
