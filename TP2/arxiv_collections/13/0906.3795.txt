In this work, we study persistent current in a mesoscopic cylinder subjected
to both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fluxes. A simple tight-binding
model is used to describe the system, where all the calculations are performed
exactly within the non-interacting electron picture. The current $I$ is
investigated numerically concerning its dependence on total number of electrons
$N_e$, system size $N$, longitudinal magnetic flux $\phi_l$ and transverse
magnetic flux $\phi_t$. Quite interestingly we observe that typical current
amplitude oscillates as a function of the transverse magnetic flux, associated
with the energy-flux characteristics, showing $N \phi_0$ flux-quantum
periodicity, where $N$ and $\phi_0$ $(=ch/e)$ correspond to the system size and
the elementary flux-quantum respectively. This analysis may provide a new
aspect of persistent current for multi-channel cylindrical systems in the
presence of radial magnetic field $B_r$, associated with the flux $\phi_t$.
