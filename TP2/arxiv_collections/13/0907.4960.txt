Ezhil is a Tamil language based interpreted procedural programming language.
Tamil keywords and grammar are chosen to make the native Tamil speaker write
programs in the Ezhil system. Ezhil allows easy representation of computer
program closer to the Tamil language logical constructs equivalent to the
conditional, branch and loop statements in modern English based programming
languages. Ezhil is a compact programming language aimed towards Tamil speaking
novice computer users. Grammar for Ezhil and a few example programs are
reported here, from the initial proof-of-concept implementation using the
Python programming language1. To the best of our knowledge, Ezhil language is
the first freely available Tamil programming language.
