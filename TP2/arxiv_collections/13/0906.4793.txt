We study exchange coupling in Si double quantum dots, which have been
proposed as suitable candidates for spin qubits due to their long spin
coherence times. We discuss in detail two alternative schemes which have been
proposed for implementing spin qubits in quantum dots. One scheme uses spin
states in a single dot and the interdot exchange coupling controls interactions
between unbiased dots. The other scheme employs the singlet and triplet states
of a biased double dot as the two-level system making up the qubit and exchange
controls the energy splitting of the levels. Exchange in these two
configurations depends differently on system parameters. Our work relies on the
Heitler-London approximation and the Hund-Mulliken molecular orbital method.
The results we obtain enable us to investigate the sensitivity of the system to
background charge fluctuations and determine the conditions under which optimal
spots, at which the influence of the charge noise is minimized, may exist in Si
double quantum dot structures.
