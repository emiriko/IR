If Micro Black Holes (MBHs) can be produced at the LHC, they will decay very
fast. We study hypothetical MBHs that do not decay; in particular, QCD effects
on accretion by MBHs that are produced at rest. We explain why accretion of a
nucleon by such MBHs is associated with pion emission. This pion emission
results in a kick to the MBHs, such that their velocities are large enough to
escape the Earth. Our study provides an extra assurance that MBHs which might
be produced at the LHC are not dangerous.
