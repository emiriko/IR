In this paper we study a model of cosmic evolution, assuming that the
different components of the universe could interact between them any time. An
effective equation of state (EOS) for the universe has been used as well. A
particular function for w, which gives a good agreement between our results and
the experimental data, has been studied. Finally, the model obtained has been
applied to different important cases.
