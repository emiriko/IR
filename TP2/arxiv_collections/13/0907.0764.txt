The X-ray emission from most accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in symbiotic binary
stars is quite soft. Several symbiotic WDs, however, produce strong X-ray
emission at energies greater than ~20 keV. The Swift BAT instrument has
detected hard X-ray emission from 4 such accreting WDs in symbiotic stars: RT
Cru, T CrB, CD -57 3057, and CH Cyg. In one case (RT Cru), Swift detected
X-rays out to greater than 50 keV at a > 5 sigma confidence level. Combining
data from the XRT and BAT detectors, we find that the 0.3-150 keV spectra of RT
Cru, T CrB, and CD -57 3057 are well described by emission from a
single-temperature, optically thin thermal plasma, plus an unresolved 6.4-6.9
keV Fe line complex. The X-ray spectrum of CH Cyg contains an additional bright
soft component. For all 4 systems, the spectra suffer high levels of absorption
from material that both fully and partially covers the source of hard X-rays.
The XRT data did not show any of the rapid, periodic variations that one would
expect if the X-ray emission were due to accretion onto a rotating, highly
magnetized WD. The X-rays were thus more likely from the accretion-disk
boundary layer around a massive, non-magnetic WD in each binary. The X-ray
emission from RT Cru varied on timescales of a few days. This variability is
consistent with being due to changes in the absorber that partially covers the
source, suggesting localized absorption from a clumpy medium moving into the
line of sight. The X-ray emission from CD -57 3057 and T CrB also varied during
the 9 months of Swift observations, in a manner that was also consistent with
variable absorption.
