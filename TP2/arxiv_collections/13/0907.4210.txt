Magnetic resonance coupling between connected split ring resonators (SRRs)
and magnetic plasmon (MP) excitations in the connected SRR chains were
theoretically studied. By changing the connection configuration, two different
coupling behaviors were observed, and therefore two kinds of MP bands were
formed in the connected ring chains, accordingly. These MPs were revealed with
positive and negative dispersion for the homo- and anti-connected chain,
respectively. Notably, these two MP modes both have wide bandwidth due to the
conductive coupling. Moreover, the anti-connected chain is found supporting a
novel negative propagating wave with a wide band starting from zero frequency,
which is a fancy phenomenon in one-dimensional system.
