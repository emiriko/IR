We present an R-parity conserving model of sneutrino dark matter within a
Higgs-philic U(1)' extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. In
this theory, the mu parameter and light Dirac neutrino masses are generated
naturally upon the breaking of the U(1)' gauge symmetry. The leptonic and
hadronic decays of sneutrinos in this model, taken to be the lightest and
next-to-lightest superpartners, allow for a natural fit to the recent results
reported by the PAMELA experiment.
