Single-file diffusion of propane and toluene molecules inside a narrow,
effectively one-dimensional zeolite pore was experimentally studied by
Czaplewski {\sl et al.} Using a stochastic lattice gas approach, we obtain an
analytical description of this process for the case of single-component
loading. We show that a good quantitative agreement with the experimental data
for the desorption temperature of the hydrocarbon molecules can be obtained if
the desorption process from the boundary is associated with a higher activation
energy than the diffusion process in the bulk. We also present Dynamical Monte
Carlo simulation results for two-component loading which demonstrate in
agreement with the experimental findings the effects of mutual blockage of the
molecules due to single-file diffusion.
