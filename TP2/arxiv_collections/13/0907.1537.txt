The spectral energy distribution (SED) of TeV blazars has a double-humped
shape that is usually interpreted as Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) model. The
one zone SSC model is used broadly but cannot fit the high energy tail of SED
very well. It need bulk Lorentz factor which is conflict with the observation.
Furthermore one zone SSC model can not explain the entire spectrum. In the
paper, we propose a new model that the high energy emission is produced by the
accelerated protons in the blob with a small size and high magnetic field, the
low energy radiation comes from the electrons in the expanded blob. Because the
high and low energy photons are not produced at the same time, the requirement
of large Doppler factor from pair production is relaxed. We present the fitting
results of the SEDs for Mkn 501 during April 1997 and Mkn 421 during March 2001
respectively.
