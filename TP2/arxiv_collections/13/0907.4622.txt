Aneka is a platform for deploying Clouds developing applications on top of
it. It provides a runtime environment and a set of APIs that allow developers
to build .NET applications that leverage their computation on either public or
private clouds. One of the key features of Aneka is the ability of supporting
multiple programming models that are ways of expressing the execution logic of
applications by using specific abstractions. This is accomplished by creating a
customizable and extensible service oriented runtime environment represented by
a collection of software containers connected together. By leveraging on these
architecture advanced services including resource reservation, persistence,
storage management, security, and performance monitoring have been implemented.
On top of this infrastructure different programming models can be plugged to
provide support for different scenarios as demonstrated by the engineering,
life science, and industry applications.
