Spin chains have been proposed as quantum wires for information transfer in
solid state quantum architectures. We show that huge gains in both transfer
speed and fidelity are possible using a minimalist control approach that relies
only a single, local, on-off switch actuator. Effective switching time
sequences can be determined using optimization techniques for both ideal and
disordered chains. Simulations suggest that effective optimization is possible
even in the absence of accurate models.
