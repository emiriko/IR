The symmetry factor of Feynman diagrams for real and complex scalar fields is
presented. Being analysis of Wick expansion for Green functions, the mentioned
factor is derived in a general form. The symmetry factor can be separated into
two ones corresponding to that of connected and vacuum diagrams. The
determination of symmetry factors for the vacuum diagrams is necessary as they
play a role in the effective action and phase transitions in cosmology. In the
complex scalar theory the diagrams different in topology may give the same
contribution, hence inverse of the symmetry factor (1/S) for total contribution
is a summation of each similar ones (1/S_i), i.e., 1/S = \sum_i (1/S_i).
