The present paper is aimed at studying the microscopic origin of the jump
diffusion. Starting from the $N$-body Liouville equation and making only the
assumption that molecular reorientation is overdamped, we derive and solve the
new (hereafter generalized diffusion) equation. This is the most general
equation which governs orientational relaxation of an equilibrium molecular
ensemble in the hindered rotation limit and in the long time limit. The
generalized diffusion equation is an extension of the small-angle diffusion
equation beyond the impact approximation. We establish the conditions under
which the generalized diffusion equation can be identified with the jump
diffusion equation, and also discuss the similarities and differences between
the two approaches.
