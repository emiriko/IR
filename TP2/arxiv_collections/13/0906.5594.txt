We use the cannonball model of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and public data from
the first day of observations of GRB 090618 to predict its X-ray and optical
lightcurves until very late times, and, in particular, the emergence of a
photometric and spectroscopic signature of an SN akin to SN1998bw in its
optical afterglow with an anticipated peak brightness of magnitude 23 in the R
band around July 10, 2009, if extinction in the host galaxy can be neglected.
