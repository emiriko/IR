We discuss the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two
colors and two flavors of light quarks. This is motivated by the increasing
interest in the QCD phase diagram as follows: (1) The QCD critical point search
has been under intensive dispute and its location and existence suffer from
uncertainty of effective U(1)_A symmetry restoration. (2) A new phase called
quarkyonic matter is drawing theoretical and experimental attention but it is
not clear whether it can coexist with diquark condensation. We point out that
two-color QCD is nontrivial enough to contain essential ingredients for (1) and
(2) both, and most importantly, is a system without the sign problem in
numerical simulations on the lattice. We adopt the two-flavor
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model extended with the two-color Polyakov loop and make
quantitative predictions which can be tested by lattice simulations.
