We introduce a two-body quantum Hamiltonian model with spins-$\half$ located
on the vertices of a 2D spatial lattice. The model exhibits an exact
topological degeneracy in all coupling regimes. This is a remarkable
non-perturbative effect. The model has a $\Z_2\times \Z_2$ gauge group symmetry
and string-net integrals of motion. There exists a gapped phase in which the
low-energy sector reproduces an effective topological color code model. High
energy excitations fall into three families of anyonic fermions that turn out
to be strongly interacting. All these, and more, are new features not present
in honeycomb lattice models like Kitaev model.
