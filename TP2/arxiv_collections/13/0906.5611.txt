We investigate the statistical properties of the complexness parameter which
characterizes uniquely complexness (biorthogonality) of resonance eigenstates
of open chaotic systems. Specifying to the regime of isolated resonances, we
apply the random matrix theory to the effective Hamiltonian formalism and
derive analytically the probability distribution of the complexness parameter
for two statistical ensembles describing the systems invariant under time
reversal. For those with rigid spectra, we consider a Hamiltonian characterized
by a picket-fence spectrum without spectral fluctuations. Then, in the more
realistic case of a Hamiltonian described by the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble,
we reveal and discuss the r\^ole of spectral fluctuations.
