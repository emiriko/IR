We present here three different approaches to the problem of modeling
mathematically the concept of a non-deterministic mechanism. Each of these
three approaches leads to a mathematical definition. We then show that all the
three mathematical concepts are equivalent to one another. This insight gives
us the option of approaching the wp-formalism of Dijkstra from a different
viewpoint that is easier to understand and to teach.
