We extend the asymptotic boundary layer (ABL) method, originally developed
for stable resonator modes, to the description of individual wavefunctions
localized around unstable periodic orbits. The formalism applies to the
description of scar states in fully or partially chaotic quantum systems, and
also allows for the presence of smooth and sharp potentials, as well as
magnetic fields. We argue that the separatrix wave function provides the
largest contribution to the scars on a single wave function. This agrees with
earlier results on the wave-function asymptotics and on the quantization
condition of the scar states. Predictions of the ABL formalism are compared
with the exact numerical solution for a strip resonator with a parabolic
confinement potential and a magnetic field.
