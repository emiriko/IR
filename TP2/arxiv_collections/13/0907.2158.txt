A semi-discrete Lax pair formed from the differential system and recurrence
relation for semi-classical orthogonal polynomials, leads to a discrete
integrable equation for a specific semi-classical orthogonal polynomial weight.
The main example we use is a semi-classical Laguerre weight to derive a third
order difference equation with a corresponding Lax pair.
