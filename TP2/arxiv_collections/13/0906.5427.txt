We review quantum Monte Carlo results on energetic and structure properties
of quantum fluids adsorbed in a bundle of carbon nanotubes. Using realistic
interatomic interactions the different adsorption sites that a bundle offer are
accurately studied and compared in some cases with strictly one-dimensional
geometries. The study is performed quite extensively for $^4$He and restricted
to the inner part of a single nanotube for H$_2$ and D$_2$. From a theoretical
point of view, nanotubes open the real possibility of a quasi-one-dimensional
confinement where to study quantum fluids in extremely reduced dimensionality.
The results obtained show that in the narrowest configurations the system is
nearly one-dimensional reinforcing the interest on the physics of
one-dimensional quantum fluids. Experimental confirmation of the theoretical
results obtained is still not in a satisfactory situation due to the
difficulties on extracting from the data the dominant adsorption sites.
