The concept of the Majorana fermion has been postulated more than eighty
years ago; however, this elusive particle has never been observed in nature.
The non-local character of the Majorana fermion can be useful for topological
quantum computation. Recently, it has been shown that the 3He-B phase is a
time-reversal invariant topological superfluid, with a single component of
gapless Majorana fermion state localized on the surface. Such a Majorana
surface state contains half the degrees of freedom of the single Dirac surface
state recently observed in topological insulators. We show here that the
Majorana surface state can be detected through an electron spin relaxation
experiment. The Majorana nature of the surface state can be revealed though the
striking angular dependence of the relaxation time on the magnetic field
direction, $1/T_1 \propto sin^2 \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the
magnetic field and the surface normal. The temperature dependence of the spin
relaxation rate can reveal the gapless linear dispersion of the Majorana
surface state. We propose a spin relaxation experiment setup where we inject an
electron inside a nano-sized bubble below the helium liquid surface.
