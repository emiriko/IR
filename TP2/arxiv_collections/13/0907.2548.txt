Results of a numerically exact transfer matrix calculation for the model of
Interacting Self-Avoiding Trails are presented. The results lead to the
conclusion that, at the collapse transition, Self-Avoiding Trails are in the
same universality class as the O(n=0) model of Blote and Nienhuis (or
vertex-interacting self-avoiding walk), which has thermal exponent $\nu=12/23$,
contrary to previous conjectures.
