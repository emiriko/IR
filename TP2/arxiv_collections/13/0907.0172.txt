We establish the volume conjecture for (m,2)-cables of the figure 8 knot,
when m is odd. For (m,2)-cables of general knots where m is even, we show that
the limit in the volume conjecture depends on the parity of the color (of the
Kashaev invariant). There are many cases when the volume conjecture for cables
of the figure 8 knot is false if one considers all the colors, but holds true
if one restricts the colors to a subset of the set of positive integers.
