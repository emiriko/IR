We review the noncommutative gravity of Wess et al. and discuss its physical
applications. We define noncommutative symmetry reduction and construct
deformed symmetric solutions of the noncommutative Einstein equations. We apply
our framework to find explicit deformed cosmological and black hole solutions
and discuss their phenomenology.
