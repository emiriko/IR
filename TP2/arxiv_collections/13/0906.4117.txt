Recently estimates have been made of the velocities of pulsars produced by
the emission of sterile neutrinos during the first 10 seconds and by active
neutrinos during the second 10 seconds after a supernova event reaches thermal
equilibrium. Neutrinos produced with electrons in the lowest Landau level are
emitted in the direction of the magnetic field, and the resulting pulsar
velocity depends mainly on the temperature. Using measurements of the neutrino
energies emitted from SN1987A, the temperature can be estimated, and from this
we estimate the velocity of the resulting pulsar from both active and large
mixing-angle sterile neutrinos.
