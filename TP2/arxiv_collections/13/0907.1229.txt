Several observational pieces of evidence indicate that specific evolutionary
channels which involve Roche lobe overflow are not correctly accounted for by
the classical Roche model. We generalize the concept of Roche lobe in the
presence of extra forces (caused by radiation pressure or pulsations). By
computing the distortion of the equipotential surfaces, we are able to evaluate
the impact of these perturbing forces on the stability of Roche-lobe overflow
(RLOF). Radiative forces are parametrized through the constant reduction factor
that they impose on the gravitational force from the radiating star (neglecting
any shielding in case of large optical thickness). Forces imparted by
pulsations are derived from the velocity profile of the wind that they trigger.
We provide analytical expressions to compute the generalized Roche radius.
Depending on the extra force, the Roche-lobe radius may either stay unchanged,
become smaller, or even become meaningless (in the presence of a radiatively-
or pulsation-driven wind). There is little impact on the RLOF stability.
