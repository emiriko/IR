In order to help detecting superfluidity, we theoretically investigate p-wave
pairing superfluids in neutral Fermion atom gases confined by a three
dimensimentional (3D) harmonic potential. The Ginzburg-Landau framework, which
is generic for p-wave superfluids, is used to describe the order parameter
spatial structure, or texture characterized by the l-vector both at rest and
under rotation. The l-vector configuration is strongly contrained by the
boundary condition due to a trap. It is found that the ground state textures
exhibit spontaneous supercurrent at rest both cigar and pancake shape traps.
The current direction depends on the trapping shape. Under rotation a pair of
half-quantum vortex with half-winding number enters a system and is stabilized
for both trap geometries. We give detailed explanation for their 3D structure.
The deformations of the condensate shape are seen with increasing the rotation
speed, which is tightly connected with the underlying vortex formation where
the condensates are depressed in the vortex core.
