In this note we show that for the group G = U(N) the space of Hecke
modifications of a rank N vector bundle over a Riemann surface C coincides with
the moduli space of solutions of certain non-abelian vortex equations over C .
Through the recent work of Kapustin and Witten this then leads to an
isomorphism between the moduli space of vortices and the moduli space of
singular monopoles on the product of C with a closed interval I .
