The interaction between the field emission resonance states and the
photodetached electron in an electric field is studied by semiclassical theory.
An analytical expression of the photodetachment cross section is derived in the
framework. It is found that the Stark shifted image state modulates the
photodetachment cross section by adding irregular staircase or smooth
oscillation in the spectrum. When the photodetached electron is trapped in
Stark shifted image potential well, the detachment spectrum displays an
irregular staircase structure which corresponds to the modified Rydberg series.
While the photodetached electron is not bound by the surface potential well,
the cross secton contains only a smooth oscillation due to the reflection of
electronic wave by the field or the surface.
