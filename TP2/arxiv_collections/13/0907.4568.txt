Ferroelectric switching in BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin films with intrinsic
``stripe-like'' and ``bubble-like'' polydomain configurations was studied by
piezoresponse force microscopy. Using the local electric field applied by a
scanning probe microscope tip, we observe reversal of both out-of-plane and
in-plane components of the polarization, with the final domain state depending
on the tip sweeping direction. In ``bubble-like'' samples, complete control of
the polarization is achieved, with in-plane polarization change mediated and
stabilized by out-of-plane polarization reversal. In ``stripe-like'' samples
the intrinsic domain structure influences polarization switching and in-plane
reversal may occur without out-of-plane change. The observed switching
behaviour can be well correlated with the radial and vertical components of the
highly inhomogeneous electric field applied by the tip.
