Following our earlier work on the Ruppeiner geometry of an anyon gas [B.
Mirza and H. Mohammadzadeh, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 78,} 021127 (2008)], we will
derive nonperturbative thermodynamic curvature of a two-dimensional ideal anyon
gas. At different values of the thermodynamic parameter space, some unique and
interesting behaviors of the anyon gas are explored. A complete picture of
attractive and repulsive phases of the anyon gas is given.
