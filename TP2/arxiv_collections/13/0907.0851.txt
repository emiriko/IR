A conceptual design of an advanced Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope with a 23
m diameter mirror and of 50 tons weight will be presented. A system photon
detection efficiency of 15-17%, averaged over 300-600 nm, is aimed at to lower
the threshold to 10-20 GeV. Prospects for a second generation camera with
Geiger-mode Avalanche Photo Diodes will be discussed.
