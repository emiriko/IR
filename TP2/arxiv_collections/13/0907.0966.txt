Central exclusive Higgs boson production, pp -> p+H+p, at the LHC can provide
important complementary contribution to the comprehensive study of the Higgs
sector in a remarkably clean topology. The bb(bar) Higgs decay mode is
especially attractive, and for certain BSM scenarios may even become the
discovery channel. Obvious requirements for the success of such exclusive
measurements are strongly suppressed and controllable backgrounds. One
potential source of background comes from additional gluon radiation which
leads to a three-jet bb(bar)g final state. We perform an explicit calculation
of the subprocesses gg -> q(bar)qg, gg -> ggg in the case of `internal' gluon
radiation from the spectator, t-channel screening gluon, when the two incoming
active t-channel gluons form a colour octet. We find that the overall
contribution of this source of background is orders of magnitude lower than
that caused by the main irreducible background resulting from the gg^{PP} ->
b(bar)b subprocess. Therefore, this background contribution can be safely
neglected.
