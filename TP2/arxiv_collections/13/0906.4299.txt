We present thermodynamic, structural and transport measurements on
Ba(Fe0.973Cr0.027)2As2 single crystals. All measurements reveal sharp anomalies
at ~ 112 K. Single crystal x-ray diffraction identifies the structural
transition as a first order, from the high-temperature tetragonal I4/mmm to the
low-temperature orthorhombic Fmmm structure, in contrast to an earlier report.
