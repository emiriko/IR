We present the CoRoT light curve of the Beta Cep star HD 180642, assembled
during the first long run of the space mission, as well as archival single-band
photometry.
  Our goal is to analyse the detailed behaviour present in the light curve and
interpret it in terms of excited mode frequencies.
  After describing the noise properties in detail, we use various time series
analysis and fitting techniques to model the CoRoT light curve, for various
physical assumptions. We apply statistical goodness-of-fit criteria that allow
us to select the most appropriate physical model fit to the data.
  We conclude that the light curve model based on nonlinear resonant frequency
and phase locking provides the best representation of the data. The
interpretation of the residuals is dependent on the chosen physical model used
to prewhiten the data. Our observational results constitute a fruitful starting
point for detailed seismic stellar modelling of this large-amplitude and
evolved Beta Cep star.
