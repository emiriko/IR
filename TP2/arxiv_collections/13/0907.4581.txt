While B0 and B+ mesons are well studied at B-factories, large samples of B0s
mesons are only available at the Tevatron so far. Since the B0s meson consists
of quarks of the second and third generation it provides a complementary probe
for searches for new physics effects. Results of the CDF and D0 experiments on
the decays B0s -> mu+ mu- and B0s -> mu+ mu- phi as well as on CP violation in
B0s mixing and in interference between mixing and decay are presented.
