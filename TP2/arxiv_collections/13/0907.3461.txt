The energy-momentum and angular momentum contained in a spacelike two-surface
of spherical topology are estimated by joining the two-surface to null infinity
via an approximate no-incoming-radiation condition. The result is a set of
gauge-invariant formulas for energy-momentum and angular momentum which should
be applicable to much numerical work; it also gives estimates of the
finite-size effects.
