Computer simulations of liquid phases require an initial configuration from
which to begin. The preparation of such an initial configuration or `snapshot'
often involves the melting of a solid phase. This melting is usually undertaken
by heating the system at low pressure, followed by a lengthy re-compression and
cooling once the melt has formed. This note looks at a novel technique to
produce a liquid phase from a perfect crystal using a standard Monte Carlo
simulation code.
