I consider a hybrid cosmological model with a classical gravitational field
and a quantized massive scalar field in spherically symmetric gravity. The
interaction between classical and quantum fields is described using the
formalism of ensembles on configuration space, an approach that provides an
alternative to semiclassical gravity. After giving an outline of the
formulation as it applies to spherically symmetric gravity, I discuss a
particular solution that is analogous to the Einstein universe of classical
relativity.
