We present a sophisticated gamma-ray likelihood reconstruction technique for
Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes. The technique is based on the
comparison of the raw Cherenkov camera pixel images of a photon induced
atmospheric particle shower with the predictions from a semi-analytical model.
The approach was initiated by the CAT experiment in the 1990's, and has been
further developed by a new fit algorithm based on a log-likelihood minimisation
using all pixels in the camera, a precise treatment of night sky background
noise, the use of stereoscopy and the introduction of first interaction depth
as parameter of the model.
  The reconstruction technique provides a more precise direction and energy
reconstruction of the photon induced shower compared to other techniques in
use, together with a better gamma efficiency, especially at low energies, as
well as an improved background rejection. For data taken with the H.E.S.S.
experiment, the reconstruction technique yielded a factor of ~2 better
sensitivity compared to the H.E.S.S. standard reconstruction techniques based
on second moments of the camera images (Hillas Parameter technique).
