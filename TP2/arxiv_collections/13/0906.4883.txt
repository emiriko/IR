We show that the Arzela-Ascoli theorem and Kolmogorov compactness theorem
both are consequences of a simple lemma on compactness in metric spaces. Their
relation to Helly's theorem is discussed. The paper contains a detailed
discussion on the historical background of the Kolmogorov compactness theorem.
