Applying Artmann's formula to the TE-polarized incident waves, we
theoretically show that the Goos-H\"{a}nchen (GH) shifts near the angle of the
pseudo-Brewster dip of the reflection from a slab of chiral metamaterial can be
greatly enhanced. The GH shifts are observed for both parallel and
perpendicular components of the reflected field. In addition, it is found that
the GH shifts depend not only on the slab thickness and the incident angle, but
also on the constitutive parameters of the chiral medium. In particular, when
the incident angle is close to the critical angle of total reflection for LCP
wave, significant enhancement of the GH shifts can be obtained. Finally, the
validity of the stationary-phase analysis is demonstrated by numerical
simulations of a Gaussian-shaped beam.
