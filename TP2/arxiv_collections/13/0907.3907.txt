An isotropic interaction potential for classical particles is devised in such
a way that the crystalline ground state of the system changes discontinuously
when some parameter of the potential is varied. Using this potential we model
martensitic transformations, and are able to study in detail the processes that
are usually associated with it: shape memory effect, superelasticity, as well
as many details concerning the dynamics of the transformation, particularly the
characteristics of the martensitic texture obtained as a function of parameters
affecting the transformation rate. Here we introduce the interaction potentials
and present some basic results about the transformation it describes, for the
particular case of two dimensional triangular-rombohedral and triangular-square
transformation.
