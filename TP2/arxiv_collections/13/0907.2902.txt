We report on the observation of reverse Doppler effect in backward spin waves
reflected off of surface acoustic waves. The spin waves are excited in a
yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. Simultaneously, acoustic waves are also
generated. The strain induced by the acoustic waves in the magnetostrictive YIG
film results in the periodic modulation of the magnetic anisotropy in the film.
Thus, in effect, a travelling Bragg grating for the spin waves is produced. The
backward spin waves reflecting off of this grating exhibit a reverse Doppler
shift: shifting down rather than up in frequency when reflecting off of an
approaching acoustic wave. Similarly, the spin waves are shifted up in
frequency when reflecting from receding acoustic waves.
