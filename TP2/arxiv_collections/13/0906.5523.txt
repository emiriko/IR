We examine the ordering behavior of the ferromagnetic Ising lattice model
defined on a surface with a constant negative curvature. Small-sized
ferromagnetic domains are observed to exist at temperatures far greater than
the critical temperature, at which the inner core region of the lattice
undergoes a mean-field phase transition. The survival of short-range order at
such high temperatures can be attributed to strong boundary-spin contributions
to the ordering mechanism, as a result of which boundary effects remain active
even within the thermodynamic limit. Our results are consistent with the
previous finding of disorder-free Griffiths phase that is stable at
temperatures lower than the mean-field critical temperature.
