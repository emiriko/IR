The optical turbulence conditions as measured between 2004 until end of 2008
above Cerro Tololo, their seasonal as well as nocturnal behavior are presented.
A comparison with the MASS-DIMM system of the Thirty Meter Telescope site
testing was conducted and identifies an artificially increased seeing component
in the data collected by the CTIO DIMM system under northerly winds. Evidence
is shown that this increased turbulence is caused by the telescope dome. A
correction for this effect is attempted and applied to the CTIO DIMM data. The
MASS data of this comparison campaign allow to set constraints on the general
assumption of uniform turbulent layers above a site.
