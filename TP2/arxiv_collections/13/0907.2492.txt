In this paper I discuss the reality that deductive inference is not the only
way we explain in science. I discuss the role of the opportunity for an
adaptation in the biosphere and claim that such an opportunity is a 'blind
final cause', not an efficient cause, yet shapes evolution. I also argue that
Darwinian exaptations are not describable by sufficient natural law. Based on
an argument of Sir Karl Popper, I claim that no law, or function, f, maps a
decoherence process in a Special Relativity setting from a specific space-time
slice into its future. If true this suggests there can be no theory of
everything entailing all that happens. I then discuss whether we can view laws
as 'enabling constraints' and what they enable. Finally, in place of the weak
Anthropic principle in a multiverse, I suggest that we might consider Darwin
all the way down. It is not impossible that a single universe has an abiotic
natural selection process for laws as enabling constraints and that the single
universe that 'wins' is ours. One possible criterion of winning might be 'most
rapid growth of the Adjacent Possible of the universe'.
