Surface spontaneous parametric down-conversion is predicted as a consequence
of continuity requirements for electric- and magnetic-field amplitudes at a
discontinuity of chi2 nonlinearity. A generalization of the usual two-photon
spectral amplitude is suggested to describe this effect. Examples of nonlinear
layered structures and periodically-poled nonlinear crystals show that surface
contributions to spontaneous down-conversion can be important.
