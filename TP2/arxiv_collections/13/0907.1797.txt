The heavy-quark spectral function in a hot plasma is reconstructed from the
corresponding euclidean propagator. The latter is evaluated through a
path-integral simulation. A weak-coupling calculation is also performed,
allowing to interpret the qualitative behavior of the spectral function in
terms of quite general physical processes.
