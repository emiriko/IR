A novel perturbative analysis for the 2+1 local supercritical field theory of
pomerons is developed. It is based on the PT symmetry of the model which allows
to study a similar Hamiltonian with the same real perturbative spectrum. In the
lowest non trivial order of perturbation theory the pomeron interactions are
shown to lead to the renormalization of the slope. The appearance of a non
local interaction for two pomeron states is such that at small coupling only
scattering states are present and the spectrum of two particle states is not
affected.
