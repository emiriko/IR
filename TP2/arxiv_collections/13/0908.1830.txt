We construct stable configurations of n overlapping discs of radius r in a
unit square, with r = O(1/n). By a result of Diaconis, Lebeau, and Michel, this
result is best possible, up to a constant factor. A consequence is that the
Metropolis algorithm, a well-studied Markov chain on the hardcore model, is not
irreducible in this range of parameters.
