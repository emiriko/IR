Weak-lensing searches for galaxy clusters are plagued by low completeness and
purity, severely limiting their usefulness for constraining cosmological
parameters with the cluster mass function. A significant fraction of `false
positives' are due to projection of large-scale structure and as such carry
information about the matter distribution. We demonstrate that by constructing
a "peak function", in analogy to the cluster mass function, cosmological
parameters can be constrained. To this end we carried out a large number of
cosmological N-body simulations in the \Omega_m-\sigma_8 plane to study the
variation of this peak function. We demonstrate that the peak statistics is
able to provide constraints competitive with those obtained from cosmic-shear
tomography from the same data set. By taking the full cross-covariance between
the peak statistics and cosmic shear into account, we show that the combination
of both methods leads to tighter constraints than either method alone can
provide.
