Graphene has attracted much attention due to its interesting properties and
potential applications. Chemical exfoliation methods have been developed to
make graphene recently, aimed at large-scale assembly and applications such as
composites and Li ion batteries. Although efficient, the chemical exfoliation
methods involve oxidation of graphene and introduce defects in the as-made
sheets. Hydrazine reduction at 100 has shown to partially restore the structure
and conductance of graphite oxide. However, the reduced GO still shows strong
defect peaks in Raman spectra with higher resistivity than pristine graphene by
2 to 3 orders of magnitude. It is important to produce much less defective
graphene sheets than GO, and develop more effective graphene reduction.
Recently, we reported a mild exfoliation-reintercalation-expansion method to
form high-quality GS with higher conductivity and lower oxidation degree than
GO.5 Here, we present a 180 solvothermal reduction method for our GS and GO.
The solvothermal reduction is more effective than the earlier reduction methods
in lowering the oxygen and defect levels in GS, increasing the graphene
domains, and bringing the conductivity of GS close to pristine graphene. The
reduced GS possess the highest degree of pristinity among chemically derived
graphene.
