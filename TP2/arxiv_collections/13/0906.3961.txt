In the theoretical analysis of high-energy elastic nucleon scattering one
starts commonly from the description based on the validity of optical theorem,
which allows to derive the value of total cross section directly from the
experimentally measured t-dependence of elastic differential cross section. It
may be shown, however, that this theorem has been derived on the basis of one
assumption that might be regarded perhaps as acceptable for long-range (e.g.,
Coulomb) forces but must be denoted as quite unacceptable for finite-range
hadron forces. Consequently, the conclusions leading to the increase of total
cross section with energy at higher collision energies must be newly analyzed.
The necessity of new analysis concerns also the derivation of elastic
scattering t-dependence at very low transverse momenta from measured data.
