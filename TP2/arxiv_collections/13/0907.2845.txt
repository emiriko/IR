In the context of the space-based mission CoRoT, devoted to asteroseismology
and search for planet transits, we analyse the accuracy of fundamental stellar
parameters (mass, radius, luminosity) that can be obtained from
asteroseismological data.} Our work is motivated by the large uncertainties on
planetary radius determination of transiting planets which are mainly due to
uncertainties on the stellar parameters. Our goal is to analyse uncertainties
of fundamental stellar parameters for a given accuracy of oscillation frequency
determination. We generate grids of equilibrium models of stars and compute
their pulsation spectra based on a linear nonadiabatic stability analysis.
Using differents methods of comparison of oscillation mode spectra, we derive
uncertainties on fundamental stellar parameters and analyse the effect of
varying the number of considered modes.} The limits obtained depend strongly on
the adapted method to compare spectra. We find a degeneracy in the stellar
parameter solutions, up to a few % in mass (from less than 1% to more than 7%
depending on the method used and the number of considered modes), luminosity
(from 2% to more than 10%) or radius (from less than 1% to 3%), for a given
pulsation spectrum.
