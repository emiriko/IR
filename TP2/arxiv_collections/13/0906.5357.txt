We use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict galaxy merger rates and
contributions to bulge growth as functions of merger mass, redshift, and mass
ratio. The models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identify
mergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers with
different properties contribute to the bulge population. We find good agreement
with a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions for
merger rates and contributions to bulge growth. We identify several robust
conclusions. (1) Major mergers dominate formation and assembly of L* bulges and
the spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) This is
mass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers in
lower-mass systems. At higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near L*, but
subsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) The minor/major contribution is
also morphology-dependent: higher B/T systems form in more major mergers, lower
B/T systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) Low-mass galaxies, being
gas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same B/T as high-mass
systems. (5) Absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) Predicted
rates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selected
samples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) Predicted rates agree
with integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2
uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. We
consider ~1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties.
Conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are very
robust, absolute merger rates have systematic factor ~2 uncertainties.
