The study of the evolutionary properties of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars
still presents unresolved topics. Progress in the theoretical understanding of
their evolution is hampered by the difficulty to empirically explain key
physical parameters like their luminosity, mass loss rate and chemical
abundances. We are performing an analysis of Galactic AGB stars trying to find
constraints for these parameters. Our aim is of extending this analysis to the
AGB stars of the Magellanic Clouds and of the Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies using
also mid-infrared observations from the Antarctic telescope IRAIT. AGB sources
from the Magellanic Clouds will be fundamental in our understanding of the AGB
evolution because they are all at a well defined distance (differently from the
Galactic AGBs). Moreover, these sources present different values of
metallicity: this fact should permit us of examining in a better way their
evolutionary properties comparing their behaviour with the one from Galactic
sources.
