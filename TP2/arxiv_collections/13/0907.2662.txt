The three-site model has been offered as a benchmark for studying the
collider phenomenology of Higgsless models. In this paper we analyze how well
the three-site model performs as a general exemplar of Higgsless models in
describing W_L W_L scattering, and which modifications can make it more
representative. We employ general sum rules relating the masses and couplings
of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the gauge fields in continuum and
deconstructed Higgsless models as a way to compare the different theories. We
show that the size of the four-point vertex for the (unphysical)
Nambu-Goldstone modes and the degree to which the sum rules are saturated by
contributions from the lowest-lying KK resonances both provide good measures of
the extent to which a highly-deconstructed theory can accurately describe the
low-energy physics of a continuum 5d Higgsless model. After comparing the
three-site model to flat and warped continuum models, we analyze extensions of
the three-site model to a longer open linear moose with an additional U(1)
group and to a ring ("BESS' or "hidden local symmetry") model with three sites
and three links. Both cases may be readily analyzed in the framework of the
general sum rules. We demonstrate that W_L W_L scattering in the ring model can
very closely approximate scattering in the continuum models, provided that the
hidden local symmetry parameter `a' is chosen to mimic rho-meson dominance of
pion-pion scattering in QCD. The hadron and lepton collider phenomenology of
both extended models is briefly discussed, with a focus on the complementary
information to be gained from precision measurements of the Z' line shape and
ZWW coupling at a high-energy lepton collider.
