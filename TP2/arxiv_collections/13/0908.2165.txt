In the paper the behavior of density (or specific volume), the heat of
evaporation and entropy per molecule for normal and heavy water on their
coexistence curves is discussed. The special attention is paid on the physical
nature of the similarity in the behavior of density and the heat of evaporation
for water and argon as well as the nearest water homolog $H_{2} S$. It is shown
that the appearance of this similarity is a consequence of the rotational
motion of water molecules, which averages the inter-particle potential in water
and leads it to the argon-like form. To describe the fine distinctions in the
behavior of the binodals for water and argon the dependence of the proper
molecular volume on pressure is taken into account. In accordance with this
often used the van der Waals and Carnahan-Starling equations of states are
modified. The very surprising behavior of the entropy diameter for water is
analyzed. It is shown that the nontrivial details of the temperature dependence
for the entropy diameter is directly connected with the peculiarities of the
rotational motion of molecules in water. The effect of strong dimerization of
water molecules in the fluctuation region near the critical point is studied in
details. The inner rotation of monomers forming the dimer $(D_{2} O)_{2} $ near
the critical point is discovered.
