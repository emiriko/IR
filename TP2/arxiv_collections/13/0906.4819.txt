We present the first measurement of dijet angular distributions in ppbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The
measurement is based on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
up to 0.7fb-1 collected with the D0 detector. Dijet angular distributions have
been measured over a range of dijet masses, from 0.25TeV to above 1.1TeV. The
data are in good agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD and are
used to constrain new physics models including quark compositeness, large extra
dimensions, and TeV-1 scale extra dimensions. For all models we set the most
stringent direct limits to date.
