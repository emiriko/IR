For users, recommendations can sometimes seem odd or counterintuitive.
Visualizing recommendations can remove some of this mystery, showing how a
recommendation is grouped with other choices. A drawing can also lead a user's
eye to other options. Traditional 2D-embeddings of points can be used to create
a basic layout, but these methods, by themselves, do not illustrate clusters
and neighborhoods very well. In this paper, we propose the use of geographic
maps to enhance the definition of clusters and neighborhoods, and consider the
effectiveness of this approach in visualizing similarities and recommendations
arising from TV shows and music selections. All the maps referenced in this
paper can be found in http://www.research.att.com/~volinsky/maps
