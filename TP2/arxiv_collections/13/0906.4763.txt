Based on the 1960 idea of Lipkin, the minimization of energy of a
symmetry-restored mean-field state is equivalent to the minimization of a
corrected energy of a symmetry-broken state with the Peierls-Yoccoz mass. It is
interesting to note that the "unphysical" Peierls-Yoccoz mass, and not the true
mass, appears in the Lipkin projected energy. The Peierls-Yoccoz mass can be
easily calculated from the energy and overlap kernels, which allows for a
systematic, albeit approximate, restoration of translational symmetry within
the energy-density formalism. Analogous methods can also be implemented for all
other broken symmetries.
