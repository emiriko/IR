The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in
various aspects of small-team collaborative search to share ideas, to stimulate
research in the area, and to increase the visibility of this emerging area. We
expect to identify promising directions for further exploration and to
establish collaborative links among research groups. The workshop took place on
June 20, 2008 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, in conjunction with the JCDL
2008 conference.
  The workshop was organized around three themes: practices, models, and
evaluation. We started with a discussion (still ongoing) about terminology,
about how to situate our work in the existing research space. We also wanted to
motivate our modeling and design discussions with real-world examples of
collaboration. We discussed examples from the healthcare domain, students,
faculty members, the military, and businesses such as pharmaceutical companies
that conduct research.
  We discussed several models of collaborative information seeking, including
sense-making, communication, and information seeking theory based on Marcia
Bates' Berrypicking theory.
  Finally, presenters described several systems that implement various aspects
of collaboration, including using search paths, simulations of user behavior to
model system performance, and characterizing properties of groups that lead to
more effective collaboration.
