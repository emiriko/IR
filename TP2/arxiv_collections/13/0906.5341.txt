We report evidence that the metallic phase in high Tc cuprate superconductors
results from an instability of the quasi 2D-electron gas at densities lower or
larger than the critical density for the formation of a Wigner polaronic
crystal. The electron gas undergoes a microscopic phase separation between 1) a
polaron gas with density 1/8 at the Wigner localization limit and 2) a Fermi
liquid confined in a superlattice of quantum stripes. The 2D-polaron gas
condenses into a paired unidimensional Wigner charge density wave (CDW) at
T<T*~1.4 Tc. Below the superconducting critical temperature the two types of
carriers are coupled, and the pairing mechanism involves virtual polaron pairs.
This mechanism drives the condensate to the maximum critical temperature for a
Fermi liquid. In addition the pairing model proposed here correctly predicts
the dependence of Tc on the condensate density ns/m* (Uemura plot), and the
variation of the isotope effect.
