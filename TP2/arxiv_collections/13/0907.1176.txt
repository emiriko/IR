Using tunneling spectroscopy we have measured the spectral density of states
of the mobile, two-dimensional electron system generated at the LaAlO3-SrTiO3
interface. As shown by the density of states the interface electron system
differs qualitatively, first, from the electron systems of the materials
defining the interface and, second, from the two-dimensional electron gases
formed at interfaces between conventional semiconductors.
