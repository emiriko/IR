A novel formalism for the evaluation of the Casimir-Polder potential in an
arbitrary gauge of vector potentials is introduced. The ground state energy of
a neutral atom in the presence of an infinite two-dimensional plane with
Chern-Simons interaction is derived at zero temperature. The essential feature
of the result is its dependence on the antisymmetric part of a dipole moment
correlation function.
