We analyze non-equilibrium states in a tunnel superconductor-normal metal
(NSN) structure in the presence of a tunnel current $I$. We use an
approximation of an effective temperature $T$ and calculate the current-voltage
I-V characteristics. It is shown that the I-V dependence may have an S-shaped
form. We determine nonuniform current $I(x)$ and temperature $T(x)$
distributions that arise as a result of instability of the uniform state with
negative differential conductance ($dI/dV<0$). We discuss an analogy with
equilibrium superconductors with an exchange field in which nonuniform states
predicted by Larkin-Ovchinnikov and Fulde-Ferrel are possible.
