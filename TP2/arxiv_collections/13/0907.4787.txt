Three measurements that broaden the scope of the experimental investigation
of quarkonia modifications in heavy ion collisions are presented. Although the
current statistical precision on the first two measurements does not allow one
to draw significant conclusions, J/$\psi$ elliptic flow and high pT suppression
results are important proofs of principle measurements, and make the case for
higher luminosities at RHIC. Finally, the first measurement of an upper limit
on the nuclear modification R_AA of dielectrons in the $\Upsilon$ mass region
in Au+Au collisions is presented. The results show a significant suppression
with an upper limit of 0.64 at 90% CL.
