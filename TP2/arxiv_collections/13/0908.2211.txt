A series of electron-doped cuprate La(2-x)CexCuO4 thin films with different
thicknesses have been fabricated and their annealing time are adjusted
carefully to ensure the highest superconducting transition temperature. The
transport measurements indicate that, with the increase of the film thickness
(<100 nm), the residual resistivity increases and the Hall coefficient shifts
in the negative direction. Further more, the X-ray diffraction data reveal that
the c-axis lattice constant c0 increases with the decrease of film thickness.
These abnormal phenomena can be attributed to the insufficient oxygen reduction
in the thin films. Considering the lattice mismatching in the ab-plane between
the SrTiO3 substrates and the films, the compressive stress from the substrates
may be responsible for the more difficult reduction of the oxygen in the thin
films.
