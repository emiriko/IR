We give an overview of photon physics which will be studied by the ALICE
experiment in proton-proton and heavy ion collisions at LHC. We compare
properties of ALICE photon detectors and estimate their ability to measure
neutral meson and direct photon spectra as well as gamma-hadron and gamma-jet
correlations in pp and Pb+Pb collisions.
