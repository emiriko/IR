Monte Carlo simulation has been performed in a two-dimensional modified
XY-model first proposed by Domany et. al [E. Domany, M. Schick and R. H.
Swendsen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 1535 (1984)]. The cluster algorithm of Wolff has
been used and multiple histogram reweighting is performed. The first order
scaling behavior of the quantities like specific heat, order parameter
susceptibility and free energy barrier are found to be obeyed accurately. While
the lowest order correlation function was found to decay to zero at long
distance just above the transition, the next higher order correlation function
shows a non-zero plateau.
