HESS J0632+057 is one of only two unidentified high energy gamma-ray sources
which appear to be point-like in nature. It is possibly associated with the
massive star MWC 148 and has been suggested to resemble known TeV binary
systems like LS I +61 303 or LS 5039. These binaries are rare and extreme (only
three TeV binaries are known to date), and their gamma-ray emission mechanism
has not been understood. HESS J0632+057 was observed by VERITAS, an array of
four 12 m imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, in 2006, 2008 and 2009.
Based on these observations we present evidence for variability in the high
energy gamma-ray emission from HESS J0632+057.
