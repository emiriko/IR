The H.E.S.S. experiment has reported the detection of very high energy (VHE:
E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from the well-known radio-galaxy Cen A. Following
this discovery, we refine the previous multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton
(SSC) model applied to the multi-wavelength emission from this source using the
new H.E.S.S. data. The prediction of the VHE gamma-ray level of emission for
Cen A presented in Lenain et al. paper agrees very well in the view of this
recent data. Further VHE observations of Cen A might detect variability, which
would comfort our inner jet modeling. The next generation of imaging
atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, will help to reveal possible multiple sources
of VHE emission in the complex structure of Cen A.
