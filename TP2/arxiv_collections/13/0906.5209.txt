There are well-known protocols for performing CNOT quantum logic with qubits
coupled by particular high-symmetry (Ising or Heisenberg) interactions.
However, many architectures being considered for quantum computation involve
qubits or qubits and resonators coupled by more complicated and less symmetric
interactions. Here we consider a widely applicable model of weakly but
otherwise arbitrarily coupled two-level systems, and use quantum gate design
techniques to derive a simple and intuitive CNOT construction. Useful
variations and extensions of the solution are given for common special cases.
