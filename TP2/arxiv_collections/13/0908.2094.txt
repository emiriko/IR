We obtained Hubble STIS spectra of three nova-like variables: V751 Cygni,
V380 Oph, and - the only confirmed nova-like variable known to be below the
period gap - BK Lyn. In all three systems, the spectra were taken during high
optical brightness state, and a luminous accretion disk dominates their far
ultraviolet (FUV) light. We assessed a lower limit of the distances by applying
the infrared photometric method of \citet{Knigge2006}. Within the limitations
imposed by the poorly known system parameters (such as the inclination, white
dwarf mass, and the applicability of steady state accretion disks) we obtained
satisfactory fits to BK Lyn using optically thick accretion disk models with an
accretion rate of $\dot{M} = 1\times10^{-9} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for a white
dwarf mass of $M_{wd} = 1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\dot{M} = 1 \times 10^{-8}
M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for $M_{wd} = 0.4 M_{\odot}$. However, for the VY Scl-type
nova-like variable V751 Cygni and for the SW Sex star V380 Oph, we are unable
to obtain satisfactory synthetic spectral fits to the high state FUV spectra
using optically thick steady state accretion disk models. The lack of FUV
spectra information down to the Lyman limit hinders the extraction of
information about the accreting white dwarf during the high states of these
nova-like systems.
