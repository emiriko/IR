Experiments in mechanics can often be timed by the sounds they produce. In
such cases, digital audio recordings provide a simple way of measuring time
intervals with an accuracy comparable to that of photogate timers. We
illustrate this with an experiment in the physics of sports: to measure the
speed of a hard-kicked soccer ball.
