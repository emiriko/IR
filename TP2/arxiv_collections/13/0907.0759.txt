Fluorescent and luminescent gene reporters allow us to dynamically quantify
changes in molecular species concentration over time on the single cell level.
The mathematical modeling of their interaction through multivariate dynamical
models requires the development of effective statistical methods to calibrate
such models against available data. Given the prevalence of stochasticity and
noise in biochemical systems inference for stochastic models is of special
interest. In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient
algorithm for the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters from gene
reporter data. We use the linear noise approximation to model biochemical
reactions through a stochastic dynamic model which essentially approximates a
diffusion model by an ordinary differential equation model with an
appropriately defined noise process. An explicit formula for the likelihood
function can be derived allowing for computationally efficient parameter
estimation. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a Bayesian framework and
inference is performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The major advantage of
the method is that in contrast to the more established diffusion approximation
based methods the computationally costly methods of data augmentation are not
necessary. Our approach also allows for unobserved variables and measurement
error. The application of the method to both simulated and experimental data
shows that the proposed methodology provides a useful alternative to diffusion
approximation based methods.
