The isospin dependence of the saturation properties of asymmetric nuclear
matter, particularly the incompressibility $K_\infty (X) = K_\infty + K_\tau
X^2 + O(X^4)$ at saturation density is systematically studied using density
dependent M3Y interaction. The $K_\tau$ characterizes the isospin dependence of
the incompressibility at saturation density $\rho_0$. The approximate
expression $K_{asy} \approx K_{sym}-6L$ is often used for $K_\tau$ where $L$
and $K_{sym}$ represent, respectively, the slope and curvature parameters of
the symmetry energy at $\rho_0$. It can be expressed accurately as
$K_\tau=K_{sym}-6L-\frac{Q_0}{K_\infty}L$ where $Q_0$ is the third-order
derivative parameter of symmetric nuclear matter at $\rho_0$. The results of
this addendum to Phys. Rev. C 80, 011305(R) (2009) indicate that the $Q_0$
contribution to $K_\tau$ is not insignificant.
