We numerically study the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles which are inside an
almost flat background; we assumed spherical symmetry and the size of the
bubble is smaller than the size of the background horizon. According to the
thin shell approximation and the null energy condition, if the bubble is
outside of a Schwarzschild black hole, unless we assume Farhi-Guth-Guven
tunneling, expanding and inflating solutions are impossible. In this paper, we
extend our method to beyond the thin shell approximation: we include the
dynamics of fields and assume that the transition layer between a true vacuum
and a false vacuum has non-zero thickness. If a shell has sufficiently low
energy, as expected from the thin shell approximation, it collapses (Type 1).
However, if the shell has sufficiently large energy, it tends to expand. Here,
via the field dynamics, field values of inside of the shell slowly roll down to
the true vacuum and hence the shell does not inflate (Type 2). If we add
sufficient exotic matters to regularize the curvature near the shell, inflation
may be possible without assuming Farhi-Guth-Guven tunneling. In this case, a
wormhole is dynamically generated around the shell (Type 3). By tuning our
simulation parameters, we could find transitions between Type 1 and Type 2, as
well as between Type 2 and Type 3. Between Type 2 and Type 3, we could find
another class of solutions (Type 4). Finally, we discuss the generation of a
bubble universe and the violation of unitarity. We conclude that the existence
of a certain combination of exotic matter fields violates unitarity.
