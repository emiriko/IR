The interleaving semantics is not compatible with both action refinement and
durational actions. Since many true concurrency semantics are congruent w.r.t.
action refinement, notably the causality and the maximality ones, this has
challenged us to study the dense time behavior - where the actions are of
arbitrary fixed duration - within the causality semantics of Da Costa.
  We extend the causal transition systems with the clocks and the timed
constraints, and thus we obtain an over class of timed automata where the
actions need not to be atomic. We define a real time extension of the formal
description technique CSP, called duration-CSP, by attributing the duration to
actions. We give the operational timed causal semantics of duration-CSP as well
as its denotational semantics over the class of timed causal transition
systems. Afterwards, we prove that the two semantics are equivalent. Finally we
extend the duration-CSP language with a refinement operator $\rho$ - that
allows to replace an action with a process - and prove that it preserves the
timed causal bisimulation.
