We examine the Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons in a
semiconductor microcavity via an electrical current. We propose that by
embedding a quantum dot p-i-n junction inside the cavity, the tunneling current
through the device can reveal features of condensation due to a one-to-one
correspondence of the photons to the condensate polaritons. Such a device can
also be used to observe the phase interference of the order parameters from two
condensates.
