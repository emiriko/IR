On June 15, 2009 UT the transit of TrES-2b was detected using the University
of Arizona's 1.55 meter Kuiper Telescope with 2.0-2.5 millimag RMS accuracy in
the I-band. We find a central transit time of $T_c = 2454997.76286 \pm0.00035$
HJD, an orbital period of $P = 2.4706127 \pm 0.0000009$ days, and an
inclination angle of $i = 83^{\circ}.92 \pm 0.05$, which is consistent with our
re-fit of the original I-band light curve of O'Donovan et al. (2006) where we
find $i = 83^{\circ}.84 \pm0.05$. We calculate an insignificant inclination
change of $\Delta i = -0^{\circ}.08 \pm 0.07$ over the last 3 years, and as
such, our observations rule out, at the $\sim 11 \sigma$ level, the apparent
change of orbital inclination to $i_{predicted} = 83^{\circ}.35 \pm0.1$ as
predicted by Mislis and Schmitt (2009) and Mislis et al. (2010) for our epoch.
Moreover, our analysis of a recently published Kepler Space Telescope light
curve (Gilliland et al. 2010) for TrES-2b finds an inclination of $i =
83^{\circ}.91 \pm0.03$ for a similar epoch. These Kepler results definitively
rule out change in $i$ as a function of time. Indeed, we detect no significant
changes in any of the orbital parameters of TrES-2b.
