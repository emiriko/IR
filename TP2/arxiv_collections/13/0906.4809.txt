We give a spectral sequence to compute the logarithmic Hodge groups on a
hypersurface type toric log Calabi-Yau space, compute its E_1 term explicitly
in terms of tropical degeneration data and Jacobian rings and prove its
degeneration at E_2 under mild assumptions. We prove the basechange of the
affine Hodge groups and deduce it for the logarithmic Hodge groups in low
dimensions. As an application, we prove a mirror symmetry duality in dimension
two and four involving the usual Hodge numbers, the stringy Hodge numbers and
the affine Hodge numbers.
