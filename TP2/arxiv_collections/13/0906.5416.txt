The Non-Identity Check problem asks whether a given a quantum circuit is far
away from the identity or not. It is well known that this problem is
QMA-Complete \cite{JWB05}. In this note, it is shown that the Non-Identity
Check problem remains QMA-Complete for circuits of short depth. Specifically,
we prove that for constant depth quantum circuit in which each gate is given to
at least $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of precision, the Non-Identity Check problem is
QMA-Complete. It also follows that the hardness of the problem remains for
polylogarithmic depth circuit consisting of only gates from any universal gate
set and for logarithmic depth circuit using some specific universal gate set.
