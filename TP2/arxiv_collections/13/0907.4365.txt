Fix a rational basepoint b and a rational number c. For the quadratic
dynamical system f_c(x) = x^2+c, it has been shown that the number of rational
points in the backward orbit of b is bounded independent of the choice of
rational parameter c. In this short note we investigate the dependence of the
bound on the basepoint b, assuming a strong form of the Mordell Conjecture.
