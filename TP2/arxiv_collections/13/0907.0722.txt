We discuss a quantum description of bubble growth in a superheated liquid
Helium by addressing the problem of operator ordering ambiguities that arise
due to the presence of position dependent mass (PDM) in this system. Using a
supersymmetric quantum mechanics formalism along with the Weyl quantization
rule, we are able to identify specific operator orderings for this problem.
This is a general method which should be applicable to other PDM systems.
