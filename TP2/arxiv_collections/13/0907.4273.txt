In this work we investigate the problem of simultaneous privacy and integrity
protection in cryptographic circuits. We consider a white-box scenario with a
powerful, yet limited attacker. A concise metric for the level of probing and
fault security is introduced, which is directly related to the capabilities of
a realistic attacker. In order to investigate the interrelation of probing and
fault security we introduce a common mathematical framework based on the
formalism of information and coding theory. The framework unifies the known
linear masking schemes. We proof a central theorem about the properties of
linear codes which leads to optimal secret sharing schemes. These schemes
provide the lower bound for the number of masks needed to counteract an
attacker with a given strength. The new formalism reveals an intriguing duality
principle between the problems of probing and fault security, and provides a
unified view on privacy and integrity protection using error detecting codes.
Finally, we introduce a new class of linear tamper-resistant codes. These are
eligible to preserve security against an attacker mounting simultaneous probing
and fault attacks.
