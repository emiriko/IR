Compact algebraic equations are derived, which connect the binding energy and
the asymptotic normalization constant (ANC) of a subthreshold bound state with
the effective-range expansion of the corresponding partial wave. These
relations are established for positively-charged and neutral particles, using
the analytic continuation of the scattering (S) matrix in the complex
wave-number plane. Their accuracy is checked on simple local potential models
for the 16O+n, 16O+p and 12C+alpha nuclear systems, with exotic nuclei and
nuclear astrophysics applications in mind.
