Since the PAMELA results on the "anomalously" high positron fraction and the
lack of antiproton excess in our Galaxy, there has been a tremendous number of
studies advocating new types of dark matter, with larger couplings to electrons
than to quarks.
  This raises the question of the production of dark matter particles (and
heavy associated coloured states) at LHC. Here, we explore a very simple
benchmark dark matter model and show that, in spite of the agreement between
the PAMELA antiproton measurements and the expected astrophysical secondary
background, there is room for large couplings of a WIMP candidate to heavy
quarks. Contrary to what could have been naively anticipated, the PAMELA pbar/p
measurements do not challenge dark matter model building, as far as the quark
sector is concerned. A quarkophillic species is therefore not forbidden.Owing
to these large couplings, one would expect that a new production channel opens
up at the LHC, through quark--quark and quark--gluon interactions. Alas, when
the PDF of the quark is taken into account, prospects for a copious production
fade away.
