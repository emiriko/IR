Several topics on the implementation of spin qubits in quantum dots are
reviewed. We first provide an introduction to the standard model of quantum
computing and the basic criteria for its realization. Other alternative
formulations such as measurement-based and adiabatic quantum computing are
briefly discussed. We then focus on spin qubits in single and double GaAs
electron quantum dots and review recent experimental achievements with respect
to initialization, coherent manipulation and readout of the spin states. We
extensively discuss the problem of decoherence in this system, with particular
emphasis on its theoretical treatment and possible ways to overcome it.
