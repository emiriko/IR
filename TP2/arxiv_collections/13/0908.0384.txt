The goal of this paper is to understand the drivers, configurations, and
scenarios of two similar eruptive events, which occurred in the same solar
active region 9973 on 2002 June 1 and 2. The June 2 event was previously
studied by Sui, Holman, and Dennis (2006, 2008), who concluded that it was
challenging for popular flare models. Using multi-spectral data, we analyze a
combination of the two events. Each of the events exhibited an evolving
cusp-like feature. We have revealed that these apparent ``cusps'' were most
likely mimicked by twisted magnetic flux ropes, but unlikely to be related to
the inverted Y-like magnetic configuration in the standard flare model. The
ropes originated inside a funnel-like magnetic domain whose base was bounded by
an EUV ring structure, and the top was associated with a coronal null point.
The ropes appear to be the major drivers for the events, but their rise was not
triggered by reconnection in the coronal null point. We propose a scenario and
a three-dimensional scheme for these events in which the filament eruptions and
flares were caused by interaction of the ropes.
