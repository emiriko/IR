In this article we explore the analytical and policy implications of widening
the governance of nanomaterials from the focus on risk regulation to a broader
focus on the governance of innovation. To do this, we have analysed the impact
of industrial activities on nanotechnology governance, while previous studies
have concentrated on risk appraisal, public perceptions, public engagement,
regulatory frameworks and related policies. We argue that the specific
characteristics of the industrial dynamics of nanomaterials - flexibility in
applications and distributed innovation - have important implications for
innovation governance as they limit and enable different interventions to
attempt to shape technology. Flexibility and distributedness exacerbate the
difficulties of directly controlling or shaping the directions of nanomaterials
innovation. In particular, the potential for public policy leverage is hindered
by the bottom-up nature of governance resulting from the multiplicity of
innovation sites. Under these conditions, we argue that the framing of policies
for nanomaterials governance needs to be broadened. The prevailing emphasis on
policy initiatives upstream, while commendable, should be complemented with
broader downstream policies, such as renewable energy procurement or
regulations in housing, in order to modulate technological development towards
socially desirable goals.
