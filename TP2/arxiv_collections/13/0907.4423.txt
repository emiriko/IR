We study the breathing mode in systems of trapped interacting particles. Our
approach, based on a dynamical ansatz in the first equation of the
Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy allows us to tackle at
once a wide range of power law interactions and interaction strengths, at
linear and non linear levels. This both puts in a common framework various
results scattered in the literature, and by widely generalizing these,
emphasizes universal characters of this breathing mode. Our findings are
supported by direct numerical simulations.
