The recently developed Life-Space-Foam approach to goal-directed human action
deals with individual actor dynamics. This paper applies the model to
characterize the dynamics of co-action by two or more actors. This dynamics is
modelled by: (i) a two-term joint action (including cognitive/motivatonal
potential and kinetic energy), and (ii) its associated adaptive path integral,
representing an infinite--dimensional neural network. Its feedback adaptation
loop has been derived from Bernstein's concepts of sensory corrections loop in
human motor control and Brooks' subsumption architectures in robotics.
Potential applications of the proposed model in human--robot interaction
research are discussed.
