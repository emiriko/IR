The radiation from newly born stars photoevaporates their parental neutral
cloud, leading to the formation of dense clumps that will eventually form
stars. We present 3D simulations of the interaction of a neutral cloud with an
external ionising radiation field, and compute the angular momenta of these
collapsing clumps. The angular momenta of these collapsing clumps show that
they have preferential orient mostly perpendicular to the direction of the
incident ionising photon field. Therefore, the axes of the jet systems that
will be eventually ejected (from the star + accretion disk systems that will
form) will be oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction to the
photoionising source.
