I review the problem of motion for small bodies in General Relativity, with
an emphasis on developing a self-consistent treatment of the gravitational
self-force. An analysis of the various derivations extant in the literature
leads me to formulate an asymptotic expansion in which the metric is expanded
while a representative worldline is held fixed; I discuss the utility of this
expansion for both exact point particles and asymptotically small bodies,
contrasting it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the
worldline are expanded. Based on these preliminary analyses, I present a
general method of deriving self-consistent equations of motion for arbitrarily
structured (sufficiently compact) small bodies. My method utilizes two
expansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an
outer expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By
imposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein
equation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of
small radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are
determined from a local-in-space expansion in a buffer region where both the
inner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results
in an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the
metric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these
pieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the
body's past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a
self-consistent approximation that is valid on long timescales, both near and
far from the small body. I conclude by discussing possible extensions of my
method and comparing it to alternative approaches.
