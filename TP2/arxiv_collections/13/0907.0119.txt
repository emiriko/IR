We discuss the elastic ed scattering beyond Born approximation. It is shown
that the reaction amplitude contains six generalized form factors, but only
three linearly independent combinations of them (we call them generalized
charge, quadrupole and magnetic form factors) contribute to the reaction cross
section in the second order perturbation theory. We examine two-photon exchange
and find that it includes two types of diagrams, when two virtual photons
interact with the same nucleon and when the photons interact with different
nucleons. Estimations based on nonrelativistic calculations with the deuteron
wave function for realistic NN potential show that the main contribution to the
generalized charge, quadrupole and magnetic form factors comes from diagrams of
the first type.
