The interfacial properties of Y0.6Pr0.4Ba2Cu3O7/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 superlattices
have been studied by resonant soft x-rays and diffuse scattered neutrons.
Linearly polarized X-ray absorption at Cu L3 -edge reveals dramatic interfacial
changes from the bulk including charge transfer between LCMO and YPBCO and an
orbital reconstruction in the interface CuO2 plane. The similarities to the
case of zero Pr-doping are due to the strongly hybridized covalent bond between
Cu and Mn. However, reduced charge transfer and a more bulk-like interfacial
orbital occupation are observed and related to the effect of Pr-doping. Neutron
reflectometry measurements reveal a drastic increase in diffuse scattering with
decreasing temperature, likely due to buckling caused by the structural phase
transition of the SrTiO3 substrate. We observe no evidence that this diffuse
scattering is related to the superconducting transition.
