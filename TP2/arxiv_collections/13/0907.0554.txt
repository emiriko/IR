We demonstrate that the gain/loss asymmetry observed for stock indices
vanishes if the temporal dependence structure is destroyed by scrambling the
time series. We also show that an artificial index constructed by a simple
average of a number of individual stocks display gain/loss asymmetry - this
allows us to explicitly analyze the dependence between the index constituents.
We consider mutual information and correlation based measures and show that the
stock returns indeed have a higher degree of dependence in times of market
downturns than upturns.
