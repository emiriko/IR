We calculate the important quantity of superfluid hydrodynamics, the
relativistic entrainment matrix for a nucleon-hyperon mixture at arbitrary
temperature. In the nonrelativistic limit this matrix is also termed the
Andreev-Bashkin or mass-density matrix. Our results can be useful for modeling
the pulsations of massive neutron stars with superfluid nucleon-hyperon cores
and for studies of the kinetic properties of superfluid baryon matter.
