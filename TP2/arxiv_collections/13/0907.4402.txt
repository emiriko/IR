We present results from an optical imaging and spectroscopic monitoring
campaign on the young, low-mass eruptive variable star V1647 Orionis. The star
and associated nebulosity (McNeil's Nebula) were observed over the period
February 2004 to February 2006 with observations commencing a few months after
the original outburst event occurred. Using the Gemini North telescope, we
obtained multi-band optical imaging photometry and medium-resolution long-slit
spectroscopy of V1647 Ori on an approximately monthly interval. During this
period, V1647 Ori remained at, or close to, peak brightness and then faded by 5
magnitudes to close to its pre-outburst brightness. This implies an outburst
timescale of around 27 months. Spectral features seen in both emission and
absorption varied considerably during the monitoring period. For example, the
Halpha line changed significantly in both intensity and profile. We present and
discuss the observed photometric and spectroscopic changes and consider how
this eruptive event relates to the early formative stages of low-mass stars.
