The ALICE detector has been commissioned and is ready for taking data at the
Large Hadron Collider. The first proton-proton collisions are expected in 2009.
This contribution describes the current status of the detector, the results of
the commissioning phase and its capabilities to contribute to the understanding
of both pp and PbPb collisions
