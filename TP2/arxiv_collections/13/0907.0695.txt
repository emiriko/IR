Fix an integer N>1. To each diagram of a link colored by 1,...,N, we
associate a chain complex of graded matrix factorizations. We prove that the
homotopy type of this chain complex is invariant under Reidemeister moves. When
every component of the link is colored by 1, this chain complex is isomorphic
to the chain complex defined by Khovanov and Rozansky in arXiv:math/0401268.
The homology of this chain complex decategorifies to the Reshetikhin-Turaev
sl(N) polynomial of links colored by exterior powers of the defining
representation.
