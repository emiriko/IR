Precise measurement of the Higgs boson properties is an important issue of
the International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment. We studied the accuracy of
the Higgs mass reconstruction in the ZH->qqH multi-jet process with the Higgs
mass of MH = 120 GeV at sqrt(s) = 250 GeV with the ILD detector model. In this
study, we obtained the reconstructed Higgs mass of M_H = 120.79 +- 0.089 GeV
and 5.3% measurement accuracy of the cross-section for ZH->qqbb with the
integrated luminosity of L=250 fb^{-1} data samples.
