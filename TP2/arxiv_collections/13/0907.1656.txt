We report the highest-fidelity observations of the spiral galaxy M51 in CO
emission, revealing the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) vis-a-vis
the large-scale galactic structure and dynamics. The most massive GMCs
(so-called GMAs) are first assembled and then broken up as the gas flow through
the spiral arms. The GMAs and their H2 molecules are not fully dissociated into
atomic gas as predicted in stellar feedback scenarios, but are fragmented into
smaller GMCs upon leaving the spiral arms. The remnants of GMAs are detected as
the chains of GMCs that emerge from the spiral arms into interarm regions. The
kinematic shear within the spiral arms is sufficient to unbind the GMAs against
self-gravity. We conclude that the evolution of GMCs is driven by large-scale
galactic dynamics --their coagulation into GMAs is due to spiral arm streaming
motions upon entering the arms, followed by fragmentation due to shear as they
leave the arms on the downstream side. In M51, the majority of the gas remains
molecular from arm entry through the inter-arm region and into the next spiral
arm passage.
