In 1934 H. Malmheden discovered an elegant geometric algorithm for solving
the Dirichlet problem in a ball. Although his result was rediscovered
independently by Duffin 23 years later, it still does not seem to be widely
known. In this paper we return to Malmheden's theorem, give an alternative
proof of the result that allows generalization to polyharmonic functions and,
also, discuss applications of his theorem to geometric properties of harmonic
measures in balls in Euclidean spaces.
