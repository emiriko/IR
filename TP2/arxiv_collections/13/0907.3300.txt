The Dine-Seiberg-Thomas model (DSTM) is the simplest version of the new
physics beyond the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), in the sense
that its Higgs sector has just two dimension-five operators, which are obtained
from the power series of the energy scale for the new physics in the effective
action analysis. We study the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in the
Higgs sector of the DSTM, which consists of two Higgs doublets. We find that
the CP violation may be triggered spontaneously by a complex phase, obtained as
the relative phase between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs
doublets. At the tree level, for a reasonably established parameter region, the
masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons and their corresponding coupling
coefficients to a pair of $Z$ bosons in the DSTM are calculated such that the
results are inconsistent with the experimental constraint by the LEP data.
Thus, the LEP2 data exclude the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in the
DSTM at the tree level. On the other hand, we find that, for a wide area in the
parameter region, the CP symmetry may be broken spontaneously in the Higgs
sector of the DSTM at the one-loop level, where top quark and scalar top quark
loops are taken into account. The upper bound on the radiatively corrected mass
of the lightest neutral Higgs boson of the DSTM is about 87 GeV, in the
spontaneous CP violation scenario. We confirm that the LEP data does not
exclude this numerical result.
