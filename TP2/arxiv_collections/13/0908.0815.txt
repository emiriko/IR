The change in the lattice parameters or the lattice disorder is claimed as a
cause of the slight reduction in the transition temperature by carbon doping in
MgB2. In this work, an extensive investigation on the effects of carbohydrate
doping has been carried out. It is found that not only the a-axis but also the
c-axis lattice parameter increases with the sintering temperature. A linear
relation between the unit cell volume and the critical temperature is observed.
Compared with the well known correlation between the lattice strain and the
critical temperature, the X-ray peak broadening itself shows a closer
correlation with the transition temperature. The residual resistivity and the
critical temperature are linearly correlated with each other as well and its
implication is further discussed.
