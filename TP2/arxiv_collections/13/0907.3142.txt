Many popular models of new physics beyond the Standard Model use a parity to
stabilize weakly interacting, dark matter candidates. We examine the potential
for the CERN Large Hadron Collider to distinguish models with parity stabilized
dark matter from models in which the dark matter is stabilized by other
symmetries. In this letter, we focus on signatures involving long-lived
particles and large amounts of missing transverse energy. To illustrate these
signatures, we consider three models from the literature which are
representative of a more general class of models with non-traditional
stabilization symmetries. The most optimistic scenario can observe the proposed
signature with a minimum of 10 inverse fb of integrated luminosity at design
center of mass energy. It will probably take considerable longer to validate
the stabilizing symmetry is not a simple parity. In all, we emphasize that the
underlying symmetry that stabilizes weakly interacting dark matter has
tremendous implications for the LHC and our understanding of the nature of dark
matter.
