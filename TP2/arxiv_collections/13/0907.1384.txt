Using 605/fb of data collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance we present a
measurement of the inclusive radiative B-meson decay channel, B to X_s gamma.
For the lower photon energy thresholds of 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.0GeV, as defined
in the rest frame of the B-meson, we measure the partial branching fraction and
the mean and variance of the photon energy spectrum. At the 1.7GeV threshold we
obtain the partial branching fraction BF(B to X_s gamma) = (3.45 +/- 0.15 +/-
0.40) x 10^-4, where the errors are statistical and systematic.
