We give the full set of $S$ matrices for extensions of $D(n)_1$ permutation
orbifolds, extending our previous work to the yet unknown case of integer spin
spinor currents. The main tool is triality of SO(8). We also provide fixed
point resolution matrices for spinor currents of $D(n)_1$ permutation orbifolds
with $n$ even and not multiple of four, where the spinor currents have
half-integer spin.
