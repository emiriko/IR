The best known Solar oscillation-like star is the Sun. During the last 14
years, the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) has been
continuously observing this star from the Lagrange point L1 with an enormous
success. Among the 11 instruments placed onboard, 3 of them are dedicated to
helioseismology: GOLF, VIRGO and MDI. The first two observe the Sun as a star
by integrating the velocity or intensity signal of the visible solar disk into
a single point. They are thus similar to any other observation done in
asteroseismology. During this review I will present the most important results
obtained during the mission concerning the Sun seen as a star and how this
results have evolved our thoughts of the inside of our star.
