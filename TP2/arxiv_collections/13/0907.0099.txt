We investigate the possibility of unitarity violation in the sequential
neutrino mixing matrix in a scenario with extra compact spacelike dimensions.
Gauge singlet neutrinos are assumed to propagate in one extra dimension, giving
rise to an infinite tower of states in the effective four-dimensional theory.
It is shown that this leads to small lepton-number violating entries in the
neutrino mass matrix, which can violate unitarity on the order of one per cent.
