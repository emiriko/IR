We study Finsler black holes induced from Einstein gravity as possible
effects of quantum spacetime noncommutativity. Such Finsler models are defined
by nonholonomic frames not on tangent bundles but on (pseudo) Riemannian
manifolds being compatible with standard theories of physics. We focus on
noncommutative deformations of Schwarzschild metrics into locally anisotropic
stationary ones with spherical/rotoid symmetry. There are derived the
conditions when black hole configurations can be extracted from two classes of
exact solutions depending on noncommutative parameters. The first class of
metrics is defined by nonholonomic deformations of the gravitational vacuum by
noncommutative geometry. The second class of such solutions is induced by
noncommutative matter fields and/or effective polarizations of cosmological
constants.
