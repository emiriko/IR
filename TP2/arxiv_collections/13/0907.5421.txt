Cosmology with Type Ia supernovae heretofore has required extensive
spectroscopic follow-up to establish a redshift. Though tolerable at the
present discovery rate, the next generation of ground-based all-sky survey
instruments will render this approach unsustainable. Photometry-based redshift
determination is a viable alternative, but introduces non-negligible errors
that ultimately degrade the ability to discriminate between competing
cosmologies. We present a strictly template-based photometric redshift
estimator and compute redshift reconstruction errors in the presence of
photometry and statistical errors. With reasonable assumptions for a cadence
and supernovae distribution, these redshift errors are combined with systematic
errors and propagated using the Fisher matrix formalism to derive lower bounds
on the joint errors in $\Omega_w$ and $\Omega_w'$ relevant to the next
generation of ground-based all-sky survey.
