With a view to a better understanding of the influence of atomic quantum
delocalisation effects on the phase behaviour of water, path integral
simulations have been undertaken for almost all of the known ice phases using
the TIP4P/2005 model, in conjunction with the rigid rotor propagator proposed
by Muser and Berne [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 2638 (1996)]. The quantum
contributions then being known, a new empirical model of water is developed
(TIP4PQ/2005) which reproduces, to a good degree, a number of the physical
properties of the ice phases, for example densities, structure and relative
stabilities.
