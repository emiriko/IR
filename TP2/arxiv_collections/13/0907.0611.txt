Aluminum extrusion die manufacturing is a critical task for productive
improvement and increasing potential of competition in aluminum extrusion
industry. It causes to meet the efficiency not only consistent quality but also
time and production cost reduction. Die manufacturing consists first of die
design and process planning in order to make a die for extruding the customer's
requirement products. The efficiency of die design and process planning are
based on the knowledge and experience of die design and die manufacturer
experts. This knowledge has been formulated into a computer system called the
knowledge-based system. It can be reused to support a new die design and
process planning. Such knowledge can be extracted directly from die geometry
which is composed of die features. These features are stored in die feature
library to be prepared for producing a new die manufacturing. Die geometry is
defined according to the characteristics of the profile so we can reuse die
features from the previous similar profile design cases. This paper presents
the CaseXpert Process Planning System for die manufacturing based on feature
based neural network technique. Die manufacturing cases in the case library
would be retrieved with searching and learning method by neural network for
reusing or revising it to build a die design and process planning when a new
case is similar with the previous die manufacturing cases. The results of the
system are dies design and machining process. The system has been successfully
tested, it has been proved that the system can reduce planning time and respond
high consistent plans.
