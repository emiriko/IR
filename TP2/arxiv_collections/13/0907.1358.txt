Belle and BaBar experiments at the KEKB and PEP-II
  B-factories provide also an excellent environment for spectroscopy studies.
In this report we present recent results in the field of charmonium
spectroscopy, focusing on new charmonium-like states observed in B decays, and
on $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ resonances created in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation through the
photon radiative return.
