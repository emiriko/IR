We prove a concise factor-of-2 estimate for the failure rate of optimally
distinguishing an arbitrary ensemble of mixed quantum states, generalizing work
of Holevo [Theor. Probab. Appl. 23, 411 (1978)] and Curlander [Ph.D. Thesis,
MIT, 1979]. A modification to the minimal principle of Cocha and Poor
[Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Quantum Communication,
Measurement, and Computing (Rinton, Princeton, NJ, 2003)] is used to derive a
suboptimal measurement which has an error rate within a factor of 2 of the
optimal by construction. This measurement is quadratically weighted and has
appeared as the first iterate of a sequence of measurements proposed by Jezek
et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 060301 (2002)]. Unlike the so-called pretty good
measurement, it coincides with Holevo's asymptotically optimal measurement in
the case of nonequiprobable pure states. A quadratically weighted version of
the measurement bound by Barnum and Knill [J. Math. Phys. 43, 2097 (2002)] is
proven. Bounds on the distinguishability of syndromes in the sense of
Schumacher and Westmoreland [Phys. Rev. A 56, 131 (1997)] appear as a
corollary. An appendix relates our bounds to the trace-Jensen inequality.
