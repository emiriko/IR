Using some assumptions about the correlation function of velocity in a
turbulent flow, a cylindrically symmetric tube-like solution is obtained. It is
proposed that this turbulent flow is similar to a flux tube in quantum
chromodynamics. Using similar assumptions for quantum chromodynamics, a flux
tube filled with a color electric field is obtained. The connection between
turbulence theory and quantum chromodynamics is discussed.
