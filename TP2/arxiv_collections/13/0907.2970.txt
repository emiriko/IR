We study gaugino mass generation in the context of semi-direct gauge
mediation models, where the messengers are charged under both the hidden sector
and the standard model gauge groups while they do not play important roles in
dynamical supersymmetry breaking. We clarify the cancellation of the leading
contributions of the supersymmetry breaking effects to the gaugino mass in this
class of models in terms of the macroscopic effective theory of the hidden
sector dynamics. We also consider how to retrofit the model so that we obtain
the non-vanishing leading contribution to the gaugino mass.
