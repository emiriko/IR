The CoRoT satellite is collecting precise time-resolved photometry for tens
of asteroseismology targets. To ensure a correct interpretation of the CoRoT
data, the atmospheric parameters, chemical compositions, and rotational
velocities of the stars must be determined. The main goal of the ground-based
seismology support program for the CoRoT mission was to obtain photometric and
spectroscopic data for stars in the fields monitored by the satellite. These
ground-based observations were collected in the GAUDI archive. High-resolution
spectra of more than 200 B-type stars are available in this database, and about
45% of them is analysed here. To derive the effective temperature of the stars,
we used photometric indices. Surface gravities were obtained by comparing
observed and theoretical Balmer line profiles. To determine the chemical
abundances and rotational velocities, we used a spectrum synthesis method,
which consisted of comparing the observed spectrum with theoretical ones based
on the assumption of LTE. Atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, and
rotational velocities were determined for 89 late-B stars. The dominant species
in their spectra are iron-peak elements. The average Fe abundance is
7.24+/-0.45 dex. The average rotational velocity is 126 km/sec, but there are
13 and 20 stars with low and moderate Vsin i values, respectively. The analysis
of this sample of 89 late B-type stars reveals many chemically peculiar (CP)
stars. Some of them were previously known, but at least 9 new CP candidates,
among which at least two HgMn stars, are identified in our study. These CP
stars as a group exhibit Vsin i values lower than the stars with normal surface
chemical composition.
