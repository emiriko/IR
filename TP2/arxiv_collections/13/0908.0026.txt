This paper deals with sufficiency conditions for irreducibility of certain
induced modules. We also construct irreducible representations for a group $G$
over a field ${\mathbb K}$ where the group $G$ is a semidirect product of a
normal abelian subgroup $N$ and a subgroup $H$. The main results are proved
with the assumption that ${\rm char} {\mathbb K}$ does not divide $|G|$ but
there is no assumption made of ${\mathbb K}$ being algebraically closed.
