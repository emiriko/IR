We revisit the controversy, discussed recently by Goldstein in this
journal[J. Chem. Phys. 128,154510 (2008)], whether the residual entropy is real
or fictional. It is shown that the residual entropy loss conjecture (ELC) at
the glass transition, which results in a discontinuous entropy violates many
fundamental principles of classical thermodynamics, and also contradicts some
experimental facts. Assuming, as is common in the field, that glasses are in
internal equilibrium, we show that the continuity of enthalpy and volume at the
glass transition require the continuity of the Gibbs free energy and the
entropy, which contradicts ELC. It is then argued that ELC is founded on an
incorrect understanding of what it means for a glass to be kinetically trapped
in a basin and of the concept of probability and entropy. Once this
misunderstanding is corrected in our approach by the proper identification of
entropy as the ensemble entropy, which is in accordance with the principle of
reproducibility (see Sect. II), it follows immediately that the residual
entropy does not disappear in a kinetically frozen glassy state and all the
violations of thermodynamics disappear. We show that the temporal definition of
entropy over finite times does not make sense for glasses as it is not unique.
There is no loss of ergodicity and causality, contrary to some recent claims.
