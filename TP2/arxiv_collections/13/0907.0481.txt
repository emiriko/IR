We predict new end-of-pulse behavior in high-field atomic double ionization.
Calculations of atomic electron trajectories in short intense laser pulses
confirm our analysis of elliptical polarization. We exhibit a four-band
structure in ion momentum distributions under various ellipticities, and
predict that sequential and non-sequential double ionization can be cleanly
distinguished under elliptical polarization.
