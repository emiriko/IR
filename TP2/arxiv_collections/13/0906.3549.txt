Quantum black holes are the smallest and heaviest conceivable elementary
particles. They have a microscopic size but a macroscopic mass. Several
fundamental types have been constructed with some remarkable properties.
Quantum black holes in the neighborhood of the Galaxy could resolve the paradox
of ultra-high energy cosmic rays detected in Earth's atmosphere. They may also
play a role as dark matter in cosmology.
