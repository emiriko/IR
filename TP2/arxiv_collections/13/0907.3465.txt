We consider classical and entanglement-assisted versions of a distributed
computation scheme that computes nonlinear Boolean functions of a set of input
bits supplied by separated parties. Communication between the parties is
restricted to take place through a specific apparatus which enforces the
constraints that all nonlinear, nonlocal classical logic is performed by a
single receiver, and that all communication occurs through a limited number of
one-bit channels. In the entanglement-assisted version, the number of channels
required to compute a Boolean function of fixed nonlinearity can become
exponentially smaller than in the classical version. We demonstrate this
exponential enhancement for the problem of distributed integer addition.
