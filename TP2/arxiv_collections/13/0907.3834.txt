A long-term project, aiming at systematic search for variable stars in
Galactic Open Clusters, was started at the Geneva Observatory in 2002. We have
been observing regularly a sample of twenty-seven Galactic Open Clusters in the
U, B, V Geneva filters. The goal is to identify and to study their variable
stars, as well as the connection between the variable stars in a cluster and
the cluster properties. We present the status of this work in progress, and
show preliminary results for one of these clusters, IC 4651.
