We present an analysis of the quark spectral function above and below the
critical temperature for deconfinement performed at zero and non-zero momentum
in quenched lattice QCD using clover improved Wilson fermions in Landau gauge.
It is found that the temporal quark correlation function in the deconfined
phase near the critical temperature is well reproduced by a two-pole ansatz for
the spectral function. This indicates that excitation modes of the quark field
have small decay rates. The bare quark mass and momentum dependence of the
spectral function is analyzed with this ansatz. In the chiral limit we find
that the quark spectral function has two collective modes corresponding to the
normal and plasmino excitations in the high temperature limit. Over a rather
wide temperature range in the deconfined phase the pole mass of these modes at
zero momentum, which corresponds to the thermal mass of the quark, is
approximately proportional to temperature. With increasing bare quark masses
the plasmino mode gradually disappears and the spectral function is dominated
by a single pole. We also discuss quasi-particle properties of heavy quarks in
the deconfined phase. In the confined phase, it is found that the pole ansatz
for the spectral function fails completely.
