We report results for the masses of the flavour non-singlet light 0++, 1--,
and 1+- mesons from unquenched lattice QCD at two lattice spacings. The twisted
mass formalism was used with two flavours of sea quarks. For the 0++ and 1+-
mesons we look for the effect of decays on the mass dependence. For the light
vector mesons we study the chiral extrapolations of the mass. We report results
for the leptonic and transverse decay constants of the rho meson. We test the
mass dependence of the KRSF relations.
