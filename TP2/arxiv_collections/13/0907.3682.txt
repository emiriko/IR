The NA60 experiment has studied muon pair production in p-A and In-In
collisions at the CERN SPS. We present new results on nuclear effects on J/psi
production in p-A at 158 GeV, the same energy used for collecting A-A data at
the SPS. We then compare nuclear effects with previous results from fixed
target experiments, and with the results obtained from a p-A data sample taken
by NA60 at 400 GeV. Based on the 158 GeV results, we calculate the expected
J/psi suppression in In-In and Pb-Pb collisions due to cold nuclear matter
effects, and we extract a new estimate for the anomalous suppression at SPS
energies. Finally, we show preliminary results on J/psi polarization in p-A
collisions.
