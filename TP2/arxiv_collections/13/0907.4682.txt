We provide a full one-loop calculation of the self energies and tadpoles of
the neutral Higgs bosons of the NMSSM. In addition, we compute the two-loop
O(alpha_t*alpha_s+alpha_b*alpha_s) corrections to the neutral Higgs boson
masses in the effective potential approximation. With respect to earlier
calculations, the newly-computed corrections can account for shifts of a few
GeV in the light scalar and pseudoscalar masses, and they can also sizeably
affect the mixing between singlet and MSSM-like Higgs scalars. Taking these
corrections into account will be crucial for a meaningful comparison between
the MSSM and NMSSM predictions for the Higgs sector.
