The application of a gauge covariant derivative to the Euler-Lagrange
equation yields a shortcut to the equations of motion for a field subject to an
external force. The gauge covariant derivative includes an external force as an
intrinsic part of the derivative and hence simplifies Lagrangians containing
tensor and gauge covariant fields. The gauge covariant derivative used in the
covariant Euler-Lagrange equation is presented as an extension of the
coordinate covariant derivative used in tensor analysis. Several examples
provide useful demonstrations of the covariant derivative relevant to studies
in general relativity and gauge theory.
