The capabilities of the CMS detector at the LHC will be described for
measuring high-pT hadrons, photons and jets in heavy ion collisions. Detailed
simulations of various studies planned with the CMS apparatus, including
charged particle tracking, jet reconstruction using calorimetry, dimuon and
isolated photon detection and the measurement of in-medium fragmentation
functions using high-pT photon-jet correlations will be discussed.
