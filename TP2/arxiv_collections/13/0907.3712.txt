We perform a fully relativistic calculation of the $^2 \vec H(e,e'p)n$
reaction in the impulse approximation employing the Gross equation to describe
the deuteron ground state, and we use the SAID parametrization of the full NN
scattering amplitude to describe the final state interactions (FSIs). The
formalism for treating target polarization with arbitrary polarization axes is
discussed, and general properties of some asymmetries are derived from it. We
show results for momentum distributions and angular distributions of various
asymmetries that can only be accessed with polarized targets.
