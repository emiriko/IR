The influence of fast neutrons on the occupancy and the single tube
resolution of ATLAS muon drift detectors was investigated by exposing a chamber
built out of 3 layers of 3 short standard drift tubes to neutron flux-densities
of up to 16 kHz/cm2 at a neutron energy of E=11 MeV. Pulse shape capable NE213
scintillaton detectors and a calibrated BF3 neutron detector provided
monitoring of the neutron flux-density and energy. The sensitivity of the drift
chamber to the neutrons was measured to be 4*10-4 by comparing data sets with
and without neutron background. For the investigation of tracks of cosmic muons
two silicon-strip detectors above and underneath the chamber allow to compare
measured drift-radii with reference tracks. Alternatively, the single tube
resolution was determined using the triple-sum method. The comparison between
data with and without neutron irradiation shows only a marginal effect on the
resolution and little influence on the muon track reconstruction.
