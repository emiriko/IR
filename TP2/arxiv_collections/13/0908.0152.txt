A TeV scale decaying dark matter chiral multiplet N is introduced in addition
to the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). For a calculable abundance
of N, we introduce heavy axino decaying to N and MSSM particles including the
lightest supersymmetric particle(LSP). In the scenario that heavy axino, once
dominating the energy density of the universe, decays after the LSP decouples,
it is possible to estimate the relative cosmic abundances of N and the LSP.
Dimension 6 interactions allow the lifetime of the fermionic or the bosonic
superpartner of N in the 10^{27} s range to be compatible with the recent
astrophysical bounds. A diagrammatic strategy obtaining a suppression factor
1/M^2 is also given.
