We study the adiabatic quantum pumping characteristics in the graphene
modulated by two oscillating gate potentials out of phase. The angular and
energy dependence of the pumped current is presented. The direction of the
pumped current can be reversed when a high barrier demonstrates stronger
transparency than a low one, which results from the Klein paradox. The
underlying physics of the pumping process is illuminated.
