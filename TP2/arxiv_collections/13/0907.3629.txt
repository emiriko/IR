Chemical bonds formed by hydrazine-sulfide treatment of GaAs(111) were
studied by synchrotron photoemission spectroscopy. At the B surface, the top
arsenic atoms are replaced by nitrogen atoms, while GaAs(111)A is covered by
sulfur, also bonded to underlying gallium, despite the sulfide molar
concentration being 103 times smaller than that of the hydrazine. This extreme
dependence on surface polarity is explained by competitive adsorption processes
of HS- and OH- anions and of hydrazine molecules, on Ga- adsorption sites,
which have distinct configurations on the A and B surfaces.
