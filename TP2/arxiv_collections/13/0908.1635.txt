This paper is the sequel to [HP1] to study the deformed structures and
representations of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$
associated to the finite dimensional simple Lie algebras $\mg$. An equivalence
of the braided tensor categories $\O^{r,s}$ and $\O^{q}$ is explicitly
established.
