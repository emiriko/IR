We perform an extensive study of the DAMA annual modulation data in the
context of inelastic dark matter. We find that inelastic dark matter with mass
m > 15 GeV is excluded at the 95% confidence level by the combination of DAMA
spectral information and results from other direct detection experiments.
However, at smaller m, inelastic dark matter constitutes a possible solution to
the DAMA puzzle.
