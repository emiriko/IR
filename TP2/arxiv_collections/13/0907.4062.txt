We discuss a common feature of all known reactions on nuclear targets - a
significant suppression at large x. Simple interpretation of this effect is
based on energy conservation restrictions in initial state parton
rescatterings. Using the light-cone dipole approach this mechanism is shown to
control variety of processes on nuclear targets: high-pT particle production at
different rapidities as well as direct and virtual (Drell-Yan) photon
production. We demonstrate universality and wide applicability of this
mechanism allowing to describe large-x effects also at SPS and FNAL energies
too low for the onset of coherent effects or shadowing.
