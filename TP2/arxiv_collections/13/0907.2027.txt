Point-contacts (PC) offer a simple way to create high current densities, 10^9
A/cm^2 and beyond, without substantial Joule heating. We have shown recently
(Nano Letters, 7 (2007) 927) that conductivity of nanosized PCs between a
normal and ferromagnetic metals exhibits bi-stable hysteretic states versus
both bias current and external magnetic field - the effect typical for
spin-valve structures. Here we report that apart from the bi-stable state a
third intermediate-resistance state is occasionally observed. We interpret this
state as due to a spin-vortex in the PC, nucleated either by Oersted field of
the bias current and/or by the circular geometry of PC. The observed
three-level-states in the PC conductivity testify that the interface spins are
both weakly coupled to the spins in the bulk and have depressed exchange
interaction within the surface layer.
