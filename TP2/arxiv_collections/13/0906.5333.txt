A study of the $J/\psi \pi \pi$ and $J/\psi K \bar{K}$ systems, treating them
as coupled channels, has been made by solving the Faddeev equations, with the
purpose of investigating the possibility of generation of the $J^{PC} =
1^{--}$, Y(4260) resonance due to the interaction between these three mesons.
In order to do this, we start by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the
two pseudoscalar and for the vector-pseudocalar meson systems using the
amplitudes obtained from the lowest order chiral Lagrangians as potentials.
With the $t$-matrices generated from these potentials, which contain the poles
of the $\sigma$, $f_{0}(980)$ and $a_{0}(980)$ resonances for the
pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar system and the pole of the X(3872), alongwith other
new charmed resonant states, for the vector-pseudoscalar system, we solve the
Faddeev equations. As a result, we get a peak around 4150 MeV with a width
$\sim$ 90 MeV when the invariant mass of the two pseudoscalars is close to that
of the $f_0 (980)$.
