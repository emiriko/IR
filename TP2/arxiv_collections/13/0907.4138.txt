We derive a new implementation of linear covariant gauges on the lattice,
based on a minimizing functional that can be interpreted as the Hamiltonian of
a spin-glass model in a random external magnetic field. We show that our method
solves most problems encountered in earlier implementations, mostly related to
the no-go condition formulated by L. Giusti, Nucl. Phys. B 498, 331 (1997). We
carry out tests in the SU(2) case in four space-time dimensions. We also
present preliminary results for the transverse gluon propagator at different
values of the gauge parameter xi.
