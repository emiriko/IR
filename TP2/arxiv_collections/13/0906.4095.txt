We study a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model in
which the Abelian sector of the theory consists of B-L and right-handed
isospin. In the minimal model this Abelian gauge structure is broken to the
standard model hypercharge gauge group by non-vanishing vacuum expectation
values of the right-handed sneutrinos, resulting in spontaneous R-parity
violation. This theory can emerge as a low energy effective theory of a
left-right symmetric theory realized at a high scale. We determine the mass
spectrum of the theory, and discuss the generation of neutrino masses and
R-parity violating interactions. The possibility of distinguishing between
R-parity violating models with a gauged B-L broken at the TeV scale at the
Large Hadron Collider is discussed.
