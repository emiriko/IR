We show that a spherically symmetric perturbation of a dust dominated
$\Omega=1$ FRW universe in the Newtonian gauge can lead to an apparent
acceleration of standard candles and provide a fit to the magnitude-redshift
relation inferred from the supernovae data, while the perturbation in the
gravitational potential remains small at all scales. We also demonstrate that
the supernovae data does not necessarily imply the presence of some additional
non-perturbative contribution by showing that any Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi model
fitting the supernovae data (with appropriate initial conditions) will be
equivalent to a perturbed FRW spacetime along the past light cone.
