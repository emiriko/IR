We discuss the existence of a common colour-magnitude relation (CMR) of
metal-poor globular clusters and early-type galaxies, i.e. giant ellipticals,
normal ellipticals and lenticulars, dwarf ellipticals and lenticulars, and
dwarf spheroidals. Such CMR would cover a range of ~ 14 mag, extending from the
brightest galaxies, down to the globular clusters on the fainter side.
