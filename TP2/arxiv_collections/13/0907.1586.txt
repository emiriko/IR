High energy physics data is a long term investment and contains the potential
for physics results beyond the lifetime of a collaboration. Many existing
experiments are concluding their physics programs, and looking at ways to
preserve their data heritage. Preservation of high-energy physics data and data
analysis structures is a challenge, and past experience has shown it can be
difficult if adequate planning and resources are not provided. A study group
has been formed to provide guidelines for such data preservation efforts in the
future. Key areas to be investigated were identified at a workshop at DESY in
January 2009, to be followed by a workshop at SLAC in May 2009. More
