Using Monte Carlo Simulation and fundamental measure theory we study the
phase diagram of a two-dimensional lattice gas model with a nearest neighbor
hard core exclusion and a next-to-nearest neighbors finite repulsive
interaction. The model presents two competing ranges of interaction and, in
common with many experimental systems, exhibits a low density solid phase,
which melts back to the fluid phase upon compression. The theoretical approach
is found to provide a qualitatively correct picture of the phase diagram of our
model system.
