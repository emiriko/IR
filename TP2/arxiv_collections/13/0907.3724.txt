Doubled topological phases introduced by Kitaev, Levin and Wen supported on
two dimensional lattices are Hamiltonian versions of three dimensional
topological quantum field theories described by the Turaev-Viro state sum
models. We introduce the latter with an emphasis on obtaining them from
theories in the continuum. Equivalence of the previous models in the ground
state are shown in case of the honeycomb lattice and the gauge group being a
finite group by means of the well-known duality transformation between the
group algebra and the spin network basis of lattice gauge theory. An analysis
of the ribbon operators describing excitations in both types of models and the
three dimensional geometrical interpretation are given.
