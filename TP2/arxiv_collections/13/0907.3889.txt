Complex electronic matter exhibit subtle forms of self organization which are
almost invisible to the available experimental tools, but which have dramatic
physical consequences. One prominent example is provided by the actinide based
heavy fermion material URu_2Si_2. At high temperature, the U-5f electrons in
URu_2Si_2 carry a very large entropy. This entropy is released at 17.5K via a
second order phase transition to a state which remains shrouded in mystery, and
which was termed a "hidden order" state. Here we develop a first principles
theoretical method to analyze the electronic spectrum of correlated materials
as a function of the position inside the unit cell of the crystal, and use it
to identify the low energy excitations of the URu_2Si_2. We identify the order
parameter of the hidden order state, and show that it is intimately connected
with magnetism. We present first principles results for the temperature
evolution of the electronic states of the material. At temperature below 70K
U-5f electrons undergo a multichannel Kondo effect, which is arrested at low
temperature by the crystal field splitting. At lower temperatures, two broken
symmetry states emerge, characterized by a complex order parameter \psi. A real
$\psi$ describes the hidden order phase, and an imaginary \psi corresponds to
the large moment antiferromagnetic phase, thus providing a unified picture of
the two broken symmetry phases, which are realized in this material.
