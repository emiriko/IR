FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ thin films with PbO-type structure are successfully
grown on MgO(100) and LaSrAlO$_{4}$(001) substrates from FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x+d}$
polycrystalline targets by pulsed-laser deposition. The film deposited on the
MgO substrate (film thickness $\sim$ 63 nm) shows superconductivity at 6.7 K
(onset) and 5.5 K (zero resistivity). On the other hand, the film deposited on
the LaSrAlO$_{4}$ substrate (film thickness $\sim$ 52 nm) exhibits only the
onset of superconducting transition at 2.6 K, but does not show zero
resistivity. This indicates the strong influence of epitaxial strain to
superconducting properties of FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ thin films.
