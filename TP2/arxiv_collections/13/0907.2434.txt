In this paper, we derive upper bounds for the heat kernel of the simple
random walk on the infinite cluster of a supercritical long range percolation
process. For any $d \geq 1$ and for any exponent $s \in (d, (d+2) \wedge 2d)$
giving the rate of decay of the percolation process, we show that the return
probability decays like $t^{-\ffrac{d}{s-d}}$ up to logarithmic corrections,
where $t$ denotes the time the walk is run. Moreover, our methods also yield
generalized bounds on the spectral gap of the dynamics and on the diameter of
the largest component in a box.
  Besides its intrinsic interest, the main result is needed for a companion
paper studying the scaling limit of simple random walk on the infinite cluster.
