FERMI-LAT is performing an all-sky gamma-ray survey from 20 MeV to >300 GeV
with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution. FERMI is the only
mission able to detect high energy (>20 MeV) emission from the Sun during the
new solar cycle 24. FERMI was launched on June 2008, since then high energy
emission from the Sun was continuously monitored searching for flare events.
Upper limits were derived for all the solar flares detected by other missions
and experiments (RHESSI, FERMI-GBM, GOES). We present the analysis techniques
used for this study and the preliminary results obtained so far.
