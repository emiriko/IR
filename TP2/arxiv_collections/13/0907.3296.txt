Time-frequency analysis, such as the Gabor transform, plays an important role
in many signal processing applications. The redundancy of such representations
is often directly related to the computational load of any algorithm operating
in the transform domain. To reduce complexity, it may be desirable to increase
the time and frequency sampling intervals beyond the point where the transform
is invertible, at the cost of an inevitable recovery error. In this paper we
initiate the study of recovery procedures for non-invertible Gabor
representations. We propose using fixed analysis and synthesis windows, chosen
e.g. according to implementation constraints, and to process the Gabor
coefficients prior to synthesis in order to shape the reconstructed signal. We
develop three methods to tackle this problem. The first follows from the
consistency requirement, namely that the recovered signal has the same Gabor
representation as the input signal. The second, is based on the minimization of
a worst-case error criterion. Last, we develop a recovery technique based on
the assumption that the input signal lies in some subspace of $L_2$. We show
that for each of the criteria, the manipulation of the transform coefficients
amounts to a 2D twisted convolution operation, which we show how to perform
using a filter-bank. When the under-sampling factor is an integer, the
processing reduces to standard 2D convolution. We provide simulation results to
demonstrate the advantages and weaknesses of each of the algorithms.
