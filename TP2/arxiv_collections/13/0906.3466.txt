In an unpublished preprint, A. King conjectured that there are tilting
bundles over projective varieties which are obtained as invariant quotients of
affine spaces for linear actions of reductive groups. The goal of this paper is
to give further examples of strong exceptional sequences of vector bundles on
certain projective varieties. These are obtained as geometric invariant
quotients of affine spaces by linear actions of reductive groups, as in King's
conjecture.
