We explore jet-medium interactions via the recently developed multi-hadron
correlation or "2+1" technique. We restrict the di-jet kinematics by selecting
a pair of approximately back-to-back high pT hadron triggers and study
associated particles. Here we present our study of di-jet systematics comparing
the measurements of associate yields and spectra in 200 GeV Au+Au and d+Au
collisions in two different scenarios. We present Sum(pT) as an estimate for
energy loss. First findings indicate little to no energy loss in the symmetric
"2+1" scenario whereas model predictions are about 2 GeV.
