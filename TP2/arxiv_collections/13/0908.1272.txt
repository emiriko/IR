We study $R^{2}$ corrections to five-dimensional asymptotically Lifshitz
spacetimes by adding Gauss-Bonnet terms in the effective action. For the
zero-temperature backgrounds we obtain exact solutions in both pure
Gauss-Bonnet gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity with non-trivial matter. The
dynamical exponent undergoes finite renormalization in the latter case. For the
finite-temperature backgrounds we obtain black brane solutions perturbatively
and calculate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$. The KSS
bound is still violated but unlike the relativistic counterparts, the causality
of the boundary field theory cannot be taken as a constraint.
