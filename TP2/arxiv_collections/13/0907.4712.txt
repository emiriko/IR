Analogy between Anderson T-motives and abelian varieties with multiplication
by an imaginary quadratic field (MIQF) is a source of 2 results:
  1. A description of abelian varieties with MIQF of dimension $r$ and
signature $(n, r-n)$ in terms of "lattices" of dimension $r$ in $\Bbb C^n$;
  2. A construction of exterior powers of abelian varieties with MIQF having
$n=1$.
