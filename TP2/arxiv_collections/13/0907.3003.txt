We investigate a scattering of electron which is injected individually into
an empty ballistic channel containing a cavity that is Coulomb coupled to a
quantum ring charged with a single-electron.
  We solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the electron pair with
an exact account for the electron-electron correlation. Absorption of energy
and angular momentum by the quantum ring is not an even function of the
external magnetic field. As a consequence we find that the electron
backscattering probability is asymmetric in the magnetic field and thus
violates Onsager symmetry.
