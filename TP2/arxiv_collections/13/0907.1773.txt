We consider statistics of the disruption and Lyapunov times in an
hierarchical restricted three-body problem. We show that at the edge of
disruption the orbital periods and the size of the orbit of the escaping body
exhibit L\'evy flights. Due to them, the time decay of the survival probability
is heavy-tailed with the power-law index equal to -2/3, while the relation
between the Lyapunov and disruption times is quasilinear. Applicability of
these results in an "hierarchical resonant scattering" setting for a three-body
interaction is discussed.
