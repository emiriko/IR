I discuss a method to model the instrumental response of the CMS and ATLAS
detectors at high transverse missing energies to dominant standard model V+jets
backgrounds, where V is a Z, gamma or W, using multi-jet QCD events. The method
is developed for new physics searches in early data at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) with minimal recourse to simulation.
