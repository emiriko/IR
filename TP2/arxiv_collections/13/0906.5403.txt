In this work, we study thin-film limits of the full three-dimensional
Ginzburg-Landau model for a superconductor in an applied magnetic field
oriented obliquely to the film surface. We obtain Gamma-convergence results in
several regimes, determined by the asymptotic ratio between the magnitude of
the parallel applied magnetic field and the thickness of the film. Depending on
the regime, we show that there may be a decrease in the density of Cooper
pairs. We also show that in the case of variable thickness of the film, its
geometry will affect the effective applied magnetic field, thus influencing the
position of vortices.
