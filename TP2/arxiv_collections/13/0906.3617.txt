We investigate the influence of the magnetic field of the
  Experimental storage ring (ESR) at GSI on the periodic time-dependence of the
orbital K-shell electron capture decay $(EC$) rates of the H--like heavy ions.
We approximate the magnetic field of the ESR by a uniform magnetic field.
Unlike the assertion by Lambiase et al., arXiv: 0811.2302 [nucl-th], we show
that a motion of the H-like heavy ion in a uniform magnetic field cannot be the
origin of the periodic time-dependence of the EC-decay rates of the H-like
heavy ions.
