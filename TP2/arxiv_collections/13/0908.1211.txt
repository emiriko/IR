In this paper we derive the optimal execution trajectory for a trader who
wishes to buy or sell a large position of shares which evolve as a geometric
Brownian process in contrast to the arithmetic model which prevails in the
existing literature, and with a general temporary impact $h$. We provide a
couple of examples which illustrate the results. We would like to stress the
fact that in this paper we use understandable user-friendly techniques.
