We prove that rational and 1-rational singularities of complex spaces are
stable under taking quotients by holomorphic actions of reductive and compact
Lie groups. This extends a result of Boutot to the analytic category and yields
a refinement of his result in the algebraic category. As one of the main
technical tools vanishing theorems for cohomology groups with support on fibres
of resolutions are proven.
