We revisit the exciton mechanism of superconductivity in the framework of
microcavity physics, replacing virtual excitons as a binding agent of Cooper
pairs by excitations of an exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate. We
consider a model microcavity where a quantum well with a two dimensional
electron gas is sandwiched between two undoped quantum wells, where a polariton
condensate is formed. We show that the critical temperature for
superconductivity dramatically increases with the condensate population,
opening a new route towards high temperature superconductivity.
