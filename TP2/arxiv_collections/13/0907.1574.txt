We present a density functional theory study on the shape and arrangement of
small BN domains embedded into single-walled carbon nanotubes. We show a strong
tendency for the BN hexagons formation at the simultaneous inclusion of B and N
atoms within the walls of carbon nanotubes. The work emphasizes the importance
of a correct description of the BN-C frontier. We suggest that BN-C interface
will be formed preferentially with the participation of N-C bonds. Thus, we
propose a new way of stabilizing the small BN inclusions through the formation
of nitrogen terminated borders. The comparison between the obtained results and
the available experimental data on formation of BN plackets within the single
walled carbon nanotubes is presented. The mirror situation of inclusion of
carbon plackets within single walled BN nanotubes is considered within the
proposed formalism. Finally, we show that the inclusion of small BN plackets
inside the CNTs strongly affects the electronic character of the initial
systems, opening a band gap. The nitrogen excess in the BN plackets introduces
donor states in the band gap and it might thus result in a promising way for
n-doping single walled carbon nanotubes.
