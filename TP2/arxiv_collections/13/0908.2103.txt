We have performed detailed x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals
of the spin-Peierls compound TiOBr in order to study the critical properties of
the transition between the incommensurate spin-Peierls state and the
paramagnetic state at Tc2 ~ 48 K. We have determined a value of the critical
exponent beta which is consistent with the conventional 3D universality
classes, in contrast with earlier results reported for TiOBr and TiOCl. Using a
simple power law fit function we demonstrate that the asymptotic critical
regime in TiOBr is quite narrow, and obtain a value of beta_{asy} = 0.32 +/-
0.03 in the asymptotic limit. A power law fit function which includes the first
order correction-to-scaling confluent singularity term can be used to account
for data outside the asymptotic regime, yielding a more robust value of
beta_{avg} = 0.39 +/- 0.05. We observe no evidence of commensurate fluctuations
above Tc1 in TiOBr, unlike its isostructural sister compound TiOCl. In
addition, we find that the incommensurate structure between Tc1 and Tc2 is
shifted in Q-space relative to the commensurate structure below Tc1.
