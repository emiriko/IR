We investigate the angular normal modes for small oscillations about an
equilibrium of a single-component coulomb cluster confined by a radially
symmetric external potential to a circle. The dynamical matrix for this system
is a Laplacian symmetrically circulant matrix and this result leads to an
analytic solution for the eigenfrequencies of the angular normal modes. We also
show the limiting dependence of the largest eigenfrequency for large numbers of
particles.
