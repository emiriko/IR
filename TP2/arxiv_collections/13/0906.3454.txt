We examine nonclassical properties of the field states generated by applying
the photon annihilation-then-creation operation (AC) and
creation-then-annihilation operation (CA) to the thermal and coherent states.
Effects of repeated applications of AC and of CA are also studied. We also
discuss experimental schemes to realize AC and CA with a cavity system using
atom-field interactions.
