Dense quantum plasmas are ubiquitous in planetary interiors and in compact
astrophysical objects, in semiconductors and micro-mechanical systems, as well
as in the next generation intense laser-solid density plasma interaction
experiments and in quantum x-ray free-electron lasers. In contrast to classical
plasmas, one encounters extremely high plasma number density and low
temperature in quantum plasmas. The latter are composed of electrons, positrons
and holes, which are degenerate. Positrons (holes) have the same (slightly
different) mass as electrons, but opposite charge. The degenerate charged
particles (electrons, positrons, holes) follow the Fermi-Dirac statistics. In
quantum plasmas, there are new forces associated with i) quantum statistical
electron and positron pressures, ii) electron and positron tunneling through
the Bohm potential, and iii) electron and positron angular momentum spin.
Inclusion of these quantum forces provides possibility of very high-frequency
dispersive electrostatic and electromagnetic waves (e.g. in the hard x-ray and
gamma rays regimes) having extremely short wavelengths. In this review paper,
we present theoretical backgrounds for some important nonlinear aspects of
wave-wave and wave-electron interactions in dense quantum plasmas.
Specifically, we shall focus on nonlinear electrostatic electron and ion plasma
waves, novel aspects of 3D quantum electron fluid turbulence, as well as
nonlinearly coupled intense electromagnetic waves and localized plasma wave
structures. Also discussed are the phase space kinetic structures and
mechanisms that can generate quasi-stationary magnetic fields in dense quantum
plasmas. The influence of the external magnetic field and the electron angular
momentum spin on the electromagnetic wave dynamics is discussed.
