The direct method of construction of local conservation laws of partial
differential equations (PDE) is a systematic method applicable to a wide class
of PDE systems [Anco S. and Bluman G., Direct construction method for
conservation laws of partial differential equations Part II: General treatment.
{\sl Europ. J. Appl. Math.} {\bf 13}, 567--585 (2002)]. Within the direct
method, one seeks multipliers, such that the linear combination of PDEs of a
given system with these multipliers yields a divergence expression.
  After local conservation law multipliers are found, one needs to reconstruct
the fluxes of the conservation law. In this review paper, we discuss common
methods of flux computation, compare them, and illustrate by examples. An
implementation of these methods in symbolic software is also presented.
