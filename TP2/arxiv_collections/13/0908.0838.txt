We present a theorem that shows that all useful protocols for magic state
distillation output states with a fidelity that is upper-bounded by those
generated by a much smaller class of protocols. This reduced class consists of
the protocols where multiple copies of a state are projected onto a stabilizer
codespace and the logical qubit is then decoded.
