In this paper, we propose a semi-parametric model for autonomous nonlinear
dynamical systems and devise an estimation procedure for model fitting. This
model incorporates subject-specific effects and can be viewed as a nonlinear
semi-parametric mixed effects model. We also propose a computationally
efficient model selection procedure. We prove consistency of the proposed
estimator under suitable regularity conditions. We show by simulation studies
that the proposed estimation as well as model selection procedures can
efficiently handle sparse and noisy measurements. Finally, we apply the
proposed method to a plant growth data used to study growth displacement rates
within meristems of maize roots under two different experimental conditions.
