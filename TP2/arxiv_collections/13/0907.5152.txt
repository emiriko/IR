We fabricate a highly efficient colour conversion light emitting diode
consisting of surface-patterned blue emitters and semiconductor colloidal
nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs). Electrically injected carriers in the blue
emitter (donor) are efficiently transferred to the NQDs (acceptor) via
nonradiative energy transfer in addition to conventional radiative energy
transfer. The existence of nonradiative energy transfer is verified by the
simultaneous observation of increased donor emission decay rate, the transient
transfer of carriers at the acceptor and a 2-fold enhancement of the NQD
electroluminescence.
