Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDG), concentrations of interstellar gas and stars in
the tidal features of interacting galaxies, have been the subject of much
scrutiny. The `smoking gun' that will prove the TDG hypothesis is the discovery
of independent dwarf galaxies that are detached from other galaxies, but have
clear tidal histories. As part of a search for TDGs we are using GALEX to
conduct a large UV imaging survey of interacting galaxies selected from the Arp
Atlas. As part of that study, we present a GALEX UV and SDSS and SARA optical
study of the gas-rich interacting galaxy pair Arp 305. The GALEX UV data reveal
much extended diffuse UV emission and star formation outside the disks
including a candidate TDG between the two galaxies. We have used a smooth
particle hydrodynamics code to model the interaction and determine the fate of
the candidate TDG.
