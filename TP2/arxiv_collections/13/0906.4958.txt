We report on the status of the QCD analysis of dijet azimuthal
decorrelations. We emphasise the relevance of resummation of soft and collinear
enhancements in describing these observables in the region where the two jets
are nearly back-to-back in the transverse plane. We also discuss the sources of
theoretical uncertainties and possible research directions aimed at their
reduction.
