We produce some explicit examples of conformally compact Einstein manifolds,
whose conformal compactifications are foliated by Riemannian products of a
closed Einstein manifold with the total space of a principal circle bundle over
products of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. We compute the associated conformal
invariants, i.e., the renormalized volume in even dimensions and the conformal
anomaly in odd dimensions. As a by-product, we obtain some Riemannian products
with vanishing Q-curvature.
