The usual semiclassical approximation for atom-field dynamics consists in
substituting the field operators by complex numbers related to the (supposedly
large enough) intensity of the field. We show that a semiclassical evolution
for coupled systems can always be obtained by frequent Zeno-like measurements
on the state of one subsystems, independently of the field intensity in the
example given. We study the Jaynes Cummings model from this perspective.
