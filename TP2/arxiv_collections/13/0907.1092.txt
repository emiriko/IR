We discuss pure dephasing of singlet-triplet superpositions in two-electron
double quantum dots due to elastic phonon scattering. We generalize our
previous results to a system built of two non-identical dots. We show that the
asymmetry must be very strong in order to considerably affect the dephasing
rate.
