A viable WIMP candidate, the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP), is
motivated by theories of universal extra dimensions. LKPs can scatter off
nuclei in large celestial bodies, like the Sun, and become trapped within their
deep gravitational wells, leading to high WIMP densities in the object's core.
Pair-wise LKP annihilation could lead to a detectable high energy neutrino flux
from the center of the Sun in the IceCube neutrino telescope. We describe an
ongoing search for Kaluza-Klein solar WIMPs with the AMANDA-II data for the
year 2001, and also present a UED dark matter sensitivity projected to 180 days
from a study of data taken with the combined AMANDA II and IceCube detector in
the year 2007. A competitive sensitivity, compared to existing direct and
indirect search experiments, on the spin-dependent cross section of the LKP on
protons is also presented.
