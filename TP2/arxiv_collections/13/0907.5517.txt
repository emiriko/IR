(Shortened) [...] After recalling the basic features of the "fireshell
model", we emphasize the following novel results: 1) the interpretation of the
X-ray flares in GRB afterglows as due to the interaction of the optically thin
fireshell with isolated clouds in the CircumBurst Medium (CBM); 2) an
interpretation as "fake - disguised" short GRBs of the GRBs belonging to the
class identified by Norris & Bonnell [...] consistent with an origin from the
final coalescence of a binary system in the halo of their host galaxies with
particularly low CBM density [...]; 3) the first attempt to study a genuine
short GRB with the analysis of GRB 050509B, that reveals indeed still an open
question; 4) the interpretation of the GRB-SN association in the case of GRB
060218 via the "induced gravitational collapse" process; 5) a first attempt to
understand the nature of the "Amati relation", a phenomenological correlation
between the isotropic-equivalent radiated energy of the prompt emission E_{iso}
with the cosmological rest-frame \nu F_{\nu} spectrum peak energy E_{p,i}. In
addition, recent progress on the thermalization of the electron-positron plasma
close to their formation phase, as well as the structure of the electrodynamics
of Kerr-Newman Black Holes are presented. An outlook for possible explanation
of high-energy phenomena in GRBs to be expected from the AGILE and the Fermi
satellites are discussed. As an example of high energy process, the work by
Enrico Fermi dealing with ultrarelativistic collisions is examined. It is clear
that all the GRB physics points to the existence of overcritical
electrodynamical fields. In this sense we present some progresses on a unified
approach to heavy nuclei and neutron stars cores, which leads to the existence
of overcritical fields under the neutron star crust.
