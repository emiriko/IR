Recent clock experiments have measured density-dependent frequency shifts in
polarized fermionic alkaline-earth atoms using 1S0-3P0 Rabi spectroscopy. Here
we provide a first-principles non-equilibrium theoretical description of the
interaction frequency shifts starting from the microscopic many-body
Hamiltonian. Our formalism describes the dependence of the frequency shift on
excitation inhomogeneity, interactions, and many-body dynamics, provides a
fundamental understanding of the effects of the measurement process, and
explains the observed density shift data. We also propose a method to measure
the second of the two 1S0-3P0 scattering lengths, whose knowledge is essential
for quantum information processing and quantum simulation applications.
