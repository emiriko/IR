The results of mid-rapidity ($0 < y < 0.8$) neutral pion spectra over an
extended transverse momentum range ($1 < p_T < 12$ GeV/$c$) in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$
= 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, measured by the STAR experiment, are presented. The
neutral pions are reconstructed from photons measured either by the STAR Barrel
Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) or by the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) via
tracking of conversion electron-positron pairs. Our measurements are compared
to previously published $\pi^{\pm}$ and $\pi^0$ results. The nuclear
modification factors $R_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ of $\pi^0$ are
also presented as a function of $p_T$ . In the most central Au+Au collisions,
the binary collision scaled $\pi^0$ yield at high $p_T$ is suppressed by a
factor of about 5 compared to the expectation from the yield of p+p collisions.
Such a large suppression is in agreement with previous observations for light
quark mesons and is consistent with the scenario that partons suffer
considerable energy loss in the dense medium formed in central nucleus-nucleus
collisions at RHIC.
