An electric charge is imparted to macroscopic particles, whereupon they are
pre-accelerated in an electrostatic field by the high voltage U = 220 kV. Then
the particles are accelerated by a traveling electromagnetic wave with the
initial phase velocity lying in the range v/c = 1e-3 - 1e-5. Focusing the
particles is provided by electrostatic doublets. At the acceleration length L =
20 m, the particles with Z/A = 2.3e-7 increase their velocity from v/c = 1e-5
to v/c = 1e-4.
