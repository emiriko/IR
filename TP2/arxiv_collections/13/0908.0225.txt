The propagation of a modulated positron beam in a planar crystal channel is
investigated. It is demonstrated that the beam preserves its modulation at
sufficiently large penetration depths which opens the prospect of using a
crystalline undulator as a coherent source of hard x-rays. This finding is a
crucial milestone in developing a new type of lasers radiating in the hard
x-ray and gamma-ray range.
