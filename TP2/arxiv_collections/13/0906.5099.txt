We show in detail how to determine the time-reversed representation of a
stationary hidden stochastic process from linear combinations of its
forward-time $\epsilon$-machine causal states. This also gives a check for the
$k$-cryptic expansion recently introduced to explore the temporal range over
which internal state information is spread.
