We study the possibility that further advancement in the understanding of the
order of chaos may demand a certain reconsideration of the approach to the
classical mechanics. For this we suggest to consider the viewpoint that
spatio-temporal relations between objects are emergent and that they are but a
result of complex interactions of objects. Such an approach is a natural
continuation of the revision of the notions of space and time started by the
general theory of relativity. It leads to a possible extension of the structure
of the classical mechanics. Namely, the result of the objects interactions can
be wider than the spatio-temporal relations. In this case interactions form a
generalized space ("Field-Space") wider than its spatio-temporal section (while
the known interactions are embedded within that section). The study of such
hypothesis demands constructing a theory, not relying on space and time as
primitive notions. As primary elements of such a theory we consider objects and
purely informational connections between them, not expressed in spatio-temporal
terms. Following the logic of this theory, the world constitutes a complex
information web. The Web is in the state of a constant flux (of a more general
category than the one of the quantum fields) - an incessant change of
connections, the complex order of which comprises the order of chaos. Reminding
the space build-up from the Regge skeleton, the Web builds a unified
Field-Space of pure information, manifested in space as energy distribution. We
describe the emergence of spatio-temporal laws from the viewpoint of purely
informational physics. The suggested construction of physics on the purely
informational basis is a candidate for the theory of quantum gravity.
