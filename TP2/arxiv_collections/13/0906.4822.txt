We study the linearized approximation of N=1 topologically massive
supergravity around AdS3. Linearized gravitino fields are explicitly
constructed. For appropriate boundary conditions, the conserved charges
demonstrate chiral behavior, so that chiral gravity can be consistently
extended to chiral supergravity.
