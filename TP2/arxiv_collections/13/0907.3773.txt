We study the adsorption of ideal random lattice copolymers with correlations
in the sequences on homogeneous substrates with two different methods: An
analytical solution of the problem based on the constrained annealed
approximation introduced by Morita in 1964 and the generating functional (GF)
technique, and direct numerical simulations of lattice chains averaged over
many realizations of random sequences. Both methods allow to calculate the free
energy and different conformational characteristics of the adsorbed chain. The
comparison of the results for random copolymers with different degree of
correlations and different types of nonadsorbing monomers (neutral or repelling
from the surface) shows not only qualitative but a very good quantitative
agreement, especially in the cases of Bernoullian and quasi-alternating random
sequences.
