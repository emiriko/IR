A simple method for describing the evolution of a quantum state of a double
quantum dot system interacting simultaneously with the electromagnetic
environment and with the lattice modes is developed. It is shown that the joint
action of the two reservoirs leads to nontrivial effects in the system
dephasing. As an example, the impact of phonon-induced initial dephasing on the
radiative decay of delocalized exciton states is discussed.
