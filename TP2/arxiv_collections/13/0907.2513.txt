Radiation by solid or fluid bodies can be characterized by resonance modes.
They are complex, as well as resonance frequencies, because of the energy loss
due to radiation. For ducts, they can be computed from the knowledge of the
radiation impedance matrix. For the case of a flanged duct of finite length
radiating on one side in an infinite medium, the expression of this matrix was
given by Zorumski, using a decomposition in duct modes. In order to calculate
the resonance frequencies, the formulation used in Zorumski's theory must be
modified as it is not valid for complex frequencies. The analytical development
of the Green's function in free space used by Zorumski depends on the integrals
of Bessel functions which become divergent for complex frequencies. This paper
proposes first a development of the Green's function which is valid for all
frequencies. Results are applied to the calculation of the complex resonance
frequencies of a flanged duct, by using a formulation of the internal pressure
based upon cascade impedance matrices. Several series of resonance modes are
found, each series being shown to be related to a dominant duct mode. Influence
of higher order duct modes and the results for several fluid densities is
presented and discussed.
