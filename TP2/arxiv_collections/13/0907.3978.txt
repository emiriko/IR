We have studied the prospects of measuring the CP violating phase with
atmospheric neutrinos at a large magnetized iron calorimeter detector
considering the muons (directly measurable) of the neutrino events generated by
a MonteCarlo event generator Nuance. The effect of $\theta_{13}$ and
$\delta_{CP}$ appears dominantly neither in atmospheric neutrino oscillation
nor in solar neutrino oscillation, but appears as subleading in both cases.
These are observable in range of $E \sim 1$ GeV for atmospheric neutrino, where
solar and atmospheric oscillation couple. In this regime, the quasi-elastic
events dominate and the energy resolution is very good, but the angular
resolution is very poor. Unlike beam experiments this poor angular resolution
acts against its measurements. However, we find that one can be able to
distinguish $\delta_{CP}\approx 0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ at 90% confidence
level. We find no significant sensitivity for $\delta_{CP}\approx 90^\circ$ or
$270^\circ$.
