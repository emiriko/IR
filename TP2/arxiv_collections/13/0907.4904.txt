The present paper investigates the cross-sectional morphology of Multiwalled
Carbon Nanotubes (MWNTs) restrained radially and circumferentially by an
infinite surrounding elastic medium, subjected to uniform external hydrostatic
pressure. In this study, a two-dimensional plane strain model is developed,
assuming no variation of load and deformation along the tube axis. We find some
characteristic cross-sectional shapes from the elastic buckling analysis. The
effect of the surrounded elastic medium on the cross-sectional shape which
occurs due to pressure buckling is focused on by the comparison with the shape
for no elastic medium case in our discussion. It is suggested that in no
embedded elastic medium cases, the cross-sectional shapes of inner tubes
maintain circle or oval; on the other hand, an embedded medium may cause inner
tube corrugation modes especially when the number of shells for MWNTs is small.
