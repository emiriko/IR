There are the results of gamma-ray bursts observations obtained using the
MASTER robotic telescope in 2007 - 2009. We observed 20 error-boxes of
gamma-ray bursts this period.The limits on their optical brightnesses have been
derived. There are 5 prompt observations among them, obtained at our very wide
field cameras. Also we present the results of the earliest observations of the
optical emission of the gamma-ray bursts GRB 050824 and GRB 060926.
