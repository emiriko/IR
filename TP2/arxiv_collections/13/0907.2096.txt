Recent experimental findings show that the pairing interaction in hole-doped
cuprates resides in the nodal (FS arcs) region accompanied by the separate
antinodal pseudogap. A corresponding multiband model of cuprate
superconductivity is developed. It is based on the electronic spectrum evolving
with doping and extends authors earlier approaches. The leading pair-transfer
interaction is supposed between the itinerant (mainly oxygen) band and a nodal
defect (polaron) band created by doping. These components are overlapping. The
defect subband created in the antinodal region of the momentum space does not
participate in the pairing by symmetry arguments. A supposed bare gap
separating it from the itinerant band top disappears with extended doping. The
corresponding antinodal pseudogap appears as a perturbative band structure
effect. The low energy excitation spectrum treated in the mean-field
approximation includes two nodal superconducting gaps and one pseudogap. The
behaviour of these gaps and of other pairing characteristics agree
qualitatively with the observations on the whole doping scale.
