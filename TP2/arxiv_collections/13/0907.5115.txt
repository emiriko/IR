In core-collapse supernovae, the nu_e and anti-nu_e species may experience
collective flavor swaps to non-electron species nu_x, within energy intervals
limited by relatively sharp boundaries ("splits"). These phenomena appear to
depend sensitively upon the initial energy spectra and luminosities. We
investigate the effect of generic variations of the fractional luminosities
(l_e, l_{anti-e}, l_x) with respect to the usual "energy equipartition" case
(1/6, 1/6, 1/6), within an early-time supernova scenario with fixed thermal
spectra and total luminosity. We represent the constraint l_e+l_{anti-e}+4l_x=1
in a ternary diagram, which is explored via numerical experiments (in
single-angle approximation) over an evenly-spaced grid of points. In inverted
hierarchy, single splits arise in most cases, but an abrupt transition to
double splits is observed for a few points surrounding the equipartition one.
In normal hierarchy, collective effects turn out to be unobservable at all grid
points but one, where single splits occur. Admissible deviations from
equipartition may thus induce dramatic changes in the shape of supernova
(anti)neutrino spectra. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of
initial flavor polarization vectors (defining boundaries for the single/double
split transitions), lepton number conservation, and minimization of potential
energy.
