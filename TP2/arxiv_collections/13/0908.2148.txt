Optical coupling of nitrogen vacancy centers in single-crystal diamond to an
on-chip microcavity is demonstrated. The microcavity is fabricated from a
hybrid gallium phosphide and diamond material system, and supports whispering
gallery mode resonances with spectrometer resolution limited Q > 25000.
