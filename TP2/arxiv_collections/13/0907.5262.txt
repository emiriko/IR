The authors report on modeling of transport spectroscopy in split-gate
controlled quantum constrictions. A mixed momentum-coordinate representation is
employed to solve a set of time-dependent Lippmann-Schwinger equations with
intricate coupling between the subbands and the sidebands. Our numerical
results show that the transport properties are tunable by adjusting the
ac-biased split-gates and the applied perpendicular magnetic field. We
illustrate time-modulated quasibound-state features involving inter-sideband
transitions and the Aharonov-Bohm oscillation characteristics in the
split-gated systems.
