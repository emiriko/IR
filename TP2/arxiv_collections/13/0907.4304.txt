Extending the use of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators to jets in nuclear
collisions requires a probabilistic implementation of the non-abelian LPM
effect. We demonstrate that a local, probabilistic MC implementation based on
the concept of formation times can account fully for the LPM-effect. The main
features of the analytically known eikonal and collinear approximation can be
reproduced, but we show how going beyond this approximation can lead to
qualitatively different results.
