We point out that the exchange of a Goldstone pseudo-scalar can provide an
enhancement in the dark matter annihilation rate capable of explaining the
excess flux seen in high energy cosmic ray data. The mechanism of enhancement
involves the coupling of s and d waves through the tensor force that is very
strong and, in fact, singular at short distances. The results indicate that
large enhancements require some amount of fine tuning. We also discuss the
enhancement due to other singular attractive potentials, such as WIMP models
with a permanent electric dipole.
