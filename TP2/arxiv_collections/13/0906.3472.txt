We describe solitons that live on the world--volumes of D5 branes wrapped on
deformed $A_2$ singularities fibered over $C(x)$. We show that monopoles are D3
branes wrapped on a node of the deformed singularity and stretched along
$C(x)$. F and D--term strings are D3 branes wrapped on a node of a singularity
that is deformed and resolved respectively. Domain walls require deformed $A_3$
singularities and correspond to D5 branes wrapped on a node and stretched along
$C(x)$.
