We examine spectrum of the physical volume operator within the non-standard
loop quantum cosmology. The spectrum is discrete with equally distant levels
defining a quantum of the volume. The discreteness may imply a foamy structure
of spacetime at semi-classical level which may be detected in astro-cosmo
observations.
