We consider the prospects for the detection of relatively light dark matter
through direct annihilation to neutrinos. We specifically focus on the
detection possibilities of water Cherenkov and liquid scintillator neutrino
detection devices. We find in particular that liquid scintillator detectors may
potentially provide excellent detection prospects for dark matter in the 4-10
GeV mass range. These experiments can provide excellent corroborative checks of
the DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal, but may yield results for low mass
dark matter in any case. We identify important tests of the ratio of electron
to muon neutrino events (and neutrino versus anti-neutrino events), which
discriminate against background atmospheric neutrinos. In addition, the
fraction of events which arise from muon neutrinos or anti-neutrinos ($R_{\mu}$
and $R_{\bar \mu}$) can potentially yield information about the branching
fractions of hypothetical dark matter annihilations into different neutrino
flavors. These results apply to neutrinos from secondary and tertiary decays as
well, but will suffer from decreased detectability.
