The minimal coupling procedure, which is employed in standard Yang-Mills
theories, appears to be ambiguous in the case of gravity. We propose a slight
modification of this procedure, which removes the ambiguity. Our modification
justifies some earlier results concerning the consequences of the Poincar\'e
gauge theory of gravity. In particular, the predictions of the Einstein-Cartan
theory with fermionic matter are rendered unique.
