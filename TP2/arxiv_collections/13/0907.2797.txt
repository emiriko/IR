We discuss the single-spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive DIS, $e p^\uparrow \to
e \pi X$, based on the twist-3 mechanism in the collinear factorization
relevant for the pion production with the large transverse-momentum. This
updates our previous study by including, in particular, the contributions
induced by the novel partonic subprocesses, and allows us to derive the entire
formula for the corresponding single-spin asymmetry associated with a complete
set of the twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions in the transversely
polarized nucleon. We discuss the correspondence with the results obtained by
the transverse-momentum-dependent factorization relevant for the pion
production with the low transverse-momentum.
