This report provides the technical justification for locating a large
detector underground in a US based Deep Underground Science and Engineering
Laboratory. A large detector with a fiducial mass in the mega-ton scale will
most likely be a multipurpose facility. The main physics justification for such
a device is detection of accelerator generated neutrinos, nucleon decay, and
natural sources of neutrinos such as solar, atmospheric and supernova
neutrinos. In addition to the physics justification there are practical issues
regarding the existing infrastructure at Homestake, and the stress
characteristics of the Homestake rock formations.
  The depth requirements associated with the various physics processes are
reported for water Cherenkov and liquid argon detector technologies. While some
of these physics processes can be adequately studied at shallower depths, none
of them require a depth greater than 4300 mwe which corresponds to the 4850 ft
level at Homestake. It is very important to note that the scale of the planned
detector is such that even for accelerator neutrino detection (which allows one
to use the accelerator duty factor to eliminate cosmics) a minimum depth is
needed to reduce risk of contamination from cosmic rays. After consideration of
the science and the practical issues regarding the Homestake site, we strongly
recommend that the geotechnical studies be commenced at the 4850ft level in a
timely manner.
