We consider several classes of symmetries of the Dirac Hamiltonian in 3+1
dimensions, with axially-deformed scalar and vector potentials. The symmetries
include the known pseudospin and spin limits and additional symmetries which
occur when the potentials depend on different variables. Supersymmetries are
observed within each class and the corresponding charges are identified.
