We analytically find an approximate Bloch-Messiah reduction of a noncollinear
parametric amplifier pumped with a focused monochromatic beam. We consider type
I phase matching. The results are obtained using a perturbative expansion and
scaled to a high gain regime. They allow a straightforward maximization of the
signal gain and minimization of the parametric fluorescence noise. We find the
fundamental mode of the amplifier, which is an elliptic Gaussian defining the
optimal seed beam shape. We conclude that the output of the amplifier should be
stripped of higher order modes, which are approximately Hermite-Gaussian beams.
Alternatively, the pump waist can be adjusted such that the amount of noise
produced in the higher order modes is minimized.
