We propose an analytic approach to the problem of collisionless magnetic
reconnection formulated as a process of Alfven eigenmodes' generation and
dissipation. Alfven eigenmodes are confined by the current sheet in the same
way that quantum mechanical waves are confined by the tanh^2 potential. The
dynamical time scale of reconnection is the system scale divided by the
eigenvalue propagation velocity of the n=1 mode. The prediction of the n=1 mode
shows good agreement with the in situ measurement of the
reconnection-associated Hall fields.
