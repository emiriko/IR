We demonstrate that efficient optical pumping of nuclear spins in
semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can be achieved by resonant pumping of
optically "forbidden" transitions. This process corresponds to one-to-one
conversion of a photon absorbed by the dot into a polarized nuclear spin, which
also has potential for initialization of hole spin in QDs. Pumping via the
"forbidden" transition is a manifestation of the "optical solid effect", an
optical analogue of the effect previously observed in electron spin resonance
experiments in the solid state. We find that by employing this effect, nuclear
polarization of 65% can be achieved, the highest reported so far in optical
orientation studies in QDs. The efficiency of the spin pumping exceeds that
employing the allowed transition, which saturates due to the low probability of
electron-nuclear spin flip-flop.
