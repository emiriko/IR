We study the evolution of supernova remnants in a low-metallicity medium
$Z/Z_{\odot} = 10^{-4}$ -- $10^{-2}$ in the early universe, using
one-dimensional hydrodynamics with non-equilibrium chemistry. Once a post-shock
layer is able to cool radiatively, a dense shell forms behind the shock. If
this shell becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments into pieces,
next-generation stars are expected to form from these fragments. To explore the
possibility of this triggered star formation, we apply a linear perturbation
analysis of an expanding shell to our results and constrain the parameter range
of ambient density, explosion energy, and metallicity where fragmentation of
the shell occurs. For the explosion energy of $10^{51}{\rm ergs} (10^{52}{\rm
ergs})$, the shell fragmentation occurs for ambient densities higher than
$\gtrsim 10^{2} {\rm cm^{-3}}$ (10 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, respectively). This
condition depends little on the metallicity in the ranges we examined. We find
that the mode of star formation triggered occurs only in massive ($\gtrsim
10^{8}M_{\odot}$) haloes.
