As a model for mesoscopic quantum systems in thermal contact, we consider a
four-mode Bose-Hubbard model with two greatly differing tunneling rates. By a
series of Holstein-Primakoff transformations we show that the low-frequency
dynamics of this system consists in general of two slow Josephson oscillations,
rather than the single slow mode predicted by linear Bogoliubov theory. We
identify the second slow Josephson oscillation as a heat exchange mode
analogous to second sound.
