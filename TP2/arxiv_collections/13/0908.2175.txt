A careful reanalysis of both Argonne National Laboratory and Brookhaven
National Laboratory data for weak single pion production is done. We consider
deuteron nuclear effects and normalization (flux) uncertainties in both
experiments. We demonstrate that these two sets of data are in good agreement.
For the dipole parametrization of $C_5^A(Q^2)$, we obtain $C_5^A(0)=1.19\pm
0.08$, $M_A=0.94\pm 0.03$ GeV. As an application we present the discussion of
the uncertainty of the neutral current 1$\pi^0$ production cross section,
important for the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment.
