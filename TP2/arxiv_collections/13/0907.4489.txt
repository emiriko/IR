At high baryon number density, it has been proposed that a new phase of QCD
matter controls the physics. This matter is confining but can have densities
much larger than $\Lambda^3_{QCD}$ QCD. Its existence is argued from large Nc
approximations, and model computations. It is approximately chirally symmetric.
