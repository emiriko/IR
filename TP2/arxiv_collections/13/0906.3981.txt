In a previous publication (Richichi & Percheron 2005) we described a program
of observations of candidate calibrator stars at the ESO Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI), and presented the main results from a statistical point
of view. In the present paper, we concentrate on establishing a new homogeneous
group of bright interferometric calibrators, based entirely on publicly
available K-band VLTI observations carried out with the VINCI instrument up to
July 2004. For this, we have defined a number of selection criteria for the
quality and volume of the observations, and we have accordingly selected a list
of 17 primary and 47 secondary calibrators. We have developed an approach to a
robust global fit for the angular diameters using the whole volume of
quality-controlled data, largely independent of a priori assumptions. Our
results have been compared with direct measurements, and indirect estimates
based on spectrophotometric methods, and general agreement is found within the
combined uncertainties. The stars in our list cover the range K=-2.9 to +3.0
mag in brightness, and 1.3 to 20.5 milliarcseconds in uniform-disk diameter.
The relative accuracy of the angular diameter values is on average 0.4% and 2%
for the primary and secondary calibrators respectively. Our calibrators are
well suited for interferometric observations in the near-infrared on baselines
between ~20m and ~200m, and their accuracy is superior, at least for the
primary calibrators, to other similar catalogues. Therefore, the present list
of calibrators has the potential to lead to significantly improved
interferometric scientific results.
