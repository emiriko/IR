We study different configurations of permanent magnets and ferromagnetic
circuit, in order to optimize the magnetic field for the so-called ``magnetic
tweezers'' technique, for studing mechanical properties of DNA molecules. The
magnetic field is used to pull and twist a micron-sized superparamagnetic
bead,tethered to a microscope slide surface by a DNA molecule. The force
applied to the bead must be vertical, pointing upwards, being as strong as
possible, and it must decrease smoothly as the magnets are moved away from the
bead. In order to rotate the bead around the vertical axis, the field must be
horizontal. Moreover, the volume occupied by the magnets is limited by the
optical system. We simulate different configurations by solving the equations
for the static magnetic field; then, we test some of the configurations by
measuring the force acting on a bead tethered by a DNA molecule. One of the
configurations is able to generate a magnetic field ten times stronger than
usually reported.
