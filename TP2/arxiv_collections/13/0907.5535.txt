We consider the dissipative dynamics of a qubit coupled to a nonlinear
oscillator (NO) embedded in an Ohmic environment. By treating the nonlinearity
up to first order and applying Van Vleck perturbation theory up to second order
in the qubit-NO coupling, we derive an analytical expression for the
eigenstates and eigenfunctions of the coupled qubit-NO system beyond the
rotating wave approximation. In the regime of weak coupling to the thermal
bath, analytical expressions for the time evolution of the qubit's populations
are derived: they describe a multiplicity of damped oscillations superposed to
a complex relaxation part toward thermal equilibrium. The long time dynamics is
characterized by a single relaxation rate, which is maximal when the qubit is
tuned to one of the resonances with the nonlinear oscillator.
