The current-voltage p-n junction characteristics were mainly analyzed until
now at low injection levels and high level injection separately. This work
unifies the low injection, medium injection, high injection levels and the
ohmic region of the I/V characteristics. Keywords: p-n junctions,
current-voltage characteristics, low injection and high injection levels, ohmic
region.
