The formation of a deeply-bound $K^- pp$ state with $I=1/2$, $J^\pi=0^-$ by
the $^3$He(in-flight $K^-$, $n$) reaction is theoretically investigated in a
distorted-wave impulse approximation using the Green's function method. The
expected inclusive and semi-exclusive spectra at $p_{K^-} = 1.0$ GeV/c and
$\theta_{\rm lab} = 0^{\circ}$ are calculated for the forthcoming J-PARC E15
experiment. We demonstrate these spectra with several types of phenomenological
$K^-$-``$pp$'' optical potentials $U^{\rm opt}(E)$ which have an
energy-dependent imaginary part multiplied by a phase space suppression factor,
fitting to recent theoretical predictions or experimental candidates of the
$K^-pp$ bound state. The results show that a cusp-like peak at the $\pi \Sigma
N$ threshold is an unique signal for the $K^-pp$ bound state in the spectrum
including the [$K^-pp$] $\to$ $Y + N$ decay process from the two-nucleon $K^-$
absorption, as well as a distinct peak of the $K^-pp$ bound state. The shape of
the spectrum is explained by a trajectory of a moving pole of the $K^-pp$ bound
state in the complex energy plane. The importance of the spectrum with
[$K^-pp$] $\to$ $Y + N$ from the two-nucleon $K^-$ absorption is emphasized in
order to extract clear evidence of the $K^-pp$ bound state.
