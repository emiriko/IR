The Letter takes up a question of what radio emission is produced by
electrons at the very acceleration site of a solar flare. Specifically, we
calculate incoherent radio emission produced within two competing acceleration
models--stochastic acceleration by cascading MHD turbulence and regular
acceleration in collapsing magnetic traps. Our analysis clearly demonstrates
that the radio emission from the acceleration sites: (i) has sufficiently
strong intensity to be observed by currently available radio instruments and
(ii) has spectra and light curves which are distinctly different in these two
competing models, which makes them observationally distinguishable. In
particular, we suggest that some of the narrowband microwave and decimeter
continuum bursts may be a signature of the stochastic acceleration in solar
flares.
