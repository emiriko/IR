The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) has recently
surveyed ~8.7 deg^2 centered on GOODS-South at 250, 350, and 500 microns. In
Dye et al. (2009) we presented the catalogue of sources detected at 5-sigma in
at least one band in this field and the probable counterparts to these sources
in other wavebands. In this paper, we present the results of a redshift survey
in which we succeeded in measuring redshifts for 82 of these counterparts. The
spectra show that the BLAST counterparts are mostly star-forming galaxies but
not extreme ones when compared to those found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Roughly one quarter of the BLAST counterparts contain an active nucleus. We
have used the spectroscopic redshifts to carry out a test of the ability of
photometric redshift methods to estimate the redshifts of dusty galaxies,
showing that the standard methods work well even when a galaxy contains a large
amount of dust. We have also investigated the cases where there are two
possible counterparts to the BLAST source, finding that in at least half of
these there is evidence that the two galaxies are physically associated, either
because they are interacting or because they are in the same large-scale
structure. Finally, we have made the first direct measurements of the
luminosity function in the three BLAST bands. We find strong evolution out to
z=1, in the sense that there is a large increase in the space-density of the
most luminous galaxies. We have also investigated the evolution of the
dust-mass function, finding similar strong evolution in the space-density of
the galaxies with the largest dust masses, showing that the luminosity
evolution seen in many wavebands is associated with an increase in the
reservoir of interstellar matter in galaxies.
