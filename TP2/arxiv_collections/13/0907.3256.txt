A generalized Langevin equation with quantum baths (QMD) for thermal
transport is derived with the help of nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formulation. The exact relationship of the quasi-classical approximation to
NEGF is demonstrated using Feynman diagrams of the nonlinear self energies. To
leading order, the retarded self energies agree, but QMD and NEGF differ in
lesser/greater self energies. An implementation for general systems using
Cholesky decomposition of the correlated noises is discussed. Some means of
stabilizing the dynamics are given. Thermal conductance results for graphene
strips under strain and temperature dependence of carbon nanotubes are
presented. The "quantum correction" method is critically examined.
