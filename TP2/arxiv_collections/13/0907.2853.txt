We use neutron scattering to show that replacing the larger arsenic with
smaller phosphorus in CeFeAs(1-x)P(x)O simultaneously suppresses the AF order
and orthorhombic distortion near x = 0.4, providing evidence for a magnetic
quantum critical point. Furthermore, we find that the pnictogen height in iron
arsenide is an important controlling parameter for their electronic and
magnetic properties, and may play an important role in electron pairing and
superconductivity.
