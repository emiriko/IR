The cosmic-ray propagation code GALPROP has recently been enhanced in the
areas of Galactic magnetic field and synchrotron radiation. A full 3D treatment
is now implemented. We describe these enhancements and show applications to the
interpretation of non-thermal radio surveys and gamma rays, to probe the
Galactic cosmic-ray electron spectrum and magnetic fields.
