We investigate the motion of two overlapping polymers with self-avoidance
confined in a narrow 2d box. A statistical model is constructed using blob
free-energy arguments. We find spontaneous segregation under the condition: $L
> R_{//}$, and mixing under $L < R_{//}$, where L is the length of the box, and
$R_{//}$ the polymer extension in an infinite slit. Segregation time scales are
determined by solving a mean first-passage time problem, and by performing
Monte Carlo simulations. Predictions of the two methods show good agreement.
Our results may elucidate a driving force for chromosomes segregation in
bacteria.
