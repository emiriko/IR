We report on a study of the anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic
rays with a median energy per Cosmic Ray (CR) particle of ~ 14 TeV using data
from the IceCube detector. IceCube is a neutrino observatory at the
geographical South Pole, when completed it will comprise 80 strings plus 6
additional strings for the low energy array Deep Core. The strings are deployed
in the deep ice between 1,450 and 2,450 meters depth, each string containing 60
optical sensors. The data used in this analysis were collected from April 2007
to March 2008 with 22 deployed strings. The data contain ~ 4.3 billion downward
going muon events. A two-dimensional skymap is presented with an evidence of
0.06% large scale anisotropy. The energy dependence of this anisotropy at
median energies per CR particle of 12 TeV and 126 TeV is also presented in this
work. This anisotropy could arise from a number of possible effects; it could
further enhance the understanding of the structure of the galactic magnetic
field and possible cosmic ray sources.
