A Haldane conjecture is revealed for spin-singlet charge modes in
2N-component fermionic cold atoms loaded into a one-dimensional optical
lattice. By means of a low-energy approach and DMRG calculations, we show the
emergence of gapless and gapped phases depending on the parity of $N$ for
attractive interactions at half-filling. The analogue of the Haldane phase of
the spin-1 Heisenberg chain is stabilized for N=2 with non-local string charge
correlation, and pseudo-spin 1/2 edge states. At the heart of this even-odd
behavior is the existence of a spin-singlet pseudo-spin $N/2$ operator which
governs the low-energy properties of the model for attractive interactions and
gives rise to the Haldane physics.
