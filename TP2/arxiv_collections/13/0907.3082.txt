We prove a generalization of Shafarevich's Conjecture for fields of Laurent
series in two variables over an arbitrary field. While not projective, the
absolute Galois group of such a field is shown to be semi-free. We also show
that the function field of a smooth projective curve over a large field has
semi-free absolute Galois group. In the first edition of this paper it was
shown that these groups are quasi-free, which is weaker.
