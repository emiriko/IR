In Bounded Model Checking both the system model and the checked property are
translated into a Boolean formula to be analyzed by a SAT-solver. We introduce
a new encoding technique which is particularly optimized for managing
quantitative future and past metric temporal operators, typically found in
properties of hard real time systems. The encoding is simple and intuitive in
principle, but it is made more complex by the presence, typical of the Bounded
Model Checking technique, of backward and forward loops used to represent an
ultimately periodic infinite domain by a finite structure. We report and
comment on the new encoding technique and on an extensive set of experiments
carried out to assess its feasibility and effectiveness.
