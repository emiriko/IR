Quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic vacuum are investigated in a
half-space bounded by a perfectly reflecting plate by introducing a probe
described by a charged wave-packet distribution in time-direction. The
wave-packet distribution of the probe enables one to investigate the smearing
effect upon the measured vacuum fluctuations caused by the quantum nature of
the probe particle. It is shown that the wave-packet spread of the probe
particle significantly influences the measured velocity dispersion of the
probe. In particular, the asymptotic late-time behavior of its $z$-component, $
< \D v_{z}^{2}>$, for the wave-packet case is quite different from the test
point-particle case ($z$ is the coordinate normal to the plate). The result for
the wave-packet is $<\D v_{z}^{2} > \sim 1/\t^2$ in the late time ($\t$ is the
measuring time), in stead of the reported late-time behavior $<\D v_{z}^{2} >
\sim 1/z^2$ for a point-particle probe. This result can be quite significant
for further investigations on the measurement of vacuum fluctuations.
