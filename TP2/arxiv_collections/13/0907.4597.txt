The ATLAS experiment took its first beam data in September 2008 and is
actively preparing for the planned start of LHC collision data-taking in 2009.
This preparation includes hardware and software commissioning, as well as
calibration and cosmic data analysis. The status and performance of the ATLAS
detector will be discussed, with a view towards the Pb+Pb run expected in 2010.
