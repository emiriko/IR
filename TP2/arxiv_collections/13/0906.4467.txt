We have used first-principles density-functional-theory methods with a
random-structure-searching technique to determine the structure of the
previously unidentified post-cotunnite phase of TeO2. Our calculations indicate
a transition from the cotunnite to post-cotunnite phase at 130 GPa. The
predicted post-cotunnite structure has P2_1/m space group symmetry and its
calculated x-ray diffraction pattern is in good agreement with the available
experimental data. We find that the cotunnite phase re-enters at about 260 GPa.
