We present a novel imaging system for ultracold quantum gases in expansion.
After release from a confining potential, atoms fall through a sheet of
resonant excitation laser light and the emitted fluorescence photons are imaged
onto an amplified CCD camera using a high numerical aperture optical system.
The imaging system reaches an extraordinary dynamic range, not attainable with
conventional absorption imaging. We demonstrate single-atom detection for
dilute atomic clouds with high efficiency where at the same time dense
Bose-Einstein condensates can be imaged without saturation or distortion. The
spatial resolution can reach the sampling limit as given by the 8 \mu m pixel
size in object space. Pulsed operation of the detector allows for slice images,
a first step toward a 3D tomography of the measured object. The scheme can
easily be implemented for any atomic species and all optical components are
situated outside the vacuum system. As a first application we perform
thermometry on rubidium Bose-Einstein condensates created on an atom chip.
