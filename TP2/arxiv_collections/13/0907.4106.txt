Most models for predicting the acoustic response of perforated panels are
based on the assumption that there is no interactions between the holes. The
common way of taking into account the perforates effects is the use of Fok's
functions. The few papers that deal with these effects study the case of low
sound pressure levels. This paper investigates the Holes Interaction Effects
(HIE) of perforated and micro-perforated panels when submitted to high sound
pressure levels. Analysis of the data yields to the fact that even with HIE,
the nonlinear reactance dependency with velocity is very slight. The HIE can
provide good absorption of the perforated panel backed by an air cavity at low
and high sound pressure levels if the holes positions are well configured.
Perforated panels of holes diameters less than 2 millimeters were built out of
steel with different interstices (distance between two adjacent holes) and
tested. Experimental results (performed with an impedance tube) in the cases of
interaction are done and compared with the exact cases of no interactions. The
results can be used for designing optimal perforated panels for ducts silencers
for instance.
