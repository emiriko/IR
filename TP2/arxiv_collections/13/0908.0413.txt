A particular framework for Quantum Gravity is the Doubly Special Relativity
(DSR) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale, the Planck
energy. Our aim in this paper is to study the effects of this energy upper
bound in relativistic thermodynamics. We have explicitly computed the modified
equation of state for an ideal fluid in the DSR framework. In deriving our
result we exploited the scheme of treating DSR as a non-linear representation
of the Lorentz group in Special Relativity.
