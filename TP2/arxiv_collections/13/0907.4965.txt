We calculated the glassy response of solid He-4 to torsional oscillations
assuming a phenomenological glass model. Making only a few assumptions about
the distribution of glassy relaxation times in a small subsystem of otherwise
rigid solid He-4, we can account for the magnitude of the observed period shift
and concomitant dissipation peak in several torsion oscillator experiments. The
implications of the glass model for solid He-4 are threefold: (1) The dynamics
of solid He-4 is governed by glassy relaxation processes. (2) The distribution
of relaxation times varies significantly between different torsion oscillator
experiments. (3) The mechanical response of a torsion oscillator does not
require a supersolid component to account for the observed anomaly at low
temperatures, though we cannot rule out its existence.
