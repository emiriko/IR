We observe deterministic chaos in a simple network of electronic logic gates
that are not regulated by a clocking signal. The resulting power spectrum is
ultra-wide-band, extending from dc to beyond 2 GHz. The observed behavior is
reproduced qualitatively using an autonomously updating Boolean model with
signal propagation times that depend on the recent history of the gates and
filtering of pulses of short duration, whose presence is confirmed
experimentally. Electronic Boolean chaos may find application as an
ultra-wide-band source of radio waves
