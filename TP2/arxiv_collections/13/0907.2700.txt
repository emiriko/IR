The electronic structure of lanthanide and actinide compounds is often
characterized by orbital ordering of localized $f$-electrons.
Density-functional theory (DFT) studies of such systems using the currently
available LDA+$U$ method are plagued by significant orbital-dependent
self-interaction, leading to erroneous orbital ground states. An alternative
scheme that modifies the exchange, not Hartree, energy is proposed as a remedy.
We show that our LDA+$U$ approach reproduces the expected degeneracy of $f^1$
and $f^2$ states in free ions and the correct ground states in solid PrO$_2$.
We expect our method to be useful in studying compounds of $f$- and heavy-$d$
elements.
