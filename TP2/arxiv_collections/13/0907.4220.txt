Large-scale simulations have been performed in the current-driven
three-dimensional XY spin glass with resistively-shunted junction dynamics for
sample sizes up to $64^3$. It is observed that the linear resistivity at low
temperatures tends to zero, providing a strong evidence of a finite temperature
phase-coherence (i.e. spin-glass) transition. Dynamical scaling analysis
demonstrates that a perfect collapse of current-voltage data can be achieved.
The obtained critical exponents agree with those in equilibrium Monte Carlo
simulations, and are compatible with those observed in various experiments on
high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. It is suggested that the spin and the
chirality order simultaneously. A genuine continuous depinning transition is
found at zero temperature. For low temperature creep motion, critical exponents
are evaluated, and a non-Arrhenius creep motion is observed in the low
temperature ordered phase. It is proposed that the XY spin glass gives an
effective description of the transport properties in high-T$_c$ superconductors
with d-wave symmetry.
