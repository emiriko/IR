In the Axelrod's model of cultural dissemination, we consider mobility of
cultural agents through the introduction of a density of empty sites and the
possibility that agents in a dissimilar neighborhood can move to them if their
mean cultural similarity with the neighborhood is below some threshold. While
for low values of the density of empty sites the mobility enhances the
convergence to a global culture, for high enough values of it the dynamics can
lead to the coexistence of disconnected domains of different cultures. In this
regime, the increase of initial cultural diversity paradoxically increases the
convergence to a dominant culture. Further increase of diversity leads to
fragmentation of the dominant culture into domains, forever changing in shape
and number, as an effect of the never ending eroding activity of cultural
minorities.
