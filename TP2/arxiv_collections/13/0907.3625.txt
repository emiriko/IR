Combined spectrally and time resolved measurements provide information not
otherwise available if performed in either domain alone. We demonstrate a new
approach to Four Wave Mixing spectroscopy, where spectral selectivity is
achieved by phase matching filtering without a spectrometer, and the time
resolved signal is obtained within a single pulse and without mechanically
scanning any delays. We analyze the Degenerate Four Wave Mixing signal, and
show that a counter-rotating Feynman diagram not previously considered is
necessary in order to understand the measured frequency and time resolved
spectrograms.
