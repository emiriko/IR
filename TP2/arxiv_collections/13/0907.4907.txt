We seek explanation for the neurophysiological phenomenon of event related
desynchronization (ERD) by using models of diffusively coupled nonlinear
oscillators. We demonstrate that when the strength of the event is sufficient,
ERD is found to emerge and the accomplishment of a behavioral/functional task
is determined by the nature of the desynchronized state. We illustrate the
phenomenon for the case of limit cycle and chaotic systems. We numerically
demonstrate the occurrence of ERD and provide analytical explanation. We also
discuss possible applications of the observed phenomenon in real physical
systems other than the brain.
