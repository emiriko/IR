Future large ensembles of time delay lenses have the potential to provide
interesting cosmological constraints complementary to those of other methods.
In a flat universe with constant w including a Planck prior, LSST time delay
measurements for ~4,000 lenses should constrain the local Hubble constant h to
~0.007 (~1%), Omega_DE to ~0.005, and w to ~0.026 (all 1-sigma precisions).
Similar constraints could be obtained by a dedicated gravitational lens
observatory (OMEGA) which would obtain precise time delay and mass model
measurements for ~100 well-studied lenses. We compare these constraints (as
well as those for a general cosmology) to the "optimistic Stage IV" constraints
expected from weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and
cluster counts, as calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force. Time delays yield
a modest constraint on a time-varying w(z), with the best constraint on w(z) at
the "pivot redshift" of z ~ 0.31. Our Fisher matrix calculation is provided to
allow time delay constraints to be easily compared to and combined with
constraints from other experiments. We also show how cosmological constraining
power varies as a function of numbers of lenses, lens model uncertainty, time
delay precision, redshift precision, and the ratio of four-image to two-image
lenses.
