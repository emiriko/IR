Wave-function Monte Carlo methods are an important tool for simulating
quantum systems, but the standard method cannot be used to simulate decoherence
in continuously measured systems. Here we present a new Monte Carlo method for
such systems. This was used to perform the simulations of a continuously
measured nano-resonator in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 057208 (2009)].
