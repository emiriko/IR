Group theory arguments have been invoked to argue that odd parity order
parameters cannot have line nodes in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. In
this paper we show that these arguments do not hold for certain non-symmorphic
superconductors. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the underlying crystal
has a twofold screw axis, half of the odd parity representations vanish on the
Brillouin zone face perpendicular to this axis. Many unconventional
superconductors have non-symmorphic space groups, and we discuss implications
for several materials, including UPt3, UBe13, Li2Pt3B and Na4Ir3O8.
