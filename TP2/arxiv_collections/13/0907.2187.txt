Sequence alignment is a tool in bioinformatics that is used to find
homological relationships in large molecular databases. It can be mapped on the
physical model of directed polymers in random media. We consider the
finite-temperature version of local sequence alignment for proteins and study
the transition between the linear phase and the biologically relevant
logarithmic phase, where the free-energy grows linearly or logarithmically with
the sequence length. By means of numerical simulations and finite-size scaling
analysis we determine the phase diagram in the plane that is spanned by the gap
costs and the temperature. We use the most frequently used parameter set for
protein alignment. The critical exponents that describe the parameter driven
transition are found to be explicitly temperature dependent.
  Furthermore, we study the shape of the (free-) energy distribution close to
the transition by rare-event simulations down to probabilities of the order
$10^{-64}$. It is well known that, in the logarithmic region, the optimal score
distribution (T=0) is described by a modified Gumbel distribution. We confirm
that this also applies for the free-energy distribution ($T>0$). However, in
the linear phase, the distribution crosses over to a modified Gaussian
distribution.
