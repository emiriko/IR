The spin density wave (SDW) state of the uniform electron gas is investigated
in the exact exchange approximation of noncollinear spin density functional
theory (DFT). Unlike in Hartree-Fock theory, where the uniform paramagnetic
state of the electron gas is unstable against formation of the spin density
wave for all densities, in exact-exchange spin-DFT this instability occurs only
for densities lower than a critical value. It is also shown that, although in a
suitable density range it is possible to find a non-interacting SDW ground
state Slater determinant with energy lower than the corresponding paramagnetic
state, this Slater determinant is not a self-consistent solution of the
Optimized Effective Potential (OEP) integral equations of noncollinear
spin-DFT. A selfconsistent solution of the OEP equations which gives an even
lower energy can be found using an excited-state Slater determinant where only
orbitals with single-particle energies in the lower of two bands are occupied
while orbitals in the second band remain unoccupied even if their energies are
below the Fermi energy.
