Motivated by the on-going rotating cryostat experiments in ISSP, Univ. of
Tokyo, we explore the textures and vortices in superfluid 3He-A phase confined
in narrow cylinders, whose radii are R=50mum and 115mum. The calculations are
based on the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework, which fully takes into account the
orbital (l-vector) and spin (d-vector) degrees of freedom for chiral p-wave
pairing superfluid. The GL free energy functional is solved numerically by
using best known GL parameters appropriate for the actual experimental
situations at P=3.2MPa and H=21.6mT. We identify the ground state l-vector
configuration as radial disgyration (RD) texture with the polar core both at
rest and low rotations and associated d-vector textures for both narrow
cylinder systems under high magnetic fields. The RD which has a singularity at
center, changes into Mermin-Ho texture above the critical rotation speed which
is determined precisely, providing an experimental check for own proposal.
