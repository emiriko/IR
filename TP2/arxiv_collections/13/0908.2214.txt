The phase diffusion in a self-sustained oscillator, which produces
oscillator's spectral linewidth, is inherently governed by a nonlinear Langevin
equation. Over past 40 years, the equation has been treated with linear
approximation, rendering the nonlinearity's effects unknown. Here we solve the
nonlinear Langevin equation using the perturbation method borrowed from quantum
mechanics, and reveal the physics of the nonlinearity: slower phase diffusion
(linewidth narrowing) and a surprising oscillation frequency shift that
formally corresponds to the Lamb shift in quantum electrodynamics.
