MAGIC-II is the second imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope of the MAGIC
observatory, which has recently been inaugurated on Canary island of La Palma.
We are currently developing a new camera based on clusters of hybrid photon
detectors (HPD) for the upgrade of MAGIC-II. The photon detectors feature a
GaAsP photocathode and an avalanche diode as electron bombarded anodes with
internal gain, and were supplied by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (R9792U-40). The
HPD camera with high quantum efficiency will increase the MAGIC-II sensitivity
and lower the energy threshold. The basic performance of the HPDs has been
measured and a prototype of an HPD cluster has been developed to be mounted on
MAGIC-II. Here we report on the status of the HPD cluster and the project of
eventually using HPD clusters in the central area of the MAGIC-II camera.
