We have calculated the decay amplitude for the process $K_{S}$ $\to$ $\gamma
\gamma$ at one loop order in chiral perturbation theory. As a new improvement
we have included the weak mass term which is only relevant for processes with
external fields in the final state. This term was ignored in earlier
publications for this decay. We find that the inclusion of $G_{8}^{\prime}$
brings the theoretical decay rate into a good agreement with experiment.
