First we investigate the possibility of detecting solar antineutrinos with
the KamLAND experiment. Then we analyze the first Borexino data release to
constrain the neutrino magnetic moment. Finally we investigate the resonant
spin flavour conversion of solar neutrinos to sterile ones, a mechanism which
is added to the well known LMA one. In this last condition, we show that the
data from all solar neutrino experiments except Borexino exhibit a clear
preference for a sizable magnetic field. We argue that the solar neutrino
experiments are capable of tracing the possible modulation of the solar
magnetic field. In this way Borexino alone may play an essential role although
experimental redundancy from other experiments will be most important.
