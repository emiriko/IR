We present an efficient expression for the analytic continuation to arbitrary
complex frequencies of the complex optical and AC conductivity of a homogeneous
superconductor with arbitrary mean free path. Knowledge of this quantity is
fundamental in the calculation of thermodynamic potentials and dispersion
energies involving type-I superconducting bodies. When considered for imaginary
frequencies, our formula evaluates faster than previous schemes involving
Kramers--Kronig transforms. A number of applications illustrates its
efficiency: a simplified low-frequency expansion of the conductivity, the
electromagnetic bulk self-energy due to longitudinal plasma oscillations, and
the Casimir free energy of a superconducting cavity.
