We consider d=2 Ising strip with surface fields acting on boundary spins.
Using the properties of the transfer matrix spectrum we identify two
pseudotransition temperatures and show that they satisfy similar scaling
relations as expected for real transition temperatures in strips with d>2. The
solvation force between the boundaries of the strip is analysed as a function
of temperature, surface fields and the width of the strip. For large widths the
solvation force can be described by scaling functions in three different
regimes: in the vicinity of the critical wetting temperature of 2D
semi-infinite system, in the vicinity of the bulk critical temperature, and in
the regime of weak surface fields where the critical wetting temperature tends
towards the bulk critical temperature. The properties of the relevant scaling
functions are discussed.
