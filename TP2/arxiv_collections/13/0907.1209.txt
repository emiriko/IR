In this paper we present the time-dependent generalization of an 'ordinary'
autonomous human musculo-skeletal biomechanics. We start with the configuration
manifold of human body, given as a set of its all active degrees of freedom
(DOF). This is a Riemannian manifold with a material metric tensor given by the
total mass-inertia matrix of the human body segments. This is the base manifold
for standard autonomous biomechanics. To make its time-dependent
generalization, we need to extend it with a real time axis. On this extended
configuration space we develop time-dependent biomechanical Lagrangian
dynamics, using derived jet spaces of velocities and accelerations, as well as
the underlying geometric evolution of the mass-inertia matrix.
