We derive two general criteria that can be used to constrain the initial time
of the onset of 2nd-order conformal viscous hydrodynamics in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. We show this explicitly for 0+1 dimensional viscous
hydrodynamics and discuss how to extend the constraint to higher dimensions.
