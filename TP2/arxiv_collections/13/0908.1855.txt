We study an evolutionary spatial prisoner's dilemma game where the fitness of
the players is determined by both the payoffs from the current interaction and
their history. We consider the situation where the selection timescale is
slower than the interaction timescale. This is done by implementing
probabilistic reproduction on an individual level. We observe that both too
fast and too slow reproduction rates hamper the emergence of cooperation. In
other words, there exists an intermediate selection timescale that maximizes
cooperation. Another factor we find to promote cooperation is a diversity of
reproduction timescales.
