Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT)
ensemble have been carried out to study the dependence of the lattice parameter
of 3C-SiC upon isotope mass. This computational method allows a quantitative
and nonperturbative study of such anharmonic effect. Atomic nuclei were treated
as quantum particles interacting via a tight-binding-type potential. At 300 K,
the difference Delta a between lattice parameters of 3C-SiC crystals with 12C
and 13C amounts to 2.1 x 10^{-4} A. The effect due to Si isotopes is smaller,
and amounts to 3.5 x 10^{-5} A when replacing 28Si by 29Si. Results of the PIMD
simulations are interpreted in terms of a quasiharmonic approximation for the
lattice vibrations.
