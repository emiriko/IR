We examine zero temperature hysteresis in random field XY and Heisenberg
models in the zero frequency limit of a cyclic driving field. Exact expressions
for hysteresis loops are obtained in the mean field approximation. These show
rather unusual features. We also perform simulations of the two models on a
simple cubic lattice and compare them with the predictions of the mean field
theory.
