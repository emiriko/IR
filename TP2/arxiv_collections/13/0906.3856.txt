Periodic multilayers of various periods were prepared according to an
algorithm proposed by the authors. The reflectivity properties of these systems
were investigated using neutron reflectometry.The obtained experimental results
were compared with the theoretical expectations. In first approximation, the
results proved the main features of the theoretical predictions. These
promising results initiate further research of such systems.
