The electromagnetic dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the neutral and
charged pions are calculated in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Our results
agree with the recent experimental analysis of these quantities based on
Dispersion Sum Rules. Comparison is made with the results from the Chiral
Perturbation Theory.
