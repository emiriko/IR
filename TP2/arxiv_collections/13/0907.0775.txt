We present an analytic method of assessing the typical performance of
low-density parity-check codes on finite-state Markov channels. We show that
this problem is similar to a spin-glass model on a `small-world' lattice. We
apply our methodology to binary-symmetric and binary-asymmetric channels and we
provide the critical noise levels for different degrees of channel symmetry.
