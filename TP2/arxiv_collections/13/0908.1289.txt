Glozman has proposed that highly excited mesons and baryons fall into parity
doublets, and that the f4(2050) on the leading Regge trajectory should have a
nearly degenerate J^{PC} = 4^{-+} partner. A re-analysis of Crystal Barrel data
does not support this idea. A likely explanation is that centrifugal barriers
on the leading trajectory allow formation of the L=J-1 states, but are too
strong to allow L=J states. Two new polarisation experiments have the potential
for major progress in meson spectroscopy.
