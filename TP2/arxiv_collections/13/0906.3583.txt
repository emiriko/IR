Using the Suzaku X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, we performed a 130 ks
observation of an extended X-ray emission, which was shown by ROSAT and Chandra
observations to apparently associate with the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The
obtained $0.5-6$ keV spectrum was successfully fitted with a redshifted thin
thermal plasma emission model whose temperature and redshift are
$2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3} $keV (at the rest frame) and $0.34\pm0.02$, respectively.
Derived parameters, including the temperature, redshift, and luminosity,
indicate that the extended X-ray source is a background cluster of galaxies,
and its projected location falls, by chance, on the direction of the proper
motion of 47 Tucanae.
