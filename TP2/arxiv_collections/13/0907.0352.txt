The photon is a very interesting object for QCD studies since it has both a
pointlike coupling to quarks, which yields a perturbative part of photon's wave
function, and a non-perturbative coupling related to the magnetic
susceptibility of the QCD vacuum and which builds its chiral-odd twist-2
distribution amplitude. The first feature allows us to compute the photon
anomalous generalized parton distributions (GPD) and the diphoton generalized
distribution amplitudes. The second feature allows us to use a transverse spin
asymmetry to probe the chiral odd distribution amplitude of the photon.
