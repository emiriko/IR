We study the thermal Casimir effect between two thick slabs composed of
plane-parallel layers of random dielectric materials interacting across an
intervening homogeneous dielectric. It is found that the effective interaction
at long distances is self averaging and its value is given by a that between
non-random media with the effective dielectric tensor of the corresponding
random media. The behavior at short distances becomes random (sample dependent)
and is dominated by the local values of the dielectric constants proximal to
each other across the homogeneous slab. These results are extended to the
regime of intermediate slab separations by using perturbation theory for weak
disorder and also by extensive numerical simulations for a number of systems
where the dielectric function has a log-normal distribution.
