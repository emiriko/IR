In this paper we report calculations of the relativistic corrections to
transition frequencies (q factors) of Yb II for the transitions from the
odd-parity states to the metastable state $4f^{13}6s^2 ^2F_{7/2}^o$. These
transitions are of particular interest experimentally since they possess some
of the largest q factors calculated to date and the $^2F_{7/2}^o$ state can be
prepared with high efficiency. This makes Yb II a very attractive candidate for
the laboratory search for variation of the fine-structure constant alpha.
