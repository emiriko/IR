Numerous experimental anomalies hint at the existence of a dark matter (DM)
multiplet chi_i with small mass splittings. We survey the simplest such models
which arise from DM in the low representations of a new SU(2) gauge symmetry,
whose gauge bosons have a small mass mu < 1 GeV. We identify preferred
parameters M_chi ~ 1 TeV, mu ~ 100 MeV, alpha_g ~ 0.04 and the chi chi -> 4e
annihilation channel, for explaining PAMELA, Fermi, and INTEGRAL/SPI lepton
excesses, while remaining consistent with constraints from relic density,
diffuse gamma rays and the CMB. This consistency is strengthened if DM
annihilations occur mainly in subhalos, while excitations (relevant to the
excited DM proposal to explain the 511 keV excess) occur in the galactic center
(GC), due to higher velocity dispersions in the GC, induced by baryons. We
derive new constraints and predictions which are generic to these models.
Notably, decays of excited DM states chi' -> chi gamma arise at one loop and
could provide a new signal for INTEGRAL/SPI; big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
constraints on the density of dark SU(2) gauge bosons imply a lower bound on
the mixing parameter epsilon between the SU(2) gauge bosons and photon. These
considerations rule out the possibility of the gauge bosons that decay into
e^+e^- being long-lived. We study in detail models of doublet, triplet and
quintuplet DM, showing that both normal and inverted mass hierarchies can
occur, with mass splittings that can be parametrically smaller, e.g., O(100)
keV, than the generic MeV scale of splittings. A systematic treatment of Z_2
symmetry which insures the stability of the intermediate DM state is given for
cases with inverted mass hierarchy, of interest for boosting the 511 keV signal
from the excited dark matter mechanism.
