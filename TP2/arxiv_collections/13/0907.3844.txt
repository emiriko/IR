We present the results of an in-depth study of the long-period X-ray pulsar
GX 301-2. Using archival data of INTEGRAL, RXTE ASM, and CGRO BATSE, we study
the spectral and timing properties of the source. Comparison of our timing
results with previously published work reveals a secular decay of the orbital
period at a rate of \simeq -3.25 \times 10^{-5} d yr^{-1}, which is an order of
magnitude faster than for other known systems. We argue that this is probably
result either of the apsidal motion or of gravitational coupling of the matter
lost by the optical companion with the neutron star, although current
observations do not allow us to distinguish between those possibilities. We
also propose a model to explain the observed long pulse period. We find that a
very strong magnetic field B \sim 10^{14} G can explain the observed pulse
period in the framework of existing models for torques affecting the neutron
star. We show that the apparent contradiction with the magnetic field strength
B_{CRSF} \sim 4 \times 10^{12} G derived from the observed cyclotron line
position may be resolved if the line formation region resides in a tall
accretion column of height \sim 2.5 - 3 R_{NS}. The color temperature measured
from the spectrum suggests that such a column may indeed be present, and our
estimates show that its height is sufficient to explain the observed cyclotron
line position.
