Deep multicolour surveys are the main tool to explore the formation and
evolution of the faint galaxies which are beyond the spectroscopic limit with
the present technology. The photometric properties of these faint galaxies are
usually compared with current renditions of semianalytical models to provide
constraints on the fundamental physical processes involved in galaxy formation
and evolution, namely the mass assembly and the star formation. Galaxy counts
over large sky areas in the near-UV band are important because they are
difficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-UV instrumentation, even
at 8m class telescopes. A large instrumental field of view helps in minimizing
the biases due to the cosmic variance. We have obtained deep images in the
360nm U band provided by the blue channel of the Large Binocular Camera at the
prime focus of the Large Binocular Telescope. We have derived over an area of
~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to U=27 in the Vega system
(corresponding to U=27.86 in the AB system) at a completeness level of 30%
reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. The shape
of the galaxy counts in the U band can be described by a double power-law, the
bright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparable
or greater areas. The slope bends over significantly at U>23.5 ensuring the
convergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the EBL in the
near-UV band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limits
derived for this band. We have jointly compared our near-UV and K band counts
collected from the literature with few selected hierarchical CDM models
emphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formation
and evolution.
