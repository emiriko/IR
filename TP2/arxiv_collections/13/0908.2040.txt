Temperature dependencies of the impurity magnetic susceptibility, entropy,
and heat capacity have been obtained by the method of numerical renormalization
group and exact diagonalization for the Kondo model with peaks in the electron
density of states near the Fermi energy (in particular, with logarithmic Van
Hove singularities). It is shown that these quantities can be {\it negative}. A
new effect has been predicted (which, in principle, can be observed
experimentally), namely, the decrease in the magnetic susceptibility and heat
capacity of a nonmagnetic sample upon the addition of magnetic impurities into
it.
