We propose a theory of combinatorially explicit Schubert polynomials which
represent the Schubert classes in the Borel presentation of the cohomology ring
of orthogonal flag varieties. We use these polynomials to describe the
arithmetic Schubert calculus on these spaces. We also give a method to compute
the natural arithmetic intersection numbers which arise, and prove that they
are all rational numbers.
