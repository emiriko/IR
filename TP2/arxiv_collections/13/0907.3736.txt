We compute the entropy of antiferromagnetic quantum spin-s chains in an
external magnetic field using exact diagonalization and Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The magnetocaloric effect, i.e., temperature variations during
adiabatic field changes, can be derived from the isentropes. First, we focus on
the example of the spin-s=1 chain and show that one can cool by closing the
Haldane gap with a magnetic field. We then move to quantum spin-s chains and
demonstrate linear scaling with $s$ close to the saturation field. In passing,
we propose a new method to compute many low-lying excited states using the
Lanczos recursion.
