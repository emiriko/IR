Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is a promising tool for
quantitative study of properties of the dense medium produced at RHIC.
Measurements of d+Au collisions are important to disentangle initial state
nuclear effects from medium-induced $k_\mathrm{T}$ broadening and jet
quenching. We report measurements of mid-rapidity ($|\eta_{jet}| < 0.4|$)
di-jet correlations in d+Au using high-statistics run 8 RHIC data at
$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$.
