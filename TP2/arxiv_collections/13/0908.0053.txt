Context: Monitoring of pulse period variations in accreting binary pulsars is
an important tool to study the interaction between the magnetosphere of the
neutron star and the accretion disk. While the X-ray flux of the brightest
X-ray pulsars have been successfully monitored over many years (e.g. with
RXTE/ASM, CGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT), the possibility to monitor their pulse timing
properties continuously has so far been very limited. Aims: In our work we show
that the Swift/BAT observations can be used to monitor coherent pulsations of
bright X-ray sources and use the Swift archival data to study one of the most
enigmatic X-ray pulsars, Hercules X-1. A quasi-continuous monitoring of the
pulse period and the pulse period derivative of an X-ray pulsar, here Her X-1,
is achieved over a long time (<~ 4 yrs). We compare our observational results
with predictions of accretion theory and use them to test different aspects of
the physical model of the system. Methods: In our analysis we use the data
accumulated with Swift/BAT starting from the beginning of 2005 (shortly after
launch) until the present time. To search for pulsations and for their
subsequent analysis we used the count rate measured by the BAT detector in the
entire field of view. Results: The slope of the correlation between the locally
determined spin-up rate and the X-ray luminosity is measured for Her X-1 and
found to be in agreement with predictions of basic accretion torque theory. The
observed behaviour of the pulse period together with the previously measured
secular decrease of the system's orbital period is discussed in the frame of a
model assuming ejection of matter close to the inner boundary of the accretion
disk.
