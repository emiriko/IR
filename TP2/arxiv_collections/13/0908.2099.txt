Spin effects in a normal two-dimensional (2D) electron gas in lateral contact
with a 2D region with spin-orbit interaction are studied. The peculiarity of
this system is the presence of spin-dependent scattering of electrons from the
interface. This results in an equilibrium edge spin current and nontrivial spin
responses to a particle current. We investigate the spatial distribution of the
spin currents and spin density under non-equilibrium conditions caused by a
ballistic electron current flowing normal or parallel to the interface. The
parallel electron current is found to generate the spin density near the
interface and to change the edge spin current. The perpendicular electron
current changes the edge spin current proportionally to the electron current
and produces a bulk spin current penetrating deep into the normal region. This
spin current has two components, one of which is directed normal to the
interface and polarized parallel to it, and the second is parallel to the
interface and is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the contact line. Both
spin currents have a high degree of polarization ($\sim 40-60%$).
