We propose a computational method to solve optimal swimming problems, based
on the boundary integral formulation of the hydrodynamic interaction between
swimmer and surrounding fluid and direct constrained minimization of the energy
consumed by the swimmer.
  We apply our method to axisymmetric model examples. We consider a classical
model swimmer (the three-sphere swimmer of Golestanian et al.) as well as a
novel axisymmetric swimmer inspired by the observation of biological
micro-organisms.
