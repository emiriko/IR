Transformations involving only local operations assisted with classical
communication are investigated for multipartite entangled pure states having
tensor rank 2. All necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of
deterministically converting truly multipartite, rank-2 states into each other
are given. Furthermore, a chain of local operations that successfully achieves
the transformation has been identified for all allowed transformations. The
identified chains have two nice features: (1) each party needs to carry out at
most one local operation and (2) all of these local operations are also
deterministic transformations by themselves. Finally, it is found that there
are disjoint classes of states, all of which can be identified by a single real
parameter, which remain invariant under deterministic transformations.
