We present a scheme of XOR/XNOR logic gate, based on non phase-matched
noncollinear second harmonic generation from a medium of suitable crystalline
symmetry, Gallium nitride. The polarization of the noncollinear generated beam
is a function of the polarization of both pump beams, thus we experimentally
investigated all possible polarization combinations, evidencing that only some
of them are allowed and that the nonlinear interaction of optical signals
behaves as a polarization based XOR. The experimental results show the
peculiarity of the nonlinear optical response associated with noncollinear
excitation, and are explained using the expression for the effective second
order optical nonlinearity in noncollinear scheme.
