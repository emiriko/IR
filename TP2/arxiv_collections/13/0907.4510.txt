We discuss our recent observation of an atom-dimer Efimov resonance in an
ultracold mixture of Cs atoms and Cs_2 Feshbach molecules [Nature Phys. 5, 227
(2009)]. We review our experimental procedure and present additional data
involving a non-universal g-wave dimer state, to contrast our previous results
on the universal s-wave dimer. We resolve a seeming discrepancy when
quantitatively comparing our experimental findings with theoretical results
from effective field theory.
