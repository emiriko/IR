We consider identical copies of spin glasses in finite dimension coupled at
the boundaries. This allows to identify the spin glass analogous of twisted
boundary conditions in ferromagnetic system and leads to the definition of an
interface free-energy that is positively defined and that should scale with a
positive power of the system size in the spin glass phase. In this note we
study the behavior of the interface at the spin glass critical temperature
$T_c$ within mean field theory. We show that the leading scaling of the
interface free-energy does not depend on replica symmetry breaking, and can be
obtained by simple scaling arguments using a cubic theory for critical spin
glasses.
