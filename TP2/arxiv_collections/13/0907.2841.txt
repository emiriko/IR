Using muffin-tin orbital (MTO) based NMTO-downfolding procedure within the
framework of local density approximation, we construct the Wannier orbitals for
the $t_{2g}$ manifold of bands in V2O3 in the paramagnetic phase. The real
space representation of the one-electron Hamiltonian in the constructed Wannier
function basis shows that, contrary to the popular belief, the in-plane hopping
interactions are as important as the vertical pair hopping. Following the
language of Di Matteo {\it et.al.} [Phys. Rev. B 65, 054413 (2002)], this
implies, the problem of V2O3 falls in the atomic regime rather than in the
molecular regime. We have also repeated our construction procedure in the low
temperature monoclinic phase, for which the changes in hopping interactions are
found not to be dramatic.
