Assuming that soft X-ray sources in symbiotic stars result from strong
thermonuclear runaways, and supersoft X-ray sources from weak thermonuclear
runaways or steady hydrogen burning symbiotic stars, we investigate the
Galactic soft and supersoft X-ray sources in symbiotic stars by means of
population synthesis. The Galactic occurrence rates of soft X-ray sources and
supersoft X-ray sources are from $\sim$ 2 to 20 $\rm yr^{-1}$, and $\sim$ 2 to
17 $\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively. The numbers of X-ray sources in symbiotic stars
range from 2390 to 6120. We simulate the distribution of X-ray sources over
orbital periods, masses and mass-accretion rates of white dwarfs. The agreement
with observations is reasonable.
