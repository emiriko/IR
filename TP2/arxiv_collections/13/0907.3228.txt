Statistical mechanics has proven to be able to capture the fundamental rules
underlying phenomena of social aggregation and opinion dynamics, well studied
in disciplines like sociology and psychology. This approach is based on the
underlying paradigm that the interesting dynamics of multi-agent systems emerge
from the correct definition of few parameters governing the evolution of each
individual. Into this context, we propose a new model of opinion dynamics based
on the psychological construct named "cognitive dissonance". Our system is made
of interacting individuals, the agents, each bearing only two dynamical
variables (respectively "opinion" and "affinity") self-consistently adjusted
during time evolution. We also define two special classes of interacting
entities, both acting for a peace mediation process but via different course of
action: "diplomats" and "auctoritates". The behaviour of the system with and
without peace mediators (PMs) is investigated and discussed with reference to
corresponding psychological and social implications.
