The power available to microscopic robots (nanorobots) that oxidize
bloodstream glucose while aggregated in circumferential rings on capillary
walls is evaluated with a numerical model using axial symmetry and
time-averaged release of oxygen from passing red blood cells. Robots about one
micron in size can produce up to several tens of picowatts, in steady-state, if
they fully use oxygen reaching their surface from the blood plasma. Robots with
pumps and tanks for onboard oxygen storage could collect oxygen to support
burst power demands two to three orders of magnitude larger. We evaluate
effects of oxygen depletion and local heating on surrounding tissue. These
results give the power constraints when robots rely entirely on ambient
available oxygen and identify aspects of the robot design significantly
affecting available power. More generally, our numerical model provides an
approach to evaluating robot design choices for nanomedicine treatments in and
near capillaries.
