The aim of this letter is to analyze the effect on decoherence of the
randomness of the coupling coefficients involved in the interaction
Hamiltonian. By studying the spin-bath model with computer simulations, we show
that such randomness greatly improves the "efficiency" of decoherence and,
then, its physical meaning deserves to be considered.
