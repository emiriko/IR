We report the detection of eclipses in GJ 3236, a bright (I = 11.6) very low
mass binary system with an orbital period of 0.77 days. Analysis of light- and
radial velocity curves of the system yielded component masses of 0.38 +/- 0.02
and 0.28 +/- 0.02 Msol. The central values for the stellar radii are larger
than the theoretical models predict for these masses, in agreement with the
results for existing eclipsing binaries, although the present 5% observational
uncertainties limit the significance of the larger radii to approximately 1
sigma. Degeneracies in the light curve models resulting from the unknown
configuration of surface spots on the components of GJ 3236 currently dominate
the uncertainties in the radii, and could be reduced by obtaining precise,
multi-band photometry covering the full orbital period. The system appears to
be tidally synchronized and shows signs of high activity levels as expected for
such a short orbital period, evidenced by strong Halpha emission lines in the
spectra of both components. These observations probe an important region of
mass-radius parameter space around the predicted transition to fully-convective
stellar interiors, where there are a limited number of precise measurements
available in the literature.
