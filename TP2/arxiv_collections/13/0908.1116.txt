The current SINR mechanism does not provide the base station (BS) with any
knowledge on the frequency selectivity of channel from mobile service
station(MSS). This knowledge is important since, contrary to the AWGN channel,
in a frequency selective channel there is no longer a 1 to 1 relation between
amount of increase in power and amount of improvement in effective SINR 1.
Furthermore, the relation is dependent on MCS level. This lack of knowledge in
the BS side results in larger fade margins, which translates directly to
reduction in capacity. In this paper we propose a enhanced algorithm on the
EESM model with weighted beta (\beta) that provides the BS with sufficient
knowledge on the channel-dependent relationship between power increase, MCS
change and improvement in effective SINR.
