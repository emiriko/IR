We discuss the support for the cooling of gas directly at the disk-halo
interface as a mechanism to continually fuel a galaxy. This may be an important
reservoir as there is not enough cold gas observed in galaxy halos and
simulations indicate the existing cold clouds will be rapidly destroyed as they
move through the surrounding halo medium. We show possible evidence for a net
infall of the WIM layer in the Milky Way, simulation results showing the
recooling of warm clouds at the disk-halo interface, and GALFA HI data of
small, cold HI clouds that could represent this recooling.
