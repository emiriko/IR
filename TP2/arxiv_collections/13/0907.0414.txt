We analyze the issue of ``particle motion'' in general relativity in a
systematic and rigorous way by considering a one-parameter family of metrics
corresponding to having a body (or black hole) that is ``scaled down'' to zero
size and mass in an appropriate manner. We prove that the limiting worldline of
such a one-parameter family must be a geodesic of the background metric and
obtain the leading order perturbative corrections, which include gravitational
self-force, spin force, and geodesic deviation effects. The status the
MiSaTaQuWa equation is explained as a candidate ``self-consistent perturbative
equation'' associated with our rigorous perturbative result
