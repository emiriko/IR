The sensitivity of molecular fingerprinting is dramatically improved when
placing the absorbing sample in a high-finesse optical cavity, thanks to the
large increase of the effective path-length. As demonstrated recently, when the
equidistant lines from a laser frequency comb are simultaneously injected into
the cavity over a large spectral range, multiple trace-gases may be identified
within a few milliseconds. Analyzing efficiently the light transmitted through
the cavity however still remains challenging. Here, a novel approach,
cavity-enhanced frequency comb Fourier transform spectroscopy, fully overcomes
this difficulty and measures ultrasensitive, broad-bandwidth, high-resolution
spectra within a few tens of $\mu$s. It could be implemented from the Terahertz
to the ultraviolet regions without any need for detector arrays. We recorded,
within 18 $\mu$s, spectra of the 1.0 $\mu$m overtone bands of ammonia spanning
20 nm with 4.5 GHz resolution and a noise-equivalent-absorption at
one-second-averaging per spectral element of 3 10^-12 cm^-1Hz^-1/2, thus
opening a route to time-resolved spectroscopy of rapidly-evolving
single-events.
