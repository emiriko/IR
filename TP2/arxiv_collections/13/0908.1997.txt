We present measurements of the electrical and thermal properties of new
arrays of bolometeric detectors that were fabricated as part of a program to
develop bolometers optimized for the low photon background of the EBEX
balloon-borne experiment. An array consists of 140 spider-web transition edge
sensor bolometers microfabricated on a 4" diameter silicon wafer. The designed
average thermal conductance of bolometers on a proto-type array is 32 pW/K, and
measurements are in good agreement with this value. The measurements are taken
with newly developed, digital frequency domain multiplexer SQUID readout
electronics.
