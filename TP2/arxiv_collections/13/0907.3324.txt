We construct the moduli spaces of tropical curves and tropical principally
polarized abelian varieties, working in the category of (what we call) stacky
fans. We define the tropical Torelli map between these two moduli spaces and we
study the fibers (tropical Torelli theorem) and the image of this map (tropical
Schottky problem). Finally we determine the image of the planar tropical curves
via the tropical Torelli map and we use it to give a positive answer to a
question raised by Namikawa on the compactified classical Torelli map.
