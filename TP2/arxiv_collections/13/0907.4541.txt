Multi-wavelength observations of an M 2.0 flare event on 2000 March 23 in
NOAA active region 8910 provide us a good chance to study the detailed
structure and dynamics of the magnetic reconnection region. In the process of
the flare, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) loops displayed two times of sideward
motions upon a loop-top hard X-ray source with average velocities of 75 and
25.6 km/s, respectively. We consider these two motions to be the observational
evidence of reconnection inflow, and find an X-shaped structure upon the
post-flare loops during the period of the second motion. Two separations of the
flare ribbons are associated with these two sideward motions, with average
velocities of 3.3 and 1.3 km/s, separately. Using the observation of
photospheric magnetic field, the velocities of the sideward motions and the
separations, we deduce the corresponding coronal magnetic field strength to be
about 13.2-15.2 G, and estimate the reconnection rates to be 0.05 and 0.02 for
these two magnetic reconnection processes, respectively. We also observe
motions of bright points upward and downward along the EUV loops with
velocities ranging from 45.4 to 556.7 km/s. A cloud of bright material flowing
outward from the loop-top hard X-ray source with an average velocity of 51 km/s
in the process of the flare may be accelerated by the tension force of the
newly reconnected magnetic field lines. All the observations can be explained
by schematic diagrams of magnetic reconnection.
