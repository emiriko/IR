We generalize Bowen-York black hole initial data to hyperboloidal constant
mean curvature slices which extend to future null infinity. We solve this
initial value problem numerically for several cases, including unequal mass
binary black holes with spins and boosts. The singularity at null infinity in
the Hamiltonian constraint associated with a constant mean curvature
hypersurface does not pose any particular difficulties. The inner boundaries of
our slices are minimal surfaces. Trumpet configurations are explored both
analytically and numerically.
