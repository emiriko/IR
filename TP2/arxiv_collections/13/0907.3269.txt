The kinetics of two (2D) and three (3D) dimensional diffusion-assisted
escaping of Brownian particles from a potential well in the presence of an
external force is analyzed in detail. The kinetics is studied within the
two-state model (TSM) proposed for processes in the absence of external force.
The generalized variant of this model, taking into account the force effect, is
proposed which is shown to be quite accurate for some shapes of the well both
for 2D and 3D processes. Within the generalized TSM simple expressions for the
well depopulation kinetics and, in particular, for the escape rate are
obtained. The effect of the force ($F$) is shown to manifest itself in the
escape rate dependence on the only parameter $\varphi = Fa/(2k_b T)$, where $a$
is the Onsager radius of the attractive part of the well $U(r)$, defined by the
relation $|U(a)| \approx k_b T$. The limiting behavior of this dependence in
the cases of weak and strong force is studied in detail both in 2D and 3D
processes. Some applications of obtained results to the analysis of experiments
are briefly discussed.
