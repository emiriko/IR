Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations spectra of
the quasi-two dimensional charge transfer salt
$\beta$"-(ET)$_4$(H$_3$O)[Fe(C$_2$O$_4$)$_3$]$\cdot$C$_6$H$_4$Cl$_2$ have been
investigated in pulsed magnetic fields up to 54 T. The data reveal three basic
frequencies F$_a$, F$_b$ and F$_{b - a}$, which can be interpreted on the basis
of three compensated closed orbits at low temperature. However a very weak
thermal damping of the Fourier component F$_b$, with the highest amplitude, is
evidenced for SdH spectra above about 6 K. As a result, magnetoresistance
oscillations are observed at temperatures higher than 30 K. This feature, which
is not observed for dHvA oscillations, is in line with quantum interference,
pointing to a Fermi surface reconstruction in this compound.
