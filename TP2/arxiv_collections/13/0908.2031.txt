We point out that the main results-the analytic expressions for the Groverian
Measure of Entanglement, in the above mentioned paper are erroneous. The
technical mistake of the paper is discussed. It is shown by an explicit example
that the formula for calculating the Groverian measure yields G(|\psi>) = 0 for
some entangled states.
