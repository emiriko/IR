We introduce and describe our newly developed code that simulates light
curves and radial velocity curves for arbitrary transiting exoplanets with a
satellite. The most important feature of the program is the calculation of
radial velocity curves and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in such systems. We
discuss the possibilities for detecting the exomoons taking the abilities of
Extremely Large Telescopes into account. We show that satellites may be
detected also by their RM effect in the future, probably using less accurate
measurements than promised by the current instrumental developments. Thus, RM
effect will be an important observational tool in the exploration of exomoons.
