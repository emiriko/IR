The strong electromagnetic fields of short duration associated with
relativistic heavy ions make a heavy-ion collider a unique tool to study
two-photon and photonuclear collisions.
  In this talk, we introduce the principles of photoproduction at hadron
colliders, review recent results from RHIC on meson and e$^+$e$^-$ production.
At RHIC, STAR has studied exclusive $\rho^{0}$ vector meson production and
$\rho^{0}$ production accompanied by electromagnetic dissociation of both
nuclei in collisions of AuAu at 62, 130 and 200 GeV. Recent results suggest the
validity of the Glauber calculations for the vector meson photoproduction and
incosistency of the model based on the parton saturation phenomenon. The
measurements are a lso sensitive to interference between production on the two
nuclei: either ion can be the photon emitter or the target. The level of
observed interference suggests that the final state wave function carries
information about all possible decays long after the decay occurs. We also
observe coherent photoproduction of a $\pi ^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ state
which may be associated with $\rho^{0*}$ (1450).
