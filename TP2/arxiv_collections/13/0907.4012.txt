We show that if a flavour-less vector meson remains bound after
deconfinement, and if its limiting velocity in the quark-gluon plasma is
subluminal, then this meson produces a distinct peak in the spectrum of thermal
photons emitted by the plasma. We also demonstrate that this effect is a
universal property of all strongly coupled, large-$\nc$ plasmas with a gravity
dual. For the $J/\Psi$ the corresponding peak lies between 3 and 5 GeV and
could be observed at the LHC.
