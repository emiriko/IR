The full Klein-Nishina cross section for the inverse Compton scattering
interactions of electrons implies a significant reduction of the electron
energy loss rate compared to the Thomson limit when the electron energy exceeds
the critical Klein-Nishina energy E_K = gamma_K * m_e c^2 = 0.27 m_e^2
c^2/(k_BT), where T denotes the temperature of the photon graybody
distribution. As a consequence the total radiative energy loss rate of single
electrons exhibits sudden drops in the overall energy loss rate ~ gamma ^2 -
dependence when the electron energy reaches the critical Klein-Nishina energy.
The strength of the drop is proportional to the energy density of the photon
radiation field. The diffuse galactic optical photon fields from stars of
spectral type B and G-K lead to critical Klein-Nishina energies of 40 and 161
GeV, respectively. Associated with the drop in the loss rate are sudden
increases (Klein-Nishina steps) in the equilibrium spectrum of cosmic ray
electrons. Because the radiative loss rate of electrons is the main ingredient
in any transport model of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, Klein-Nishina steps
will modify any calculated electron equilibrium spectrum irrespective of the
electron sources and spatial transport mode. To delineate most clearly the
consequences of the Klein-Nishina drops in the radiative loss rate, we chose as
illustrative example the simplest realistic model for cosmic ray electron
dynamics in the Galaxy, consisting of the competition of radiative losses and
secondary production by inelastic hadron-hadron collisions. We demonstrate that
the spectral structure in the FERMI and H.E.S.S. data is well described and
even the excess measured by ATIC might be explained by Klein-Nishina steps.
