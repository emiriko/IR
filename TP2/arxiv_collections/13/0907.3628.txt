We calculate the expected branching fraction of the second-class-current
decay tau --> pi eta' nu, motivated by a a recent experimental upper-limit
determination of this quantity. The largest contribution to the branching
fraction is due to the intermediate a0(980) scalar meson, assuming it is a
$\bar ud$ state. Smaller contributions arise from a0(1450), rho(770), and
rho(1450). Our calculated values are substantially below the experimental upper
limit, and are smaller still if the a0(980) is a four-quark state, as often
suggested. Thus, a precise measurement or tight upper limit has the potential
to determine the nature of the a0(980), as well as search for new scalar
interactions.
