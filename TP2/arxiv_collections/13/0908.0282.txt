We present the full three dimensionality of an electrostatically calculated
stability diagram for triple quantum dots. The stability diagram maps out the
favored charge configuration of the system as a function of potential shifts
due to gate voltages. For triple dots only a three dimensional visualization
allows for the complete identification of all its components. Those are most
notably the so called quadruple points where four electronic configurations are
degenerate, and quantum cellular automata (QCA) processes. The exact positions
of these features within the stability diagram are now revealed. Furthermore
the influence on transport is studied by comparing the model with a two path
triple quantum dot made with local anodic oxidation. The two path setup allows
to study the influence of the dots arrangement.
