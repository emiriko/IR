The problem of computing Craig Interpolants has recently received a lot of
interest. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient generation of
interpolants for some important fragments of first order logic, which are
amenable for effective decision procedures, called Satisfiability Modulo Theory
solvers.
  We make the following contributions.
  First, we provide interpolation procedures for several basic theories of
interest: the theories of linear arithmetic over the rationals, difference
logic over rationals and integers, and UTVPI over rationals and integers.
  Second, we define a novel approach to interpolate combinations of theories,
that applies to the Delayed Theory Combination approach.
  Efficiency is ensured by the fact that the proposed interpolation algorithms
extend state of the art algorithms for Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Our
experimental evaluation shows that the MathSAT SMT solver can produce
interpolants with minor overhead in search, and much more efficiently than
other competitor solvers.
