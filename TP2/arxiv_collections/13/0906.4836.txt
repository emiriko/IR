I discuss the concept of fractional exclusion statistics (FES) and I show
that in order to preserve the thermodynamic consistency of the formalism, the
exclusion statistics parameters should change if the species of particles in
the system are divided into subspecies. Using a simple and intuitive model I
deduce the general equations that have to be obeyed by the exlcusion statistics
parameters in any FES system.
