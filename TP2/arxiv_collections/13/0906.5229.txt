We theoretically study the excitation spectrum of confined macroscopic
optical lattices in the Mott-insulating limit. For large systems, a fast
numerical method is proposed to calculate the ground state filling and
excitation energies. We introduce many-particle on-site energies capturing
multi-band effects and discuss tunnelling on a perturbative level using an
effectively restricted Hilbert space. Results for small one-dimensional
lattices obtained by this method are in good agreement with the exact
multi-band diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. Spectral properties associated
with the formation of regions with constant filling, so-called Mott shells, are
investigated and interfaces between the shells with strong particle
fluctuations are characterized by gapless local excitations.
