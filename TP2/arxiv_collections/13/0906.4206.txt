In this article, we use the light-cone QCD sum rules to relate the
$\Lambda_b$ baryon light-cone distribution amplitudes to the Isgur-Wise
function $\xi(\omega)$ of the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c$ transition, and obtain
a simple relation. The numerical value of the Isgur-Wise function $\xi(\omega)$
is consistent with the prediction of the QCD sum rules.
