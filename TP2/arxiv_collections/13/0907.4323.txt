We consider the notion of improved and perfect actions within Regge calculus.
These actions are constructed in such a way that they - although being defined
on a triangulation - reproduce the continuum dynamics exactly, and therefore
capture the gauge symmetries of General Relativity. We construct the perfect
action in three dimensions with cosmological constant, and in four dimensions
for one simplex. We conclude with a discussion about Regge Calculus with curved
simplices, which arises naturally in this context.
