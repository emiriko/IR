Feedback control protocols can stabilize and enhance the operation of quantum
devices, however, unavoidable delays in the feedback loop adversely affect
their performance. We introduce a quantum control methodology, combining
open-loop control with quantum filtering, which is not constrained by feedback
delays. For the problems studied (rapid purification and rapid measurement) we
analytically derive lower bounds on the control performance that are comparable
with the best corresponding bounds for feedback protocols.
