We study the magnetization dynamics of a molecular magnet driven by static
and variable magnetic fields within a semiclassical treatment. The underling
analyzes is valid in a regime, when the energy is definitely lower than the
anisotropy barrier, but still a substantial number of states are excited. We
find the phase space to contain a separatrix line. Solutions far from it are
oscillatory whereas the separatrix solution is of a soliton type. States near
the separatrix are extremely sensitive to small perturbations, a fact which we
utilize for dynamically induced magnetization switching.
