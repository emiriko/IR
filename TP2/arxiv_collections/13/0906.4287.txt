The exact global energy conservation laws for the full-$f$ and $\delta f$
formulations of the nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic equations in general
magnetic geometry are presented. In both formulations, the relation between
polarization and magnetization effects in the gyrokinetic Poisson and
Amp\`{e}re equations and the quadratic ponderomotive gyrocenter Hamiltonian is
emphasized.
