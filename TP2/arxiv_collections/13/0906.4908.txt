We present multi-colour time-series CCD photometry of the solar-age galactic
open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). About 3600 frames spread over 28 nights were
obtained with the 1.5 m Russian-Turkish and 1.2 m Mercator telescopes.
High-precision observations of the close binary stars AH Cnc, EV Cnc, ES Cnc,
the $\delta$ Scuti type systems EX Cnc and EW Cnc, and some long-period
variables belonging to M67 are presented. Three full multi-colour light curves
of the overcontact binary AH Cnc were obtained during three observing seasons.
Likewise we gathered three light curves of EV Cnc, an EB-type binary, and two
light curves of ES Cnc, a blue straggler binary. Parts of the light change of
long-term variables S1024, S1040, S1045, S1063, S1242, and S1264 are obtained.
Period variation analysis of AH Cnc, EV Cnc, and ES Cnc were done using all
times of mid-eclipse available in the literature and those obtained in this
study. In addition, we analyzed multi-colour light curves of the close binaries
and also determined new frequencies for the $\delta$ Scuti systems. The
physical parameters of the close binary stars were determined with simultaneous
solutions of multi-colour light and radial velocity curves. Finally we
determined the distance of M67 as 857(33) pc via binary star parameters, which
is consistent with an independent method from earlier studies.
