We give improved constants for data dependent and variance sensitive
confidence bounds, called empirical Bernstein bounds, and extend these
inequalities to hold uniformly over classes of functionswhose growth function
is polynomial in the sample size n. The bounds lead us to consider sample
variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the
empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample
variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the
excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are
situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the
excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some
experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the
potential application of our results to sample compression schemes.
