Using the caustic method, we identify the member stars of five dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Milky Way, the smallest dark matter (DM)
dominated systems in the Universe. After our interloper rejection, we compute
line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles that are substantially smoother than
previous results. Moreover, two dSphs have line-of-sight velocity dispersions
20% smaller than previous calculations suggested. Our Jeans modelling confirms
that the DM content interior to 300pc is roughly constant with satellite
luminosity. Finally, if we assume that MOND provides the true law of gravity,
our identification of interlopers implies that four dSphs have mass-to-light
ratios in agreement with stellar population synthesis models, whereas Carina
still has a mass-to-light ratio a factor of two too large and remains a problem
for MOND.
