Nonadiabatic dynamical simulations were carried out to study cis-to-trans
isomerization of azobenzene under laser irradiation and/or external mechanical
loads. We used a semiclassical electron-radiation-ion dynamics method that is
able to describe the coevolution of the structural dynamics and the underlying
electronic dynamics in a real-time manner. It is found that azobenzene
photoisomerization occurs predominantly by an out-of-plane rotation mechanism
even under a nontrivial resisting force of several tens of piconewtons. We have
repeated the simulations systematically for a broad range of parameters for
laser pulses, but could not find any photoisomerization event by a previously
suggested in-plane inversion mechanism. The simulations found that the
photoisomerization process can be held back by an external resisting force of
90 - 200 pN depending on the frequency and intensity of the lasers. This study
also found that a pure mechanical isomerization is possible from the cis state
if the azobenzene molecule is stretched by an external force of 1250 -1650 pN.
Remarkably, the mechanical isomerization first proceeds through a mechanically
activated inversion, and then is diverted to an ultrafast downhill rotation
that accomplishes the isomerization. Implications of these findings to
azobenzene-based nanomechanical devices are discussed.
