We study the phase diagram of the standard pair approximation equations for
two different models in population dynamics, the
susceptible-infective-recovered-susceptible model of infection spread and a
predator-prey interaction model, on a network of homogeneous degree $k$. These
models have similar phase diagrams and represent two classes of systems for
which noisy oscillations, still largely unexplained, are observed in nature. We
show that for a certain range of the parameter $k$ both models exhibit an
oscillatory phase in a region of parameter space that corresponds to weak
driving. This oscillatory phase, however, disappears when $k$ is large. For
$k=3, 4$, we compare the phase diagram of the standard pair approximation
equations of both models with the results of simulations on regular random
graphs of the same degree. We show that for parameter values in the oscillatory
phase, and even for large system sizes, the simulations either die out or
exhibit damped oscillations, depending on the initial conditions. We discuss
this failure of the standard pair approximation model to capture even the
qualitative behavior of the simulations on large regular random graphs and the
relevance of the oscillatory phase in the pair approximation diagrams to
explain the cycling behavior found in real populations.
