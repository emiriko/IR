The frozen spin method can be effectively used for a high-precision
measurement of the tensor electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the
deuteron and other nuclei in storage rings. For the deuteron, this method would
provide the determination of the deuteron's polarizabilities with absolute
precision of order of $10^{-43}$ cm$^3$.
