The Raman shift, broadening, and relative Raman intensities of bilayer
graphene are computed as functions of the electron concentration. We include
dynamic effects for the phonon frequencies and we consider the gap induced in
the band structure of bilayer graphene by an external electric field. We show
that from the analysis of the Raman spectra of gated bilayer graphene it is
possible to quantitatively identify the amount of charges coming from the
atmosphere and from the substrate. These findings suggest that Raman
spectroscopy of bilayer graphene can be used to characterize the electrostatic
environment of few-layers graphene.
