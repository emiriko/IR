By combining optical spin injection techniques with transport spectroscopy
tools, we demonstrate a spin-photodetector allowing for the electrical
measurement and active filtering of conduction band electron spin at room
temperature in a non-magnetic GaAsN semiconductor structure. By switching the
polarization of the incident light from linear to circular, we observe a Giant
Spin-dependent Photoconductivity (GSP) reaching up to 40 % without the need of
an external magnetic field. We show that the GSP is due to a very efficient
spin filtering effect of conduction band electrons on Nitrogen-induced Ga
self-interstitial deep paramagnetic centers.
