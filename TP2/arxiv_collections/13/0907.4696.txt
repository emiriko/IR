We report new quarkonia measurements necessary to understand production
mechanisms and cold nuclear matter effects in the yields observed at RHIC
energy. Results obtained in p+p collisions collected during the 2006 RHIC Run
include J/psi, Psi' and Upsilon differential cross sections as well as J/psi
polarization. Revisited interpretations of the published J/psi nuclear
modification factors and statistically improved observations in d+Au collisions
taken in the 2008 Run are also discussed in the view of the recent
understanding of the initial state effects and breakup cross section.
