We report Ferromagnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (FMRFM) experiments on a
justaposed continuous films of permalloy and cobalt. Our studies demonstrate
the capability of FMRFM to perform local spectroscopy of different
ferromagnetic materials. Theoretical analysis of the uniform resonance mode
near the edge of the film agrees quantitatively with experimental data. Our
experiments demonstrate the micron scale lateral resolution in determining
local magnetic properties in continuous ferromagnetic samples.
