Inclusive production of K0S K0S in ep collisions was studied with the ZEUS
detector. Significant production of JPC=2++ tensor mesons and of the 0++
glueball candidate f0(1710) was seen. Masses and widths were compared with
previous experiments. The H1 Collaboration saw a charm pentaquark candidate in
the D*p spectrum at 3.1 GeV, which was not confirmed by a ZEUS higher
statistics search. With the full HERA data, H1 did not see a signal in this
region. Masses, widths and helicity parameters of excited charm and
charm-strange mesons were measured by ZEUS. Rates of c-quarks hadronising into
these mesons were determined and a search for a radially excited charm meson
was performed.
