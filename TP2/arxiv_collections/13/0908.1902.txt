We present the intrinsic optical properties over a broad spectral range of
TiN thin films deposited on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate. We analyze the measured
reflectivity spectra of the film-substrate multilayer structure within a
well-establish procedure based on the Fresnel equation and extract the real
part of the optical conductivity of TiN. We identify the metallic contribution
as well as the finite energy excitations and disentangle the spectral weight
distribution among them. The absorption spectrum of TiN bears some similarities
with the electrodynamic response observed in the normal state of the
high-temperature superconductors. Particularly, a mid-infrared feature in the
optical conductivity is quite reminiscent of a pseudogap-like excitation.
