We consider the agegraphic models of dark energy in a braneworld scenario
with brane-bulk energy exchange. We assume that the adiabatic equation for the
dark matter is satisfied while it is violated for the agegraphic dark energy
due to the energy exchange between the brane and the bulk. Our study shows that
with the brane-bulk interaction, the equation of state parameter of agegraphic
dark energy on the brane, $w_D$, can have a transition from normal state where
$w_D >-1 $ to the phantom regime where $w_D <-1 $, while the effective equation
of state for dark energy always satisfies $w^{\mathrm{eff}}_D\geq-1$.
