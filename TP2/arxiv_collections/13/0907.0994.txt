The MAGIC telescope observed the region around the distant blazar 3C 66A for
54.2 hr in 2007 August-December. The observations resulted in the discovery of
a gamma-ray source centered at celestial coordinates R.A. = 2h23m12s and decl.=
43deg 0.7arcmin (MAGIC J0223+430), coinciding with the nearby radio galaxy 3C
66B. A possible association of the excess with the blazar 3C 66A is discussed.
The energy spectrum of MAGIC J0223+430 follows a power law with a normalization
of (1.7+-0.3_stat+-0.6_syst) x 10^-11 TeV^-1 cm-2 s-1 at 300 GeV and a photon
index of 3.10+-0.31_stat+-0:2syst.
