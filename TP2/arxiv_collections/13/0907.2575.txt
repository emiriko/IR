A quasiclassical theory of the synchrotron-like gluon emission is discussed.
We show that the synchrotron emission may be important in the jet quenching if
the plasma instabilities generate a chromomagnetic field about $m^{2}_{D}/g$.
Our gluon spectrum disagrees with that obtained by Shuryak and Zahed within
Schwinger's proper time method.
