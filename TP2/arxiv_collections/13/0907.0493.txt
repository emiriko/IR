We introduce a novel form of decoy-state technique to make the single-photon
Bennett 1992 protocol robust against losses and noise of a communication
channel. Two uninformative states are prepared by the transmitter in order to
prevent the unambiguous state discrimination attack and improve the phase-error
rate estimation. The presented method does not require strong reference pulses,
additional electronics or extra detectors for its implementation.
