The interaction of a space system with its orbital environment is a major
consideration in the design of any space system, since a variety of hazards are
associated with the operation of spacecraft in the harsh space environment. In
this brief review, two types of hazards to Earth-orbiting spacecraft are
discussed: spacecraft charging and radiation hazards to spacecraft electronics,
with emphasis on the natural environmental factors and interactions which
contribute to these hazards. Following a summary of the historical eras of
spacecraft charging and some observations from experimental satellites: SCATHA,
CRRES and DMSP, environmental factors significant to spacecraft charging are
discussed, including plasma interactions, electric and magnetic fields and
solar radiation. Spacecraft charging depends on the spacecraft geometry, as
well as on the characteristics of its orbit, since the natural environment may
differ for each type of orbit. Low altitude orbiting satellites (LEO) usually
experience less charging effects than high altitude geosynchronous (GEO)
satellites, except for low altitude polar orbiting satellites which cross the
auroral oval. Basic mechanisms of surface charging, differential charging and
internal charging are described. Environmental factors including trapped and
transient radiation, solar and galactic cosmic rays, which can profoundly
damage spacecraft electronics are presented. Some effects such as ionization
and atomic displacement damages to semiconductors and single event phenomena
are also briefly mentioned.
