The annihilations of WIMPs produce high energy gamma-rays in the final state.
These high energy gamma-rays may be detected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes (IACTs). Amongst the plausible targets are the Galactic Center, the
centre of galaxy clusters, dwarf Sphreroidal galaxies and substructures in
Galactic haloes. I will review on the recent results from observations of
ongoing IACTs.
