This paper presents a generalized treatment of Type I planetary migration in
the presence of stochastic perturbations. In many planet-forming disks, the
Type I migration mechanism, driven by asymmetric torques, acts on a short time
scale and compromises planet formation. If the disk also supports MHD
instabilities, however, the corresponding turbulent fluctuations produce
additional stochastic torques that modify the steady inward migration scenario.
This work studies the migration of planetary cores in the presence of
stochastic fluctuations using complementary methods, including a Fokker-Planck
approach and iterative maps. Stochastic torques have two main effects: [1]
Through outward diffusion, a small fraction of the planetary cores can survive
in the face of Type I inward migration. [2] For a given starting condition, the
result of any particular realization of migration is uncertain, so that results
must be described in terms of the distributions of outcomes. In addition to
exploring different regimes of parameter space, this paper considers the
effects of the outer disk boundary condition, varying initial conditions, and
time-dependence of the torque parameters. For disks with finite radii, the
fraction of surviving planets decreases exponentially with time. We find the
survival fractions and decay rates for a range of disk models, and find the
expected distribution of locations for surviving planets. For expected disk
properties, the survival fraction lies in the range $0.01 < p_S < 0.1$.
