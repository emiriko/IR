Recent inclusive measurements with polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC
provide significant constraints on the polarized gluon distribution, Delta
g(x), integrated over the gluon momentum range 0.02 < x < 0.3. Di-jet and
photon-jet coincidence measurements will allow to study the x-dependence of
Delta g(x). In this report we present the status of photon-jet coincidence
studies for photons detected at forward pseudorapidity, 1.08<eta<2, using the
STAR Endcap Calorimeter.
