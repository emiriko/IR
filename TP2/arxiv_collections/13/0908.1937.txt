We have investigated a phase transition of a long-range RKKY Ising spin glass
\dyyrusi by means of the dc and the ac magnetization measurements. The static
nonlinear susceptibility $\chi_{2}$ exhibits a divergent behavior toward $\Tg$
$=$ 1.925 K with the exponent of $\gamma$ $=$ 1.08. The characteristic
relaxation time $\tau$ obtained from the ac magnetization measurements also
diverges to the same $\Tg$ with the exponent of $z\nu$ $=$ 1.9 in zero static
field . These results indicate the spin glass phase transition belonging to the
mean-field universality class, in which the exponents of $\gammaMF$ and
$\znuMF$ are 1 and 2 respectively. Moreover, we observed the divergence of
$\tau$ in a finite field of 500 Oe toward $\Tg$ $=$ 1.412 K with the exponent
of $z\nu$ $=$ 2.1, being quite similar to that in zero field. It strongly
suggests an existence of the spin glass phase transition in a finite field and
the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in the long-range Ising spin glass
\dyyrusi.
