We employ the bifurcation theory of planar dynamical systems to investigate
the exact travelling wave solutions of a generalized Degasperis-Procesi
equation. The implicit expression of smooth soliton solutions is given. The
explicit expressions of peaked soliton solutions and periodic cuspon solutions
are also obtained. Further, we show the relationship among the smooth soliton
solutions, the peaked soliton solutions, and the periodic cuspon solutions. The
physical relevance of the found solutions and the reasonwhy these solutions can
exist in this equation are also given.
