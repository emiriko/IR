In this paper we investigate peculiarities of phase transition high-symmetry
- incommensurate phase in inhomogeneous systems. We obtain the nonlinear
dispersion law and then present a renormalization group analysis of phase
transitions in multiferroics. We have determined the dependence of critical
indices on the nonextensivity parameter of the system.
