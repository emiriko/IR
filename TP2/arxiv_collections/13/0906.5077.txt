In this paper a macroscopic model of tumor cord growth is developed, relying
on the mathematical theory of deformable porous media. Tumor is modeled as a
saturated mixture of proliferating cells, extracellular fluid and extracellular
matrix, that occupies a spatial region close to a blood vessel whence cells get
the nutrient needed for their vital functions. Growth of tumor cells takes
place within a healthy host tissue, which is in turn modeled as a saturated
mixture of non-proliferating cells. Interactions between these two regions are
accounted for as an essential mechanism for the growth of the tumor mass. By
weakening the role of the extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a rigid
non-remodeling scaffold, a system of two partial differential equations is
derived, describing the evolution of the cell volume ratio coupled to the
dynamics of the nutrient, whose higher and lower concentration levels determine
proliferation or death of tumor cells, respectively. Numerical simulations of a
reference two-dimensional problem are shown and commented, and a qualitative
mathematical analysis of some of its key issues is proposed.
