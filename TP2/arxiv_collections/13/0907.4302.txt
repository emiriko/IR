Remote-sensing measurements of a hole-punch cloud or fall-streak hole are
presented. The cloud was observed with a vertically pointing infrared
ceilometer, Doppler lidar, sky camera and a polarimetric radar inclined at 45
degrees. The Doppler lidar and polarimetric radar observations show that the
aircraft-induced fall streak was composed primarily of oriented thick plate
crystals, and the vertical Doppler velocities suggest that vertical mixing may
have been triggered by the large flux of ice into the dry air at the base of
the virga.
