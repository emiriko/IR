We study the dynamics of spherically symmetric solutions in the Einstein
Skyrme model. We focus our attention on generic long time evolution of initial
data resulting in the formation of the B = 1 soliton, which plays the role of
an attractor. We demonstrate that similarly to the case of flat space
evolution, the relaxation to the regular soliton (which we will call Skyrmion)
is universal and may be treated as a superposition of two effects quasinormal
oscillations responsible for intermediate asymptotics and a power-law tail
describing the behavior of the system at very long times. We determine the
values of parameters describing asymptotics and examine their dependence on the
value of dimensionless coupling constant of the model.
