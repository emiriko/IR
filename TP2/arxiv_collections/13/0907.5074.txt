Complex systems typically have many different parts and facets, with
different characteristics. In a multi-paradigm approach to modeling, formalisms
with different natures are used in combination to describe complementary parts
and aspects of the system. This can have a beneficial impact on the modeling
activity, as different paradigms an be better suited to describe different
aspects of the system. While each paradigm provides a different view on the
many facets of the system, it is of paramount importance that a coherent
comprehensive model emerges from the combination of the various partial
descriptions. In this paper we present a technique to model different aspects
of the same system with different formalisms, while keeping the various models
tightly integrated with one another. In addition, our approach leverages the
flexibility provided by a bounded satisfiability checker to encode the
verification problem of the integrated model in the propositional
satisfiability (SAT) problem; this allows users to carry out formal
verification activities both on the whole model and on parts thereof. The
effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through the example of a
monitoring system.
