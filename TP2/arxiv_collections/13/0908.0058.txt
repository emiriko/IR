We study the evolution of a quantum state of a double quantum dot system
interacting with the electromagnetic environment and with the lattice modes, in
the presence of a coupling between the two dots. We propose a unified approach
to the simulation of the system evolution under joint impact of the two
reservoirs. We discuss the sub- and superradiant radiative decay of the system,
the phonon-induced decay of entanglement between the dots, and the transfer of
excitation between them.
