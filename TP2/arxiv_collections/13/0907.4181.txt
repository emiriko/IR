"Sticky" motion in mixed phase space of conservative systems is difficult to
detect and to characterize, in particular for high dimensional phase spaces.
Its effect on quasi-regular motion is quantified here with four different
measures, related to the distribution of the finite time Lyapunov exponents. We
study systematically standard maps from the uncoupled two-dimensional case up
to coupled maps of dimension $20$. We find that sticky motion in all unstable
directions above a threshold $K_{d}$ of the nonlinearity parameter $K$ for the
high dimensional cases $d=10,20$. Moreover, as $K$ increases we can clearly
identify the transition from quasiregular to totally chaotic motion which
occurs simultaneously in all unstable directions. The results show that all
four statistical measures sensitively probe sticky motion in high dimensional
systems.
