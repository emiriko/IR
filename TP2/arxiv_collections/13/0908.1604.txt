Spatial qudit states can be realized by using multi-slits to discretize the
transverse momentum of a photon. The merit of this kind of spatial qudit states
is that the implementation of higher dimensional qudits is relatively easy. As
we have recently shown, the quantum states of these spatial qudits can be
analyzed by scanning a single interference pattern. This method of single scan
tomography can also be applied at higher dimensions, but the reconstruction
becomes more sensitive to smaller details of the scanned patterns as the
dimensions increase. In this paper, we investigate the effect of finite
measurement resolution on the single scan tomography of spatial qutrits.
Realistic measurement operators describing the spatial resolution of the
measurement are introduced and the corresponding pattern functions for quantum
state reconstruction are derived. We use the pattern functions to analyze
experimental results for entangled pairs of spatial qutrits generated by
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). It is shown that a reliable
reconstruction of the quantum state can be achieved with finite measurement
resolution if this limitation of the measurement is included in the pattern
functions of single scan tomography.
