I show an updated QCD phase diagram with recent developments from chiral
effective theories and phenomenological models. Expected signals of a QCD
critical point accessible in heavy-ion collisions are also discussed. In
particular, non-monotonic behavior of fluctuations associated with conserved
charges is focused on.
