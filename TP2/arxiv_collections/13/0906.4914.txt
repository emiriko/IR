Hamiltonian dynamical systems possessing equilibria of ${saddle} \times
{centre} \times...\times {centre}$ stability type display \emph{reaction-type
dynamics} for energies close to the energy of such equilibria; entrance and
exit from certain regions of the phase space is only possible via narrow
\emph{bottlenecks} created by the influence of the equilibrium points. In this
paper we provide a thorough pedagogical description of the phase space
structures that are responsible for controlling transport in these problems. Of
central importance is the existence of a \emph{Normally Hyperbolic Invariant
Manifold (NHIM)}, whose \emph{stable and unstable manifolds} have sufficient
dimensionality to act as separatrices, partitioning energy surfaces into
regions of qualitatively distinct behavior. This NHIM forms the natural
(dynamical) equator of a (spherical) \emph{dividing surface} which locally
divides an energy surface into two components (`reactants' and `products'), one
on either side of the bottleneck. This dividing surface has all the desired
properties sought for in \emph{transition state theory} where reaction rates
are computed from the flux through a dividing surface. In fact, the dividing
surface that we construct is crossed exactly once by reactive trajectories, and
not crossed by nonreactive trajectories, and related to these properties,
minimizes the flux upon variation of the dividing surface.
  We discuss three presentations of the energy surface and the phase space
structures contained in it for 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in the
threedimensional space $\R^3$, and two schematic models which capture many of
the essential features of the dynamics for $n$-DoF systems. In addition, we
elucidate the structure of the NHIM.
