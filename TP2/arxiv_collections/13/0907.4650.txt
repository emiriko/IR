We study the impact of correlated instrumental noise and non-circular antenna
beam patterns on primordial non-Gaussianity analysis. The two systematic
effects are reproduced in the case of the Planck mission, using Planck-like
realistic simulations. The non-Gaussian analysis is conducted with different
approaches. First we adopt a blind approach, using the Spherical Mexican Hat
Wavelet and the Minkowski functionals, and then a fNL estimator. We look
respectively for false primordial non-Gaussian detections and for bias or
variance increase in the estimated fNL value. Even if some slight effects are
present, we can not observe any significant impact of the 1/f noise and the
asymmetric beam on non-Gaussianity searches in the context of the Planck
mission.
