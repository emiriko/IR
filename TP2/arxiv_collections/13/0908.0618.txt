When predicting scalar responses in the situation where the explanatory
variables are functions, it is sometimes the case that some functional
variables are related to responses linearly while other variables have more
complicated relationships with the responses. In this paper, we propose a new
semi-parametric model to take advantage of both parametric and nonparametric
functional modeling. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are
established and finite sample behavior is investigated through a small
simulation experiment.
