We perform a qualitative analysis of the critical equation associated with a
stationary ergodic Hamiltonian through a stochastic version of the metric
method, where the notion of closed random stationary set, issued from
stochastic geometry, plays a major role. Our purpose is to give an appropriate
notion of random Aubry set, to single out characterizing conditions for the
existence of exact or approximate correctors, and write down representation
formulae for them. For the last task, we make use of a Lax--type formula,
adapted to the stochastic environment. This material can be regarded as a first
step of a long--term project to develop a random analog of Weak KAM Theory,
generalizing what done in the periodic case or, more generally, when the
underlying space is a compact manifold.
