IceCube is a kilometer-scale high energy neutrino telescope under
construction at the South Pole, a second-generation instrument expanding the
capabilities of the AMANDA telescope. The scientific portfolio of IceCube
includes the detection of neutrinos from astrophysical objects such as the
sources of the cosmic rays, the search for dark matter, and fundamental physics
using a very large data set of atmospheric neutrinos. The design and status of
IceCube are briefly reviewed, followed by a summary of results to date from
AMANDA and initial IceCube results from the 2007 run, with 22 of a planned 86
strings operational. The new infill array known as Deep Core, which will extend
IceCube's capabilities to energies as low as 10 GeV, is also described.
