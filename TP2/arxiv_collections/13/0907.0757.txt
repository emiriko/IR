The dynamical symmetry algebra of the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian with
equal scalar and vector Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials is constructed. It is
the Higgs algebra, a cubic polynomial generalization of SU(2). With the help of
the Casimir operators, the energy levels are derived algebraically.
