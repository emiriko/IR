In this article we introduce a broad family of adaptive, linear
time-frequency representations termed superposition frames, and show that they
admit desirable fast overlap-add reconstruction properties akin to standard
short-time Fourier techniques. This approach stands in contrast to many
adaptive time-frequency representations in the extant literature, which, while
more flexible than standard fixed-resolution approaches, typically fail to
provide efficient reconstruction and often lack the regular structure necessary
for precise frame-theoretic analysis. Our main technical contributions come
through the development of properties which ensure that this construction
provides for a numerically stable, invertible signal representation. Our
primary algorithmic contributions come via the introduction and discussion of
specific signal adaptation criteria in deterministic and stochastic settings,
based respectively on time-frequency concentration and nonstationarity
detection. We conclude with a short speech enhancement example that serves to
highlight potential applications of our approach.
