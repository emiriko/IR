A phenomenological approach using the states of spin-like observables is
developed to understand the nature of consciousness and the totality of
experience. The three states of consciousness are taken to form the triplet of
eigenstates of a spin-one entity and are derived as the triplet resulting from
the composition of two spins by treating the subject and the object as
interacting two-state, spin-half systems with external and internal
projections. The state of deep sleep is analysed in the light of this
phenomenological approach and a novel understanding of the status of the
individual consciousness in this state is obtained. The resulting fourth state
i.e. the singlet state is interpreted to correspond to the superconscious state
of intuitive experience and is justified by invoking the concept of the
universal consciousness as the underlying source of all individual states of
experience. It is proposed that the individual experiences result from the
operations of four individualizing observables which project out the individual
from the universal. The one-to-one correspondence between the individual and
the universal states of experience is brought out and their identity in the
fourth state is established by showing that all individualizing quantum numbers
become zero in this state leaving no trace of any individuality.
