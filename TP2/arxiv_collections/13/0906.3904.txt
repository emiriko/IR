A wave model for the interconversion of photon particle behavior and wave
phenomena is examined in relation to the adiabatic spatial expansion of the
Universe. An historical perspective of the mathematics of physical science over
the 20th century between what are termed phenomenal and noumenal are contrasted
based on quotations from leading scholars. The question is posed whether the
generation of space is an energetic sink and should be included in the
conservation of energy as posited by the First Law of Thermodynamics. Various
aspects of space expansion and electromagnetic radiation are examined as well
as a mechanism based on imaginary conmponents to real space dimensions and the
consequent creation of the time dimension.
