We have investigated the magnetic behavior of the nanocrystalline form of a
well-known Laves phase compound, ErCo2 - the bulk form of which has been known
to undergo an interesting first-order ferrimagnetic ordering near 32 K -
synthesized by high-energy ball-milling. It is found that, in these
nanocrystallites, Co exhibits ferromagnetic order at room temperature as
inferred from the magnetization data. However, the magnetic transition
temperature for Er sublattice remains essentially unaffected as though the
(Er)4f-Co(3d) coupling is weak on Er magnetism. The net magnetic moment as
measured at high fields, sat at 120 kOe, is significantly reduced with respect
to that for the bulk in the ferrimagnetically ordered state and possible
reasons are outlined. We have also compared the magnetocaloric behavior for the
bulk and the nano particles.
