The behaviour and fate of tissue cells is controlled by the rigidity and
geometry of their adhesive environment, possibly through forces localized to
sites of adhesion. We introduce a mechanical model that predicts cellular force
distributions for cells adhering to adhesive patterns with different geometries
and rigidities. For continuous adhesion along a closed contour, forces are
predicted to be localized to the corners. For discrete sites of adhesion, the
model predicts the forces to be mainly determined by the lateral pull of the
cell contour. With increasing distance between two neighboring sites of
adhesion, the adhesion force increases because cell shape results in steeper
pulling directions. Softer substrates result in smaller forces. Our predictions
agree well with experimental force patterns measured on pillar assays.
