The problem of detecting terms that can be interesting to the advertiser is
considered. If a company has already bought some advertising terms which
describe certain services, it is reasonable to find out the terms bought by
competing companies. A part of them can be recommended as future advertising
terms to the company. The goal of this work is to propose better interpretable
recommendations based on FCA and association rules.
