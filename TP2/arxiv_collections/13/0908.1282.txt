We have investigated the initial growth of Fe on GaAs(110) by means of
density functional theory. In contrast to the conventionally used (001)-surface
the (110)-surface does not reconstruct. Therefore, a flat interface and small
diffusion can be expected, which makes Fe/GaAs(110) a possible candidate for
spintronic applications. Since experimentally, the actual quality of the
interface seems to depend on the growth conditions, e.g., on the flux rate, we
simulate the effect of different flux rates by different Fe coverages of the
semiconductor surface. Systems with low coverages are highly diffusive. With
increasing amount of Fe, i.e., higher flux rates, a flat interface becomes more
stable. The magnetic structure strongly depends on the Fe coverage but no
quenching of the magnetic moments is observed in our calculations.
