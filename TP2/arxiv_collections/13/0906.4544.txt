It has been claimed that decoherence of open quantum systems explains the
tendency of macroscopic systems to exhibit quasiclassical behavior. We show
that quasiclassicality is in fact an unremarkable property, characterizing
generic subsystems of environments even in the absence of dynamical
decoherence. It is suggested that decoherence is best regarded as explaining
the persistence of true classicality, rather than the emergence, rather than
the emergence of quasiclassicality.
