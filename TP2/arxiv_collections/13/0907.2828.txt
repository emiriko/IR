The intermediate-state interaction and structure of amplitudes of complicated
processes in medium (decays, reactions and the $n\bar{n}$ transitions) are
studied. It is proposed to use the branching ratio of channels of free-space
hadron-nucleon interaction as a test in the construction and verification of
the models. The corresponding formulas for the processes in the medium are
obtained. The connection between particle self-energy and amplitudes of
subprocesses are analyzed as well.
