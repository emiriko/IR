In this article, spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes supported by a
generalized Chaplygin gas are constructed and their stability under
perturbations preserving the symmetry is studied. Wormholes with charge and
with a cosmological constant are analyzed and the results are compared with
those obtained for the original Chaplygin gas, which was considered in a
previous work. For some values of the parameters, one stable configuration is
also present and a new extra unstable solution is found.
