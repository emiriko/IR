We derive an accurate mass distribution of the rich galaxy cluster
Cl0024+1654 (z=0.395) based on deep Subaru BR_{c}z' imaging and our recent
comprehensive strong lensing analysis of HST/ACS/NIC3 observations. We obtain
the weak lensing distortion and magnification of undilted samples of red and
blue background galaxies by carefully combining all color and positional
information. Unlike previous work, the weak and strong lensing are in excellent
agreement where the data overlap. The joint mass profile continuously steepens
out to the virial radius with only a minor contribution \sim 10% in the mass
from known subcluster at a projected distance of \sim 700kpc/h. The projected
mass distribution for the entire cluster is well fitted with a single
Navarro-Frenk-White model with a virial mass, M_{vir} = (1.2 \pm 0.2) \times
10^{15} M_{sun}/h, and a concentration, c_{vir} = 9.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}. This model
fit is fully consistent with the depletion of the red background counts,
providing independent confirmation. Careful examination and interpretation of
X-ray and dynamical data strongly suggest that this cluster system is in a post
collision state, which we show is consistent with our well-defined mass profile
for a major merger occurring along the line of sight, viewed approximately
2-3Gyr after impact when the gravitational potential has had time to relax in
the center, before the gas has recovered and before the outskirts are fully
virialized. Finally, our full lensing analysis provides a model-independent
constraint of M_{2D}(<r_{vir}) = (1.4 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{15} M_{sun}/h for the
projected mass of the whole system, including any currently unbound material
beyond the virial radius, which can constrain the sum of the two pre-merger
cluster masses when designing simulations to explore this system.
