Elaborating on the observation that two-particle unitarity-cuts of scattering
amplitudes can be computed by applying Stokes' Theorem, we relate the Optical
Theorem to the Berry Phase, showing how the imaginary part of arbitrary
one-loop Feynman amplitudes can be interpreted as the flux of a complex 2-form.
