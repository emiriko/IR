Graphene antidot lattices constitute a novel class of nano-engineered
graphene devices with controllable electronic and optical properties. An
antidot lattice consists of a periodic array of holes which causes a band gap
to open up around the Fermi level, turning graphene from a semimetal into a
semiconductor. We calculate the electronic band structure of graphene antidot
lattices using three numerical approaches with different levels of
computational complexity, efficiency, and accuracy. Fast finite-element
solutions of the Dirac equation capture qualitative features of the band
structure, while full tight-binding calculations and density functional theory
are necessary for more reliable predictions of the band structure. We compare
the three computational approaches and investigate the role of hydrogen
passivation within our density functional theory scheme.
