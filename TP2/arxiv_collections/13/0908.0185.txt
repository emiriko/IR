Imaging with the second-order correlation of two light fields is a method to
image an object by two-photon interference involving a joint detection of two
photons at distant space-time points. We demonstrate for the first time that an
image with high quality can still be obtained in the scattering media by
applying the second-order correlation of illuminating light field. The
scattering effect on the visibility of images is analyzed both theoretically
and experimentally. Potential applications and the methods to further improve
the visibility of the images in scattering media are also discussed.
