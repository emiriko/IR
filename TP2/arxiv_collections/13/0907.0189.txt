We present a model for the decay D+ --> K- pi+ pi+. The weak interaction part
of this reaction is described using the effective weak Hamiltonian in the
factorisation approach. Hadronic final state interactions are taken into
account through the Kpi scalar and vector form factors fulfilling analyticity,
unitarity and chiral symmetry constraints. The model has only two free
parameters that are fixed from experimental branching ratios. We show that the
modulus and phase of the S wave thus obtained agree nicely with experiment up
to 1.55 GeV. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to compare the predicted Dalitz
plot with experimental analyses. Allowing for a global phase difference between
the S and P waves of -65 degrees, the Dalitz plot of the D+ --> K- pi+ pi+
decay, the Kpi invariant mass spectra and the total branching ratio due to
S-wave interactions are well reproduced.
