The process of charged Higgs production in association with a top quark at
the LHC has been calculated at the complete NLO electroweak level both in a Two
Higgs Doublets Model and in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, assuming
a mSUGRA breaking scheme. We have numerically explored the size of the one-loop
corrections in two typical supersymmetric scenarios, with particular attention
to the tan beta dependence, and we have found that they remain perturbatively
small but possibly sizable, reaching a 20% limit for extreme values of tan
beta, when the complete set of Feynman diagrams is taken into account.
