We discuss two qualities of quantum systems: various correlations existing
between their subsystems and the distingushability of different quantum states.
This is then applied to analysing quantum information processing. While quantum
correlations, or entanglement, are clearly of paramount importance for
efficient pure state manipulations, mixed states present a much richer arena
and reveal a more subtle interplay between correlations and distinguishability.
The current work explores a number of issues related with identifying the
important ingredients needed for quantum information processing. We discuss the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the Shor algorithm, the Grover algorithm and the power
of a single qubit class of algorithms. One section is dedicated to cluster
states where entanglement is crucial, but its precise role is highly
counter-intuitive. Here we see that distinguishability becomes a more useful
concept.
