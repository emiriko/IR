Starting from the full--shift on a finite alphabet $A$, mingling some symbols
of $A$, we obtain a new full shift on a smaller alphabet $B$. This amalgamation
defines a factor map from $(A^{\mathbb N},T_A)$ to $(B^{\mathbb N},T_B)$, where
$T_A$ and $T_B$ are the respective shift maps.
  According to the thermodynamic formalism, to each regular function
(`potential') $\psi:A^{\mathbb N}\to{\mathbb R}$, we can associate a unique
Gibbs measure $\mu_\psi$. In this article, we prove that, for a large class of
potentials, the pushforward measure $\mu_\psi\circ\pi^{-1}$ is still Gibbsian
for a potential $\phi:B^{\mathbb N}\to{\mathbb R}$ having a `bit less'
regularity than $\psi$. In the special case where $\psi$ is a `2--symbol'
potential, the Gibbs measure $\mu_\psi$ is nothing but a Markov measure and the
amalgamation $\pi$ defines a hidden Markov chain. In this particular case, our
theorem can be recast by saying that a hidden Markov chain is a Gibbs measure
(for a H\"older potential).
