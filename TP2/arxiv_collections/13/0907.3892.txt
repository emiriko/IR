We develop a Landau Ginzburg theory of the hidden order phase and the local
moment antiferromagnetic phase of URu_2Si_2. We unify the two broken symmetries
in a common complex order parameter and derive many experimentally relevant
consequences such as the topology of the phase diagram in magnetic field and
pressure. The theory accounts for the appearance of a moment under application
of stress and the thermal expansion anomaly across the phase transitions. It
identifies the low energy mode which is seen in the hidden order phase near the
conmensurate wavector (0,0, 1) as the pseudo-Goldstone mode of the approximate
U(1) symmetry.
