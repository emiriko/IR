We present Lithium abundance determination for a sample of K giant stars in
the galactic bulge. The stars presented here are the only 13 stars with
detectable Lithium line (6767.18 A) among ~400 stars for which we have spectra
in this wavelength range, half of them in Baade's Window (b=-4) and half in a
field at b=-6. The stars were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph of
FLAMES@VLT, with a spectral resolution of R~20,000. Abundances were derived via
spectral synthesis and the results are compared with those for stars with
similar parameters, but no detectable Li line. We find 13 stars with a
detectable Li line, among which 2 have abundances A(Li)>2.7. No clear
correlations were found between the Li abundance and those of other elements.
With the exception of the two most Li rich stars, the others follow a fairly
tight A(Li)-T_eff correlation. It would seems that there must be a Li
production phase during the red giant branch (RGB), acting either on a very
short timescale, or selectively only in some stars. The proposed Li production
phase associated with the RGB bump cannot be excluded, although our targets are
significantly brighter than the predicted RGB bump magnitude for a population
at 8 kpc
