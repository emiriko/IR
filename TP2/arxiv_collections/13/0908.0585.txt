The Taylor expansion method has been used to investigate the scale dependence
of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. In the present study, an
alternative numerical method is used to clarify the $k$ dependence. Although
there is thought to be no large difference between these two methods, some
differences arise among various inflation models. For example, at $k$ = 1 Mpc,
there is a 1.4 % difference in the power spectrum, and with respect to the
angular power spectrum, the difference of the value of $\chi^2$ nearly 10 occur
in new inflation. However, in hybrid inflation, these differences do not occur.
The time dependence of the inflationary and cosmological parameters is
investigated, and differences among inflation models are clarified.
