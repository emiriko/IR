Jpsi and dielectron photoproduction measurements in ultra-peripheral Au+Au
collisions at 200 GeV with the PHENIX experiment are presented. The triggered
events correspond to those accompanied with forward neutron emission from the
Au dissociation. Jpsi and high-mass dielectron cross sections and pT
distributions are consistent with various theoretical calculations.
