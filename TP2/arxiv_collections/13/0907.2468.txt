We report on magnetoresistance oscillations in superconducting NbNx nanowires
synthesized through ammonia gas annealing of NbSe3 precursor nanostructures.
Even though the transverse dimensions of the nanowires are much larger than the
superconducting coherence length, the voltage-current characteristics of these
nanowires at low temperatures are reminiscent of one-dimensional
superconductors where quantum phase slips are associated with the origin of
dissipation. We show that both the magnetoresistance oscillations and
voltage-current characteristics observed in this work result from the granular
structure of our nanowires.
