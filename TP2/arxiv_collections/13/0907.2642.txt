Nonlinear effects in vacuum have been predicted but never observed yet
directly. The PVLAS collaboration has long been working on an apparatus aimed
at detecting such effects by measuring vacuum magnetic birefringence.
Unfortunately the sensitivity has been affected by unaccounted noise and
systematics since the beginning. A new small prototype ellipsometer has been
designed and characterized at the Department of Physics of the University of
Ferrara, Italy entirely mounted on a single seismically isolated optical bench.
With a finesse F = 414000 and a cavity length L = 0.5 m we have reached the
predicted sensitivity of psi = 2x10^-8 1/sqrt(Hz) given the laser power at the
output of the ellipsomenter of P = 24 mW. This record result demonstrates the
feasibility of reaching such sensitivities and opens the way to designing a
dedicated apparatus for a first detection of vacuum magnetic birefringence.
