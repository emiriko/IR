Despite its name, Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has been built to describe
interactions between localizable particles. For this reason the actual
formalism of QFT is partly based on a suitable generalization of the one
already used for systems of point particles. This circumstance gives rise to a
number of conceptual problems, stemming essentially from the fact that the
existence within QFT of non-equivalent representations implies the existence of
field theories allowing, within the same theory, different, inequivalent,
descriptions of particles. This led some authors to claim that in QFT the
concept itself of particle should be abandoned. In this paper we will shortly
discuss the validity of this claim, as well as the possibilities, so far
existing, of building alternative versions of QFT, not designed in advance to
allow some kind of particle representation. We will also spend some words about
the generalizations of the concept itself of particle which could grant for a
better cohabitation of particles and fields within a wider formulation of QFT.
The latter is indispensable if we want to extend the range of application of
QFT from particle physics or simple condensed matter physics to other domains
of scientific research.
