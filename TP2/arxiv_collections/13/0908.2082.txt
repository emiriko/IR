We have investigated spin-wave excitations in rolled-up Permalloy microtubes
using microwave absorption spectroscopy. We find a series of quantized
azimuthal modes which arise from the constructive interference of Damon-Eshbach
type spin waves propagating around the circumference of the microtubes, forming
a spin-wave resonator. The mode spectrum can be tailored by the tube's radius
and number of rolled-up layers.
