We show that all multi-partite pure states can, under local operations, be
transformed into bi-partite pairwise entangled states in a "lossless fashion":
An arbitrary distinguished party will keep pairwise entanglement with all other
parties after the asymptotic protocol - decorrelating all other parties from
each other - in a way that the degree of entanglement of this party with
respect to the rest will remain entirely unchanged. The set of possible
entanglement distributions of bi-partite pairs is also classified. Finally, we
point out several applications of this protocol as a useful primitive in
quantum information theory.
