The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope is a pair-conversion detector designed to study the gamma-ray
sky in the energy range 30 MeV to 300 GeV. Fermi has detected high-energy gamma
rays from the quiet Sun produced by interactions of cosmic-ray nucleons with
the solar surface, and cosmic-ray electrons with solar photons in the
heliosphere. While the Sun was detected by EGRET on CGRO with low statistics,
Fermi provides high-quality detections on a daily basis allowing variability to
be addressed. Such observations will provide a probe of the extreme conditions
near the solar surface and a monitor the modulation of cosmic rays over the
inner heliosphere. We discuss the study of the quiescent solar emission
including spectral analysis of its two components, disk and inverse Compton.
