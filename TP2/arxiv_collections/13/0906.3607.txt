By evaluating multipole susceptibility of a seven-orbital impurity Anderson
model with the use of a numerical renormalization group method, we discuss
possible multipole states of actinide dioxides at low temperatures. In
particular, here we point out a possible scenario for multipole ordering in
americium dioxide. For Am$^{4+}$ ion with five $5f$ electrons, it is considered
that the ground state is $\Gamma_7^{-}$ doublet and the first excited state is
$\Gamma_8^{-}$ quartet, but we remark that the $f^5$ ground state is easily
converted due to the competition between spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb
interactions. Then, we find that the $\Gamma_8^-$ quartet can be the ground
state of AmO$_2$ even for the same crystalline electric field potential. In the
case of $\Gamma_8^-$ quartet ground state, the numerical results suggest that
high-order multipoles such as quadrupole and octupole can be relevant to
AmO$_2$.
