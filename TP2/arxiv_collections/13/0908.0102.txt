We show that the ambipolar-diffusion--initiated fragmentation of molecular
clouds leads simply and naturally to an initial core mass function (CMF) which
is very similar to the initial stellar mass function (IMF) and in excellent
agreement with existing observations. This agreement is robust provided that
the three (input) free parameters remain within their range of values suggested
by observations. Other, observationally testable, predictions are made.
