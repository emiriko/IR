We propose to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to uncover non-statistical
differences between events created in heavy ion collisions within the same
centrality class. The advantage of the method over other approaches which are
currently in use, is that it is sensitive to any difference between the events
and is not restricted to simple moments of the distribution of hadrons. The
particular application examined here is the identification of the fireball
decay due to spinodal fragmentation and/or sudden rise of the bulk viscosity.
