We model the overall shape of an accretion disc in a semi-detached binary
system in which mass is transfered on to a spinning black hole the spin axis of
which is misaligned with the orbital rotation axis. We assume the disc is in a
steady state. Its outer regions are subject to differential precession caused
by tidal torques of the companion star. These tend to align the outer parts of
the disc with the orbital plane. Its inner regions are subject to differential
precession caused by the Lense-Thirring effect. These tend to align the inner
parts of the disc with the spin of the black hole. We give full numerical
solutions for the shape of the disc for some particular disc parameters. We
then show how an analytic approximation to these solutions can be obtained for
the case when the disc surface density varies as a power law with radius. These
analytic solutions for the shape of the disc are reasonably accurate even for
large misalignments and can be simply applied for general disc parameters. They
are particularly useful when the numerical solutions would be slow.
