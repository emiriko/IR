The study of AdS/CFT (or gauge/gravity) duality has been one of the most
active and illuminating areas of research in string theory over the past
decade. The scope of its relevance and the insights it is providing seem to be
ever expanding. In this talk I briefly describe some of the attempts to explore
how the duality works for maximally supersymmetric systems.
