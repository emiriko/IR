A better understanding of transverse momentum (k_T-) dependent quark
distributions in a hadron is needed to interpret several experimentally
observed large angular asymmetries and to clarify the fundamental role of gauge
links in non-abelian gauge theories. Based on manifestly non-local gauge
invariant quark operators we introduce process-independent k_T-distributions
and study their properties in lattice QCD. We find that the longitudinal and
transverse momentum dependence approximately factorizes, in contrast to the
behavior of generalized parton distributions. The resulting quark
k_T-probability densities for the nucleon show characteristic dipole
deformations due to correlations between intrinsic k_T and the quark or nucleon
spin. Our lattice calculations are based on N_f=2+1 mixed action propagators of
the LHP collaboration.
