Context : On its asteroseismic side, the initial run of CoRoT was partly
devoted to the solar like star HD49933.The eigenmodes of this F dwarf have been
observed with unprecedented accuracy.
  Aims : We investigate quantitatively the impact of changes in the modeling
parameters like mass and composition. More importantly we investigate how a
sophisticated physics affects the seismological picture of HD49933. We consider
the effects of diffusion, rotation and the changes in convection efficiency.
  Methods : We use the CESAM stellar evolution code coupled to the ADIPLS
adiabatic pulsation package to build secular models and their associated
oscillation frequencies. We also exploited the hydrodynamical code STAGGER to
perform surface convection calculations. The seismic variables used in this
work are : the large frequency separation, the derivative of the surface phase
shift,and the eigenfrequencies $\rm \nu_{\ell=0,n=14}$ and $\rm
\nu_{\ell=0,n=27}$.
  Results : Mass and uncertainties on the composition have much larger impacts
on the seismic variables we consider than the rotation. The derivative of the
surface phase shift is a promising variable for the determination of the helium
content. The seismological variables of HD49933 are sensitive to the assumed
solar composition and also to the presence of diffusion in the models.
