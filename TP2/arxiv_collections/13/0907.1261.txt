We present new data and a compact mobility model for single-wall carbon
nanotubes, with only two adjustable parameters, the elastic and inelastic
collision mean free paths at 300 K. The mobility increases with diameter,
decreases with temperature, and has a more complex dependence on charge
density. The model and data suggest the room temperature mobility does not
exceed 10,000 cm2/V.s at high carrier density (n > 0.5 nm-1) for typical
single-wall nanotube diameters, due to the strong scattering effect of the
second subband.
