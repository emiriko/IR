Currently, over forty transiting planets have been discovered by ground-based
photometric surveys, and space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT are
expected to detect hundreds more. Follow-up photometric observations from the
ground will play an important role in constraining both orbital and physical
parameters for newly discovered planets, especially those with small radii (R_p
less than approximately 4 Earth radii) and/or intermediate to long orbital
periods (P greater than approximately 30 days). Here, we simulate transit light
curves from Kepler-like photometry and ground-based observations in the
near-infrared (NIR) to determine how jointly modeling space-based and
ground-based light curves can improve measurements of the transit duration and
planet-star radius ratio. We find that adding observations of at least one
ground-based transit to space-based observations can significantly improve the
accuracy for measuring the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio of
small planets (R_p less than approximately 4 Earth radii) in long-period (~1
year) orbits, largely thanks to the reduced effect of limb darkening in the
NIR. We also demonstrate that multiple ground-based observations are needed to
gain a substantial improvement in the measurement accuracy for small planets
with short orbital periods (~3 days). Finally, we consider the role that higher
ground-based precisions will play in constraining parameter measurements for
typical Kepler targets. Our results can help inform the priorities of transit
follow-up programs (including both primary and secondary transit of planets
discovered with Kepler and CoRoT), leading to improved constraints for transit
durations, planet sizes, and orbital eccentricities.
