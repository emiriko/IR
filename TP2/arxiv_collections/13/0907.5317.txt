The aim of our work is to study the effect of geometry variation on
nucleation times and to address its role in the context of eukaryotic
chemotaxis (i.e. the process which allows cells to identify and follow a
gradient of chemical attractant). As a first step in this direction we study
the nucleation dynamics of the 2d Ising model defined on a cylindrical lattice
whose radius changes as a function of time. Geometry variation is obtained by
changing the relative value of the couplings between spins in the compactified
(vertical) direction with respect to the horizontal one. This allows us to keep
the lattice size unchanged and study in a single simulation the values of the
compactification radius which change in time. We show, both with theoretical
arguments and numerical simulations that squeezing the geometry allows the
system to speed up nucleation times even in presence of a very small energy gap
between the stable and the metastable states. We then address the implications
of our analysis for directional chemotaxis. The initial steps of chemotaxis can
be modelled as a nucleation process occurring on the cell membrane as a
consequence of the external chemical gradient (which plays the role of energy
gap between the stable and metastable phases). In nature most of the cells
modify their geometry by extending quasi-onedimensional protrusions (filopodia)
so as to enhance their sensitivity to chemoattractant. Our results show that
this geometry variation has indeed the effect of greatly decreasing the
timescale of the nucleation process even in presence of very small amounts of
chemoattractants.
