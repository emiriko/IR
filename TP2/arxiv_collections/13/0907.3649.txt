We study the distribution of transport current across superconducting
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ crystals and the vortex flow through the sample
edges. We show that the $T_x$ transition is of electrodynamic rather than
thermodynamic nature, below which vortex dynamics is governed by the edge
inductance instead of the resistance. This allows measurement of the resistance
down to two orders of magnitude below the transport noise. By irradiating the
current contacts the resistive step at vortex melting is shown to be due to
loss of c-axis correlations rather than breakdown of quasi-long-range order
within the a-b planes.
