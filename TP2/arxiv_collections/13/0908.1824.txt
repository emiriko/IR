The solution of the geodesic problem for an oblate ellipsoid is developed in
terms of series. Tables are provided to simplify the computation. [This is an
English translation of F. W. Bessel, Astronomische Nachrichten 4(86), 241-254
(1825). The mathematical notation has been updated to conform to current
conventions and, in a few places, the equations have been rearranged for
clarity. Several errors have been corrected, a figure has been included, and
the tables have been recomputed.]
