Exact numerical results for the full counting statistics (FCS) of a
one-dimensional tight-binding model of noninteracting electrons are presented
at finite temperatures using an identity recently presented by Abanov and
Ivanov. A similar idea is used to derive a new expression for the cumulant
generating function for a system consisting of two quasi-one-dimensional leads
connected by a quantum dot in the long time limit. This provides a
generalization of the Levitov-Lesovik formula for such systems.
