We present the observed/intrinsic optical parameters and the variability
analysis of the Naked-Eye Burst, GRB 080319B, observed by the TORTORA
wide-field optical monitoring system. The event is extreme not only in observed
properties but also intrinsically: it is the most luminous event ever recorded
at optical wavelengths. The temporal properties suggest short-lived periodic
activities of the internal engine. This is the fastest optically variable
source detected at cosmological distances.
