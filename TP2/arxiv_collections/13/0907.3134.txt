We study the adiabatic dynamics of Majorana fermions across a quantum phase
transition. We show that the Kibble-Zurek scaling, which describes the density
of bulk defects produced during the critical point crossing, is not valid for
edge Majorana fermions. Therefore, the dynamics governing an edge state quench
is nonuniversal and depends on the topological features of the system. Besides,
we show that the localization of Majorana fermions is a necessary ingredient to
guaranty robustness against defect production.
