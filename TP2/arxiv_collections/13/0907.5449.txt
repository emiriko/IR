We show, under natural assumptions for qubit systems, that measurement-based
quantum computations (MBQCs) which compute a non-linear Boolean function with
high probability are contextual. The class of contextual MBQCs includes an
example which is of practical interest and has a super-polynomial speedup over
the best known classical algorithm, namely the quantum algorithm that solves
the Discrete Log problem.
