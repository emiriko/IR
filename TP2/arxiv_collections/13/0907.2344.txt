We demonstrate fast and accurate control of the evolution of collective
atomic coherences in an Erbium doped solid using external electric fields. This
is achieved by controlling the inhomogeneous broadening of Erbium ions emitting
at 1536 nm using an electric field gradient and the linear Stark effect. The
manipulation of atomic coherence is characterized with the collective
spontaneous emission (optical free induction decay) emitted by the sample after
an optical excitation, which does not require any previous preparation of the
atoms. We show that controlled dephasing and rephasing of the atoms by the
electric field result in collapses and revivals of the optical free induction
decay. Our results show that the use of external electric fields does not
introduce any substantial additional decoherence and enables the manipulation
of collective atomic coherence with a very high degree of precision on the time
scale of tens of ns. This provides an interesting resource for photonic quantum
state storage and quantum state manipulation.
