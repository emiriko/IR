Recently different experiments mention to have observed a large scale
cosmic-ray anisotropy at TeV energies, e.g. Milagro, Tibet and
Super-Kamiokande. For these energies the cosmic-rays are expected to be nearly
isotropic. Any measurements of cosmic-rays anisotropy could bring some
information about propagation and origin of cosmic-rays. Though the primary aim
of the ANTARES neutrino telescope is the detection of high energy cosmic
neutrinos, the detector measures mainly down-doing muons, which are decay
products of cosmic-rays collisions in the Earth's atmosphere. This proceeding
describes an anlaysis method for the first year measurement of down-going
atmospheric muons at TeV energies in the ANTARES experiment, when five out of
the final number of twelve lines were taking data.
