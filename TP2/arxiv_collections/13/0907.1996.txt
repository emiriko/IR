We study the effects of unparticle physics on the cosmic ray photon and
$e^\pm$, including on the pair production (PP) and elastic scattering (ES) of
cosmic ray photon off various background radiations, and on the inverse Compton
scattering of cosmic ray $e^\pm$ with cosmic radiations. We compute the
spin-averaged amplitudes squared of three processes and find that the advent of
unparticle will never significantly change the interactions of cosmic ray
photon and $e^\pm$ with various background radiations, although the available
papers show that ES which occurs in the tree-level through unparticle exchanges
will easily surpass PP in the approximate parameter regions.
