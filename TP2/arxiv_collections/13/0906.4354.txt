We present an efficient low-rank updating algorithm for updating the trial
wavefunctions used in Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The algorithm is
based on low-rank updating of the Slater determinants. In particular, the
computational complexity of the algorithm is O(kN) during the k-th step
compared with traditional algorithms that require O(N^2) computations, where N
is the system size. For single determinant trial wavefunctions the new
algorithm is faster than the traditional O(N^2) Sherman-Morrison algorithm for
up to O(N) updates. For multideterminant configuration-interaction type trial
wavefunctions of M+1 determinants, the new algorithm is significantly more
efficient, saving both O(MN^2) work and O(MN^2) storage. The algorithm enables
more accurate and significantly more efficient QMC calculations using
configuration interaction type wavefunctions.
