We have studied the synchronization induced by periodic inputs applied to the
finite $N$-unit coupled bistable Langevin model which is subjected to
cross-correlated additive and multiplicative noises. Effects on the
synchronization of the system size ($N$), the coupling strength and the
cross-correlation between additive and multiplicative noises have been
investigated with the use of the semi-analytical augmented moment method (AMM)
which is the second-order moment approximation for local and global variables
[H. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 67} (2003) 041903]. A linear analysis of the
stationary solution of AMM equations shows that the stability is improved
(degraded) by positive (negative) couplings. Results of the nonlinear bistable
Langevin model are compared to those of the linear Langevin model.
