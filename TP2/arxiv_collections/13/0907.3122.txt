The role of $CPT$ invariance and consequences for bipartite entanglement of
neutral (K) mesons are discussed. A relaxation of $CPT$ leads to a modification
of the entanglement which is known as the $\omega$ effect. The relaxation of
assumptions required to prove the $CPT$ theorem are examined within the context
of models of space-time foam. It is shown that the evasion of the EPR type
entanglement implied by $CPT$ (which is connected with spin statistics) is
rather elusive. Relaxation of locality (through non-commutative geometry) or
the introduction of decoherence by themselves do not lead to a destruction of
the entanglement. So far we find only one model which is based on non-critical
strings and D-particle capture and recoil that leads to a stochastic
contribution to the space-time metric and consequent change in the neutral
meson bipartite entanglement. The lack of an omega effect is demonstrated for a
class of models based on thermal like baths which are generally considered as
generic models of decoherence.
