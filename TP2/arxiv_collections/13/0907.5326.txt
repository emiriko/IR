In this paper, by using bifurcation method, we successfully find the
Fornberg-Whitham equation has a type of traveling wave solutions called
kink-like wave solutions and antikinklike wave solutions. They are defined on
some semifinal bounded domains and possess properties of kink waves and
anti-kink waves. Their implicit expressions are obtained. For some concrete
data, the graphs of the implicit functions are displayed, and the numerical
simulation is made. The results show that our theoretical analysis agrees with
the numerical simulation.
