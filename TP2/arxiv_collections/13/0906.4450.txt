The increasing focus on unquenched lattice simulations has revived interest
also in gluonic screening masses, whose inverses characterise the longest
length scales at which thermal fluctuations are correlated in a hot non-Abelian
plasma. We fill an apparent gap in the literature concerning the theoretical
structure of one of the relevant screening masses (the one which equals twice
the Debye mass at leading order), by showing that the next-to-leading order
correction to it is perturbative and small. This surprising result appears to
explain semi-quantitatively why this particular channel yields the smallest
gluonic screening mass at temperatures around a few hundred MeV (it couples to
the energy density and to the real part of the Polyakov loop), even though it
is not among the smallest screening masses at asymptotically high temperatures.
