We have searched for 14.4 keV solar axions or more general axion-like
particles (ALPs), that may be emitted in the M1 nuclear transition of 57Fe, by
using the axion-to-photon conversion in the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST)
with evacuated magnet bores (Phase I). From the absence of excess of the
monoenergetic X-rays when the magnet was pointing to the Sun, we set
model-independent constraints on the coupling constants of pseudoscalar
particles that couple to two photons and to a nucleon g_{a\gamma} |-1.19
g_{aN}^{0}+g_{aN}^{3}|<1.36\times 10^{-16} GeV^{-1} for m_{a}<0.03 eV at the
95% confidence level.
