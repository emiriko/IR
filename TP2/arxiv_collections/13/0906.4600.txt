Context. We diagnose the properties of the plume and interplume regions in a
polar coronal hole and the role of waves in the acceleration of the solar wind.
Aims. We attempt to detect whether Alfven waves are present in the polar
coronal holes through variations in EUV line widths. Methods. Using spectral
observations performed over a polar coronal hole region with the EIS
spectrometer on Hinode, we study the variation in the line width and electron
density as a function of height. We use the density sensitive line pairs of Fe
xii 186.88 A & 195.119 A and Fe xiii 203.82 A & 202.04 A . Results. For the
polar region, the line width data show that the nonthermal line-of-sight
velocity increases from 26 km/s at 1000 above the limb to 42 km/s some 15000
(i.e. 110,000 km) above the limb. The electron density shows a decrease from
3:3 10^9 cm^-3 to 1:9 10^8 cm^-3 over the same distance. Conclusions. These
results imply that the nonthermal velocity is inversely proportional to the
quadratic root of the electron density, in excellent agreement with what is
predicted for undamped radially propagating linear Alfven waves. Our data
provide signatures of Alfven waves in the polar coronal hole regions, which
could be important for the acceleration of the solar wind.
