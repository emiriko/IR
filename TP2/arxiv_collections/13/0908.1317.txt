We have used fibre spectroscopy to establish cluster membership and examine
pre-main-sequence (PMS) lithium depletion for low-mass stars (spectral types F
to M) in the sparse young (~30 Myr) cluster IC 4665. We present a filtered
candidate list of 40 stars that should contain 75 per cent of single cluster
members with V of 11.5 to 18 in the central square degree of the cluster.
Whilst F- and G-type stars in IC 4665 have depleted little or no lithium, the
K- and early M-type stars have depleted more Li than expected when compared
with similar stars in other clusters of known age. An empirical age estimate
based on Li-depletion among the late-type stars of IC 4665 would suggest it is
older than 100 Myr. This disagrees entirely with ages determined either from
the nuclear turn-off, from isochronal matches to low-mass stars or from the
re-appearance of lithium previously found in much lower mass stars (the
``lithium depletion boundary''). We suggest that other parameters besides age,
perhaps composition or rotation, are very influential in determining the degree
of PMS Li-depletion in stars with M greater than 0.5 Msun. Further work is
required to identify and assess the effects of these additional parameters,
particularly to probe conditions at the interface between the sub-photospheric
convection zone and developing radiative core. Until then, PMS Li depletion in
F- to early M-type stars cannot be confidently used as a precise age indicator
in young clusters, kinematic groups or individual field stars.
