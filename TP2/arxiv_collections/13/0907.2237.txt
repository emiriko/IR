This paper presents an analysis that searched for systematic effects within
the CoRoT exoplanet field light curves. The analysis identified a systematic
effect that modified the zero point of most CoRoT exposures as a function of
stellar magnitude. We could find this effect only after preparing a set of
learning light curves that were relatively free of stellar and instrumental
noise. Correcting for this effect, rejecting outliers that appear in almost
every exposure, and applying SysRem, reduced the stellar RMS by about 20 %,
without attenuating transit signals.
