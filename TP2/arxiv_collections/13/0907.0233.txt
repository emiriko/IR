Using WMAP 5 year data, we look for the average Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
(SZE) signal from clusters of galaxies by stacking the regions around hundreds
of known X-ray clusters. We detect the average SZE at a very high significance
level. The average cluster signal is spatially resolved in the W band. This
mean signal is compared with the expected signal from the same clusters
calculated on the basis of archival ROSAT data. From the comparison we conclude
that the observed SZE seems to be less than the expected signal derived from
X-ray measurements when a standard beta-model is assumed for the gas
distribution. This conclusion is model dependent. Our predictions depend mostly
on the assumptions made about the core radius of clusters and the slope of the
gas density profile. Models with steeper profiles are able to simultaneously
fit both X-ray and WMAP data better than a beta-model. However, the agreement
is not perfect and we find that it is still difficult to make the X-ray and SZE
results agree. A model assuming point source contamination in SZE clusters
renders a better fit to the one-dimensional SZE profiles thus suggesting that
contamination from point sources could be contributing to a diminution of the
SZE signal. Selecting a model that better fits both X-ray and WMAP data away
from the very central region, we estimate the level of contamination and find
that on average, the point source contamination is on the level of 16 mJy (at
41 GHz), 26 mJy (at 61 GHz) and 18 mJy (at 94 GHz). These estimated fluxes are
marginally consistent with the estimated contamination derived from radio and
infrared surveys thus suggesting that the combination of a steeper gas profile
and the contribution from point sources allows us to consistently explain the
X-ray emission and SZE in galaxy clusters as measured by ROSAT and WMAP.
