I will present here my perception on the status of Deep Inelastic Scattering
physics, as I have further developed it during this Workshop, together with a
number of comments on the results that have impressed me most during this week.
I will emphasize a number of open problems and of critical areas. Finally I
conclude with some projections and auspices for the future of the field.
