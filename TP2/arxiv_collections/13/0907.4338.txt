Random nonlinear layered structures have been found to be a useful source of
photon pairs with perfectly indistinguishable un-entangled photons emitted into
a very narrow spectral range. Localization of the interacting optical fields
typical for random structures gives relatively high photon-pair fluxes.
Superposing photon-pair emission quantum paths at different emission angles,
several kinds of two-photon states (including states with coincident
frequencies) useful in quantum-information processing can easily be generated.
