The most commonly employed formalisms of radiative energy loss have been
derived in the high- energy approximation. In its present form, it is reliable
only for the medium modifications of inclusive particle spectra. Modifications
to this formalism are expected to be important for less inclusive measurements.
This is especially relevant for reconstructed jets in heavy-ion collisions,
which are becoming available only recently. We present some ideas to overcome
this limitation. Specifically, we show an implementation of radiative energy
loss within a jet parton shower. This implementation has been done within the
PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator. We present the publicly available routine
Q-PYTHIA and discuss some of the obtained physics results.
