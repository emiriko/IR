A tight-binding model for eg electrons coupled to Jahn-Teller lattice
distortions is studied via unbiased Monte- Carlo simulations. By focusing on
the periodicity of the Jahn Teller distortions, and the one-particle spectral
function, our results clarify the physical origin of the Fermi-arcs phase
observed in layered manganites. In a range of parameters where no broken
symmetry phase exists, the nearly nested Fermi surface favors certain
correlations between Jahn Teller distortions. The spectral weight near the
Brillouin zone edge is suppressed, leading to the pseudogap in the density of
states. We discuss the stability of this phase as a function of temperature and
coupling strength for different hole dopings.
