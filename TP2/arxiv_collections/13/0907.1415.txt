Some progress in understanding AGN variability is reviewed. Reprocessing of
X-ray radiation to produce significant amounts of longer-wavelength continua
seems to be ruled out. In some objects where there has been correlated X-ray
and optical variability, the amplitude of the optical variability has exceeded
the amplitude of X-ray variability. We suggest that accelerated particles
striking material could be linking X-ray and optical variability (as in
activity in the solar chromosphere). Beaming effects could be significant in
all types of AGN. The diversity in optical/X-ray relationships at different
times in the same object, and between different objects, might be explained by
changes in geometry and directions of motion relative to our line of sight.
Linear shot-noise models of the variability are ruled out; instead there must
be large-scale organization of variability. Variability occurs on
light-crossing timescales rather than viscous timescales and this probably
rules out the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk. Radio-loud and
radio-quiet AGNs have similar continuum shapes and similar variability
properties. This suggests similar continuum origins and variability mechanisms.
Despite their extreme X-ray variability, narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) do not
show extreme optical variability.
