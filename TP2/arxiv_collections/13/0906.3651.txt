Thomson scattering in non-ideal (collision-dominated) two-component plasmas
is calculated accounting for electron-ion collisions as well as
electron-electron correlations. This is achieved by using a novel interpolation
scheme for the electron-electron response function generalizing the traditional
Mermin approach. Also, ions are treated as randomly distributed inert
scattering centers. The collision frequency is taken as a dynamic and complex
quantity and is calculated from a microscopic quantum-statistical approach.
Implications due to different approximations for the electron-electron
correlation, i.e. different forms of the OCP local field correction, are
discussed.
