It is natural for humans to collaborate while dealing with complex problems.
In this article I consider this process of collaboration in the context of
information seeking. The study and discussion presented here are driven by two
dissatisfactions: (1) the majority of IR systems today do not facilitate
collaboration directly, and (2) the concept of collaboration itself is not
well-understood. I begin by probing the notion of collaboration and propose a
model that helps us understand the requirements for a successful collaboration.
A model of a Collaborative Information Seeking (CIS) environment is then
rendered based on an extended model of information seeking.
