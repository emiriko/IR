The decays of pseudoscalar bottomonium eta_b into a pair of vector charmonia,
J/\psi J/\psi, J/\psi \psi', \psi' \psi' are considered in the light cone
formalism. Relativistic and leading logarithmic radiative corrections to the
amplitudes of these processes are resummed. It is shown that the small value
for the branching ratio of the decay eta_b-> J/\psi J/\psi obtained within the
leading order nonrelativistic QCD is a consequence of a fine-tuning between
certain parameters, which is broken when relativistic and leading logarithmic
radiative corrections are taken into account. As a result, the branching ratio
obtained in this paper is enhanced by an order of magnitude.
