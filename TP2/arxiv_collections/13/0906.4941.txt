We study the influence of energy levels broadening and electron subsystem
overheating in island electrode (cluster) on current-voltage characteristics of
three-electrode structure. A calculation scheme for broadening effect in
one-dimensional case is suggested. Estimation of broadening is performed for
electron levels in disc-like and spherical gold clusters. Within the
two-temperature model of metallic cluster and by using a size dependence of the
Debye frequency the effective electron temperature as a function of bias
voltage is found approximately. We suggest that the effects of broadening and
electron overheating are responsible for the strong smoothing of
current-voltage curves, which is observed experimentally at low temperatures in
structures based on clusters consisting of accountable number of atoms.
