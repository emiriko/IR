The stacking faults (deviates from Bernal) will break the translational
symmetry of multilayer graphenes and modify their electronic and optical
behaviors to the extent depending on the interlayer coupling strength. This
paper addresses the stacking-induced band splitting and folding effect on the
electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene. Based on the
first-principles density functional theory study, we predict that the band
folding effect of graphene layers may enable the G band Raman double resonance
in the visible excitation range. Such prediction is confirmed experimentally
with our Raman observation that the resonant energies of the resonant G mode
are strongly dependent on the stacking geometry of graphene layers.
