In the context of guided optics, we derive, analytically and geometrically, a
rigorous general criterion to design wavelength insensitive interferometers
with mirror symmetry, which are needed for wavelength
multiplexing/demultiplexing. The criterion is applied to a practical case,
resulting in an interferometer that works on a band wider than 70 nm.
