We study the field/antifield formulation of pure Yang Mills theory in the
framework of finite field dependent BRST transformation. We show that the
generating functionals corresponding to different solutions of quantum master
equation are connected through the finite field dependent BRST transformations.
We establish this result with the help of several explicit examples.
