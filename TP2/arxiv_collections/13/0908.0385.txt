We investigate accelerated electron energy spectra for different sources in a
large flare using simultaneous observations obtained with two instruments, the
Nobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH) at 17 and 34 GHz, and the Reuven Ramaty High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) at hard X-rays. This flare is one of
the few in which emission up to energies exceeding 200 keV can be imaged in
hard X-rays. Furthermore, we can investigate the spectra of individual sources
up to this energy. We discuss and compare the HXR and microwave spectra and
morphology. Although the event overall appears to correspond to the standard
scenario with magnetic reconnection under an eruptive filament, several of its
features do not seem to be consistent with popular flare models. In particular
we find that (1) microwave emissions might be optically thick at high
frequencies despite a low peak frequency in the total flux radio spectrum,
presumably due to the inhomogeneity of the emitting source; (2) magnetic fields
in high-frequency radio sources might be stronger than sometimes assumed; (3)
sources spread over a very large volume can show matching evolution in their
hard X-ray spectra that may provide a challenge to acceleration models. Our
results emphasize the importance of studies of sunspot-associated flares and
total flux measurements of radio bursts in the millimeter range.
