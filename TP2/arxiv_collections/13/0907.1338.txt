In this paper, we examine the structure of vertex- and edge-transitive
strongly regular graphs, using normal quotient reduction. We show that the
irreducible graphs in this family have quasiprimitive automorphism groups, and
prove (using the Classification of Finite Simple Groups) that no graph in this
family has a holomorphic simple automorphism group. We also find some
constraints on the parameters of the graphs in this family that reduce to
complete graphs.
