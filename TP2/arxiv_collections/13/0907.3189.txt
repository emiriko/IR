We study how much noise can be tolerated by a universal gate set before it
loses its quantum-computational power. Specifically we look at circuits with
perfect stabilizer operations in addition to imperfect non-stabilizer gates. We
prove that for all unitary single-qubit gates there exists a tight depolarizing
noise threshold that determines whether the gate enables universal quantum
computation or if the gate can be simulated by a mixture of Clifford gates.
This exact threshold is determined by the Clifford polytope spanned by the 24
single-qubit Clifford gates. The result is in contrast to the situation wherein
non-stabilizer qubit states are used; the thresholds in that case are not
currently known to be tight.
