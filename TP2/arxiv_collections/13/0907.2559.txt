The major loss mechanism of photogenerated polarons was investigated in
P3HT:PCBM solar cells by the photo-CELIV technique. For pristine and annealed
devices, we find that the experimental data can be explained by a bimolecular
recombination rate reduced by a factor of about ten (pristine) and 25
(annealed) as compared to Langevin theory. Aided by a macroscopic device model,
we discuss the implications of the lowered loss rate on the characteristics of
polymer:fullerene solar cells.
