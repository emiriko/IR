It has been postulated that globular clusters could be sources of Very-High
Energy (VHE) gamma rays, powered by milli-second pulsars. This could be due to
cumulative direct emission or to plerion-type emission driven by colliding
winds. In particular the southern hemisphere globular cluster 47 Tuc has been
singled out as a potential source in both models. In light of the recent
detection by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) of 47 Tuc, the first
detection of any globular cluster as a gamma-ray source, we present the results
of observations of northern hemisphere globular clusters by VERITAS. Three
globular clusters have been observed: M15, M13 and M5. Of these, M15 and M13
have been explicitly proposed as VHE gamma-ray sources and M5 possess
similarities with them.
