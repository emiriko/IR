I briefly introduce the theoretical frameworks for studies of two-body
hadronic $B$ meson decays, which include the factorization assumption, the
QCD-improved factorization, the perturbative QCD, the soft-collinear effective
theory, the light-cone QCD sum rules, and the quark-diagram parametrization.
