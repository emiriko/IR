The text of Laplace, \textit{Sur l'application du calcul des probabilit\'es
\`a la philosophie naturelle,} (Th\'eorie Analytique des Probabilit\'es.
Troisi\`eme \'Edition. Premier Suppl\'ement), 1820, is quoted in the context of
the Gram-Schmidt algorithm. We provide an English translation of Laplace's
manuscript (originally in French) and interpret the algorithms of Laplace in a
contemporary context. The two algorithms given by Laplace computes the mean and
the variance of two components of the solution of a linear statistical model.
The first algorithm can be interpreted as {\em reverse square-root-free
modified Gram-Schmidt by row} algorithm on the regression matrix. The second
algorithm can be interpreted as the {\em reverse square-root-free Cholesky}
algorithm.
