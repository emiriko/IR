By using a No-Scale Supergravity model, which was proved to explain WMAP
observations appropriately, a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and a
preheating just after the end of inflation are investigated. Non-thermal
production rate of gravitino is estimated as well as supersymmetry breaking
mechanism numerically. The supersymmetry breaking is triggered by the inflaton
superfield alone and the interchange of supersymmetry breaking fields does not
occur in our model. By the instant preheating mechanism, the preheating
temperature is calculated through the process where the inflaton decays into
right handed sneutrinos, which will decay into Higgs fields and others. The
obtained value of the yield variable for gravitino is rather large, however,
the primordial gravitinos decay very rapidly and the preheating temperature is
lower than the gravitino mass, the effect to the standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis (BBN) scenario is negligible. Though a tachyonic state seems to
appear from modular field T, it will be solved by assuming the spontaneous
breaking of modular invariance. Whether or not the fact is a defect, we
emphasize that the model still seems phenomenologically effective.
