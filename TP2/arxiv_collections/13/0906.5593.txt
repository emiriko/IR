The solution of non-linear evolution equations for dense nuclear gluon
density has been suggested as one of the relevant mechanisms of pA and AA
collisions at collider energies. Here we study a simple parameterization for
the unintegrated gluon distribution using the knowledge of asymptotic solutions
of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, describing high-energy QCD in the presence
of saturation effects. A satisfactory description of nuclear shadowing at
small-x is obtained and it allows us to understand the qualitative behavior
shown by data.
