In this work a simple classical analog of the quantum Zeno effect is
suggested. As it is well known, in the quantum mechanics, in the limit of the
infinite series of alternative short dynamical evolution and measurement, an
unstable quantum system will never decay, that is called quantum Zeno effect.
Here an ideal (without resistance), classical LC oscillating circuit with quick
switch ON-OFF alternation is considered. In the limit of the infinite series of
alternative short electrical current regime (switch in the ON state) and
no-current regime (current breaking by quick switch ON-OFF state alternation)
given LC circuit will never oscillate. Obviously, it represents a classical
electro-dynamical Zeno effect deeply analogous to quantum Zeno effect. All this
admits a general definition of the Zeno effect that includes both quantum and
classical cases (without any classical interpretation of the quantum Zeno
effect or quantum interpretation of the classical Zeno effect).
