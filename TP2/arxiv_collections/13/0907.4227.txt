The remarkably high superconducting transition temperature and upper critical
field of iron(Fe)-based layered superconductors, despite ferromagnetic material
base, open the prospect for superconducting electronics. However, success in
superconducting electronics has been limited because of difficulties in
fabricating high-quality thin films. We report the growth of high-quality
c-axis-oriented cobalt(Co)-doped SrFe2As2 thin films with bulk
superconductivity by using an in-situ pulsed laser deposition technique with a
248-nm-wavelength KrF excimer laser and an arsenic(As)-rich phase target. The
temperature and field dependences of the magnetization showing strong
diamagnetism and transport critical current density with superior Jc-H
performance are reported. These results provide necessary information for
practical applications of Fe-based superconductors.
