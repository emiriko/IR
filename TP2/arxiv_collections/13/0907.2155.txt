In a previous work (arXiv:0902.3750 [hep-th]) we studied the world-sheet
conformal invariance for superstrings in type IIB R-R plane-wave in
semi-light-cone gauge. Here we give further justification to the results found
in that work through alternative arguments using dynamical supersymmetries. We
show that by using the susy algebra the same quantum definition of the
energy-momentum (EM) tensor can be derived. Furthermore, using certain Jacobi
identities we indirectly compute the Virasoro anomaly terms by calculating
second order susy variation of the EM tensor. Certain integrated form of all
such terms are shown to vanish. In order to deal with various divergences that
appear in such computations we take a point-split definition of the same EM
tensor. The final results are shown not to suffer from the ordering ambiguity
as noticed in the previous work provided the coincidence limit is taken before
sending the regularization parameter to zero at the end of the computation.
