An approach to calculate microscopic optical potential (OP) with the real
part obtained by a folding procedure and with the imaginary part inherent in
the high-energy approximation (HEA) is applied to study the $^8$He+p elastic
scattering data at energies of tens of MeV/nucleon (MeV/N). The neutron and
proton density distributions obtained in different models for $^{8}$He are
utilized in the calculations of the differential cross sections. The role of
the spin-orbit potential is studied. Comparison of the calculations with the
available experimental data on the elastic scattering differential cross
sections at beam energies of 15.7, 26.25, 32, 66 and 73 MeV/N is performed. The
problem of the ambiguities of the depths of each component of the optical
potential is considered by means of the imposed physical criterion related to
the known behavior of the volume integrals as functions of the incident energy.
It is shown also that the role of the surface absorption is rather important,
in particular for the lowest incident energies (e.g., 15.7 and 26.25
MeV/nucleon).
