In this Letter we propose the concept of the evanescent Airy beam. We analyze
the structure of the ideal evanescent Airy beam, which initial profile has the
Airy form, while the spectral decomposition consists of only evanescent partial
waves. Also, we discuss the refraction of the Airy beam through the interface
and investigate the field of the transmitted evanescent Airy beam.
