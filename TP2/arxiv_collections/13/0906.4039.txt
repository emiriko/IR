In this paper the author formulates and proves a theorem that relates
smoothness of kinetic energy and smoothness of vorticity in a 3-D Navier-Stokes
fluid. Setting velocity and vorticity boundary conditions, a direct relation
arises between kinetic energy and the squared Euclidean norm of the vorticity.
As a direct result, their smoothness is closely related.
