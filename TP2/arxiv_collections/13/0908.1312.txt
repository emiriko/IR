In this paper, we introduce a real-space renormalization transformation for
random spin systems on 2D lattices. The general method is formulated for random
systems and results from merging two well known real space renormalization
techniques, namely the strong disorder renormalization technique (SDRT) and the
contractor renormalization (CORE). We analyze the performance of the method on
the 2D random transverse field Ising model (RTFIM).
