With the commissioning of the second MAGIC gamma-ray Cherenkov telescope
situated close to MAGIC-I, the standard analysis package of the MAGIC
collaboration, MARS, has been upgraded in order to perform the stereoscopic
reconstruction of the detected atmospheric showers. MARS is a ROOT-based code
written in C++, which includes all the necessary algorithms to transform the
raw data recorded by the telescopes into information about the physics
parameters of the observed targets. An overview of the methods for extracting
the basic shower parameters is presented, together with a description of the
tools used in the background discrimination and in the estimation of the
gamma-ray source spectra.
