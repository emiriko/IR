We study the rich properties of the imbalanced antiferromagnet in an optical
lattice. We present its phase diagram, discuss spin waves and explore the
emergence of topological excitations in two dimensions, known as merons, which
are responsible for a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that has never
unambiguously been observed.
