In 2004 we have shown that substantial part of conductivity in graphite is
provided by holes with massless linear spectrum - Dirac Fermions that coexist
with massive normal carriers - electrons. In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 166403 (2009), arXiv:0902.1925] Schneider et al. revised our conclusion
pointed that both types of carriers are massive. Since both groups use the same
method of phase determination of Shubnikov de Haas oscillation we comment here
that the controversy originates from the improper treatment of experimental
results in Schneider2009 et al.
