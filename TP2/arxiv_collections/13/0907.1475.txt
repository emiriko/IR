Recent precision spin-structure data from Jefferson Lab have significantly
advanced our knowledge of nucleon structure at low $Q^2$. Results on the
neutron spin sum rules and polarizabilities in the low to intermediate $Q^2$
region are presented. The Burkhardt-Cuttingham Sum Rule was verified within
experimental uncertainties. When comparing with theoretical calculations,
results on spin polarizability show surprising disagreements with Chiral
Perturbation Theory predictions. Preliminary results on first moments at very
low $Q^2$ are also presented.
