Evidence confirming that OA increases impact will not be sufficient to induce
enough researchers to provide OA; only mandates from their institutions and
funders can ensure that. HEP researchers continue to submit their papers to
peer-reviewed journals, as they always did, depositing both their unrefereed
preprints and their refereed postprints. None of that has changed. In fields
like HEP and astrophysics, the journal affordability/accessibility problem is
not as great as in many other fields, where it the HEP Early Access impact
advantage translates into the OA impact advantage itself. Almost no one has
ever argued that Gold OA provides a greater OA advantage than Green OA. The OA
advantage is the OA advantage, whether Green or Gold.
