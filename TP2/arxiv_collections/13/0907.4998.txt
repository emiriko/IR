We study charge transport in an ionic solution in a confined nanoscale
geometry in the presence of an externally applied electric field and immobile
background charges. For a range of parameters, the ion current shows
non-monotonic behavior as a function of the external ion concentration. For
small applied electric field, the ion transport can be understood from simple
analytic arguments, which are supported by Monte Carlo simulation. The results
qualitatively explain measurements of ion current seen in a recent experiment
on ion transport through a DNA-threaded nanopore (D. J. Bonthuis et. al., Phys.
Rev. Lett, vol. 97, 128104 (2006)).
