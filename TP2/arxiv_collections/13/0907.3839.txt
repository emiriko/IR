Quantum repeaters based on atomic ensemble quantum memories are promising
candidates for achieving scalable distribution of entanglement over long
distances. Recently, important experimental progress has been made towards
their implementation. However, the entanglement rates and scalability of
current approaches are limited by relatively low retrieval and single-photon
detector efficiencies. We propose a scheme, which makes use of fluorescent
detection of stored excitations to significantly increase the efficiency of
connection and hence the rate. Practical performance and possible experimental
realizations of the new protocol are discussed.
