We report a novel application of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the
purpose of accelerating the search pipelines for gravitational waves from
coalescing binaries of compact objects. A speed-up of 16 fold has been achieved
compared with a single central processing unit (CPU). We show that substantial
improvements are possible and discuss the reduction in CPU count required for
the detection of inspiral sources afforded by the use of GPUs.
