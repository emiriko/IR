In this paper a 4-component Dirac theory of ionization of hydrogen molecular
ion in a super-intense laser field is developed. Simple analytic expressions
for the spin specific as well as the total ionization currents emitted from the
ground state of the ion are derived. The results are given for all polarization
and finite propagation vectors of the field. They apply for inner-shell
ionization of analogous heavier molecular ions as well. The presence of
molecular two-slit interference effect, first found in the non-relativistic
case, and the spin-flip ionization current, and an asymmetry of the up- and
down-spin currents similar to that predicted in the atomic case, are found also
to hold for the present relativistic molecular ionic case. Finally, the
possibility of controlling the dominant spin currents by selecting the
handedness of a circularly polarized incident laser field is pointed out.
