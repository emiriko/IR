We derive the event-by-event likelihood that allows to extract the complete
information contained in the energy, time and direction of supernova neutrinos,
and specify it in the case of SN1987A data. We resolve discrepancies in the
previous literature, numerically relevant already in the concrete case of
SN1987A data.
