Using the transfer matrix technique, we investigate the propagation of
electron through a two dimensional disordered sample. We find that the spatial
distribution of electrons is homogeneous only in the limit of weak disorder
(diffusive transport regime). In the limit of very strong disorder, we identify
a narrow channel through which the electron propagates from one side of the
sample to the opposite side. Even in this limit, we prove the wave character of
the electron propagation.
