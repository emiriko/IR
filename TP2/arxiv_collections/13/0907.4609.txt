The quark antiquark potential, and its associated zero point energy, can be
extracted from lattice measurements of the Wilson loop. We discuss a unique
prescription to renormalize the Wilson loop, for which the perturbative
contribution to the zero point energy vanishes identically. A zero point energy
can arise nonperturbatively, which we illustrate by considering effective
string models. The nonperturbative contribution to the zero point energy
vanishes in the Nambu model, but is nonzero when terms for extrinsic curvature
are included. At one loop order, the nonperturbative contribution to the zero
point energy is negative, regardless of the sign of the extrinsic curvature
term.
