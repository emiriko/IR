A result of Zyczkowski and Sommers [J.Phys.A, 33, 2045--2057 (2000)] gives
the eigenvalue probability density function for the top N x N sub-block of a
Haar distributed matrix from U(N+n). In the case n \ge N, we rederive this
result, starting from knowledge of the distribution of the sub-blocks,
introducing the Schur decomposition, and integrating over all variables except
the eigenvalues. The integration is done by identifying a recursive structure
which reduces the dimension. This approach is inspired by an analogous approach
which has been recently applied to determine the eigenvalue probability density
function for random matrices A^{-1} B, where A and B are random matrices with
entries standard complex normals. We relate the eigenvalue distribution of the
sub-blocks to a many body quantum state, and to the one-component plasma, on
the pseudosphere.
