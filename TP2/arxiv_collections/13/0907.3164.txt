We show that the spin wavelets on the sphere $S^2$, which were constructed by
the first author and Marinucci in an earlier article, can be chosen so as to
form a nearly tight frame. These spin wavelets can be applied to the study of
the polarization of cosmic microwave background radiation. For certain of these
frames, there is a positive $C$ such that each frame element at scale $a^j$ is
supported in a geodesic ball of radius $Ca^j$.
