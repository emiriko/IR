Corrections to the relativistic theory of orbits are discussed considering
higher order approximations induced by gravitomagnetic effects. Beside the
standard periastron effect of General Relativity (GR), a new nutation effect
was found due to the ${\displaystyle c^{-3}}$ orbital correction. According to
the presence of that new nutation effect we studied the gravitational waveforms
emitted through the capture in a gravitational field of a massive black hole
(MBH) of a compact object (neutron star (NS) or BH) via the quadrupole
approximation. We made a numerical study to obtain the emitted gravitational
wave (GW) amplitudes. We conclude that the effects we studied could be of
interest for the future space laser interferometric GW antenna LISA.
