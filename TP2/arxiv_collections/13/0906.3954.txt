(abridged) We analyzed the archived XMM-Newton observation of the poorly
studied low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1710-281 performed in 2004 that covered one
orbital period of the system (3.8 hr). The source shows dips as well as
eclipses, hence it is viewed close to edge-on. We modeled the spectral changes
between persistent and dips in the framework of the partial covering model and
the ionized absorber approach. The persistent spectrum can be fit by a power
law with a photon index of 1.94(+-0.02) affected by absorption from cool
material with a hydrogen column density of 0.401(+-0.007)*10^22 cm^-2. The
spectral changes from persistent to deep-dipping intervals are consistent with
the partial covering of the power-law emission, with the covering fraction
increasing from 26% during shallow dipping to 78% during deep dipping. We do
not detect any absorption lines from highly ionized species such as FeXXV. The
upper-limits we derive on their equivalent width (EW) are not constraining.
Despite not detecting any signatures of a warm absorber, we show that the
spectral changes are consistent with an increase in column density
(4.3(-0.5;+0.4)*10^22 cm^-2 during shallow dipping to 11.6(-0.6;+0.4)*10^22
cm^-2 during deep dipping) and a decrease in ionization state of a
highly-ionized absorber (10^2.52 during shallow dipping to 10^2.29 erg.s^-1.cm
during deep dipping), associated with a slight increase in the column density
of a neutral absorber. The parameters of the ionized absorber are not
constrained during persistent emission. The warm absorber model better accounts
for the ~1 keV depression visible in the pn dipping spectra, and naturally
explains it as a blend of lines and edges unresolved by pn. A deeper
observation of XTE J1710-281 would enable this interpretation to be confirmed.
