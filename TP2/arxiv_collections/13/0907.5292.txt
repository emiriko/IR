Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the medium-induced energy loss
of a decelerating heavy quark moving through a strongly-coupled supersymmetric
Yang Mills plasma. In the regime where the deceleration is small, a
perturbative calculation is possible and we obtain the first two corrections to
the energy-loss rate of a heavy quark with constant velocity. The
thermalization of the heavy quark is also discussed.
