In this paper, we construct a model of spinor fields interacting with
specific gauge fields on fuzzy sphere and analyze the chiral symmetry of this
'Schwinger model'. In constructing the theory of gauge fields interacting with
spinors on fuzzy sphere, we take the approach that the Dirac operator $D_q$ on
q-deformed fuzzy sphere $S_{qF}^2$ is the gauged Dirac operator on fuzzy
sphere. This introduces interaction between spinors and specific one parameter
family of gauge fields. We also show how to express the field strength for this
gauge field in terms of the Dirac operators $D_q$ and $D$ alone. Using the path
integral method, we have calculated the $2n-$point functions of this model and
show that, in general, they do not vanish, reflecting the chiral non-invariance
of the partition function.
