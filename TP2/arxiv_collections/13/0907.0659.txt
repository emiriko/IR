I discuss the statistical mechanics of gravitating systems and in particular
its cosmological implications, and argue that many conventional views on this
subject in the foundations of statistical mechanics embody significant
confusion; I attempt to provide a clearer and more accurate account. In
particular, I observe that (i) the role of gravity \emph{in} entropy
calculations must be distinguished from the entropy \emph{of} gravity, that
(ii) although gravitational collapse is entropy-increasing, this is not usually
because the collapsing matter itself increases in entropy, and that (iii) the
Second Law of Thermodynamics does not owe its validity to the statistical
mechanics of gravitational collapse.
