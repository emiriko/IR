Scanning tunneling spectroscopy studies on high-quality Bi$_2$Te$_3$ crystals
exhibit perfect correspondence to ARPES data, hence enabling identification of
different regimes measured in the local density of states (LDOS). Oscillations
of LDOS near a step are analyzed. Within the main part of the surface band
oscillations are strongly damped, supporting the hypothesis of topological
protection. At higher energies, as the surface band becomes concave,
oscillations appear which disperse with a particular wave-vector that may
result from an unconventional hexagonal warping term.
