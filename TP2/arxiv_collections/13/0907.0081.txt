We exhibit Lipschitz (and hence H\"older) potentials on the full shift
$\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ such that the associated Gibbs measures fail to converge
as the temperature goes to zero. Thus there are "exponentially decaying"
interactions on the configuration space $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z}$ for which the
zero-temperature limit of the associated Gibbs measures does not exist. In
higher dimension, namely on the configuration space $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^{d}}$,
$d\geq3$, we show that this non-convergence behavior can occur for finite-range
interactions, that is, for locally constant potentials.
