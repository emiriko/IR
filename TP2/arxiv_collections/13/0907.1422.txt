We report the detection of a complex of extraplanar warm H_2 knots and
filaments extending more than ~3 kpc above and below the galactic plane of M82,
roughly coincident with the well-known galactic wind in this system.
Comparisons of these data with published results at other wavelengths provide
quantitative constraints on the topology, excitation, heating, and stability
against disruption of the wind-entrained molecular ISM in this prototypical
galactic wind. Deep H_2 2.12 um observations such as these represent a
promising new method to study the elusive but potentially important molecular
component of galactic winds.
