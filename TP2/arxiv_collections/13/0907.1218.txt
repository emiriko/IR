Extended spectroscopic datasets of several late-B stars of luminosity class
Ia revealed the presence of similar peculiarities in their H alpha profiles,
which might be interpreted as indications of deviation from spherically
symmetric, smooth wind approximation. Surface structures due to non-radial
pulsations or weak, large-scale, dipole magnetic fields might be responsible
for creating wind structure in the envelopes of these stars.
