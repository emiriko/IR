We have recently completed a detailed scan of the 19-dimensional parameter
space of the phenomenological MSSM, i.e., the CP-conserving MSSM assuming
Minimal Flavor Violation(MFV) with the first two sfermion generations
degenerate. We found a large set of parameter space points that satisfied all
of the existing experimental and theoretical constraints. This analysis allows
us to examine the general features of the MSSM without reference to any
particular SUSY breaking scenario or any other assumptions about physics at
higher scales. This study opens up new possibilities for SUSY phenomenology
both at colliders and in astrophysical observations.
