In this note we establish estimates for the harmonic map heat flow from $S^1$
into a closed manifold, and use it to construct sweepouts with the following
good property: each curve in the tightened sweepout, whose energy is close to
the maximal energy of curves in the sweepout, is itself close to a closed
geodesic.
