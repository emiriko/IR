A phenomenological quasiparticle model, featuring dynamically generated
self-energies of excitation modes, successfully describes lattice QCD results
relevant for the QCD equation of state and related quantities both at zero and
non-zero net baryon density. Here, this model is extended to study bulk and
shear viscosities of the gluon-plasma within an effective kinetic theory
approach. In this way, the compatibility of the employed quasiparticle ansatz
with the apparent low viscosities of the strongly coupled deconfined gluonic
medium is shown.
