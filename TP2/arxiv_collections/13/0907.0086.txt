We construct a one-dimensional piecewise linear intermittent map from the
interevent time distribution for a given renewal process. Then, we characterize
intermittency by the asymptotic behavior near the indifferent fixed point in
the piecewise linear intermittent map. Thus, we provide a new framework to
understand a unified characterization of intermittency, and also present the
Lyapunov exponent of renewal processes. This method is applied to the
occurrence of earthquakes using the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog.
We demonstrate that interevent times are not independent and identically
distributed random variables by analyzing the return map of interevent times,
but that there is a systematic change in conditional probability distribution
functions of interevent times.
