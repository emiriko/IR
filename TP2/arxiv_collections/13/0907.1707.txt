The problem of the Nature of Time is twofold: whether or not time is a
fundamental quantity of Nature, and how does clock time of metrology emerge in
the experimental description of dynamics. This work strongly supports the
fundamental timelessness of Nature. However, the correct view that physics is
described by relations between variables does not address the second problem of
how time does emerge at the macroscopic scale on the ground of a timeless
framework. In this work ordinary Hamiltonian dynamics is recast in a timeless
formalism capable to provide a definition of parameter time on the basis of the
only generalized coordinates, together with the Hamiltonian invariance on
trajectories, and a variational principle. Next, by relaxing the assumption of
periodicity of real clocks to the only cyclicity in the phase space, the second
problem is addressed. Physical systems, if complex enough, can be separated in
a subsystem whose dynamics is described, and another cyclic subsystem which
behaves as a clock. The dynamics of the first is mapped in the states of the
second cyclic subsystem which provides a discrete approximation of the
parameter time. Useful clocks fulfill a stability prescription which guarantees
that dynamics is expressed by simple laws also in terms of metric time as
naturally happens for parameter time. The two ideas provide a unitary framework
capable to account the fundamental timelessness of Nature, and the experimental
evidence of time evolution in macroscopic systems experienced by the observers.
