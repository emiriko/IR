We analyze the asymptotic behavior of discrete-time, Markovian quantum
systems with respect to a subspace of interest. Global asymptotic stability of
subspaces is relevant to quantum information processing, in particular for
initializing the system in pure states or subspace codes. We provide a
linear-algebraic characterization of the dynamical properties leading to
invariance and attractivity of a given quantum subspace. We then construct a
design algorithm for discrete-time feedback control that allows to stabilize a
target subspace, proving that if the control problem is feasible, then the
algorithm returns an effective control choice. In order to prove this result, a
canonical QR matrix decomposition is derived, and also used to establish the
control scheme potential for the simulation of open-system dynamics.
