Surveillance control and reporting (SCR) system for air threats play an
important role in the defense of a country. SCR system corresponds to air and
ground situation management/processing along with information fusion,
communication, coordination, simulation and other critical defense oriented
tasks. Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment (TEWA) sits at the core of SCR
system. In such a system, maximal or near maximal utilization of constrained
resources is of extreme importance. Manual TEWA systems cannot provide
optimality because of different limitations e.g.surface to air missile (SAM)
can fire from a distance of 5Km, but manual TEWA systems are constrained by
human vision range and other constraints. Current TEWA systems usually work on
target-by-target basis using some type of greedy algorithm thus affecting the
optimality of the solution and failing in multi-target scenario. his paper
relates to a novel two-staged flexible dynamic decision support based optimal
threat evaluation and weapon assignment algorithm for multi-target air-borne
threats.
