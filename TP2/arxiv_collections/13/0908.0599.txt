We discuss the capability of AKARI in recovering diffuse far-infrared
emission, and examine the achieved reliability. Critical issues in making
images of diffuse emission are the transient response and long-term stability
of the far-infrared detectors. Quantitative evaluation of these characteristics
are the key to achieving sensitivity comparable to or better than that for
point sources (< 20 -- 95 MJy sr-1). We describe current activity and progress
toward the production of high quality images of the diffuse far-infrared
emission using the AKARI all-sky survey data.
