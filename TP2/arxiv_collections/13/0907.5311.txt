For a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold X, we show certain Zariski decomposition
for every pseudo-effective R-divisor, and give a sufficient condition for X to
be bimeromorphic to a (holomorphic) Lagrangian fibration. We also prove that
any sequence of D-flops between projective hyperk\"ahler manifolds terminates
after finite steps.
