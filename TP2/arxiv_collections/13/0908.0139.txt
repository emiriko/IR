We develop a symplectic method of quantization of lightcone QCD. We find that
boundary gauge fields are crucial for a consistent and complete quantization.
By applying the symplectic Faddeev-Jackiw method, we very carefully remove
unphysical degrees of freedom and obtain the true phase space and the complete
Hamiltonian. The result is important for the high energy QCD evolution and for
a further extension of the JIMWLK equation, for which we find the second-order
correction. Finally, we make an important note about a peculiarity of four
space-time dimensions. In additional, our method sheds new light on the
lightcone quantization of a scalar field.
