In our previous paper "Bruhat-Tits theory from Berkovich's point of view. I ?
Realizations and compactifications of buildings", we investigated realizations
of the Bruhat-Tits building B(G,k) of a connected and reductive linear
algebraic group G over a non-Archimedean field k in the framework of
Berkovich's non-Archimedean analytic geometry, and we studied in detail the
compactifications of the building which arise from this point of view. In this
paper, we give a representation theoretic flavor to these compactifications,
following Satake's original constructions for Riemannian symmetric spaces. We
first prove that Berkovich compactifications of a building coincide with the
compactifications previously introduced by the third named author and obtained
by a gluing procedure. Then we show how to recover them from an absolutely
irreducible linear representation of G by embedding B(G,k) in the building of
the general linear group of the representation space, compactified in a
suitable way. Existence of such an embedding is a special case of Landvogt's
general results on functoriality of buildings, but we also give another natural
construction of an equivariant embedding, which relies decisively on Berkovich
geometry.
