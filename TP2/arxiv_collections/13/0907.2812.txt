Energy-momentum and angular momentum carried by electromagnetic field of two
point-like charged particles arbitrarily moving in flat spacetime are
presented. Apart from usual contributions to the Noether quantities produced
separately by particles 1 and 2, the conservation laws contain also joint
contribution due to the fields of both particles. The mixed part of Maxwell
energy-momentum density is decomposed into bound and radiative components which
are separately conserved off the world lines of particles. The former describes
the deformation of electromagnetic clouds of ``bare'' charges due to mutual
interaction while the latter defines the radiation which escapes to infinity.
The bound terms contribute to particles' individual 4-momenta while the
radiative ones exert the radiation reaction. Analysis of energy-momentum and
angular momentum balance equations results the Lorentz-Dirac equation as an
equation of motion for a pointed charge under the influence of its own
electromagnetic field as well as field produced by another charge.
