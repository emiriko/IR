We discuss a notion of gluon-glueball duality analogous to quark-hadron
duality. We apply this idea to the radiative decay of heavy orthoquarkonium,
$Q\bar Q \to \gamma g g$, which has been used to search for glueballs. The
duality is first introduced in two simplified contexts: (i) a hypothetical
version of QCD without any light quarks and (ii) QCD in the large-$N_c$ limit.
We then discuss how an approximate form of this duality could hold in real QCD,
based on a hierarchy of time scales in the temporal evolution of the $gg$
subsystem in radiative orthoquarkonium decay. We apply this notion of
gluon-glueball duality to suggest a method that could be useful in experimental
searches for glueballs.
