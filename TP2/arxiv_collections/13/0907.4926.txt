In this study we set our system in order to study the energy spectrum of
single, double and triple particles, detected in a scintillation detector. The
goal of doing this experiment was to determine the probability of number of
particles (single, double or triple) detected, from the energy spectrum in any
given energy spectrum. The results of experiment will be used in our extensive
air shower array.
