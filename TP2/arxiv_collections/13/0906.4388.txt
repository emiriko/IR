We present a fully quantum mechanical treatment of optically rephased photon
echoes. These echoes exhibit noise due to amplified spontaneous emission,
however this noise can be seen as a consequence of the entanglement between the
atoms and the output light. With a rephasing pulse one can get an "echo" of the
amplified spontaneous emission, leading to light with nonclassical correlations
at points separated in time, which is of interest in the context of building
wide bandwidth quantum repeaters. We also suggest a wideband version of DLCZ
protocol based on the same ideas.
