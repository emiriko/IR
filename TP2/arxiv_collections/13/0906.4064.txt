In this paper we will summarize some of the most important results of the
Cassini mission concerning the satellites of Saturn. Given the long duration of
the mission, the complexity of the payload onboard the Cassini Orbiter and the
amount of data gathered on the satellites of Saturn, it would be impossible to
describe all the new discoveries made, therefore we will describe only some
selected, paramount examples showing how Cassini's data confirmed and extended
ground-based observations. In particular we will describe the achievements
obtained for the satellites Phoebe, Enceladus and Titan. We will also put these
examples in the perspective of the overall evolution of the system, stressing
out why the selected satellites are representative of the overall evolution of
the Saturn system.
