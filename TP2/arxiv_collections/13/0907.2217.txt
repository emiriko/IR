We construct the exact time dependent density profile for a superposition of
the ground and singly excited states of a harmonically trapped one dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate in the limit of strongly interacting particles, the
Tonks-Girardeau gas. Results of an off resonant light scattering experiment
probing the system could allow to determine the number of particles contained
in the gas, as well as the coefficients of the superposition.
