We use (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics to describe a variety of
different jet energy loss scenarios for a jet propagating through an opaque
medium. The conical correlations obtained for fully stopped jets, revealing a
Bragg peak, are discussed as well as results from pQCD and AdS/CFT. Moreover,
we investigate transverse flow deflection. It is demonstrated that a
double-peaked away-side structure can be formed due to the different
contributions of several possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium.
