Lightcurves have long been used to study stellar activity and have more
recently become a major tool in the field of exoplanet research. We discuss the
various ways in which stellar activity can influence transit lightcurves, and
study the effects using the outstanding photometric data of the CoRoT-2
exoplanet system. We report a relation between the `global' lightcurve and the
transit profiles which turn out to be shallower during high spot coverage on
the stellar surface. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a color dependence of
the transit lightcurve compatible with a wavelength-dependent limb darkening
law as observed on the Sun. Taking into account activity-related effects, we
re-determine the orbit inclination and planetary radius and find the planet to
be approximately 3% larger than reported previously. Our findings also show
that exoplanet research cannot generally ignore the effects of stellar
activity.
