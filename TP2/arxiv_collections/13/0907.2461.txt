We study the effect of a right-handed coupling of quarks to the W-boson on
the measurements of |V_ub| and |V_cb|. It is shown that such a coupling can
remove the discrepancies between the determinations of |V_ub| from
B\to\pi\ell\nu, B^+\to\tau^+ \nu and B\to X_u\ell\nu. Further the measurements
of |V_cb| from B\to D^*\ell\nu, B\to D\ell\nu and inclusive B\to X_c\ell\nu
decays can be brought into better agreement. We demonstrate that a right-handed
coupling can be generated within the MSSM by a finite gluino-squark loop. The
effect involves the parameters \delta^{u RL}_{23} and \delta^{u RL}_{13} of the
squark mass matrices, which are poorly constrained from other processes. On the
other hand, all gluino-squark corrections to the regular left-handed coupling
of the W-boson are found to be too small to be relevant.
