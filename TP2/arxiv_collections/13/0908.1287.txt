Electrical properties of multilayer arrays of germanium nanoclusters grown on
the silicon (001) surface at low temperature have been studied. A correlation
between the quantum dot (QD) density estimated from STM and the charge
accumulated by QD layers as extracted from C-V characteristics was revealed.
Temperature dependence of the C-V characteristics was studied. At low
temperatures, the hysteresis was observed. DLTS spectra measured on the
structures with different QD arrangements demonstrated essential distinctions.
