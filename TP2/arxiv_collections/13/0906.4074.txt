CCD - photometry is presented for 20 dIrr galaxies situated in the nearby
complexes CenA/M83, and CVnI as well as in the general field of the Local
Volume. We present integrated magnitudes of the galaxies in B,V,I - bands and
also surface brightness profiles to a median isophote mu_B ~ 28 mag /sq.arcsec.
The popular Sersic parameterization of surface brightness profiles generally
does a poor job of simultaneously fitting the inner cores and outer exponential
surface brightness fall-offs observed in many of our targets. The observed
sample is a part of a general project to image about 500 nearby (D < 10 Mpc)
dwarf galaxies in multiple bands.
