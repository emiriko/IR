The construction of unitary operator bases in a finite-dimensional Hilbert
space is reviewed through a nonstandard approach combinining angular momentum
theory and representation theory of SU(2). A single formula for the bases is
obtained from a polar decomposition of SU(2) and analysed in terms of cyclic
groups, quadratic Fourier transforms, Hadamard matrices and generalized Gauss
sums. Weyl pairs, generalized Pauli operators and their application to the
unitary group and the Pauli group naturally arise in this approach.
