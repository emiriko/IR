The first 42 elements of the Allen Telescope Array (ATA-42) are beginning to
deliver data at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Northern California.
Scientists and engineers are actively exploiting all of the flexibility
designed into this innovative instrument for simultaneously conducting
panoramic surveys of the astrophysical sky. The fundamental scientific program
of this new telescope is varied and exciting; we here discuss some of the first
astronomical results.
