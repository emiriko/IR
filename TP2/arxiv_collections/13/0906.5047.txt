We construct a warm inflation model with inflaton field non-minimally coupled
to induced gravity on a warped DGP brane. We incorporate possible modification
of the induced gravity on the brane in the spirit of $f(R)$-gravity. We study
cosmological perturbations in this setup. In the case of two field inflation
such as warm inflation, usually entropy perturbations are generated. While it
is expected that in the case of one field inflation these perturbations to be
removed, we show that even in the absence of the radiation field, entropy
perturbations are generated in our setup due to non-minimal coupling and
modification of the induced gravity.
