We investigate the observational signatures associated with one of the
proposed formation scenario for the recently discovered highly eccentric binary
millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1903+0327 in the galactic plane. The scenario
requires that the MSP to be part of a hierarchical triple (HT), consisting of
inner and outer binaries, experiencing the Kozai resonance. Numerical modeling
of a bound point mass HT, while incorporating the effects due to the
quadrupolar interactions between the binary orbits and dominant contributions
to the general relativistic periastron precession in the inner binary, reveals
that, at the present epoch, the orbital eccentricity of the binary MSP should
decrease for reasonable ranges in the HT parameters. The estimated decrements
in the orbital eccentricity of the inner binary are few parts in $10^{5}$,
substantially higher than the reported accuracies in the estimation of the
orbital eccentricity of the binary MSP, while employing various general
relativistic timing models for isolated binary pulsars. For wide ranges in the
allowed orbital parameters, the estimated rate of change in the eccentricity of
the inner binary is orders of magnitude higher than the value recently measured
by the pulsar timing analysis. Therefore, we rule out the scenario that the MSP
is part of a HT undergoing the Kozai oscillations. The origin of this system in
a typical globular cluster is also shown to be less likely than inferred in the
discovery paper.
