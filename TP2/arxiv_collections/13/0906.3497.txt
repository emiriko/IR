We demonstrate the equivalence of the light-front and equal-time formulations
of pionic corrections to nucleon properties. As a specific example, we consider
the self-energy of a nucleon dressed by pion loops, for both pseudovector and
pseudoscalar pion-nucleon couplings. We derive the leading and next-to-leading
nonanalytic behavior of the self-energy on the light-front, and show explicitly
their equivalence in the rest frame and infinite momentum frame in equal-time
quantization, as well as in a manifestly covariant formulation.
