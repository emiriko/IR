We present a high-statistics calculation of nucleon electromagnetic form
factors in $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD using domain wall quarks on fine lattices, to
attain a new level of precision in systematic and statistical errors. Our
calculations use $32^3 \times 64$ lattices with lattice spacing a=0.084 fm for
pion masses of 297, 355, and 403 MeV, and we perform an overdetermined analysis
using on the order of 3600 to 7000 measurements to calculate nucleon electric
and magnetic form factors up to $Q^2 \approx$ 1.05 GeV$^2$. Results are shown
to be consistent with those obtained using valence domain wall quarks with
improved staggered sea quarks, and using coarse domain wall lattices. We
determine the isovector Dirac radius $r_1^v$, Pauli radius $r_2^v$ and
anomalous magnetic moment $\kappa_v$. We also determine connected contributions
to the corresponding isoscalar observables. We extrapolate these observables to
the physical pion mass using two different formulations of two-flavor chiral
effective field theory at one loop: the heavy baryon Small Scale Expansion
(SSE) and covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. The isovector results
and the connected contributions to the isoscalar results are compared with
experiment, and the need for calculations at smaller pion masses is discussed.
