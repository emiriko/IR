In this talk I give an overview of soft collinear effective theory (SCET),
including a discussion of some recent advances. First, I briefly cover the
foundation upon which SCET is built, namely QCD factorization, and review the
theoretical framework of SCET. Next, I cover some recent calculations involving
SCET. Since there are more interesting results than I can cover, I have picked
four that that I find particularly exciting. The first two topics are dynamical
threshold enhancements in Drell-Yan and resummation of higgs production at the
LHC. Both topics center on the resummation of large Sudakov logarithms,
however, for each there is a twist. In the case of threshold enhancements in
Drell-Yan, it is partonic, not hadronic logarithms that are summed. In the case
of higgs production at the LHC, the twist is that the logarithms are of a
time-like scale. The third topic highlighted is electroweak corrections at high
energy. In particular the electroweak Sudakov form factor. Finally, I end by
discussing generalized event shapes in $e^+e^-$ annihilation.
