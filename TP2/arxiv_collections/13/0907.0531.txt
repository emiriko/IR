We study the one-neutron removal strength of the 7He ground state, which
provides us with the 6He-n component in 7He. The He isotopes are described on
the basis of the 4He+Xn cluster model (X=1,2,3). The complex scaling method is
applied to describe not only the Gamow resonances but also the nonresonant
continuum states of valence neutrons, with the correct boundary condition of
particle decays. The one-neutron removal strength of 7He into the unbound
states of 6He is calculated using the complex-scaled Green's function, in which
a complex-scaled complete set of 4He+n+n states is adopted. Using this
framework, we investigate resonant and nonresonant contributions of the
strength, which individually produce specific structures in the distributions.
In addition, we propose a method to obtain the real-value strength using the
complex values of spectroscopic factors of Gamow states. As a result, the
6He(2+) resonance is found to give the largest contribution.
