In string gas cosmology, the extra dimensions of the underlying theory are
kept at a microscopic scale by a gas of strings. In the matter-dominated era,
however, dust pressure can lead to oscillations of the extra dimensions and to
acceleration in the three visible dimensions, even with a vanishing
cosmological term. We review the resulting oscillating expansion history, that
provides an acceptable fit to the observed accelerated expansion of the
Universe.
