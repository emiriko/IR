We report on 1.6 GHz Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) observations of
supernova SN 1979C made on 18 November 2002. We derive a model-dependent
supernova size. We also present a reanalysis of VLBI observations made by us on
June 1999 and by other authors on February 2005. We conclude that, contrary to
our earlier claim of strong deceleration in the expansion, SN 1979C has been
undergoing almost-free expansion ($m = 0.91\pm0.09$; $R \propto t^m$) for over
25 years.
