We investigate the relations holding among generalized dimensions of
invariant measures in dynamical systems and similar quantities defined by the
scaling of global averages of powers of return times. Because of a heuristic
use of Kac theorem, these latter have been used in place of the former in
numerical and experimental investigations; to mark this distinction, we call
them return time dimensions. We derive a full set of inequalities linking
measure and return time dimensions and we comment on their optimality with the
aid of two maps due to von Neumann -- Kakutani and to Gaspard -- Wang. We
conjecture the behavior of return time dimensions in a typical system. We only
assume ergodicity of the dynamical system under investigation.
