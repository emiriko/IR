The DFLU numerical flux was introduced in order to solve hyperbolic scalar
conservation laws with a flux function discontinuous in space. We show how this
flux can be used to solve systems of conservation laws. The obtained numerical
flux is very close to a Godunov flux. As an example we consider a system
modeling polymer flooding in oil reservoir engineering.
