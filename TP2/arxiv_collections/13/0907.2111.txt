The optical trapping of polymeric nanofibers and the characterization of the
rotational dynamics are reported. A strategy to apply a torque to a polymer
nanofiber, by tilting the trapped fibers using a symmetrical linear polarized
Gaussian beam is demonstrated. Rotation frequencies up to 10 Hz are measured,
depending on the trapping power, the fiber length and the tilt angle. A
comparison of the experimental rotation frequencies in the different trapping
configurations with calculations based on optical trapping and rotation of
linear nanostructures through a T-Matrix formalism, accurately reproduce the
measured data, providing a comprehensive description of the trapping and
rotation dynamics.
