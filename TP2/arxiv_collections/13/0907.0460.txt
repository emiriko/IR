M87 is the first known radio galaxy to emit very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays. During a monitoring program of M87, a rapid flare in VHE gamma-rays
was detected by the MAGIC telescope in early 2008. The flux was found to be
variable on a timescale as short as 1 day, reaching 15% of the Crab Nebula flux
above 350 GeV. In contrast, the flux at lower energies (150 GeV to 350 GeV) is
compatible with being constant. We present light curves and energy spectra, and
argue that the observed day-scale flux variability favours the M87 core as
source of the gamma-ray emission rather than the bright know HST-1 in the jet
of M87.
