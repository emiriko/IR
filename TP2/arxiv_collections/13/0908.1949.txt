We propose an inflationary scenario inspired by a recent formulation, in
terms of coherent states, of non-commutative quantum field theory. We consider
the semiclassical Einstein equations, and we exploit the ultraviolet finiteness
of the non-commutative propagator to construct the expectation value of the
energy momentum tensor associated to a generic scalar field. It turns out that
the latter is always finite and dominated by an effective cosmological
constant. By combining this general feature with the intrinsic fuzziness of
spacetime, we show that non-commutativity governs the energy density of the
early Universe in such a way that the strong energy condition is violated.
Thus, there might be a bounce and a subsequent inflationary phase, which does
not need any \emph{ad hoc} scalar field.
