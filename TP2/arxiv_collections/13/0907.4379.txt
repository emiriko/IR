Computation of radiative energy loss in a finite size dynamically screened
QCD medium is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet
quenching in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We develop a theory which
allows calculating, to first order in the number of scattering centers, the
energy loss of a heavy quark traveling through a finite size dynamical QCD
medium. We show that the result for a dynamical medium is significantly larger
compared to a medium consisting of randomly distributed static scattering
centers. Therefore, a quantitative description of jet suppression at RHIC and
LHC experiments must correctly account for the dynamics of the medium's
constituents. Furthermore, qualitative predictions that come from this energy
loss formalism are also presented.
