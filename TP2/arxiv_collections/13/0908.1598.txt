We investigate the Lagrangian mechanism of the kinematic ``fluctuation''
magnetic dynamo in turbulent plasma flow at small magnetic Prandtl numbers. The
combined effect of turbulent advection and plasma resistivity is to carry
infinitely many field lines to each space point, with the resultant magnetic
field at that point given by the average over all the individual line vectors.
As a consequence of the roughness of the advecting velocity, this remains true
even in the limit of zero resistivity. We show that the presence of dynamo
effect requires sufficient angular correlation of the passive line-vectors that
arrive simultaneously at the SAME space point. We demonstrate this in detail
for the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model of kinematic dynamo with a Gaussian advecting
velocity that is spatially rough and white-noise in time. In the regime where
dynamo action fails, we also obtain the precise rate of decay of the magnetic
energy. These exact results for the model are obtained by a generalization of
the ``slow-mode expansion'' of Bernard, Gawedzki and Kupiainen to non-Hermitian
evolution. Much of our analysis applies also to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.
