Light quark masses are important fundamental parameters of the Standard
Model. The decays psi'-->J/psi pi^0 (eta) were widely used in determining the
light quark mass ratio m_u/m_d. However, there is a large discrepancy between
the resulting value of m_u/m_d and the one determined from the light
pseudoscalar meson masses. Using the technique of non-relativistic effective
field theory, we show that intermediate charmed meson loops lead to a sizeable
contribution to the decays and hence make the psi'-->J/psi pi^0 (eta) decays
not suitable for a precise extraction of the light quark mass ratio.
