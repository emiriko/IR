We show that the differential rotation profile of the solar convection zone,
apart from inner and outer boundary layers, can be reproduced with great accu-
racy if the isorotation contours correspond to characteristics of the thermal
wind equation. This requires that there be a formal quantitative relationship
involving the entropy and the angular velocity. Earlier work has suggested that
this could arise from magnetohydrodynamic stability constraints; here we argue
that purely hydrodynamical processes could also lead to such a result. Of
special importance to the hydrodynamical solution is the fact that the thermal
wind equation is insensitive to radial entropy gradients. This allows a much
more general class of solutions to fit the solar isorotation contours, beyond
just those in which the entropy itself must be a function of the angular
velocity. In particular, for this expanded class, the thermal wind solution of
the solar rotation profile remains valid even when large radial entropy
gradients are present. A clear and explicit example of this class of solution
appears to be present in published numerical simulations of the solar
convective zone. Though hydrodynamical in character, the theory is not
sensitive to the presence of weak magnetic fields. Thus, the identification of
solar isorotation contours with the characteristics of the thermal wind
equation appears to be robust, accommodating, but by no means requiring,
magnetic field dynamics.
