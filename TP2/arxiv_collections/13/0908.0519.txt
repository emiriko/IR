Transiting extrasolar planets provide an opportunity to study the mass-radius
relation of planets as well as their internal structure. The existence of a
secondary eclipse enables further study of the thermal properties of the the
planet by observing at infrared wavelengths. The probability of an observable
secondary eclipse depends upon the orbital parameters of the planet,
particularly eccentricity and argument of periastron. Here we provide
analytical expressions for these probabilities, investigate their properties,
and calculate their values for the known extrasolar planets. We furthermore
quantitatively discuss constraints on existence and observability of primary
transits if a secondary eclipse is observed. Finally, we calculate the
a-posteriori transit probabilities of the known extrasolar planets, and we
present several case studies in which orbital constraints resulting from the
presence of a secondary eclipse may be applied in observing campaigns.
