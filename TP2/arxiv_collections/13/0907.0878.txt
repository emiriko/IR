The role of quantum mechanical time-energy uncertainty (TEU) is central in
resonant neutrino (nue) reactions (3H to 3He to 3H) because of the unusual 18 y
lifetime of 3H. The TEU explicitly manifests itself by a non-intuitive but
quantitatively predictable spontaneous temporal growth of the nue resonance
signal. A slower growth rate signifies violation of TEU via a larger than
natural width of 3H, possibly imposed by a fundamental length in nature. Strong
limits on TEU violation can be set in the unprobed virgin energy regime of
~10-24 eV.
