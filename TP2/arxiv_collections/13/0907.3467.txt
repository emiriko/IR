We study the relaxation of the bi-dimensional kinetically constrained spiral
model. We show that due to the reversibility of the dynamic rules any unblocked
state fully decorrelates in finite times irrespectively of the system being in
the unjammed or the jammed phase. In consequence, the evolution of any
unblocked configuration occurs in a different sector of phase space from the
one that includes the equilibrium blocked equilibrium configurations at
criticality and in the jammed phase. We argue that such out of equilibrium
dynamics share many points in common with coarsening in the one-dimensional
Ising model and we identify the coarsening structures that are, basically,
lines of vacancies. We provide evidence for this claim by analyzing the
behaviour of several observables including the density of particles and
vacancies, the spatial correlation function, the time-dependent persistence and
the linear response.
