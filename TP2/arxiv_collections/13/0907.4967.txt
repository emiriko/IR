In [Physical Review Letters 101, 050403 (2008)], we showed that quantum
theory cannot be explained by a hidden variable model with a non-trivial local
part. The purpose of this comment is to clarify our notion of local part, which
seems to have caused some confusion in the recent literature. This notion is
based on Bell's and demands that local hidden variables are physical, the idea
being that, if discovered, they would not contradict basic physical principles.
We explain why the recent supposed "counterexamples" that have appeared are not
counterexamples to our theorem--in fact they are based on a definition of local
hidden variables which would allow signalling and is therefore not physical.
