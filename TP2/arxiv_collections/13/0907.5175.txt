The intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lac object 3C 66A was detected in a
flaring state by the Fermi-LAT and VERITAS observatories in October 2008. These
data and follow-up observations at other wavelengths create a rich sample of
light curves and a constraining spectral energy distribution (SED). This is the
first time that simultaneous observations at GeV and TeV energies were obtained
for a flaring blazar. Results from these joint Fermi-LAT and VERITAS
observations are presented in this conference proceeding.
