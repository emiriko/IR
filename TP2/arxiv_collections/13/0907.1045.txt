Based on the formalism of thermo field dynamics we propose a concept of
nonequilibrium Fock space and nonequilibrium quasiparticles for quantum
many-body system in nonequilibrium steady state. We develop a general theory as
well as demonstrate the utility of the approach on the example of electron
transport through the interacting region. The proposed approach is compatible
with advanced methods of electronic structure calculations such as coupled
cluster theory and configuration interaction.
