The cosmic microwave background radiation is supposed to be Gaussian and this
hypothesis is in good agreement with the recent very accurate measurements.
Nonetheless a tiny amount of non-Gaussianity is predicted by the standard
inflation scenario, while more exotic models suggest a higher degree of
non-Gaussianity. Tightly constraining the level of Gaussianity in the CMB data
represents then a fundamental handle to understand the physics and the origin
of our universe. By means of needlets, a novel rendition of wavelets,
characterised by excellent properties of localisations both in harmonic and
pixel domain, we are able to detect anomalous spots in the southern hemisphere
responsible for roughly the 50% of power asymmetry we measure in the CMB power
spectrum, and to perform a detailed analysis of the needlets bispectrum. We
then constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter, $f{\rm NL}=21\pm40$ at
68% c.f., and spot a high asymmetry in the bispectrum, in particular in the
isosceles configurations.
