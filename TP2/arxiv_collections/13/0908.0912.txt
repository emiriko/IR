Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) research has focussed on a single user
interaction modality, where a user searches to satisfy an information need.
Recent advances in web technologies and computer hardware have enabled multiple
users to collaborate on many computer-supported tasks, therefore there is an
increasing opportunity to support two or more users searching together at the
same time in order to satisfy a shared information need, which we refer to as
Synchronous Collaborative Information Retrieval (SCIR). SCIR systems represent
a significant paradigmatic shift from traditional IR systems. In order to
support effective SCIR, new techniques are required to coordinate users'
activities. In addition, the novel domain of SCIR presents challenges for
effective evaluations of these systems. In this paper we will propose an
effective and re-usable evaluation methodology based on simulating users
searching together. We will outline how we have used this evaluation in
empirical studies of the effects of different division of labour and sharing of
knowledge techniques for SCIR.
