A new approach to modelling the behaviour of simple fluids is presented.
Starting from the usual expression of the partition function of N molecules, a
Fourier transformation is performed. It is argued that the N(N-1)/2 dynamical
variables kpq in the reciprocal space featuring the link between 2 molecules p
and q can reasonably be considered independent in the thermodynamical limit.
Treated as a set of effective independent particles, their statistical
behaviour is analogous to a Bose-Einstein gas. Expressions of the partition
function, of the radial pair correlation function and of the pressure are
derived, and a special attention is given to the mathematical inter-consistency
of those quantities. The results, which are independent of the exact shape of
the intermolecular potential, are applied to the simple case of hard sphere
fluids. An analytical expression of the radial pair correlation function is
derived as well as of the equation of state. The model predicts a qualitatively
satisfactory behaviour for g(R), and it provides numerically correct values for
the equation of state at low and medium densities, although at higher densities
the contact value of g(R)is underestimated. Quite interestingly it predicts for
the maximum random close packing density the correct value 0.637 .
