Using measured data we demonstrate that there is an amazing correspondence
among the statistical properties of spacings between parked cars and the
distances between birds perching on a power line. We show that this observation
is easily explained by the fact that birds and human use the same mechanism of
distance estimation. We give a simple mathematical model of this phenomenon and
prove its validity using measured data.
