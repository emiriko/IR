Pulses of synchronization in chaotic coupled map lattices are discussed in
the context of transmission of information. Synchronization and
desynchronization propagate along the chain with different velocities which are
calculated analytically from the spectrum of convective Lyapunov exponents.
Since the front of synchronization travels slower than the front of
desynchronization, the maximal possible chain length for which information can
be transmitted by modulating the first unit of the chain is bounded.
