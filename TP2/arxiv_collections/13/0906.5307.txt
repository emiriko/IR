This paper reviews and develops the proposal, widely discussed but not
examined in detail, to use stratospheric aerosols to increase the Earth's
albedo to Solar radiation in order to control climate change. The potential of
this method has been demonstrated by the "natural experiments" of volcanic
injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere that led to subsequent
observed global cooling. I consider several hygroscopic oxides as possible
aerosol materials in addition to oxides of sulfur. Aerosol chemistry,
dispersion and transport have been the subject of little study and are not
understood, representing a significant scientific risk. Even the optimal
altitude of injection and aerosol size distribution are poorly known. Past
attention focused on guns and airplanes as means of lofting aerosols or their
chemical precursors, but large sounding rockets are cheap, energetically
efficient, can be designed to inject aerosols at any required altitude, and
involve little technical risk. Sophisticated, mass-optimized "engineered"
particles have been proposed as possible aerosols, but the formidable problems
of their production in quantity, lofting and dispersion have not been
addressed.
