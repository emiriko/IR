A stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is achieved by the so
called adiabatically-amplified zero-point fluctuations process derived from
early inflation. It provides a distinctive spectrum of relic gravitational
waves. In the framework of scalar-tensor gravity, we discuss the scalar modes
of gravitational waves and the primordial production of this scalar component
which is generated beside tensorial one. Then we analyze different viable
$f(R)$-gravities towards the Solar System tests and stochastic gravitational
waves background. The aim is to achive experimental bounds for the theory at
local and cosmological scales in order to select models capable of addressing
the accelerating cosmological expansion without cosmological constant but
evading the weak field constraints. It is demonstrated that viable
$f(R)$-gravities under consideration not only satisfy the local tests, but
additionally, pass the PPN-and stochastic gravitational waves bounds for large
classes of parameters.
