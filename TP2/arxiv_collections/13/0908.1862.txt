Given a complex analytic function f on a Whitney stratified complex analytic
variety of complex dimension n, whose real part Re(f) is Morse, we prove the
existence of a stratified gradient-like vector field for Re(f) such that the
unstable set of a critical point p on a stratum S of complex dimension s has
real dimension $m(p)+n-s$ as was conjectured by Goresky and MacPherson.
