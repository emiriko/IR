We present a catalog of 5184 candidate infrared counterparts to X-ray sources
detected towards the Galactic center. The X-ray sample contains 9017 point
sources detected in this region by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including
data from a recent deep survey of the central 2 x 0.8 deg of the Galactic
plane. A total of 6760 of these sources have hard X-ray colors, and the
majority of them lie near the Galactic center, while most of the remaining 2257
soft X-ray sources lie in the foreground. We cross-correlated the X-ray source
positions with the 2MASS and SIRIUS near-infrared catalogs, which collectively
contain stars with a 10-sigma limiting flux of K_s<=15.6 mag. In order to
distinguish absorbed infrared sources near the Galactic center from those in
the foreground, we defined red and blue sources as those which have H-K_s>=0.9
and <=0.9 mag, respectively. We find that 5.8(1.5)% of the hard X-ray sources
have real infrared counterparts, of which 228(99) are red and 166(27) are blue.
The red counterparts are probably comprised of WR/O stars, HMXBs, and
symbiotics near the Galactic center. We also find that 39.4(1.0)% of the soft
X-ray sources have blue infrared counterparts; most of these are probably
coronally active dwarfs in the foreground. There is a noteworthy collection of
~20 red counterparts to hard X-ray sources near the Sagittarius-B H II region,
which are probably massive binaries that have formed within the last several
Myr. For each of the infrared matches to X-ray sources in our catalog we
derived the probability that the association is real, based on the results of
the cross-correlation analysis. The catalog will serve spectroscopic surveys to
identify infrared counterparts to X-ray sources near the Galactic center.
