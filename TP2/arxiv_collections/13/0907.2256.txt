We discuss the decay of Bc mesons into two light mesons (pi, K^(*), eta',
rho, omega, phi). All these decay channels come from a single type of diagram,
namely tree annihilation. This allows us to derive extremely simple SU(3)
relations among these processes. The size of annihilation contributions is an
important issue in B physics, and we provide two different estimates in the
case of non-leptonic charmless Bc decays, either a comparison with annihilation
decays of heavy-light mesons or a perturbative model inspired by QCD
factorisation. We finally discuss a possible search for these channels at LHCb.
