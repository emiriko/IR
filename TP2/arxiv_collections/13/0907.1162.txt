This work focuses on the fabrication and use of a Biological
Micro-ElectroMechanical System (BioMEMS) for TeraHertz (THz) detection and
characterization of enzymatic catalysis reactions. The fluidic microdevice was
fabricated using traditional lithographic techniques. It was then
functionalized by reactive amine functions using plasma polymerized allylamine
(pp-allylamine), followed by enzyme immobilization inside the microchannels.
The enzymatic reaction was controlled by fluorescent microscopy before being
analysed by sub-THz spectroscopy in the frequency range 0.06--0.11 THz. The
preliminary results show the feasibility of terahertz monitoring of the
biocatalysis reaction.
