Our recently developed 2+1 (boost-invariant) hydrodynamic model has been
presented and used to i) describe the soft hadronic data collected in the
central region of the relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and ii) to make
predictions for the heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. We have addressed
both the one- and two-particle observables: the transverse momentum spectra,
the elliptic flow coefficient v2, and the pion HBT radii. The realistic
equation of state for strongly interacting matter has been constructed that
interpolates between the hadron gas model and the results of the QCD lattice
simulations. The computational platform has been constructed, which combines
the results of our hydrodynamic code with the statistical hadronization model
THERMINATOR. The satisfactory description of the soft hadronic RHIC data has
been achieved with the standard initial conditions obtained from the optical
limit of the Glauber model. Predictions for the future heavy-ion collisions at
LHC have been formulated. The solution of the RHIC HBT puzzle has been
proposed. It suggests the use of the modified Gaussian-type initial conditions
for the energy density in the transverse plane. Finally, the processes of the
free streaming of partons followed by the sudden equilibration have been
incorporated in the model. The inclusion of the free-streaming stage allows for
the delayed start of the hydrodynamic evolution, which is a desirable effect in
the context of the early thermalization problem.
