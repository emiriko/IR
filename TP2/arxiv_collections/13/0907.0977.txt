I argue that conventional estimates of the criterion for classical behavior
of a macroscopic body are incorrect in most circumstances,because they do not
take into account the locality of interactions, which characterizes the
behavior of all systems described approximately by local quantum field theory.
The deviations from classical behavior of a macroscopic body, except for those
that can be described as classical uncertainties in the initial values of
macroscopic variables,are {\it exponentially} small as a function of the volume
of the macro-system in microscopic units. Conventional estimates are correct
only when the internal degrees of freedom of the macrosystem are in their
ground state, and the classical motion of collective coordinates is adiabatic.
Otherwise, the system acts as its own environment and washes out quantum phase
correlations between different classical states of its collective coordinates.
I suggest that it is likely that we can only achieve meso-scopic
superpositions, for systems which have topological variables, and for which we
can couple to those variables without exciting phonons.
