The electromagnetic wave propagation in an anisotropic dielectric media with
two generic matrices $\epsilon^{ij}$ and $\mu^{ij}$ of permittivity and
permeability is studied. These matrices are not required to be symmetric,
positive definite, and even invertible. In the framework of a metric-free
electrodynamics approach, compact tensorial dispersion relation is derived. The
resulted formula are useful for a theoretical study of electromagnetic wave
propagation in a classical media and in a modern type of media with a generic
linear constitutive relation including metamaterials.
