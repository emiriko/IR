In this paper we theoretically study propagation of steady state ultrashort
pulse in dissipative medium. We considered two cases (i) medium consists of
lossy metallic nanostructures embedded into a gain material and (ii) the gain
material is embedded directly into the nanostructures. We found the shape and
velocity of an optical pulse coupled with the polarization wave.
