This work was firstly published in 1986 \cite{we}. No real two-dimensional
object with the zero-gap quasi-relativistic spectrum was known in that time.
Such an object is well known now: this is graphene. That is why we decided to
present it again as a e-print in a slightly modified form. A density of the
two-dimensional zero-gap electronic states at the quantizing magnetic field in
the presence the Gaussian random potential has been calculated. The problem is
reduced to zero-dimensional spinor field theory using the holomorphic
supersymmetric representation. The calculated density of states in the case of
the mass perturbation has a delta function peak in the Dirac point.This peak
smears due to the potential perturbation.
