Organic scintillators are widely used for fast neutron detection and
spectroscopy. Several effects complicate the interpretation of results from
detectors based upon these materials. First, fast neutrons will often leave a
detector before depositing all of their energy within it. Second, fast neutrons
will typically scatter several times within a detector, and there is a
non-proportional relationship between the energy of, and the scintillation
light produced by, each individual scatter; therefore, there is not a
deterministic relationship between the scintillation light observed and the
neutron energy deposited. Here we demonstrate a hardware technique for reducing
both of these effects. Use of a segmented detector allows for the
event-by-event correction of the light yield non-proportionality and for the
preferential selection of events with near-complete energy deposition, since
these will typically have high segment multiplicities.
