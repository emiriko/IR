We present a computer simulation model for the Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment
that is entirely particle-based and reproduces the results of wave theory. The
model is solely based on experimental facts, satisfies Einstein's criterion of
local causality and does not require knowledge of the solution of a wave
equation. The simulation model is fully consistent with earlier work and
provides another demonstration that it is possible to give a particle-only
description of wave phenomena, rendering the concept of wave-particle duality
superfluous.
