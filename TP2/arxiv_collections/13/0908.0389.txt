Dry Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) is an environment-friendly
modification of the conventional EDM process, which is obtained by replacing
the liquid dielectric by a gaseous medium. In this study, multi-objective
optimization of dry EDM process has been done using the non dominated sorting
genetic algorithm (NSGA II), with material removal rate (MRR) and surface
roughness (Ra) as the objective functions. Experiments were conducted with air
as dielectric to develop polynomial models of MRR and Ra in terms of the six
input parameters: gap voltage, discharge current, pulse-on time, duty factor,
air pressure and spindle speed. A Pareto-optimal front was then obtained using
NSGA II. Analysis of the front was done to identify separate regions for finish
and rough machining. Designed experiments were then conducted in these focused
regions to verify the optimization results and to identify the region-specific
characteristics of the process. Finishing conditions were obtained at low
current, high pulse-on time and low duty factor, where as rough conditions were
obtained at high current, low pulse-on time and high duty factor. Focused
experiments revealed an additional process constraint based on the flushing
efficiency.
