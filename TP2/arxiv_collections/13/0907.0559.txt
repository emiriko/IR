The Galactic cosmic-ray propagation code GALPROP is designed to make
predictions of many kinds of data self-consistently, including direct
cosmic-ray measurements, gamma rays and synchrotron radiation. In the decade
since its conception it has undergone considerable development, which is
continuing. A public version was made available a few years ago, supported by a
website. We describe the new features of the current version which will become
part of the next public release. Plans for future developments are also
mentioned.
