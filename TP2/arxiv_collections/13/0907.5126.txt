We use confirmatory factor analysis to derive a unifying measure of
comparison of scientists based on bibliometric measurements, by utilizing the
h-index, some similar h-type indices as well as other common measures of
scientific performance. We use a real data example from nine well-known
departments of statistics to demonstrate our approach and argue that our
combined measure results in a better overall evaluation of a researchers'
scientific work.
