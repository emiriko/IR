We present a detailed study of the gain length in an active medium obtained
by doping of DNA strands with DCM dye molecules. The superior thermal stability
of the composite and its low quenching, permits to obtain optical gain
coefficient larger than 300 cm^-1. We also show that such an active material is
excellent for integration into photonic nano-structures, to achieve, for
example, efficient random lasing emission, and fluorescent photonic crystals.
