Laser-plasma accelerators are expected to deliver electron bunches with high
space charge fields. Several recent publications have addressed the impact of
space charge effects on such bunches after the extraction into vacuum.
Artifacts due to the approximation of retardation effects are addressed, which
are typically either neglected or approximated. We discuss a much more
appropriate calculation for the case of laser wakefield acceleration with
negligible retardation artifacts due to the calculation performed in the mean
rest frame. This presented calculation approach also aims at a validation of
other simulation approaches.
