We present a practical scheme by global addressing to deterministically
entangle negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers in distant diamonds
using a nano-mechanical cantilever with the magnetic tips strongly coupled to
the N-V electron spins. Symmetric Dicke states are generated as an example, and
the experimental feasibility and challenge of our scheme are discussed.
