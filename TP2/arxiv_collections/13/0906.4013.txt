Wasssily Hoeffding's terminal illness and untimely death in 1991 put an end
to efforts that were made to interview him for Statistical Science. An account
of his scientific work is given in Fisher and Sen [The Collected Works of
Wassily Hoeffding (1994) Springer], but the present authors felt that the
statistical community should also be told about the life of this remarkable
man. He contributed much to statistical science, but will also live on in the
memory of those who knew him as a kind and modest teacher and friend, whose
courage and learning were matched by a wonderful sense of humor.
