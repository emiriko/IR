In 2006 the MAGIC telescope observed the well known very high energy (VHE, >
80 GeV) blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 in the course of multi-wavelength
campaigns, comprising measurements in the optical, X-ray and VHE regime. MAGIC
performed additional snapshot observations on Mrk 421 around the MWL campaigns
and detected the source each night with high significance, establishing once
more flux variability on nightly scales for this object. For certain nights,
the integral flux exceeded the one of Crab significantly, whereas the truly
simultaneous observations have been conducted in a rather low flux state. The
MAGIC observations contemporaneous to XMM-Newton revealed clear intra-night
variability. No significant correlation between the spectral index and the flux
could be found for the nine days of observations. The VHE observations of Mrk
501 have been conducted during one of the lowest flux states ever measured by
MAGIC for this object. The VHE and optical light curves do not show significant
variability, whereas the flux in X-rays increased by about 50 %. In this
contribution, the results of the MAGIC observations will be presented in
detail.
