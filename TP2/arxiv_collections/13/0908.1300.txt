We use a numerical code to consider the nonlinear processes arising when a
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is irradiated by an exotic scalar field (modelled
as a free massless scalar field with an opposite sign for its energy-momentum
tensor). These processes are quite different from the processes arising in the
case of the same black hole being irradiated by a pulse of a normal scalar
field. In our case, we did not observe the creation of a spacelike strong
singularity in the T-region of the space-time. We investigate the antifocusing
effects in the gravity field of the exotic scalar field with the negative
energy density and the evolution of the mass function. We demonstrate the
process of vanishing of the black hole when it is irradiated by a strong pulse
of an exotic scalar field.
