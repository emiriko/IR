The scaling properties of jet suppression measurements are compared for
non-photonic electrons ($e^{\pm}$) and neutral pions ($\pi^0$) in Au + Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. For a broad range of transverse momenta
and collision centralities, the comparison is consistent with jet quenching
dominated by radiative energy loss for both heavy and light partons. Less
quenching is indicated for heavy quarks via $e^{\pm}$; this gives an
independent estimate of the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ that agrees with
its magnitude obtained from quenching of light partons via $\pi^0$'s.
