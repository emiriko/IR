We use computer simulations to compare the dynamical behaviour of torus and
even-twist knots in polymers under tension. The knots diffuse through a
mechanism similar to reptation. Their friction coefficients grow linearly with
average knot length for both knot types. For similar complexity, however, the
torus knots diffuse faster than the even twist knots. The knot-length
auto-correlation function exhibits a slow relaxation time that can be linked to
a breathing mode. Its timescale depends on knot type, being typically longer
for torus than for even-twist knots. These differences in dynamical behaviour
are interpreted in terms of topological features of the knots.
