SDSS J091709.55+463821.8 (hereafter J0917+4638) is the lowest surface gravity
white dwarf (WD) currently known, with log g = 5.55 +/- 0.05 (M ~ 0.17 M_sun;
Kilic et al. 2007a,b). Such low-mass white dwarfs (LMWDs) are believed to
originate in binaries that evolve into WD/WD or WD/neutron star (NS) systems.
An optical search for J0917+4638's companion showed that it must be a compact
object with a mass >= 0.28 M_sun (Kilic 2007b). Here we report on Green Bank
Telescope 820 MHz and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of J0917+4638 intended to
uncover a potential NS companion to the LMWD. No convincing pulsar signal is
detected in our radio data. Our X-ray observation also failed to detect X-ray
emission from J0917+4638's companion, while we would have detected any of the
millisecond radio pulsars in 47 Tuc. We conclude that the companion is almost
certainly another WD.
