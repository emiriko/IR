With the nearing completion of the first-generation experiments at asymmetric
$e^+ e^-$ colliders running at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance ("B-Factories") a
new era of high luminosity machines is at the horizon. We report here on the
plans at KEK in Japan to upgrade the KEKB machine ("SuperKEKB") with the goal
of achieving an instantaneous luminosity exceeding $8 \times 10^{35}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than KEKB. Together
with the machine, the Belle detector will be upgraded as well ("Belle-II"),
with significant improvements to increase its background tolerance as well as
improving its physics performance. The new generation of experiments is
scheduled to take first data in the year 2013.
