We derive an invariant form of the current-induced switching condition in
spin-transfer devices and show that for energy minima and maxima the "switching
ability" of the current is determined by the spin torque divergence. In
contrast, energy saddle points are normally stabilized by current-induced
merging with other equilibria. Our approach provides new predictions for
several experimental setups and shows the limitations of some frequently used
approximations.
