We present the results of an optical multi-band (BVR) photometric monitoring
program of 22 core-dominated radio-loud quasars (CRLQs) and 22 radio-quiet
quasars (RQQs). The aim was to compare the properties of microvariability in
both types of quasars. We detected optical microvariability in 5 RQQs and 4
CRLQs. Our results confirm that microvariability in RQQs may be as frequent as
in CRLQs. In addition we compare microvariability duty cycles in different
bands. Finally, the implications for the origin of the microvariations are
briefly discussed.
