The information geometry of the 2-manifold of gamma probability density
functions provides a framework in which pseudorandom number generators may be
evaluated using a neighbourhood of the curve of exponential density functions.
The process is illustrated using the pseudorandom number generator in
Mathematica. This methodology may be useful to add to the current family of
test procedures in real applications to finite sampling data.
