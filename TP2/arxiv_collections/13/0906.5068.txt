Low and intermediate frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought
to be due to oscillations of Comptonizing regions or hot regions embedded in
Keplerian discs. Observational evidence of evolutions of QPOs would therefore
be very important as they throw lights on the dynamics of the hotter region.
Our aim is to find systems in which there is a well-defined correlation among
the frequencies of the QPOs over a range of time so as to understand the
physical picture. In this paper, we concentrate on the archival data of XTE
J1550-564 obtained during 1998 outburst, and study the systematic drifts during
the rising phase from the 1998 September 7 to the 1998 September 19, when the
QPO frequency increased monotonically from 81mHz to 13.1Hz. Immediately after
that, QPO frequency started to decrease and on the 1998 September 26, the QPO
frequency became 2.62Hz. After that, its value remained almost constant. This
frequency drift can be modelled satisfactorily with a propagatory oscillating
shock solution where the post-shock region behaves as the Comptonized region.
Comparing with the nature of a more recent 2005 outburst of another black hole
candidate GRO 1655-40, where QPOs disappeared at the end of the rising phase,
we conjecture that this so-called `outburst' may not be a full-fledged
outburst.
