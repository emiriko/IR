The new free energy functional that describes general elastic interaction
between colloidal particles and nematic liquid crystal has been proposed. It
generalizes results of the paper \cite{lupe} on the case of arbitrary
orientation of colloidal particles and is valid for arbitrary surface anchoring
strength. Formal analogies and differences between electric particles and
colloidal particles in LC are found. It is first time shown that spur of the
quadrupole moment tensor is different from zero $Sp\hat{Q}_{\mu}\neq 0$ in the
case of axial symmetry breaking of the director field around colloidal particle
in contrast to electrostatics. New general presentation for the elastic
interaction between arbitrary colloids is obtained which contains new multipole
terms connected with $Sp\hat{Q}_{\mu}\neq 0$ that are absent in the standard
electrostatics.
