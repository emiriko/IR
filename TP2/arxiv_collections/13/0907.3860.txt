We analyze an inherent nonlinearity of Surface Plasmon Polaritons at the
interface of Fermi-Dirac metal plasma, stemming from the depletion of electron
density in high-field intensity regions. The derived optical nonlinear
coefficients are comparable to the experimental values for metals. We calculate
the dispersion relations for the nonlinear propagation of high-intensity
Surface Plasmon Polaritons, predicting a nonlinear induced cutoff and vanishing
group velocity.
