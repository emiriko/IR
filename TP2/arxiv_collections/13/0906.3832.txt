This paper discusses how hot carrier injection (HCI) can be exploited to
create a trojan that will cause hardware failures. The trojan is produced not
via additional logic circuitry but by controlled scenarios that maximize and
accelerate the HCI effect in transistors. These scenarios range from
manipulating the manufacturing process to varying the internal voltage
distribution. This new type of trojan is difficult to test due to its gradual
hardware degradation mechanism. This paper describes the HCI effect, detection
techniques and discusses the possibility for maliciously induced HCI trojans.
