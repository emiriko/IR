We derive an expression of the core traction contribution to the dislocation
elastic energy within linear anisotropic elasticity theory using the sextic
formalism. With this contribution, the elastic energy is a state variable
consistent with the work of the Peach-Koehler forces. This contribution needs
also to be considered when extracting from atomic simulations core energies.
The core energies thus obtained are real intrinsic dislocation properties: they
do not depend on the presence and position of other defects. This is
illustrated by calculating core energies of edge dislocation in bcc iron, where
we show that dislocations gliding in {110} planes are more stable than those
gliding in {112} planes.
