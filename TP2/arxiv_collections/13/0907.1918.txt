We demonstrate that for a finite-size quark-gluon plasma the induced gluon
radiation from heavy quarks is stronger than that for light quarks when the
gluon formation length becomes comparable with (or exceeds) the size of the
plasma. The effect is due to oscillations of the light-cone wave function for
the in-medium $q\to gq$ transition. The dead cone model by Dokshitzer and
Kharzeev neglecting quantum finite-size effects is not valid in this regime.
The finite-size effects also enhance the photon emission from heavy quarks.
