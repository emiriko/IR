An equivalence of total momentum operator of charge - monopole system to the
momentum operator of a symmetrical quantum top is observed. This explicitly
shows the string independence of Dirac's quantization condition leading to
disappearance of Schwinger's string and reveals some properties of diatomic
molecule for this system.
