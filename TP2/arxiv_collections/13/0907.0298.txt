This survey paper concerns elliptic surfaces with section. We give a detailed
overview of the theory including many examples. Emphasis is placed on rational
elliptic surfaces and elliptic K3 surfaces. To this end, we particularly review
the theory of Mordell-Weil lattices and address arithmetic questions.
