The electron-doped Pr(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4) (PCCO) compound in the pseudogap regime
(x~0.15) was investigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and the generalized dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the
k-dependent self-energy (LDA+DMFT+\Sigma_k). Model parameters (hopping integral
values and local Coulomb interaction strength) for the effective one-band
Hubbard model were calculated by the local density approximation (LDA) with
numerical renormalization group method (NRG) employed as an "impurity solver"
in DMFT computations. An "external" k-dependent self-energy \Sigma_k was used
to describe interaction of correlated conducting electrons with short-range
antiferromagnetic (AFM) pseudogap fluctuations. Both experimental and
theoretical spectral functions and Fermi surfaces (FS) were obtained and
compared demonstrating good semiquantitative agreement. For both experiment and
theory normal state spectra of nearly optimally doped PCCO show clear evidence
for a pseudogap state with AFM-like nature. Namely, folding of quasiparticle
bands as well as presence of the "hot spots" and "Fermi arcs" were observed.
