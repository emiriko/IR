We prove the exact relations between the critical exponents and the
susceptibility, implied by the Haldane Luttinger liquid conjecture, for a
generic lattice fermionic model or a quantum spin chain with short range weak
interaction. The validity of such relations was only checked in some special
solvable models, but there was up to now no proof of their validity in
non-solvable models.
