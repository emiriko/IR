We extend the theory for third-order structure functions in homogeneous
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to the case in which a
constant velocity shear is present. A generalization is found of the usual
relation [Politano and Pouquet, Phys. Rev. E, 57 21 (1998)] between third-order
structure functions and the dissipation rate in steady inertial range
turbulence, in which the shear plays a crucial role. In particular, the
presence of shear leads to a third-order law which is not simply proportional
to the relative separation. Possible implications for laboratory and space
plasmas are discussed.
