We utilize a single atom substitution technique with spectroscopic imaging in
a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to visualize the anisotropic spatial
structure of magnetic and non-magnetic transition metal acceptor states in the
GaAs (110) surface. The character of the defect states play a critical role in
the properties of the semiconductor, the localization of the states influencing
such things as the onset of the metal-insulator transition, and in dilute
magnetic semiconductors the mechanism and strength of magnetic interactions
that lead to the emergence of ferromagnetism. We study these states in the GaAs
surface finding remarkable similarities between the shape of the acceptor state
wavefunction for Mn, Fe, Co and Zn dopants, which is determined by the GaAs
host and is generally reproduced by tight binding calculations of Mn in bulk
GaAs [Tang, J.M. & Flatte, M.E., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 047201 (2004)]. The
similarities originate from the antibonding nature of the acceptor states that
arise from the hybridization of the impurity d-levels with the host. A second
deeper in-gap state is also observed for Fe and Co that can be explained by the
symmetry breaking of the surface.
