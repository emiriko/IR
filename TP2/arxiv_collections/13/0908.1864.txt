The idea of an accelerating universe comes almost simultaneously with the
determination of Hubble's constant by one of the Hubble Space Telescope Key
Projects. The age of the universe dilemma is probably the link between these
two issues. In an appendix, I claim that "Hubble's law" might yet to be
investigated for its ultimate cause, and suggest the "Hubble effect" as the
searched candidate.
