Second harmonic generation is investigated in lithium niobate channels
realized by proton exchange and quasi-phase-matched by surface periodic-poling.
The reduction in conversion efficiency at high powers is interpreted in terms
of multi-photon absorption via two-color terms, yielding an estimate of the
dominating three-photon process.
