When two atoms interact in the presence of an anharmonic potential, such as
an optical lattice, the center of mass motion cannot be separated from the
relative motion. In addition to generating a confinement-induced resonance (or
shifting the position of an existing Feshbach resonance), the external
potential changes the resonance picture qualitatively by introducing new
resonances where molecular excited center of mass states cross the scattering
threshold. We demonstrate the existence of these resonances, give their
quantitative characterization in an optical superlattice, and propose an
experimental scheme to detect them through controlled sweeping of the magnetic
field.
