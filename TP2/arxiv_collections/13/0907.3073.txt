We exhibit large classes of local actions for the vacuum Einstein equations.
In presence of fermions, or more generally of matter which couple to the
connection, these actions lead to inequivalent equations revealing an arbitrary
number of parameters. Even in the pure gravitational sector, any corresponding
quantum theory would depend on these parameters.
