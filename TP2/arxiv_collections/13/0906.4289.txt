A numerical renormalization-group survey of the zero-bias electrical
conductance through a quantum dot embedded in the conduction path of a
nanodevice is reported. The results are examined in the light of a recently
derived linear mapping between the temperature-dependent conductance and the
universal function describing the conductance for the symmetric Anderson model.
A gate potential applied to the conduction electrons is known to change
markedly the transport properties of a quantum dot side-coupled to the
conduction path; in the embedded geometry here discussed, a similar potential
is shown to affect only quantitatively the temperature dependence of the
conductance. As expected, in the Kondo regime the numerical results are in
excellent agreement with the mapped conductances. In the mixed-valence regime,
the mapping describes accurately the low-temperature tail of the conductance.
The mapping is shown to provide a unified view of conduction in the
single-electron transistor.
