We review the current best fit values of Higgs boson masses in the Standard
Model (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) obtained from
existing experimental data. We also review the parameters space of the
constrained MSSM (CMSSM) and the non-universal Higgs mass model (NUHM1)
currently preferred by precision data. Following a Frequentist approach, the
experimental data includes electroweak precision observables, B physics
observables and the relic density of cold dark matter.
