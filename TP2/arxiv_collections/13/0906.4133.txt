Classical and quantum theories of time-symmetric smoothing, which can be used
to optimally estimate waveforms in classical and quantum systems, are derived
using a discrete-time approach, and the similarities between the two theories
are emphasized. Application of the quantum theory to homodyne phase-locked loop
design for phase estimation with narrowband squeezed optical beams is studied.
The relation between the proposed theory and Aharonov et al.'s weak value
theory is also explored.
