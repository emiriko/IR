In real life, media information has time attributes either implicitly or
explicitly known as temporal data. This paper investigates the usefulness of
applying Bayesian classification to an interval encoded temporal database with
prioritized items. The proposed method performs temporal mining by encoding the
database with weighted items which prioritizes the items according to their
importance from the user perspective. Naive Bayesian classification helps in
making the resulting temporal rules more effective. The proposed priority based
temporal mining (PBTM) method added with classification aids in solving
problems in a well informed and systematic manner. The experimental results are
obtained from the complaints database of the telecommunications system, which
shows the feasibility of this method of classification based temporal mining.
