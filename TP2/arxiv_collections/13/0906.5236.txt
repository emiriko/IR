The representation theory (idempotents, quivers, Cartan invariants and Loewy
series) of the higher order unital peak algebras is investigated. On the way,
we obtain new interpretations and generating functions for the idempotents of
descent algebras introduced in [F. Saliola, J. Algebra 320 (2008) 3866.]
