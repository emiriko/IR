We report the influence of the field effect on the dc resistance and Hall
coefficient in the strain-induced Mott insulating state of an organic
superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Br. Conductivity obeys
the formula for activated transport $\sigma_{\Box} =
\sigma_{0}\exp(-W/k_{B}T)$, where $\sigma_{0}$ is a constant and $W$ depends on
the gate voltage. The gate voltage dependence of the Hall coefficient shows
that, unlike in conventional FETs, the effective mobility of dense hole
carriers ($\sim1.6\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$) is enhanced by a positive gate
voltage. This implies that carrier doping involves delocalization of intrinsic
carriers that were initially localized due to electron correlation.
