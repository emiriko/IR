We study a quantum quench in a system of two coupled one-dimensional tubes of
interacting atoms. After the quench the system is out of equilibrium and
oscillates between the tubes with a frequency determined by microscopic
parameters. Despite the high energy at which the system is prepared we find an
emergent long time scale responsible for the dephasing of the oscillations and
a transition at which this time scale diverges. We show that the universal
properties of the dephasing and the transition arise from an infrared
orthogonality catastrophe. Furthermore, we show how this universal behavior is
realized in a realistic model of fermions with attractive interactions.
