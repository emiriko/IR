Random changes in pulsation period are well established in cool pulsating
stars, in particular the red giant variables: Miras, semi-regulars of types A
and B, and RV Tau variables. Such effects are also observed in a handful of
Cepheids, the SX Phe variable XX Cyg, and, most recently, the red supergiant
variable, BC Cyg, a type C semi-regular. The nature of such fluctuations is
seemingly random over a few pulsation cycles of the stars, yet the regularity
of the primary pulsation mechanism dominates over the long term. The degree of
stochasticity is linked to the dimensions of the stars, the randomness
parameter 'e' appearing to correlate closely with mean stellar radius through
the period 'P', with an average value of e/P = 0.0136+-0.0005. The physical
processes responsible for such fluctuations are uncertain, but presumably
originate in temporal modifications of envelope convection in such stars.
