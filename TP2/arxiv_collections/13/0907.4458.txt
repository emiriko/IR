J/psi production is considered to be a sensitive probe of the properties of
quark gluon plasma created in nucleus+nucleus collisions at RHIC. In this
article, the recent analysis of mid-rapidity (|y| < 1) J/psi production via the
dielectron decay channel in Au+Au (year 2007) and Cu+Cu (year 2005) collisions
at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV at STAR is reported. It is compared to STAR p+p results
in order to study the nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse
momentum and centrality. The results are compared to previously published data
and available theoretical models.
