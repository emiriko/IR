In this paper, we give an application of iterated pushdown automata to
contour words of balls and two other domains in infinitely many tilings of the
hyperbolic plane. We also give a similar application for the tiling {5,3,4} of
the hyperbolic 3D space and for the tiling {5,3,3,4} of the hyperbolic 4D space
as well.
