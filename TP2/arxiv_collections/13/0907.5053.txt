We propose a method to construct localized single particle wave functions
using imaginary time projection and thereby determine lattice Hamiltonian
parameters. We apply the method to a specific disordered potential generated by
an optical lattice experiment and calculate for each instance of disorder, the
equivalent lattice model parameters. The probability distributions of the
Hubbard parameters are then determined. Tests of localization and eigen-energy
convergence are examined.
