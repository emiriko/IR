The critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram is usually expected to belong
to the chiral critical surface, i.e. the surface of second order transitions
bounding the region of first order chiral phase transitions for small quark
masses in the {m_{u,d}, m_s,\mu} parameter space. For \mu=0, QCD with physical
quark masses is known to be an analytic crossover, requiring the region of
chiral transitions to expand with \mu for a critical endpoint to exist.
Instead, on coarse N_t=4 lattices, we find the area of chiral transitions to
shrink with \mu, which excludes a chiral critical point for QCD at moderate
chemical potentials \mu_B < 500 MeV. First results on finer N_t=6 lattices
indicate a curvature of the critical surface consistent with zero and unchanged
conclusions.
