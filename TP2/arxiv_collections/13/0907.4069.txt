A non-Abelian flavour symmetry in a minimal supersymmetric standard model can
explain the flavour structures in the Yukawa couplings and simultaneously solve
the SUSY flavour problem. Similarly the SUSY CP problem can be solved if CP is
spontaneously broken in the flavour sector. In this work, we present an
explicit example of these statements with a SU(3) flavour symmetry and
spontaneous CP violation. In addition, we show that it is still possible to
find some significant deviation from the SM expectations as far as FCNC and CP
violation are concerned. We find that large contributions can be expected in
lepton flavour violating decays, as $\mu \to e \gamma$ and $\tau \to \mu
\gamma$, electric dipole moments, $d_e$ and $d_n$ and kaon CP violating
processes as $\epsilon_K$. Thus, these flavoured MSSM realizations are
phenomenologically sensitive to the experimental searches in the realm of
flavor and CP vioation physics.
