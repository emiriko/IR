We develop a new fully quantum method for determination of widths for nuclear
decay by proton emission where multiple internal reflections of wave packet
describing tunneling process inside proton--nucleus radial barrier are taken
into account. Exact solutions for amplitudes of wave function, penetrability
$T$ and reflection $R$ are found for $n$-step barrier (at arbitrary $n$) which
approximates the realistic barrier. In contrast to semiclassical approach and
two-potential approach, we establish by this method essential dependence of the
penetrability on the starting point $R_{\rm form}$ in the internal well where
proton starts to move outside (for example, for $^{157}_{73}{\rm Ta}$ the
penetrability is changed up to 200 times; accuracy is $|T+R-1| < 1.5 \cdot
10^{-15}$). We impose a new condition: in the beginning of the proton decay the
proton starts to move outside from minimum of the well. Such a condition
provides minimal calculated half-life and gives stable basis for predictions.
However, the half-lives calculated by such an approach turn out to be a little
closer to experimental data in comparison with the semiclassical half-lives.
Estimated influence of the external barrier region is up to 1.5 times for
changed penetrability.
