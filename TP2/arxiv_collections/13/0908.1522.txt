Phase reversal occurs in the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a
negatively refracting medium or a phase-conjugate interface. Here we report the
experimental observation of phase reversal diffraction without the above
devices. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that
phase reversal diffraction can be formed through the first-order field
correlation of chaotic light. The experimental realization is similar to phase
reversal behavior in negatively refracting media.
