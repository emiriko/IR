In this note, we attempt to provide some insights into the structure of
non-perturbative descriptions of quantum gravity using known examples of
gauge-theory / gravity duality. We argue that in familiar examples, a quantum
description of spacetime can be associated with a manifold-like structure in
which particular patches of spacetime are associated with states or density
matrices in specific quantum systems. We argue that quantum entanglement
between microscopic degrees of freedom plays an essential role in the emergence
of a dual spacetime from the nonperturbative degrees of freedom. In particular,
in at least some cases, classically connected spacetimes may be understood as
particular quantum superpositions of disconnected spacetimes.
