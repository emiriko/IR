For an unstable quantum system quantum Zeno effect represents total decay
probability decrease while quantum anti-Zeno effect represents total decay
probability increase by frequent decay detections under condition that decay
probability is the same in all single decay detections. Some authors considered
optical, i.e. polarization detection analogy of quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno
effects. We use simplest form of such ideas on the optical, i.e. polarization
detection analogy of quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects and we suggest some new
situations when decay probability is different in different single decay
detections. We consider such situation, called quantum Hamlet effect, when, by
frequent detections, final total polarization angle and state converge but
total probability for appearance of this state diverges. Also we consider such
situation, called quantum anti-Hamlet effect, when, by frequent detections,
final total polarization angle and state diverge but total probability for
appearance of this state converges. In this way, in mentioned two situations,
"Hamlet dilemma" "to be polarized or not to be polarized that is analytically
completely unsolvable question for a photon".
