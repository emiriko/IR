This document presents a number of quick-step instructions to get started on
writing mini-service-oriented web services-based applications using OpenESB
2.31, Tomcat 6, GlassFish 2.x/3.0.1 with BPEL support, and Java 1.6+ primarily
in Scientific Linux 6.6 with user quota restrictions. While the tutorial notes
are oriented towards the students taking the SOEN487 on service-oriented
architectures (SOA) at Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSE)
Department, Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science (ENCS), other may find
some of it useful as well outside of CSE or Concordia. The notes are compiled
mostly based on the students' needs and feedback.
