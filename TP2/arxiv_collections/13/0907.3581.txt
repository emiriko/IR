We examine the current-induced magnetoresistance oscillations in
high-mobility two-dimensional electron systems using the balance-equation
scheme for nonlinear magnetotransort. The reported analytical expressions for
differential magnetoresistivity at high filling factors in the overlapping
Landau-level regime, which show good agreement with the experimental
observation and the numerical calculation, may be helpful in extracting
physical information from experiments.
