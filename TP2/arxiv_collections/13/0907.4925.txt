We draw an explicit connection between the statistical properties of an
entangled two-mode continuous variable (CV) resource and the amount of
entanglement that can be dynamically transferred to a pair of non-interacting
two-level systems. More specifically, we rigorously reformulate entanglement
transfer process by making use of covariance matrix formalism. When the
resource state is Gaussian, our method makes the approach to the transfer of
quantum correlations much more flexible than in previously considered schemes
and allows the straightforward inclusion of the effects of noise affecting the
CV system. Moreover, the proposed method reveals that the use of de-Gaussified
two-mode states is almost never advantageous for transferring entanglement with
respect to the full Gaussian picture, despite the entanglement in the
non-Gaussian resource can be much larger than in its Gaussian counterpart. We
can thus conclude that the entanglement-transfer map overthrows the "ordering"
relations valid at the level of CV resource states.
