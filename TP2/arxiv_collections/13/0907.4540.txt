Cannone \cite{Cannone} proved the global well-posedness of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations for a class of highly oscillating data. In this paper,
we prove the global well-posedness for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations
in the critical functional framework with the initial data close to a stable
equilibrium. Especially, this result allows us to construct global solutions
for the highly oscillating initial velocity. The proof relies on a new estimate
for the hyperbolic/parabolic system with convection terms.
