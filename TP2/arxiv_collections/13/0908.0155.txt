We characterize the long range dipolar scattering in 2-dimensions. We use the
analytic zero energy wavefunction including the dipolar interaction; this
solution yields universal dipolar scattering properties in the threshold
regime. We also study the semi-classical dipolar scattering and find universal
dipolar scattering for this energy regime. For both energy regimes, we discuss
the validity of the universality and give physical examples of the scattering.
