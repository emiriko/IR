While the periodic Anderson model (PAM) has been recognized as a good model
for various heavy f-electron systems, here we design a purely organic polymer
whose low-energy physics can be captured by PAM. By means of the spin density
functional calculation, we show that polymer of dimethylaminopyrrole is a
candidate, where its ground state can indeed be magnetic depending on the
doping. We discuss the factors favoring ferromagnetic ground state.
