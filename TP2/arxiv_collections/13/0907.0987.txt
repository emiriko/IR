Based on MAGIC observations from June and July 2007, we present upper limits
to the E>140 GeV emission from the globular cluster M13. Those limits allow us
to constrain the population of millisecond pulsars within M13 and to test
models for acceleration of leptons inside their magnetospheres and/or
surrounding. We conclude that in M13 either millisecond pulsars are fewer than
expected or they accelerate leptons less efficiently than predicted.
