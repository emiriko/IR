The full moments expansion of the joint probability distribution of an
isotropic random field, its gradient and invariants of the Hessian is presented
in 2 and 3D. It allows for explicit expression for the Euler characteristic in
ND and computation of extrema counts as functions of the excursion set
threshold and the spectral parameter, as illustrated on model examples.
