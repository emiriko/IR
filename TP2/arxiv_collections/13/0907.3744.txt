In this paper we discuss a model which can be considered as a generalization
of the well-known scalar-tensor Brans-Dicke theory. This model possesses an
interesting feature: due to Born-Infeld type non-linearity of the scalar field
the properties of the interaction between two test bodies depend significantly
on their masses. It is shown that the model can be interesting in view of the
Pioneer 10, 11 spacecraft anomaly.
