We present an approach to one-way quantum computation (1WQC) that can
compensate for single-qubit errors, by encoding the logical information
residing on physical qubits into five-qubit error-correcting code states. A
logical two-qubit cluster state that is the fundamental resource for encoded
quantum teleportation is then described by a graph state containing ten
vertices with constant degree seven. Universal 1WQC that incorporates error
correction requires only multiple copies of this logical two-qubit state and a
logical four-qubit linear cluster state, which are prepared only just in
advance of their use in order to minimize the accumulation of errors. We
suggest how to implement this approach in systems characterized by qubits in
regular two-dimensional lattices for which entangling gates are generically
global operations, such as atoms in optical lattices, quantum dots, or
superconducting qubits.
