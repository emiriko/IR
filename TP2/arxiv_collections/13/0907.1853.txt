In this article, we develop a model for the evolution of real estate prices.
A wide range of inputs, including stochastic interest rates and changing
demands for the asset, are considered. Maximizing their expected utility, home
owners make optimal sale decisions given these changing market conditions.
Using these optimal sale decisions, we simulate the implied evolution of
housing prices providing insights into the recent subprime lending crisis.
