Under the framework of the semiclassical theory, we investigate the
equilibrium-state properties of a spin polarized dipolar Fermi gas through full
numerical calculation. We show that the Fermi surfaces in both real and
momentum spaces are stretched along the attractive direction of dipolar
interaction. We further verify that the deformed Fermi surfaces can be well
approximated by ellipsoids. In addition, the deformation parameters slightly
depend on the local real- and momentum-space densities. We also study the
interaction strength dependence of the energy and real- and momentum-space
densities. By comparing them with variational results, we find that the
ellipsoidal ansatz usually generates accurate results for weak dipolar
interaction, while under strong dipolar interaction limit, notable discrepancy
can be observed. Finally, we map out the stability boundary of the system.
