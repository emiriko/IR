There are at least four unexplained anomalies connected with astrometric
data. Perhaps the most disturbing is the fact that when a spacecraft on a flyby
trajectory approaches the Earth within 2000 km or less, it often experiences a
change in total orbital energy per unit mass. Next, a secular change in the
astronomical unit AU is definitely a concern. It is increasing by about 15 cm
yr$^{-1}$. The other two anomalies are perhaps less disturbing because of known
sources of nongravitational acceleration. The first is an apparent slowing of
the two Pioneer spacecraft as they exit the solar system in opposite
directions. Some astronomers and physicists are convinced this effect is of
concern, but many others are convinced it is produced by a nearly identical
thermal emission from both spacecraft, in a direction away from the Sun,
thereby producing acceleration toward the Sun. The fourth anomaly is a measured
increase in the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. Here again, an increase is
expected from tidal friction in both the Earth and Moon. However, there is a
reported unexplained increase that is significant at the three-sigma level. It
is prudent to suspect that all four anomalies have mundane explanations, or
that one or more anomalies are a result of systematic error. Yet they might
eventually be explained by new physics. For example, a slightly modified theory
of gravitation is not ruled out, perhaps analogous to Einstein's 1916
explanation for the excess precession of Mercury's perihelion.
