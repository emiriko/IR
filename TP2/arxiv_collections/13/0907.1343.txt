We performed simultaneous multiwavelength observations of OJ 287 with the
Nobeyama Millimeter Array for radio, the KANATA telescope and the KVA telescope
for optical, the Suzaku satellite for X-ray and the MAGIC telescope for very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray in 2007. The observations were conducted for a
quiescent state in April and in a flaring state in November-December. We
clearly observed increase of fluxes from radio to X-ray bands during the
flaring state while MAGIC could not detect significant VHE gamma-ray emission
from the source. We could derive an upper limit (95% confidence level) of 1.7%
of the Crab Nebula flux above 150 GeV from about 41.2 hours of the MAGIC
observation. A simple SSC model suggests that the observed flaring activity
could be caused by evolutions in the distribution of the electron population
rather than changes of the magnetic field strength or Doppler beaming factor in
the jet.
