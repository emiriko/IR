We apply the dynamical systems tools to study the (linear) cosmic dynamics of
a Dirac-Born-Infeld-type field trapped in the braneworld. We focus,exclusively,
in Randall-Sundrum and in Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane models. We analyze the
existence and stability of asymptotic solutions for the AdS throat and the
quadratic potential and a particular choice of the warp factor and of the
potential for the DBI field ($f(\phi)=1/V(\phi)$). It is demonstrated, in
particular, that in the ultra-relativistic approximation matter-scaling and
scalar field-dominated solutions always arise. In the first scenario the empty
universe is the past attractor, while in the second model the past attractor is
the matter-dominated phase.
