We present the results of a systematic numerical study of an alternative
progenitor scenario to produce type Ia supernova explosions, which is not
restricted to the ignition of a CO white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass. In
this scenario, a shock-triggered thermonuclear explosion ensues from the
collision of two white dwarfs. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together
with nuclear reactions using both a smoothed particle and a grid-based
hydrodynamics code are performed to study the viability of this alternative
progenitor channel. We find that shock-triggered ignition and the synthesis of
Ni are in fact a natural outcome for moderately massive white dwarf pairs
colliding close to head-on. We use a multi-dimensional radiative transfer code
to calculate the emergent broadband light curves and spectral time-series of
these events. The synthetic spectra and lightcurves compare well with those of
normal type Ia supernovae over a similar B-band decline rate and are broadly
consistent with the Phillips relation, although a mild dependence on viewing
angle is observed due to the asymmetry of the ejected debris. While event rates
within galactic centers and globular clusters are found to be much too low to
explain the bulk of the type Ia supernovae population, they may be frequent
enough to make as much as a one percent contribution to the overall rate.
Although these rate estimates are still subject to substantial uncertainties,
they do suggest that dense stellar systems should provide upcoming supernova
surveys with hundreds of such collision-induced thermonuclear explosions per
year.
