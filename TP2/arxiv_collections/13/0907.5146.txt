discuss the power-law tail in the long-time evolution of a spherically
symmetric self-gravitating massless scalar field in odd spatial dimensions.
They derive explicit expressions for the leading order asymptotics for
solutions with small initial data by using formal series expansions.
Unfortunately, this approach misses an interesting observation that the actual
decay rate is a product of asymptotic cancellations occurring due to a special
structure of the nonlinear terms. Here, we show that one can calculate the
leading asymptotics more directly by recognizing the special structure and
cancellations already on the level of the wave equation.
