We present results of a search for emission-line galaxies in the Southern
Fields of the Hubble Space Telescope PEARS (Probing Evolution And Reionization
Spectroscopically) grism survey. The PEARS South Fields consist of five ACS
pointings (including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field) with the G800L grism for a
total of 120 orbits, revealing thousands of faint object spectra in the
GOODS-South region of the sky. Emission-line galaxies (ELGs) are one subset of
objects that are prevalent among the grism spectra. Using a 2-dimensional
detection and extraction procedure, we find 320 emission lines orginating from
226 galaxy "knots'' within 192 individual galaxies. Line identification results
in 118 new grism-spectroscopic redshifts for galaxies in the GOODS-South Field.
We measure emission line fluxes using standard Gaussian fitting techniques. At
the resolution of the grism data, the H-beta and [OIII] doublet are blended.
However, by fitting two Gaussian components to the H-beta and [OIII] features,
we find that many of the PEARS ELGs have high [OIII]/H-beta ratios compared to
other galaxy samples of comparable luminosities. The star-formation rates
(SFRs) of the ELGs are presented, as well as a sample of distinct giant
star-forming regions at z~0.1-0.5 across individual galaxies. We find that the
radial distances of these HII regions in general reside near the galaxies'
optical continuum half-light radii, similar to those of giant HII regions in
local galaxies.
