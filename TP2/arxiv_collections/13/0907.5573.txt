A high statistics study of high-$p_t$ two-particle azimuthal correlations in
Pb-Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=17.2$ GeV, performed by the CERES experiment at the
CERN-SPS, is presented. A broad away-side correlation with significant dip at
$\Delta\phi\approx\pi$ is observed. The shape and magnitude of the correlation
is similar to measurements at RHIC. In comparison to PYTHIA calculations, we
observe a significant excess of soft particles at the away-side. A study of
charge correlations between trigger and associated particles disfavors vacuum
fragmentation of the away-side jet and suggests significant energy transfer of
the hard-scattered parton to the medium.
