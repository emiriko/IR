We extend the Heine-Stieltjes Theorem to concern all (non-degenerate)
differential operators preserving the property of having only real zeros. This
solves a conjecture of B. Shapiro. The new methods developed are used to
describe intricate interlacing relations between the zeros of different pairs
of solutions. This extends recent results of Bourget, McMillen and Vargas for
the Heun equation and answers their question on how to generalize their results
to higher degrees. Many of the results are new even for the classical case.
