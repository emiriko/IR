We present recent lattice results on the baryon spectrum, nucleon
electromagnetic and axial form factors, nucleon to $\Delta$ transition form
factors as well as the $\Delta$ electromagnetic form factors. The masses of the
low lying baryons and the nucleon form factors are calculated using two
degenerate flavors of twisted mass fermions down to pion mass of about 270 MeV.
We compare to the results of other collaborations. The nucleon to $\Delta$
transition and $\Delta$ form factors are calculated in a hybrid scheme, which
uses staggered sea quarks and domain wall valence quarks. The dominant dipole
nucleon to $\Delta$ transition form factor is also evaluated using dynamical
domain wall fermions. The transverse density distributions of the $\Delta$ in
the infinite momentum frame are extracted using the form factors determined
from lattice QCD.
