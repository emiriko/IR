We present a detailed temperature dependent Raman light scattering study of
optical phonons in Ba{1-x}K{x}Fe{2}As{2} (x ~ 0.28, superconducting Tc ~ 29 K),
Sr{1-x}K{x}Fe{2}As{2} (x ~ 0.15, Tc ~ 29 K) and non-superconducting
BaFe{2}As{2} single crystals. In all samples we observe a strong continuous
narrowing of the Raman-active Fe and As vibrations upon cooling below the
spin-density-wave transition Ts. We attribute this effect to the opening of the
spin-density-wave gap. The electron-phonon linewidths inferred from these data
greatly exceed the predictions of ab-initio density functional calculations
without spin polarization, which may imply that local magnetic moments survive
well above Ts. A first-order structural transition accompanying the
spin-density-wave transition induces discontinuous jumps in the phonon
frequencies. These anomalies are increasingly suppressed for higher potassium
concentrations. We also observe subtle phonon anomalies at the superconducting
transition temperature Tc, with a behavior qualitatively similar to that in the
cuprate superconductors.
