The charge of a polyelectrolyte (PE) controls myriads of phenomena in
biology, biotechnology, and materials science, but still remains elusive from
an understanding. Considering the adsorption of counterions on an isolated PE
chain, an analytical expression for the effective charge - valid for all chain
flexibility, for variable salt, in good solvents at all conditions, in poor
solvents in the expanded (coil) state away from the critical point, and for
gels, brushes and other PE systems in their expanded state - is derived. Phase
boundaries and the critical point for the I-st order collapse transition,
induced cooperatively by counterion adsorption and chain conformations, are
calculated self-consistently. The size of the PE chain is found to be a
single-valued function of charge.
