The current acceleration of the universe leads us to investigate higher
dimensional gravity theory, which is able to explain acceleration from a
theoretical view point without the need of introducing dark energy by hand. We
argue that the terms containing higher dimensional metric coefficients produce
an extra negative pressure that apparently drives an acceleration of the 3D
space, tempting us to suggest that the accelerating universe seems to act as a
window to the existence of extra spatial dimensions. Interesting to point out
that in this case our cosmology apparently mimics the well known quintessence
scenario fuelled by a generalised Chaplygin-type of fluid where a smooth
transition from a dust dominated model to a de Sitter like one takes place.
Correspondence to models generated by a tachyonic form of matter is also
briefly discussed.
