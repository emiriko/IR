We present a detailed study of some $4q$ hadrons in quenched improved
anisotropic lattice QCD. Using the $\pi\pi$ and diquark-antidiquark local and
smeared operators, we attempt to isolate the signal for $I(J^{P})=0(0^{+}),
2(0^{+})$ and $1(1^{+})$ states in two flavour QCD. In the chiral limit of
light-quark mass region, the lowest scalar $4q$ state is found to have a mass,
$m^{I=0}_{4q}=927(12)$ MeV, which is slightly lower than the experimentally
observed $f_{0}(980)$. The results from our variational analysis do not
indicate a signature of a tetraquark resonance in I=1 and I=2 channels. After
the chiral extrapolation the lowest $1(1^{+})$ state is found to have a mass,
$m^{I=1}_{4q}=1358(28)$ MeV. We analysed the static $4q$ potential extracted
form a tetraquark Wilson loop and illustrated the behaviour of the $4q$ state
as a bound state, unbinding at some critical diquark separation.
  From our analysis we conclude that scalar $4q$ system appears as a two-pion
scattering state and that there is no spatially-localised $4q$ state in the
light-quark mass region.
