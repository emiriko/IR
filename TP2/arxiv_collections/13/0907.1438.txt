We report on the analysis of the low-energy electron-recoil spectrum from the
CDMS II experiment using data with an exposure of 443.2 kg-days. The analysis
provides details on the observed counting rate and possible background sources
in the energy range of 2 - 8.5 keV. We find no significant excess in the
counting rate above background, and compare this observation to the recent DAMA
results. In the framework of a conversion of a dark matter particle into
electromagnetic energy, our 90% confidence level upper limit of 0.246
events/kg/day at 3.15 keV is lower than the total rate above background
observed by DAMA by 8.9$\sigma$. In absence of any specific particle physics
model to provide the scaling in cross section between NaI and Ge, we assume a
Z^2 scaling. With this assumption the observed rate in DAMA differs from the
upper limit in CDMS by 6.8$\sigma$. Under the conservative assumption that the
modulation amplitude is 6% of the total rate we obtain upper limits on the
modulation amplitude a factor of ~2 less than observed by DAMA, constraining
some possible interpretations of this modulation.
