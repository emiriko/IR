We employ numerical simulations to show that highly localized, enhanced
electromagnetic fields, also known as "hot spots," produced by a periodic array
of silver nanoantennas can be spatially translated to the other side of a
metal-dielectric composite superlens. The proposed translation of the hot spots
enables surface-enhanced optical spectroscopy without the undesirable contact
of molecules with metal, and thus it broadens and reinforces the potential
applications of sensing based on field-enhanced fluorescence and
surface-enhanced Raman scattering.
