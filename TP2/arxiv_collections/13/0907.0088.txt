An independent set in a graph G is a set of vertices no two of which are
joined by an edge. A vertex-weighted graph associates a weight with every
vertex in the graph. A vertex-weighted graph G is called a unique independence
vertex-weighted graph if it has a unique independent set with maximum sum of
weights. Although, in this paper we observe that the problem of recognizing
unique independence vertex-weighted graphs is NP-hard in general and therefore
no efficient characterization can be expected in general; we give, however,
some combinatorial characterizations of unique independence vertex-weighted
graphs. This paper introduces a motivating application of this problem in the
area of combinatorial auctions, as well.
