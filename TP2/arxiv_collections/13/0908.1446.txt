The theory of electromagnetic in nature new component of electrical current
is suggested. In classical physics approximations for the cases of the free
electron plasmas in semi-conductive media, the atom or molecular electrons of
liquids and amorphous or polycrystalline solid states medias, tensors of
conductivity are calculated. It is shown that the resolution of the additional
members of the tensors of conductivity in degrees of the spatial dispersion
parameter the series begins minus two degree this parameter, not the only
conventional null degree in beginning takes place. The joined optical spatial
and time dispersion effects are to be needed for the experimental observation
this non-conventional component of the electrical current. Some discussion of
this problem is given. In particular, the two-wave propagation effect predicted
is discussed.
