Within the Excited Baryon Analysis Center we have performed a dynamical
coupled-channels analysis of the available $p(e,e' \pi)N$ data in the region of
$W \leq $ 1.6 GeV and $Q^2 \leq$ 1.45 (GeV/c)$^2$. The channels included are
$\gamma^* N$, $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $\pi\pi N$ which has $\pi\Delta$, $\rho
N$, and $\sigma N$ components. With the hadronic parameters of the model
determined in our previous investigations of $\pi N\to \pi N$ reaction, we have
found that the available data in the considered $W \leq $ 1.6 GeV region can be
fitted well by only adjusting the bare $\gamma^* N \to N^*$ helicity amplitudes
for the lowest $N^*$ states in $P_{33}$, $P_{11}$, $S_{11}$ and $D_{13}$
partial waves. The meson cloud effect, as required by the unitarity conditions,
on the $\gamma^* N \to N^*$ form factors are examined.
