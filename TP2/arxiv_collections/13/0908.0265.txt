We discuss how to characterize entanglement sources with finite sets of
measurements. The measurements do not have to be tomographically complete, and
may consist of POVMs rather than von Neumann measurements. Our method yields a
probability that the source generates an entangled state as well as estimates
of any desired calculable entanglement measures, including their error bars. We
apply two criteria, namely Akaike's information criterion and the Bayesian
information criterion, to compare and assess different models (with different
numbers of parameters) describing entanglement-generating devices. We discuss
differences between standard entanglement-verificaton methods and our present
method of characterizing an entanglement source.
