We study the morphological evolution of strained islands in growing crystal
films by use of a continuum description including wetting, elasticity and
deposition flux. Wetting breaks translational invariance, allowing the flux to
tune different nonlinear regimes. Increasing the flux, we find first an
annealing-like dynamics, then a slower but non-conventional ripening followed
by a steady regime, while the island density continuously increases. The
islands develop spatial correlations and ordering with a narrow two-peaked
distance distribution and ridge-like clusters of islands for high flux.
