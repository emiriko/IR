In this work linear stability analysis of a magnetized dusty plasma with an
anisotropic dust component having transversal motions much stronger than
motions parallel to the external magnetic field, and isotropic light plasma
components is described. Such a situation presumably establishes in a shock
compressed space dusty plasma downstream the shock front. Oblique low-frequency
magneto-hydrodynamic waves ($\omega\ll \omega_{cd}$, $\omega_{cd}$ being the
dust cyclotron frequency) are shown to be undergone to the mirror instability.
Consequences for nonthermal dust destruction behind shock fronts in the
interstellar medium are discussed.
