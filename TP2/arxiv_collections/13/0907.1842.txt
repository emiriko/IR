We show that the stacking of flat aromatic molecules on a curved surface
results in topological defects. We consider, as an example, spherical vesicles,
self-assembled from molecules with 5- and 6-thiophene cores. We predict that
the symmetry of the molecules influences the number of topological defects and
the resulting equilibrium shape.
