We discuss a 4D noncommutative space-time as suggested by the version of
quantum (deformed) relativity which provides a classical geometry picture as an
`AdS_5'. The 4D noncommutative space-time is more like a part of a phase space
description, in accordance with the quantum notion -- quantum mechanics talks
about only states but not configurations. The `AdS_5' picture also illustrates
the classical 4D space-time is to be described as part of a bigger geometry
beyond space-time at the quantum level. The radically new picture of quantum
'space-time' is expected to provide the basis for a (still to be formulated)
new approach to quantum gravity with fundamental constants (quantum) hbar and
Newton's constant G put at a similar level as c, the speed of light.
