We successfully contract timetable networks with realistic transfer times.
Contraction gradually removes nodes from the graph and adds shortcuts to
preserve shortest paths. This reduces query times to 1 ms with preprocessing
times around 6 minutes on all tested instances. We achieve this by an improved
contraction algorithm and by using a station graph model. Every node in our
graph has a one-to-one correspondence to a station and every edge has an
assigned collection of connections. Our graph model does not need parallel
edges. The query algorithm does not compute a single earliest arrival time at a
station but a set of arriving connections that allow best transfer
opportunities.
