The field of ground-based gamma ray astronomy has enjoyed rapid growth in
recent years. As an increasing number of sources are detected at TeV energies,
the field has matured and become a viable branch of modern astronomy. Lying at
the uppermost end of the electromagnetic rainbow, TeV photons are always
preciously few in number but carry essential information about the particle
acceleration and radiative processes involved in extreme astronomical settings.
Together with observations at longer wavelengths, TeV gamma-ray observations
have drastically improved our view of the universe. In this review, we briefly
describe recent progress in the field. We will conclude by providing a personal
perspective on the future of the field, in particular, on the significant roles
that China could play to advance this young but exciting field.
