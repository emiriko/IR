The structure and reactions of light nuclei represent fundamental and
formidable challenges for microscopic theory based on realistic strong
interaction potentials. Several {\it ab initio} methods have now emerged that
provide nearly exact solutions for some nuclear properties. The {\it ab initio}
no core shell model (NCSM) and the no core full configuration (NCFC) method,
frame this quantum many-particle problem as a large sparse matrix eigenvalue
problem where one evaluates the Hamiltonian matrix in a basis space consisting
of many-fermion Slater determinants and then solves for a set of the lowest
eigenvalues and their associated eigenvectors. The resulting eigenvectors are
employed to evaluate a set of experimental quantities to test the underlying
potential. For fundamental problems of interest, the matrix dimension often
exceeds $10^{10}$ and the number of nonzero matrix elements may saturate
available storage on present-day leadership class facilities. We survey recent
results and advances in solving this large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem. W
also outline the challenges that lie ahead for achieving further breakthroughs
in fundamental nuclear theory using these {\it ab initio} approaches.
