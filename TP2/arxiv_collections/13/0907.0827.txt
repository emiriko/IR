The main goal of the MASTER-Net project is to produce a unique fast sky
survey with all sky observed over a single night down to a limiting magnitude
of 19 - 20mag. Such a survey will make it possible to address a number of
fundamental problems: search for dark energy via the discovery and photometry
of supernovas (including SNIa), search for exoplanets, microlensing effects,
discovery of minor bodies in the Solar System and space-junk monitoring. All
MASTER telescopes can be guided by alerts, and we plan to observe prompt
optical emission from gamma-ray bursts synchronously in several filters and in
several polarization planes.
