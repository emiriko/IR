A brief overview of strangeness physics with the CLAS detector at JLab is
given, mainly covering the domain of nucleon resonances. Several excited states
predicted by the symmetric constituent quark model may have significant
couplings to the K-Lambda or K-Sigma channels. I will discuss data that are
relevant in the search for such states in the strangeness channel, and give an
outlook on the future prospects of the N* program at JLab with electromagnetic
probes.
