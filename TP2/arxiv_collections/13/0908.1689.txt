With a collecting area of 70 000 m^2, the Five hundred metre Aperture
Spherical Telescope (FAST) will allow for great advances in pulsar astronomy.
We have performed simulations to estimate the number of previously unknown
pulsars FAST will find with its 19-beam or possibly 100-beam receivers for
different survey strategies. With the 19-beam receiver, a total of 5200
previously unknown pulsars could be discovered in the Galactic plane, including
about 460 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Such a survey would take just over 200
days with eight hours survey time per day. We also estimate that, with about 80
six-hour days, a survey of M31 and M33 could yield 50--100 extra-Galactic
pulsars. A 19-beam receiver would produce just under 500 MB of data per second
and requires about 9 tera-ops to perform the major part of a real time
analysis. We also simulate the logistics of high-precision timing of MSPs with
FAST. Timing of the 50 brightest MSPs to a signal-to-noise of 500 would take
about 24 hours per epoch.
