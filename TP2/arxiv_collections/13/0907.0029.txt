Context. NGC 205 is a peculiar dwarf elliptical galaxy hosting in its center
a population of young blue stars. Their origin is still matter of debate, the
central fresh star formation activity possibly being related to dynamical
interactions between NGC 205 and M31. Aims. The star formation history in the
central 30\arcsec ($\sim$120 pc) around the NGC 205 central nucleus is
investigated in order to obtain clues to the origin of the young stellar
population. Methods. Deep HST/ACS CCD photometry is compared with theoretical
isochrones and luminosity functions to characterize the stellar content of the
region under study and compute the recent SF rate. Results. Our photometry
reveals a previously undetected blue plume of young stars clearly
distinguishable down to I$\simeq$26. Our analysis suggests that 1.9$\times10^5$
M$_\odot$ were produced between approximately 62 Myr and 335 Myr ago in the NGC
205 inner regions, with a latest minor episode occurring $\sim$25 Myr ago. This
implies a star formation rate of $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$/yr over this
period. Conclusions. The excellent fit of the observed luminosity function of
young main sequence stars obtained with a model having a constant star
formation rate argues against a tidally triggered star formation activity over
the last $\sim$300 Myr. Rather, a constant SF may be consistent with NGC 205
being on its first interaction with M 31.
