Global linear stability analysis of a self-similar solution describing a
relativistic shell decelerated by an ambient medium is performed. The system is
shown to be subject to the convective Rayleigh-Taylor instability, with a rapid
growth of eigenmodes having angular scale much smaller than the causality
scale. The growth rate appears to be largest at the interface separating the
shocked ejecta and shocked ambient gas. The disturbances produced at the
contact interface propagate in the shocked media and cause nonlinear
oscillations of the forward and reverse shock fronts. It is speculated that
such oscillations may affect the emission from the shocked ejecta in the early
afterglow phase of GRBs, and may be the origin of the magnetic field in the
shocked circum-burst medium.
