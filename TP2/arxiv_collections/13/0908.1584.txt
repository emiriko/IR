The frequency with which spreadsheets are used and the associated risk is
well known. Many tools and techniques have been developed which help reduce
risks associate with creating and maintaining spreadsheet. However, little
consideration has been given to reducing the risks of routine usage by the
"consumers" - for example when entering and editing data. EASA's solution,
available commercially, ensures that any routine process involving spreadsheets
can be executed rapidly and without errors by the end-users, often with a
significant reduction in manual effort. Specifically, the technology enables
the rapid creation and deployment of web-based applications, connected to one
or more centralized spreadsheets; this ensures version control, easy and error
free usage, and security of intellectual property contained in spreadsheets.
