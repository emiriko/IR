We present an examination of high resolution, ultraviolet spectroscopy from
Hubble Space Telescope of the photospheric spectrum of the O-supergiant in the
massive X-ray binary HD 226868 = Cyg X-1. We analyzed this and ground-based
optical spectra to determine the effective temperature and gravity of the O9.7
Iab supergiant. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE), line
blanketed, plane parallel models from the TLUSTY grid, we obtain T_eff = 28.0
+/- 2.5kK and log g > 3.00 +/- 0.25, both lower than in previous studies. The
optical spectrum is best fit with models that have enriched He and N
abundances. We fit the model spectral energy distribution for this temperature
and gravity to the UV, optical, and IR fluxes to determine the angular size of
and extinction towards the binary. The angular size then yields relations for
the stellar radius and luminosity as a function of distance. By assuming that
the supergiant rotates synchronously with the orbit, we can use the radius -
distance relation to find mass estimates for both the supergiant and black hole
as a function of the distance and the ratio of stellar to Roche radius. Fits of
the orbital light curve yield an additional constraint that limits the
solutions in the mass plane. Our results indicate masses of 23^{+8}_{-6} M_sun
for the supergiant and 11^{+5}_{-3} M_sun for the black hole.
