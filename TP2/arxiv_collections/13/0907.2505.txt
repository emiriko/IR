We report on the first experimental verification of the Zurek-Kibble scenario
in an isolated superconducting ring over a wide parameter range. The
probability of creating a single flux quantum spontaneously during the fast
normal-superconducting phase transition of a wide Nb loop clearly follows an
allometric dependence on the quenching time $\tau_{Q}$, as one would expect if
the transition took place as fast as causality permits. However, the observed
Zurek-Kibble scaling exponent $\sigma = 0.62\pm0.15$ is two times larger than
anticipated for large loops. Assuming Gaussian winding number densities we show
that this doubling is well-founded for small annuli.
