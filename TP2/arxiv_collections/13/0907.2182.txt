We give here the Hopf algebra structure describing the noncommutative
renormalization of a recently introduced translation-invariant model on Moyal
space. We define Hochschild one-cocyles $B_+^\gamma$ which allows us to write
down the combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations for noncommutative quantum
field theory. One- and two-loops examples are explicitly worked out.
