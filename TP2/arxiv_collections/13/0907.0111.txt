An accurate knowledge of the neutron capture cross sections of 62,63Ni is
crucial since both isotopes take key positions which affect the whole reaction
flow in the weak s process up to A=90. No experimental value for the
63Ni(n,gamma) cross section exists so far, and until recently the experimental
values for 62Ni(n,gamma) at stellar temperatures (kT=30 keV) ranged between 12
and 37 mb. This latter discrepancy could now be solved by two activations with
following AMS using the GAMS setup at the Munich tandem accelerator which are
also in perfect agreement with a recent time-of-flight measurement. The
resulting (preliminary) Maxwellian cross section at kT=30 keV was determined to
be <sigma>30keV = 23.4 +/- 4.6 mb. Additionally, we have measured the
64Ni(gamma,n)63Ni cross section close to threshold. Photoactivations at 13.5
MeV, 11.4 MeV and 10.3 MeV were carried out with the ELBE accelerator at
Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. A first AMS measurement of the sample
activated at 13.5 MeV revealed a cross section smaller by more than a factor of
2 compared to NON-SMOKER predictions.
