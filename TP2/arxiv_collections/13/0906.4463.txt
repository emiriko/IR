We identify the optimal measurement for obtaining information about the
original quantum state after the state to be measured has undergone partial
decoherence due to noise. We quantify the information that can be obtained by
the measurement in terms of the Fisher information and find its value for the
optimal measurement. We apply our results to a quantum control scheme based on
a spin-boson model.
