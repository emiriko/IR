We study Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate from a
standing light wave for a square pulse with variable pulse length but constant
pulse area. We find that for sufficiently weak pulses, the usual analytical
short-pulse prediction for the Raman-Nath regime continues to hold for longer
times, albeit with a reduction of the apparent modulation depth of the standing
wave. We quantitatively relate this effect to the Fourier width of the pulse,
and draw analogies to the Rabi dynamics of a coupled two-state system. Our
findings, combined with numerical modeling for stronger pulses, are of
practical interest for the calibration of optical lattices in ultracold atomic
systems.
