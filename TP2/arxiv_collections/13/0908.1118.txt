A remarkable phenomenon in turbulent flows is the spontaneous emergence of
coherent large spatial scale zonal jets. Geophysical examples of this
phenomenon include the Jovian banded winds and the Earth's polar front jet. In
this work a comprehensive theory for the interaction of jets with turbulence,
Stochastic Structural Stability Theory, is applied to the problem of
understanding the formation and maintenance of the zonal jets that are crucial
for enhancing plasma confinement in fusion devices.
