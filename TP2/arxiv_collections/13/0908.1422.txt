We present the first-ever global, spatially-resolved reconstruction of the
star formation history (SFH) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), based on the
application of our StarFISH analysis software to the multiband photometry of
twenty million of its stars from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey. The
general outlines of our results are consistent with previously published
results: following an initial burst of star formation, there was a quiescent
epoch from approximately 12 to 5 Gyr ago. Star formation then resumed and has
proceeded until the current time at an average rate of roughly 0.2 solar
masses/yr, with temporal variations at the factor-of-two level. The re-ignition
of star formation about 5 Gyr ago, in both the LMC and SMC, is suggestive of a
dramatic event at that time in the Magellanic system. Among the global
variations in the recent star formation rate are peaks at roughly 2 Gyr, 500
Myr, 100 Myr and 12 Myr. The peaks at 500 Myr and 2 Gyr are nearly coincident
with similar peaks in the SFH of the Small Magellanic Cloud, suggesting a joint
history for these galaxies extending back at least several Gyr. The chemical
enrichment history recovered from our StarFISH analysis is in broad agreement
with that inferred from the LMC's star cluster population, although our
constraints on the ancient chemical enrichment history are weak. We conclude
from the concordance between the star formation and chemical enrichment
histories of the field and cluster populations that the field and cluster star
formation modes are tightly coupled.
