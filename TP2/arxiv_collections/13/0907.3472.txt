We present results of an analysis of the J, H, and K$_s$ 2MASS images of 139
spiral edge-on galaxies selected from the Revised Flat Galaxies Catalog. The
basic structural parameters scalelength (h), scaleheight (z_0), and central
surface brightness of the stellar disks (mu_0) are determined for all selected
galaxies in the NIR bands. The mean relative ratios of the scaleheights of the
thin stellar disks in the J:H:K$_s$ bands are 1.16:1.08:1.00, respectively.
Comparing the scaleheights obtained from the NIR bands for the same objects, we
estimate the scaleheights of the thin stellar disks corrected for the internal
extinction. We find that the extinction-corrected scaleheight is, on average,
11% smaller than that in the K-band. Using the extinction-corrected structural
parameters, we find that the dark-to-luminous mass ratio is, on average, 1.3
for the galaxies in our sample within the framework of a simplified galactic
model. The relative thicknesses of the stellar disks z_0/h correlates with
their face-on central surface brightnesses obtained from the 2MASS images. We
also find that the scaleheight of the stellar disks shows no systematic growth
with radius in most of our galaxies.
