Nonlinear integral equations are proposed for the description of the full
finite size spectrum of the 2-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma-model in a
periodic box. Numerical results for the energy eigenvalues are compared to the
rotator spectrum and perturbation theory for small volumes and with the
recently proposed generalized Luscher formulas at large volumes.
