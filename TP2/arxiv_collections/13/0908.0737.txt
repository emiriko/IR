We discuss various manifestations of the "magnetic scenario" for the
quark-gluon plasma viewed as a mixture of two plasmas, of electrically (quark
and gluons) as well as magnetically charged quasiparticles. Near the
deconfinement phase transition, $T\approx T_c$ very small density of free
quarks should lead to negligible screening of electric field while magnetic
screening remains strong. The consequence of this should be existence of a
"corona" of the QGP, in a way similar to that of the Sun, in which electric
fields influence propagation of perturbations and even form metastable flux
tubes. The natural tool for its description is (dual) magnetohydrodynamics:
among observable consequences is splitting of sound into two modes, with larger
and smaller velocity. The latter can be zero, hinting for formation of
pressure-stabilized flux tubes. Remarkably, recent experimental discoveries at
RHIC show effects similar to expected for "corona structures". In dihadron
correlation function with large-$p_t$ trigger there are a "cone" and a "hard
ridge",while the so called "soft ridge" is a similar structure seen without
hard trigger. They seem to be remnants of flux tubes, which -- contrary to
naive expectations -- seem to break less often in near-$T_c$ matter than do
confining strings in vacuum.
