Four years after the launch the Swift satellite the nature of the Gamma Ray
Bursts (GRBs) broadband afterglow behaviour is still an open issue ad the
standard external shock fireball models cannot easily explain the puzzling
combined temporal and spectral optical to X-ray behaviour of a large number of
afterglows. We analysed the rest frame de-absorbed and K- corrected optical and
X-ray multi-wavelength light-curves of a sample of 33 GRBs with known redshift
and optical extinction at the host frame. We modelled their broadband behaviour
as the sum of the standard forward shock emission due to the interaction of a
fireball with the circum-burst medium and an additional component. We are able
to obtain a good agreement with the observed light-curves despite their
complexity and diversity and can also account for the lack of achromatic late
times jet breaks in several GRBs and explain the presence of chromatic breaks.
Even if the second component is treated in a phenomenological way, we can
identify it as a "late prompt" emission due to a prolonged activity of the
central engine produced by a mechanism similar to the one responsible for the
early prompt emission. Our attempt can be considered as a first step towards
the construction of a more physical scenario. A first important hint is that
the "late prompt" temporal decay is intriguingly consistent with what expected
with the the accretion rate of fallback material. In order to test our model
also from the spectral point of view, we analysed the X-ray time resolved
spectra and when possible the evolution of the optical to X-ray spectral energy
distribution. All the events are found to be fully consistent with what
predicted by our model.
