We examine cross-correlations (CCs) in the tunneling currents through two
parallel interacting quantum dots coupled to four independent ferromagnetic
electrodes. We find that when either one of the two circuits is in the parallel
configuration with sufficiently strong polarization strength, a new mechanism
of dynamical spin blockade, i.e., a spin-dependent bunching of tunneling
events, governs transport through the system together with the inter-dot
Coulomb interaction, leading to a sign-reversal of the zero-frequency current
CC in the dynamical channel blockade regime, and to enhancement of positive
current CC in the dynamical channel anti-blockade regimes, in contrast to the
corresponding results for the case of paramagnetic leads.
