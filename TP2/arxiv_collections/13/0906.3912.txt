Electrode-immobilized glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is used to catalyze
an enzymatic reaction which carries out the AND logic gate. This logic function
is considered here in the context of biocatalytic processes utilized for the
biocomputing applications for "digital" (threshold) sensing/actuation. We
outline the response functions desirable for such applications and report the
first experimental realization of a sigmoid-shape response in one of the
inputs. A kinetic model is developed and utilized to evaluate the extent to
which the experimentally realized gate is close to optimal.
