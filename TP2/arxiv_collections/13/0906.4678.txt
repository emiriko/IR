The work is inspired by thermo-and photoacoustic imaging, where recent
efforts are devoted to take into account attenuation and varying wave speed
parameters. In this paper we derive and analyze causal equations describing
propagation of attenuated pressure waves. We also review standard models, like
frequency power laws, and the thermo-viscous equation and show that they lack
causality in the parameter range relevant for biological photoacoustic imaging.
To discuss causality in mathematical rigor we use the results and concepts of
linear system theory. We present some numerical experiments, which show the
physically unmeaningful behavior of standard attenuation models, and the
realistic behavior of the novel models.
