Motivated by Wallace's thesis that pilot wave beables should be
decoherence-preferred to recover quantum predictions, we consider the relation
between pilot wave beables and decoherence. We prove that without any
connection between beables and decoherence the overlap between macrcopic states
becomes negligible. This is sufficient to recover quantum predictions, so that
Wallace's thesis has to be rejected. A natural connection between decoherence
and beables appears if the decomposition into systems used by decoherence is
based on the beables. While our first result becomes inapplicable in this case,
we present evidence that the overlap becomes negligible too.
