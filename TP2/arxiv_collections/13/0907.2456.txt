We report the results of a low-temperature (300K-15K) high-pressure (up to
22GPa) Raman study of the Verwey transition in magnetite (Fe3O4). We use
additional Raman modes observed below the Verwey transition to determine how
the transition temperature changes with the quasihydrostatic pressure. Increase
of the pressure results in the linear decrease of the Verwey transition
temperature, with no discontinuity. The corresponding pressure coefficient
dTV/dP is found to be ~ -5.2 K/GPa. Such a decrease is substantially larger
than the one predicted by the mean-field Coulomb interaction model of the
transition.
