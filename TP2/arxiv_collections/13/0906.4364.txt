We calculate the muon flux from annihilation of the dark matter in the core
of the Sun, in the core of the Earth and from cosmic diffuse neutrinos produced
in dark matter annihilation in the halos. We consider model-independent direct
neutrino production and secondary neutrino production from the decay of taus
produced in the annihilation of dark matter. We illustrate how muon energy
distribution from dark matter annihilation has a very different shape than muon
flux from atmospheric neutrinos. We consider both the upward muon flux, when
muons are created in the rock below the detector, and the contained flux when
muons are created in the (ice) detector. We contrast our results to the ones
previously obtained in the literature, illustrating the importance of properly
treating muon propagation and energy loss. We comment on neutrino flavor
dependence and their detection.
