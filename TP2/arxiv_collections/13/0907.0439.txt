We point out that confusion sometimes arises when using a chemical potential
in plasma with Coulomb interactions. The results of our consideration are
applied to the discussion of nuclear reactions screening. Finally, we present a
transparent derivation of the thermal conductivity coefficient of a degenerate
electron gas.
