We present the SVOM (Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Object
Monitor) mission, that is being developed in cooperation between the Chinese
National Space Agency (CNSA), the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) and the
French Space Agency (CNES). Its scientific objectives include the study of the
GRB phenomenon, GRB physics and progenitors, cosmology, and fundamental
physics. SVOM is designed to detect all known types of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs),
to provide fast and reliable GRB positions, to measure the broadband spectral
characteristics and temporal properties of the GRB prompt emission. This will
be obtained in first place thanks to a set of four space flown instruments. A
wide field (~2 sr) coded mask telescope (ECLAIRs), operating in the 4-250 keV
energy range, will provide the triggers and localizations, while a gamma-ray
non-imaging spectrometer (GRM), sensitive in the 50 keV-5 MeV domain, will
extend the prompt emission energy coverage. After a satellite slew, in order to
place the GRB direction within field of view of the two narrow field
instruments - a soft X-ray (XIAO), and a visible telescope (VT) - the GRB
position will be refined and the study of the early phases of the GRB afterglow
will be possible. A set of three ground based dedicated instruments, two
robotic telescopes (GFTs) and a wide angle optical monitor (GWAC), will
complement the space borne instruments. Thanks to the low energy trigger
threshold (~4 keV) of the ECLAIRs, SVOM is ideally suited for the detection of
soft, hence potentially most distant, GRBs. Its observing strategy is optimized
to facilitate follow-up observations from the largest ground based facilities.
