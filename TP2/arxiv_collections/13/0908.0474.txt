We investigate the possibility of superconductivity on the graphene lattice
within the repulsive Hubbard model using the variational cluster approximation
(VCA). We find that singlet superconductivity is impossible; instead, triplet
superconductivity is favored, with four solutions that are close to each other
in energy and differ by their symmetry; one is f-wave, the other three p-wave,
including a p+ip solution that breaks time-reversal invariance.
