We demonstrate experimentally and numerically that metamaterials based on
bilayer cross wires give giant optical activity, circular dichroism, and
negative refractive index. The presented chiral design offers a much simpler
geometry and more efficient way to realize negative refractive index at any
frequency. We also developed a retrieval procedure for chiral materials which
works successfully for circularly polarized waves.
