Service-Oriented Computing delivers the promise of configuring and
reconfiguring software systems to address user's needs in a dynamic way.
Context-aware computing promises to capture the user's needs and hence the
requirements they have on systems. The marriage of both can deliver ad-hoc
software solutions relevant to the user in the most current fashion. However,
here it is a key to gather information on the users' activity (that is what
they are doing). Traditionally any context sensing was conducted with hardware
sensors. However, software can also play the same role and in some situations
will be more useful to sense the activity of the user. Furthermore they can
make use of the fact that Service-oriented systems exchange information through
standard protocols. In this paper we discuss our proposed approach to sense the
activity of the user making use of software.
