Molecular electronics is a new, exciting and interdisciplinary field of
research. The main concern of the subject is to exploit the organic materials
in electronic and optoelectronic devices. On the other hand Langmuir-Blodgett
(LB) film deposition technique is one of the best among few methods used to
manipulate materials in molecular level. In this article LB film preparation
technique has been discussed briefly with an emphasize of its application
towards molecular electronics.
