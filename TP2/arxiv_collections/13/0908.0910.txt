The representations of the pointed Hopf algebras $U$ and $\su$ are described,
where $U$ and $\su$ can be regarded as deformations of the usual quantized
enveloping algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(3))$ and the small quantum groups
respectively. It is illustrated that these representations have a close
connection with those of the quantized enveloping algebras
$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$ and those of the half quantum groups of
$\mathfrak{sl}(3)$.
