We investigate the dynamics of solitons of the cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger
Equation (NLSE) with the following perturbations: non-parametric
spatio-temporal driving of the form $f(x,t) = a \exp[i K(t) x]$, damping, and a
linear term which serves to stabilize the driven soliton. Using the time
evolution of norm, momentum and energy, or, alternatively, a Lagrangian
approach, we develop a Collective-Coordinate-Theory which yields a set of ODEs
for our four collective coordinates. These ODEs are solved analytically and
numerically for the case of a constant, spatially periodic force $f(x)$. The
soliton position exhibits oscillations around a mean trajectory with constant
velocity. This means that the soliton performs, on the average, a
unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The
amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of $f(x)$. In
order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we
calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum $P(t)$ and soliton
velocity $V(t)$: This is a parameter representation of a curve $P(V)$ which is
visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton
becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This
conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE.
Moreover, this curve also yields a good estimate for the soliton lifetime: the
soliton lives longer, the shorter the branch with negative slope is.
