This paper presents a brief overview on the issue of singularity resolution
in loop quantum gravity presented at the Theory Canada IV conference at the
Centre de Recherches Math\'{e}matiques at the Universit\'{e} de Montr\'{e}al
(June 4-7, 2008). The intended audience is theoretical physicists who are
non-specialist in the field and therefore much of the technical detail is
omitted here. Instead, a brief review of loop quantum gravity is presented,
followed by a survey of previous and current work on results concerning the
resolution of the classical black hole singularity within loop quantum gravity.
