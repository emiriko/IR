We show that the effective running coupling constant, $\alpha_{\rm eff}$, and
the effective regulator, $\kappa \tilde{m}_{D}^2$, which we used recently to
calculate the energy loss, $\frac{dE}{dx}$, and the elliptic flow, $v_2$, of
heavy quarks in an expanding quark gluon plasma plasma (QGP) are compatible
with lattice results and with recently advanced analytical pQCD calculation.
