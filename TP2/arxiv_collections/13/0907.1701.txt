The effects of non-Riemannian structures in Cosmology have been studied long
ago and are still a relevant subject of investigation. In the seventies, it was
discovered that singularity avoidance and early accelerated expansion can be
induced by torsion in the Einstein-Cartan theory. In this framework, torsion is
not dynamical and is completely expressed by means of the spin sources. Thus,
in order to study the effects of torsion in the Einstein-Cartan theory, one has
to introduce matter with spin. In principle, this can be done in several ways.
In this work we consider the cosmological evolution of the universe in the
presence of a constant isotropic and homogeneous axial current and the
Weyssenhoff spinning fluid. We analyse possible solutions of this model, with
and without the spinning fluid.
