By direct numerical simulation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation we study different aspects of the localization of a non-interacting
ideal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional bichromatic
quasi-periodic optical-lattice potential. Such a quasi-periodic potential, used
in a recent experiment on the localization of a BEC [Roati et al., Nature 453,
895 (2008)], can be formed by the superposition of two standing-wave polarized
laser beams with different wavelengths. We investigate the effect of the
variation of optical amplitudes and wavelengths on the localization of a
non-interacting BEC. We also simulate the non-linear dynamics when a
harmonically trapped BEC is suddenly released into a quasi-periodic potential,
{as done experimentally in a laser speckle potential [Billy et al., Nature 453,
891 (2008)]$ We finally study the destruction of the localization in an
interacting BEC due to the repulsion generated by a positive scattering length
between the bosonic atoms.
