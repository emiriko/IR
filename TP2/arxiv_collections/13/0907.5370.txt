We discuss the state tomography of a fixed qubit (a spin-1/2 target
particle), which is in general in a mixed state, through 1D scattering of a
probe qubit off the target. Two strategies are presented, by making use of
different degrees of freedom of the probe, spin and momentum. Remarkably, the
spatial degree of freedom of the probe can be useful for the tomography of the
qubit.
