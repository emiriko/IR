Narrow resonances in systems with short-range interactions are discussed in
an effective field theory (EFT) framework. An effective Lagrangian is
formulated in the form of a combined expansion in powers of a momentum Q <<
Lambda--a short-distance scale--and an energy difference delta epsilon =
|E-epsilon_0| << epsilon_0--a resonance peak energy. At leading order in the
combined expansion, a two-body scattering amplitude is the sum of a smooth
background term of order Q^0 and a Breit-Wigner term of order Q^2 (delta
epsilon)^{-1} which becomes dominant for delta epsilon <~ Q^3. Such an EFT is
applicable to systems in which short-distance dynamics generates a low-lying
quasistationary state. The EFT is generalized to describe a narrow low-lying
resonance in a system of charged particles. It is shown that in the case of
Coulomb repulsion, a two-body scattering amplitude at leading order in a
combined expansion is the sum of a Coulomb-modified background term and a
Breit-Wigner amplitude with parameters renormalized by Coulomb interactions.
