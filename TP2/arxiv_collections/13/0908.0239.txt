The sort transform (ST) is a modification of the Burrows-Wheeler transform
(BWT). Both transformations map an arbitrary word of length n to a pair
consisting of a word of length n and an index between 1 and n. The BWT sorts
all rotation conjugates of the input word, whereas the ST of order k only uses
the first k letters for sorting all such conjugates. If two conjugates start
with the same prefix of length k, then the indices of the rotations are used
for tie-breaking. Both transforms output the sequence of the last letters of
the sorted list and the index of the input within the sorted list. In this
paper, we discuss a bijective variant of the BWT (due to Scott), proving its
correctness and relations to other results due to Gessel and Reutenauer (1993)
and Crochemore, Desarmenien, and Perrin (2005). Further, we present a novel
bijective variant of the ST.
