We investigate realistic experimental conditions under which the collective
Dicke model can be implemented in ion-cavity QED context. We show how ideal
subradiance and superradiance can be observed and we propose an experiment to
generate entanglement exploiting the existence of the subradiant state. We
explore the conditions to achieve optimal entanglement generation and we show
that they are reachable with current experimental technology.
