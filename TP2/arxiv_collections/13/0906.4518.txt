We present a theoretical analysis of the environment effects on charge
transport in double-stranded synthetic poly(G)-poly(C) DNA molecules attached
to two ideal leads. Coupling of the DNA to the environment results in two
effects: (i) localization of carrier functions due to the static disorder and
(ii) phonon-induced scattering of the carrier between these localized states,
resulting in hopping conductivity. A nonlinear Pauli master equation for
populations of localized states is used to describe the hopping transport and
calculate the electric current as a function of the applied bias. We
demonstrate that, although the electronic gap in the density of states shrinks
as the disorder increases, the voltage gap in the $I-V$ characteristics becomes
wider. Simple physical explanation of this effect is provided.
