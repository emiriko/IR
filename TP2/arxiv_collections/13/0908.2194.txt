A summary of recent results reported in the Structure Functions and Low-x
working group at the DIS 2009 Workshop is given. Recent measurements of deep
inelastic scattering cross sections and structure functions at HERA and of
proton anti-proton collisions at Tevatron are presented. New developments of
the extraction of parton distribution functions and of new theoretical
developments are discussed.
