This is a comprehensive report on the phase transition between two turbulent
states of electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals, which was recently
found by the authors to be in the directed percolation (DP) universality class
[K. A. Takeuchi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 234503 (2007)]. We further
investigate both static and dynamic critical behavior of this phase transition,
measuring a total of 12 critical exponents, 5 scaling functions, and 8 scaling
relations, all in full agreement with those characterizing the DP class in 2+1
dimensions. Developing an experimental technique to create a seed of
topological-defect turbulence by pulse laser, we confirm in particular the
rapidity symmetry, which is a basic but nontrivial consequence of the
field-theoretic approach to DP. This provides the first clear experimental
realization of this outstanding, truly out-of-equilibrium universality class,
dominating most phase transitions into an absorbing state.
