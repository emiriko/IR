We calculate rapidity distribution of photons due to Compton and annihilation
processes from {\em Quark Gluon Plasma} (QGP) with pre-equilibrium
momentum-space anisotropy. We also include contributions from hadronic matter
with late stage transverse expansion. A phenomenological model has been used
for the time evolution of hard momentum scale $p_{\rm hard}(\tau)$ and
anisotropy parameter $\xi(\tau)$. As a result of pre-equilibrium momentum-space
anisotropy, we find significant modification of photons rapidity distribution.
For example, with {\em fixed initial condition} (FIC) {\em free-streaming}
($\delta=2$) interpolating model we observe significant enhancement of photon
rapidity distribution at fixed $p_T$, where as for FIC {\em
collisionally-broadened} ($\delta=2/3$) interpolating model the yield increases
till $y \sim 1$. Beyond that suppression is observed. With {\em fixed final
multiplicity} (FFM) {\em free-streaming} interpolating model we predict
enhancement of photon yield which is less than the case of FIC. Suppression is
always observed for FFM {\em collisionally-broadened} interpolating model.
