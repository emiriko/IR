Globally regular (ie. asymptotically flat and regular interior), spherically
symmetric and localised ("particle-like") solutions of the coupled Einstein
Yang-Mills (EYM) equations with gauge group SU(2) have been known for more than
20 years, yet their properties are still not well understood. Spherically
symmetric Yang--Mills fields are classified by a choice of isotropy generator
and SO(5) is distinguished as the simplest model with a \emph{non-Abelian}
residual (little) group, $SU(2)\times U(1)$, and which admits globally regular
particle-like solutions. We exhibit an algebraic gauge condition which
normalises the residual gauge freedom to a finite number of discrete
symmetries. This generalises the well-known reduction to the real magnetic
potential $w(r,t)$ in the original SU(2) YM model. Reformulating using gauge
invariant polynomials dramatically simplifies the system and makes numerical
search techniques feasible. We find three families of embedded SU(2) EYM
equations within the SO(5) system, one of which was first detected only within
the gauge-invariant polynomial reduced system. Numerical solutions representing
mixtures of the three SU(2) sub-systems are found, classified by a pair of
positive integers.
