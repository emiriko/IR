As a new and clean probe to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma
(sQGP), we propose an azimuthal correlation of an electron and a muon which
originate from the semileptonic decay of charm and bottom quarks. By solving
the Langevin equation for the heavy quarks under the hydrodynamic evolution of
the hot plasma, we show that substantial quenching of the away-side peak in the
electron-muon correlation can be seen if the sQGP drag force acting on heavy
quarks is large enough as suggested from the gauge/gravity correspondence. The
effect could be detected in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider.
