We argue from both technical and physical points of view that the main result
shown in the Comment [arXiv:0709.2619] by Cherrolet et al. [Phys. Rev. B 80,
037101 (2009)] as well as the authors' interpretations of the result are not
sufficient to draw the conclusion that the scaling law at the mobility edge
takes the form T \propto 1/L^2. On the other hand, we believe that the result
shows some evidence of T \propto ln L/L^2 behavior found in S. K. Cheung and Z.
Q. Zhang, Phys. Rev. B 72, 235102 (2005) [arXiv:cond-mat/0509381]. More
calculations with even larger L's are necessary to give a more definitive
answer to this question.
