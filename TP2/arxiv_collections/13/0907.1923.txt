We consider three-loop radiative-recoil corrections to hyperfine splitting in
muonium generated by the diagrams with electron and muon vacuum polarizations.
We calculate single-logarithmic and nonlogarithmic contributions of order
$\alpha^3(m/M)E_F$ generated by gauge invariant sets of diagrams with electron
and muon polarization insertions in the electron and muon factors. Combining
the new contributions with our older results we present complete result for all
three-loop radiative-recoil corrections generated by the diagrams with electron
and muon polarization loops.
