We present Doppler imaging and a Balmer line analysis of the weak-line T
Tauri star TWA 17. Spectra were taken in 2006 with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph
on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Using least-squares deconvolution to improve
the effective signal-to-noise ratio we produced a Doppler map of the surface
spot distribution. This shows similar features to maps of other rapidly
rotating T Tauri stars, i.e. a polar spot with more spots extending out of it
down to the equator.
  In addition to the photospheric variability, the chromospheric variability
was studied using the Balmer emission. The mean H-alpha profile has a narrow
component consistent with rotational broadening and a broad component extending
out to +/-220 km/s. The variability in H-alpha suggests that the chromosphere
has at least one slingshot prominence 3 stellar radii above the surface.
