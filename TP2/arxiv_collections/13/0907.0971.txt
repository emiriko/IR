We present one of the most efficient attacks against the combination
generator. This attack is inherent to this system as its only assumption is
that the filtering function has a good autocorrelation. This is usually the
case if the system is designed to be resistant to other kinds of attacks. We
use only classical tools, namely vectorial correlation, weight 4 multiples and
Walsh transform.
