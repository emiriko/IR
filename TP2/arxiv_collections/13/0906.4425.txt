In a celebrated paper, Valiant and Vazirani raised the question of whether
the difficulty of NP-complete problems was due to the wide variation of the
number of witnesses of their instances. They gave a strong negative answer by
showing that distinguishing between instances having zero or one witnesses is
as hard as recognizing NP, under randomized reductions. We consider the same
question in the quantum setting and investigate the possibility of reducing
quantum witnesses in the context of the complexity class QMA, the quantum
analogue of NP. The natural way to quantify the number of quantum witnesses is
the dimension of the witness subspace W in some appropriate Hilbert space H. We
present an efficient deterministic procedure that reduces any problem where the
dimension d of W is bounded by a polynomial to a problem with a unique quantum
witness. The main idea of our reduction is to consider the Alternating subspace
of the d-th tensor power of H. Indeed, the intersection of this subspace with
the d-th tensor power of W is one-dimensional, and therefore can play the role
of the unique quantum witness.
