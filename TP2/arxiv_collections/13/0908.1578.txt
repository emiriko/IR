We show that the jet structure of DM annihilation or decay products enhances
the anti-deuterium production rate by orders of magnitude compared to the
previous computations done assuming a spherically symmetric coalescence model.
In particular, in the limit of heavy DM, M >> m_p, we get a constant rather
than 1/M^2 suppressed anti-deuterium production rate. Therefore, a detectable
anti-deuterium signal is compatible with the lack of an excess in the
anti-proton PAMELA flux. Most importantly, cosmic anti-deuterium searches
become sensitive to the annihilations or decays of heavy DM, suggesting to
extend the experimental anti-deuterium searches above the O(1) GeV scale.
