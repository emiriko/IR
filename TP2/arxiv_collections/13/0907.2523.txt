Resonant frequencies of the two-dimensional plasma in FETs increase with the
reduction of the channel dimensions and can reach the THz range for sub-micron
gate lengths. Nonlinear properties of the electron plasma in the transistor
channel can be used for the detection and mixing of THz frequencies. At
cryogenic temperatures resonant and gate voltage tunable detection related to
plasma waves resonances, is observed. At room temperature, when plasma
oscillations are overdamped, the FET can operate as an efficient broadband THz
detector. We present the main theoretical and experimental results on THz
detection by FETs in the context of their possible application for THz imaging.
