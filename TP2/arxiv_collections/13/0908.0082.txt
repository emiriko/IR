The recurrent symbiotic nova RS Oph reoccurred after 21 years on 12 February
2006. In contrast to the 1985 outburst, much denser coverage with X-ray
observations was achieved. Swift observed RS Oph up to several times a day
while Chandra and XMM-Newton observed two to four times during each phase of
evolution. While the Swift observations provide high resolution in time, the
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations provide high spectral resolution. Refined
models can be constrained by the grating spectra, and interpolation of the
model parameters can be constrained by the wealth of Swift observations. We
compared the Swift light curve with six X-ray observations taken with \exosat\
during the 1985 outburst. We found that the decay from the supersoft X-ray
binary (SSS) phase had been observed.
