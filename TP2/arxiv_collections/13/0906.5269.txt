Modern spectroscopy of early-type stars often aims at studying complex
physical phenomena. Comparatively less attention is paid to identifying and
studying the "normal" A- and B-type stars and testing how the basic atomic
parameters and standard spectral analysis allow one to fit the observations. We
wish to stablish whether the chemical composition of the solar photosphere can
be regarded as a reference for early A- and late B-type stars. We have obtained
optical high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of three slowly
rotating early-type stars (HD 145788, 21 Peg and pi Cet) that show no obvious
sign of chemical peculiarity, and performed a very accurate LTE abundance
analysis of up to 38 ions of 26 elements (for 21 Peg), using a vast amount of
spectral lines visible in the spectral region covered by our spectra. We
provide an exhaustive description of the abundance characteristics of the three
analysed stars with a critical review of the line parameters used to derive the
abundances. We compiled a table of atomic data for more than 1100 measured
lines that may be used in the future as a reference. The abundances we obtained
for He, C, Al, S, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, and Zr are compatible with the
solar ones derived with recent 3D radiative-hydrodynamical simulations of the
solar photosphere. The abundances of the remaining studied elements show some
degree of discrepancy compared to the solar photosphere. Those of N, Na, Mg,
Si, Ca, Ti, and Nd may well be ascribed to non-LTE effects; for P, Cl, Sc and
Co, non-LTE effects are totally unknown; O, Ne, Ar, and Ba show discrepancies
that cannot be ascribed to non-LTE effects. The discrepancies obtained for O
(in two stars) and Ne agree with very recent non-LTE abundance analysis of
early B-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.
