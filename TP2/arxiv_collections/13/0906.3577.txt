We propose a dimensional regularization scheme in the light-cone gauge NSR
superstring field theory to regularize the divergences caused by the colliding
supercurrents inserted at the interaction points. We study the tree amplitudes
and show that our scheme actually regularize the divergences. We examine the
four-point amplitudes for the NS-NS closed strings and find that the results in
the first-quantized theory are reproduced without any counterterms.
