We report on the experimental observation of two types of phase-locked vector
soliton in weakly birefringent cavity erbium-doped fiber lasers. While a
phase-locked dark-dark vector soliton was only observed in fiber lasers of
positive dispersion, a phase-locked dark-bright vector soliton was obtained in
fiber lasers of either positive or negative dispersion. Numerical simulations
confirmed the experimental observations, and further showed that the observed
vector solitons are the two types of phase-locked polarization domain-wall
solitons theoretically predicted.
