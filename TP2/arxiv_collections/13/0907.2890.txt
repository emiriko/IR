The LMC has a rich star cluster system spanning a wide range of ages and
masses. One striking feature of the LMC cluster system is the existence of an
age gap between 3-10 Gyrs. Four LMC clusters whose integrated colours are
consistent with those of intermediate age simple stellar populations have been
imaged with the Optical Imager (SOI) at the Southern Telescope for
Astrophysical Research (SOAR). Their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) reach V ~
24. Isochrone fits, based on Padova evolutionary models, were carried out to
these CMDs, after subtraction of field contamination. The preliminary results
are as follows: KMK88-38 has an age of ~ 1.3 Gyr, assuming typical LMC
metallicity and distance modulus, and a very low redenning. For OGLE-LMC0531,
the best eye fits to isochrones yield an age ~ 1.6 Gyr and E(B-V)=0.03. BSDL917
is younger, ~ 150 yrs, and subjected to larger extinction (E(B-V)=0.08). The
remaining cluster is currently under analysis. Therefore, we conclude that
these clusers are unlikely to fill in the LMC cluster age gap, even when
fitting uncertainties in the parameters are considered.
