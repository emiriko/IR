Based on the Y-Q and I-U symmetries between mass and lifetime on the general
SU(3) theory, we can derive the lifetime formulas of hyperons and mesons, which
agree better with experiments. It is a new method on lifetime of hadrons
described by quantum numbers. They are symmetrical with the corresponding mass
formulas, and can be unified for mass and lifetime. Further, these formulas may
extend to describe masses and lifetime of heavy flavor hadrons.
