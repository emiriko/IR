Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for quantum information
processing but entails a substantial overhead of classically-controlled quantum
operations, which can be architecturally cumbersome to accommodate. Here we
discuss a novel approach to designing elementary QEC memory cells, in which all
control operations are performed autonomously by an embedded optical feedback
loop. Our approach is natural for nanophotonic implementations in which each
qubit can be coupled to its own optical resonator, and our design for a memory
cell based on the quantum bit-flip or phase-flip code requires only five
qubit-cavities (three for the register and two for the controller) connected by
wave-guides. The photonic QEC circuit is entirely on-chip, requiring no
external clocking or control, and during steady-state operation would only need
to be powered by the injection of constant-amplitude coherent fields.
