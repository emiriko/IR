It is known that, in the chiral limit, spatially inhomogeneous chiral
condensate occurs in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite density
within a mean-field approximation. We study here how an introduction of current
quark mass affects the ground state with the spatially inhomogeneous chiral
condensate. Numerical calculations show that, even if the current quark mass is
introduced, the spatially inhomogeneous chiral condensate can take place. In
order to obtain the ground state, the thermodynamic potential is calculated
with a mean-field approximation. The influence of finite current mass on the
thermodynamic potential consists of following two parts. One is a part coming
from the field energy of the condensate, which favors inhomogeneous chiral
condensate. The other is a part coming from the Dirac sea and the Fermi sea,
which favors homogeneous chiral condensate. We also find that when the
spatially inhomogeneous chiral condensate occurs, the baryon number density
becomes spatially inhomogeneous.
