We introduce a quantum channel describing photon losses depending on the
degree of polarization mixedness. This can be regarded as a model of quantum
channel with correlated errors between discrete and continuous degrees of
freedom. We consider classical information over a continuous alphabet encoded
on weak coherent states as well as classical information over a discrete
alphabet encoded on single photons using dual rail representation. In both
cases we study the one-shot capacity of the channel and its behaviour in terms
of correlation between losses and polarization mixedness.
