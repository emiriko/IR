In situ morphological investigation of the {105} faceted Ge islands on the
Si(001) surface (hut clusters) have been carried out using an ultra high vacuum
instrument integrating a high resolution scanning tunnelling microscope and a
molecular beam epitaxy vessel. Both species of hut clusters--pyramids and
wedges--were found to have the same structure of the {105} facets which was
visualized. Structures of vertexes of the pyramidal clusters and ridges of the
wedge-shaped clusters were revealed as well and found to be different. This
allowed us to propose a crystallographic model of the {105} facets as well as
models of the atomic structure of both species of the hut clusters. An
inference is made that transitions between the cluster shapes are impossible.
