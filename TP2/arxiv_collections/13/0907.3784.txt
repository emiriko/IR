The aim of this paper is to study an analog of non-commutative
Donaldson-Thomas theory corresponding to the refined topological vertex for
small crepant resolutions of toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We define the invariants
using dimer models and provide "wall-crossing" formulas. In particular, we get
normalized generating functions which are unchanged under "wall-crossing".
