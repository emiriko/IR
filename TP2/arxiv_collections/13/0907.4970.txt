We derive the sampling probability density function (pdf) of an ideal
localized random electromagnetic field, its amplitude and intensity in an
electromagnetic environment that is quasi-statically time-varying statistically
homogeneous or static statistically inhomogeneous. The results allow for the
estimation of field statistics and confidence intervals when a single spatial
or temporal stochastic process produces randomization of the field. Results for
both coherent and incoherent detection techniques are derived, for Cartesian,
planar and full-vectorial fields. We show that the functional form of the
sampling pdf depends on whether the random variable is dimensioned (e.g., the
sampled electric field proper) or is expressed in dimensionless standardized or
normalized form (e.g., the sampled electric field divided by its sampled
standard deviation). For dimensioned quantities, the electric field, its
amplitude and intensity exhibit different types of
  Bessel $K$ sampling pdfs, which differ significantly from the asymptotic
Gauss normal and $\chi^{(2)}_{2p}$ ensemble pdfs when $\nu$ is relatively
small. By contrast, for the corresponding standardized quantities, Student $t$,
Fisher-Snedecor $F$ and root-$F$ sampling pdfs are obtained that exhibit
heavier tails than comparable Bessel $K$ pdfs. Statistical uncertainties
obtained from classical small-sample theory for dimensionless quantities are
shown to be overestimated compared to dimensioned quantities. Differences in
the sampling pdfs arising from de-normalization versus de-standardization are
obtained.
