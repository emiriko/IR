We present an introductory overview of several challenging problems in the
statistical characterisation of turbulence. We provide examples from fluid
turbulence in three and two dimensions, from the turbulent advection of passive
scalars, turbulence in the one-dimensional Burgers equation, and fluid
turbulence in the presence of polymer additives.
