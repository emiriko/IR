Despite the increasing importance of hafnium in numerous technological
applications, experimental and computational data on its binary alloys is
sparse. In particular, data is scant on those binary systems believed to be
phase separating. We performed a comprehensive study of 44 hafnium binary
systems with alkali metals, alkaline earths, transition metals and metals,
using high-throughput first principles calculations. These computations predict
novel unsuspected compounds in six binary systems previously believed to be
phase separating They also predict a few unreported compounds in additional
systems and indicate that some reported compounds may actually be unstable at
low temperatures. We report the results for the following systems: AgHf, AlHf,
AuHf, BaHf*, BeHf, BiHf, CaHf*, CdHf, CoHf, CrHf, CuHf, FeHf, GaHf, HfHg, HfIn,
HfIr, HfK*, HfLa*, HfLi*, HfMg, HfMn, HfMo, HfNa*, HfNb*, HfNi, HfOs, HfPb,
HfPd, HfPt, HfRe, HfRh, HfRu, HfSc, HfSn, HfSr*, HfTa*, HfTc, HfTi, HfTl, HfV*,
HfW, HfY*, HfZn, and HfZr. (* = systems in which the ab initio method predicts
that no compounds are stable).
