The effect of solar wind on dust particle, meteoroid, is investigated.
Rotation of the particle is also considered. Detail derivations of both
equation of motion and Euler's dynamical equations, are presented. The most
simple form of the action of the solar wind is considered and the derived
equation of motion reduces to "pseudo-Poynting-Robertson effect" for
non-rotating spherical particle. The final equation of motion contains also
angular velocity term and it may cause change of orbital plane of the
meteoroid. Analysis of the Euler's dynamical equations shows that rotational
axis of the meteoroid changes in time and equilibrium state for the orientation
of the axis of rotation does not exist for spherical particle.
