The H.E.S.S. extended Galactic plane survey revealed the presence of a new
extended TeV gamma-ray source, HESSJ1503-582, with no obvious counterpart at
other wavelengths. The source is, however, coincident with an HI structure with
a velocity significantly different from that of galactic rotation - a so-called
"Forbidden Velocity Wing". These structures have been suggested as the fast
moving shells and filaments associated with the oldest supernova remnants in
our galaxy. The detection of TeV gamma-ray emission from these structures might
indicate that supernova remnants remain efficient particle accelerators for
much longer than is commonly believed. Here we report on recent VERITAS
observations of one of these structures, FVW 190.2+1.1, which shows a clear
shell-like morphology in the HI maps.
