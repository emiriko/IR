We use optical photometric and polarimetric data of BL Lacertae that cover a
period of 22 years to study the variability of the source. The long-term
observations are employed for establishing parameters of a stochastic model
consisting of the radiation from a steady polarized source and a number of
variable components with different polarization parameters, proposed by
Hagen-Thorn et al. earlier. We infer parameters of the model from the
observations using numerical simulations based on a Monte Carlo method, with
values of each model parameter selected from a Gaussian distribution. We
determine the best set of model parameters by comparing model distributions to
the observational ones using the chi-square criterion. We show that the
observed photometric and polarimetric variability can be explained within a
model with a steady source of high polarization, ~40%, and with direction of
polarization parallel to the parsec scale jet, along with 10+-5 sources of
variable polarization.
