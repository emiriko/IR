To understand the impact of low metallicities on giant molecular cloud (GMC)
structure, we compare far infrared dust emission, CO emission, and dynamics in
the star-forming complex N83 in the Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Dust
emission (measured by Spitzer as part of the S3MC and SAGE-SMC surveys) probes
the total gas column independent of molecular line emission and traces
shielding from photodissociating radiation. We calibrate a method to estimate
the dust column using only the high-resolution Spitzer data and verify that
dust traces the ISM in the HI-dominated region around N83. This allows us to
resolve the relative structures of H2, dust, and CO within a giant molecular
cloud complex, one of the first times such a measurement has been made in a
low-metallicity galaxy. Our results support the hypothesis that CO is
photodissociated while H2 self-shields in the outer parts of low-metallicity
GMCs, so that dust/self shielding is the primary factor determining the
distribution of CO emission. Four pieces of evidence support this view. First,
the CO-to-H2 conversion factor averaged over the whole cloud is very high 4-11
\times 10^21 cm^-2/(K km/s), or 20-55 times the Galactic value. Second, the
CO-to-H2 conversion factor varies across the complex, with its lowest (most
nearly Galactic) values near the CO peaks. Third, bright CO emission is largely
confined to regions of relatively high line-of-sight extinction, A_V >~ 2 mag,
in agreement with PDR models and Galactic observations. Fourth, a simple model
in which CO emerges from a smaller sphere nested inside a larger cloud can
roughly relate the H2 masses measured from CO kinematics and dust.
