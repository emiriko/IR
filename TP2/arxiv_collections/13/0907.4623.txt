We introduce a new microcanonical dynamics for a large class of Ising systems
isolated or maintained out of equilibrium by contact with thermostats at
different temperatures. Such a dynamics is very general and can be used in a
wide range of situations, including disordered and topologically inhomogenous
systems. Focusing on the two-dimensional ferromagnetic case, we show that the
equilibrium temperature is naturally defined, and it can be consistently
extended as a local temperature when far from equilibrium. This holds for
homogeneous as well as for disordered systems. In particular, we will consider
a system characterized by ferromagnetic random couplings $J_{ij} \in [ 1 -
\epsilon, 1 + \epsilon ]$. We show that the dynamics relaxes to steady states,
and that heat transport can be described on the average by means of a Fourier
equation. The presence of disorder reduces the conductivity, the effect being
especially appreciable for low temperatures. We finally discuss a possible
singular behaviour arising for small disorder, i.e. in the limit $\epsilon \to
0$.
