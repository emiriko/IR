Transverse-field muon-spin-rotation measurements have been carried out for
polycrystalline ThPt4Ge12. The magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$ and the
superconducting coherence length $\xi$ in the vortex state of this compound
were found to be 112(5) nm and 32(2) nm, respectively. We have estimated the
effective mass of the quasiparticles $m^* \approx 4.6\times m_e$, the
superfluid carrier density $n_s \approx 1.02 \times 10^{28}$ carriers/m$^{3}$,
and the zero-temperature superconducting gap 0.67 meV, corresponding to the
ratio: 2$\Delta(0)/k_BT_c$ = 3.76. We found markable difference between the
temperature dependence of the vortex state muon-spin relaxation rate ZFC- and
FC-$\sigma_s(T)$ below the irreversibility temperature $T_{ir} \sim $ 2.5 K.
Linear field dependence of $\lambda(H)$, small ratio $T_{ir}/T_c$, and power
law behavior of the temperature dependencies of $\lambda(T)$ seem to be
consistent with anisotropic superconducting pairing in the compound studied.
The analysis of correlation between the superconducting transition temperature
and the effective Fermi temperature within the Uemura classification scheme
reveals that ThPt4Ge belongs to the same class of exotic superconductors.
