The Dirac quantization procedure of a magnetic monopole can be used to derive
the coefficient of the D=3 Chern-Simons term through a self-consistency
argument, which can be readily generalized to any odd D. This yields consistent
and covariant axial anomaly coefficients on a D-1 boundary, and Chern-Simons
term coefficients in D. In D=3 magnetic monopoles cannot exist if the
Chern-Simons AdA term is present. The Dirac solenoid then becomes a physical
closed string carrying electric current. The charge carriers on the string must
be consistent with the charge used to quantize the Dirac solenoidal flux. This
yields the Chern-Simons term coefficient. In higher odd D the intersection of
(D-1)/2 Dirac branes yields a charged world-line permitting the consistency
argument. The covariant anomaly coefficients follow readily from generalizing
the counterterm. This purely bosonic derivation of anomalies is quite simple,
involving semiclassical evaluation of exact integrals, like \int dAdA...dA, in
the brane intersections.
