Methods for specifying Moore type state machines (transducers) abstractly via
primitive recursive functions and for defining parallel composition via
simultaneous primitive recursion are discussed. The method is mostly of
interest as a concise and convenient way of working with the complex state
systems found in computer programming and engineering, but a short section
indicates connections to algebraic automata theory and the theorem of Krohn and
Rhodes.
