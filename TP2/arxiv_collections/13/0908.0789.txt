We observe enhanced three-body recombination in an ultracold three-component
$^6$Li Fermi gas with large but unequal scattering lengths attributable to an
excited Efimov trimer state near the three-atom scattering threshold. We find
excellent agreement between the measured three-body recombination rate and the
recombination rate calculated in the zero-range approximation where the only
free parameters are the Efimov parameters $\kappa_*$ and $\eta_*$. The value of
$\kappa_*$ determined by the location of the Efimov resonance we observe at 895
G also predicts the locations of loss features previously observed near 130 and
500 G \cite{Jochim08,OHara09} suggesting that all three features are associated
with universal Efimov trimer states. We also report on the first realization of
a quantum degenerate three-state Fermi gas with approximate SU(3) symmetry.
