The physics of disordered alloys, such as typically the well known case of
CeNi1-xCux alloys, showing an interplay among the Kondo effect, the spin glass
state and a magnetic order, has been studied firstly within an average
description like in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Recently, a theoretical
model (PRB 74, 014427 (2006)) involving a more local description of the
intersite interaction has been proposed to describe the phase diagram of
CeNi1-xCux. This alloy is an example of the complex interplay between Kondo
effect and frustration in which there is in particular the onset of a
cluster-glass state. Although the model given in Ref. PRB 74, 014427 (2006) has
reproduced the different phases relatively well, it is not able to describe the
cluster-glass state. We study here the competition between the Kondo effect and
a cluster glass phase within a Kondo Lattice model with an inter-cluster random
Gaussian interaction. The inter-cluster term is treated within the cluster
mean-field theory for spin glasses, while, inside the cluster, an exact
diagonalisation is performed including inter-site ferromagnetic and intra-site
Kondo interactions. The cluster glass order parameters and the Kondo
correlation function are obtained for different values of the cluster size, the
intra-cluster ferromagnetic coupling and the Kondo intra-site coupling. We
obtain, for instance, that the increase of the Kondo coupling tends to destroy
the cluster glass phase.
