3D simulations of magnetic flux emergence are carried out in a computational
domain spanning the upper layers of the convection zone to the lower corona. We
use the Oslo Staggered Code to solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and
NLTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field lines.
In this paper we concentrate on the later stages of the simulations and study
the evolution of the structure of the rising flux in the upper chromosphere and
corona, the interaction between the emerging flux and the weak coronal magnetic
field initially present, and the associated dynamics.
  The flux tube injected at the bottom boundary rises to the photosphere where
it largely remains. However, some parts of the flux tube become unstable and
expand in patches into the upper chromosphere. The flux rapidly expands towards
the corona, pushing the coronal and transition region material aside, lifting
and maintaining the transition region at heights greater than 5 Mm above the
photosphere for extensive periods of time. The pre-existing magnetic field in
the corona and transition region is perturbed by the incoming flux and
reoriented by a series of high Joule heating events. Low density structures
form in the corona while at later times a high density filamentary structure
appears in the lower part of the expanding flux. The dynamics of these and
other structures is discussed. While Joule heating due to the expanding flux is
episodic, it increases in relative strength as fresh magnetic field rises and
becomes energetically important in the upper chromosphere and corona at later
times. Chromospheric, transition region and coronal lines are computed and
their response to the perturbation caused by the expanding emerging flux is
discussed.
