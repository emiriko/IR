Modulated in time orbital electron capture (EC) decays have been observed
recently in stored H-like $^{140}$Pr$^{58+}$ and $^{142}$Pm$^{60+}$ ions.
Although, the experimental results are extensively discussed in literature, a
firm interpretation has still to be established. Periodic transitions between
the hyperfine states could possible lead to the observed effect. Both selected
nuclides decay to stable daughter nuclei via allowed Gamow-Teller transitions.
Due to the conservation of total angular momentum, the allowed EC decay can
only proceed from the hyperfine ground state of parent ions. In this work we
argue that periodic transitions to the excited hyperfine state (sterile) in
respect to the allowed EC decay ground state cannot explain the observed decay
pattern.
