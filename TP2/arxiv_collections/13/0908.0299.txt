An intriguing potential signature of hydrodynamic behavior in relativistic
A+A reactions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energies is conical
flow induced by fast supersonic particles traversing the hot and dense medium.
Here I present first results on the evolution of Mach shocks in 2->2 covariant
transport theory, in a static uniform medium.
