The experimental demonstration and characterization is made of the
plasmon-mediated resonant transmission through an embedded undulated continuous
thin metal film under normal incidence. 1D undulations are shown to enable a
spatially resolved polarisation filtering whereas 2D undulations lead to
spatially resolved, polarization independent transmission. Whereas the needed
submicron microstructure lends itself in principle to CD-like low-cost mass
replication by means of injection moulding and embossing, the present paper
demonstrates the expected transmission effects on experimental models based on
metal-coated photoresist gratings. The spectral and angular dependence in the
neighbourhood of resonance are investigated and the question of the excess
losses exhibited by surface plasmons is discussed
