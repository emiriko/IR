A quasi-classical theoretical description of polarization and relaxation of
nuclear spins in a quantum dot with one resident electron is developed for
arbitrary mechanisms of electron spin polarization. The dependence of the
electron-nuclear spin dynamics on the correlation time $\tau_c$ of electron
spin precession, with frequency $\Omega$, in the nuclear hyperfine field is
analyzed. It is demonstrated that the highest nuclear polarization is achieved
for a correlation time close to the period of electron spin precession in the
nuclear field. For these and larger correlation times, the indirect hyperfine
field, which acts on nuclear spins, also reaches a maximum. This maximum is of
the order of the dipole-dipole magnetic field that nuclei create on each other.
This value is non-zero even if the average electron polarization vanishes. It
is shown that the transition from short correlation time to $\Omega\tau_c>1$
does not affect the general structure of the equation for nuclear spin
temperature and nuclear polarization in the Knight field, but changes the
values of parameters, which now become functions of $\Omega\tau_c$. For
correlation times larger than the precession time of nuclei in the electron
hyperfine field, it is found that three thermodynamic potentials ($\chi$,
$\bm{\xi}$, $\varsigma$) characterize the polarized electron-nuclear spin
system. The values of these potentials are calculated assuming a sharp
transition from short to long correlation times, and the relaxation mechanisms
of these potentials are discussed. The relaxation of the nuclear spin potential
is simulated numerically showing that high nuclear polarization decreases
relaxation rate.
