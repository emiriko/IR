Using typical experimental techniques it is difficult to separate the effects
of carrier density and disorder on the superconducting transition in two
dimensions. Using a simple fabrication procedure based on metal layer
dewetting, we have produced graphene sheets decorated with a non-percolating
network of nanoscale tin clusters. These metal clusters both efficiently dope
the graphene substrate and induce long-range superconducting correlations. This
allows us to study the superconducting transition at fixed disorder and
variable carrier concentration. We find that despite structural inhomogeneity
on mesoscopic length scales (10-100 nm), this material behaves electronically
as a homogenous dirty superconductor. Our simple self-assembly method
establishes graphene as an ideal tunable substrate for studying induced
two-dimensional electronic systems at fixed disorder and our technique can
readily be extended to other order parameters such as magnetism.
