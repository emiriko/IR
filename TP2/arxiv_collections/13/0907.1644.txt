We analyze one-dimensional photonic superlattices which alternate layers of
air and a left-handed material. We assume Drude-type dispersive responses for
the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the left-handed
material. Maxwell's equations and the transfer-matrix technique are used to
derive the dispersion relation for the propagation of obliquely incident
optical fields. The photonic dispersion indicates that the growth-direction
component of the electric (or magnetic) field leads to the propagation of
electric (or magnetic) plasmon polaritons, for either TE or TM configurations.
Furthermore, we show that if the plasma frequency is chosen within the photonic
$<n(\omega)>=0$ zeroth-order bandgap, the coupling of light with plasmons
weakens considerably. As light propagation is forbidden in that particular
frequency region, the plasmon-polariton mode reduces to a pure plasmon mode.
