The Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy REJ1034+396 is so far unique amongst AGN in
showing a Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in its variability power spectrum.
There are multiple types of QPO seen in black hole binary (BHB) systems, so we
need to identify which BHB QPO corresponds to the one seen in the AGN. A key
hint is the `hot disc dominated' energy spectrum of REJ1034+396 which is
sufficiently unusual that it suggests a mildly super-Eddington flow, also
favoured by the most recent mass estimates for the AGN. This suggests the 67Hz
QPO seen occasionally in the mildly super-Eddington BHB GRS 1915+105 as the
most likely counterpart, assuming mass scaling of the QPO frequency. This is
supported by the fact that these data from GRS 1915+105 have an energy spectrum
which is also dominated by a `hot disc' component. Here we show that the
underlying broad band power spectral shape and normalisation are also similar,
providing further consistency checks for this identification. Thus the AGN QPO
adds to the growing evidence for a simple mass scaling of the accretion flow
properties between stellar and supermassive black holes.
