I discuss an idea which could lead to a methodology for testing the effects
of WIMP DM scattering and capture onto primordial stars. It relies on the
effects of "life-prolongation" of affected Population III stars, that can slow
down nuclear reactions by supporting their own structure with the energy
produced by annihilating DM captured inside the star. This can lead to an
alteration of the Pair Production SuperNova rate, which could constitute a
peculiar signature of the existence of capture Dark Stars.
