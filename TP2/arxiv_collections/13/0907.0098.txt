We consider the phase coherent transport of a quasi one-dimensional beam of
Bose-Einstein condensed particles through a disordered potential of length L.
Among the possible different types of flow identified in [T. Paul et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 98, 210602 (2007)], we focus here on the supersonic stationary
regime where Anderson localization exists. We generalize the diffusion
formalism of Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar to include interaction effects. It is
shown that interactions modify the localization length and also introduce a
length scale L* for the disordered region, above which most of the realizations
of the random potential lead to time dependent flows. A Fokker-Planck equation
for the probability density of the transmission coefficient that takes this new
effect into account is introduced and solved. The theoretical predictions are
verified numerically for different types of disordered potentials. Experimental
scenarios for observing our predictions are discussed.
