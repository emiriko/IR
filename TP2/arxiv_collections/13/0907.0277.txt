We theoretically study Josephson vortex structures in Josephson junctions
which have multiple tunneling channels caused by multiple superconducting gaps.
Deriving "coupled sine-Gordon equations" from the free-energy taking account of
the multiple tunneling channels, we examine two typical situations, a heterotic
junction composed of multigap-superconductor, insulator, and single-gap
superconductor, and a grain-boundary junction formed by two identical multigap
superconductors. Then, we reveal in both situations that the magnetic field
distribution of the Josephson vortex for $\pm s$-wave superconductivity is more
enlarged than that for s-wave without sign change between the order parameters.
Its mechanism is ascribed to a cancellation of the multiple Josephson currents.
We display such an anomalous Josephson vortex and suggest how to evaluate the
enlargement.
