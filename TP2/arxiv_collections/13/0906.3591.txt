We report on suppression of long-range wakefields in CLIC accelerating
structures. Strong detuning and moderate damping is employed. In these initial
design studies we focus on the CLIC_G structure and enforce a moderate Q of 300
and 500. We maintain a dipole bandwidth of approximately 1 GHz as specified
from breakdown constraints in a modified structure, CLIC_DDS. The circuit
model, which facilitates a rapid design of manifolds slot-coupled to the main
accelerating cells, is described.
