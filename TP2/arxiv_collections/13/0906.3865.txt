We perform investigation of Hubbard model with interaction between strongly
correlated conducting electrons on a lattice with Debye phonons. To solve the
problem generalized dynamical mean-field DMFT+\Sigma method is employed with
"external" self-energy \Sigma_ph corresponding to electron-phonon interaction.
We present DMFT+\Sigma_ph results for densities of states and kinks in energy
dispersions for a variety of model parameters, analyzing the interplay of
recently discovered kinks of purely electronic nature and usual phonon kinks in
the electronic spectrum.
