The technique of nuclear track emulsions is used to explore the fragmentation
of light relativistic nuclei down to the most peripheral interactions - nuclear
"white" stars. A complete pattern of therelativistic dissociation of a $^8$B
nucleus with target fragment accompaniment is presented. Relativistic
dissociation $^{9}$Be$\to2\alpha$ is explored using significant statistics and
a relative contribution of $^{8}$Be decays from 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states is
established. Target fragment accompaniments are shown for relativistic
fragmentation $^{14}$N$\to$3He+H and $^{22}$Ne$\to$5He. The leading role of the
electromagnetic dissociation on heavy nuclei with respect to break-ups on
target protons is demonstrated in all these cases. It is possible to conclude
that the peripheral dissociation of relativistic nuclei in nuclear track
emulsion is a unique tool to study many-body systems composed of lightest
nuclei and nucleons in the energy scale relevant for nuclear astrophysics.
