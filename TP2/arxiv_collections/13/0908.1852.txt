The formation of bubble defects of the double stranded DNA is treated
according to the Lifshits theory of disordered chains. A molecule of the DNA is
modelled on a harmonic lattice with nearest neighbour interaction, elastic
constants being randomly distributed. The helicoidal symmetry is accommodated
through a chiral field at sites of the lattice. The number of sites varies from
100 to 300, corresponding to DNA segmnets of persistence length. We find the
spectra of elastic eigen-modes that mimic inter-strand excitations of the
duplex. The frequency distribution shows peaks and valleys at the
high-frequency end of the spectra, in accord with the general theory. External
excitations may lead to a parametric resonance that can generate localized
modes of the lattice. In real life pumping hyper-sound may generate a resonance
similar to that studied in this paper, and thus result in excitation of
inter-strand modes and possible formation of bubbles, in the duplex of the DNA.
