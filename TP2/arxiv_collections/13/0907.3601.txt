Theoretical and numerical studies are performed for the nonlinear structures
(explosive, solitons and shock) in quantum electron-positron-ion
magnetoplasmas. For this purpose, the reductive perturbation method is employed
to the quantum hydrodynamical equations and the Poisson equation, obtaining
extended quantum Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The latter has been solved using
the generalized expansion method to obtain a set of analytical solutions, which
reflect the possibility of the propagation of various nonlinear structures. The
relevance of the present investigation to the white dwarfs is highlighted.
