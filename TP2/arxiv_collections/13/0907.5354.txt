Deformations of the canonical commutation relations lead to non-Hermitian
momentum and position operators and therefore almost inevitably to
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that such type of deformed quantum
mechanical systems may be treated in a similar framework as quasi/pseudo and/or
PT-symmetric systems, which have recently attracted much attention. For a newly
proposed deformation of exponential type we compute the minimal uncertainty and
minimal length, which are essential in almost all approaches to quantum
gravity.
