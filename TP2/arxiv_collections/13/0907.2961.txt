We performed a systematic study on the properties of CeFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O
($0\leq x\leq 1$) by electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat
measurements. The c-axis lattice constant decreases significantly with
increasing P content, suggesting a remarkable chemical pressure. The Fe-3d
electrons show the enhanced metallic behavior upon P-doping and undergo a
magnetic quantum phase transition around $x \approx 0.4$. Meanwhile, the Ce-4f
electrons develop a ferromagnetic order near the same doping level. The
ferromagnetic order is vanishingly small around $x=0.9$. The data suggest a
heavy-fermion-like behavior as $x\geq 0.95$. No superconductivity is observed
down to 2 K. Our results show the ferromagnetic ordered state as an
intermediate phase intruding between the antiferromagnetic bad metal and the
nonmagnetic heavy fermion metal and support the cerium-containing iron
pnictides as a unique layered Kondo lattice system.
