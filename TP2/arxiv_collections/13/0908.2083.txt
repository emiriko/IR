We study the state complexity of regular operations in the class of ideal
languages. A language L over an alphabet Sigma is a right (left) ideal if it
satisfies L = L Sigma* (L = Sigma* L). It is a two-sided ideal if L = Sigma* L
Sigma *, and an all-sided ideal if it is the shuffle of Sigma* with L. We
prefer the term "quotient complexity" instead of "state complexity", and we use
derivatives to calculate upper bounds on quotient complexity, whenever it is
convenient. We find tight upper bounds on the quotient complexity of each type
of ideal language in terms of the complexity of an arbitrary generator and of
its minimal generator, the complexity of the minimal generator, and also on the
operations union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference,
concatenation, star and reversal of ideal languages.
