We review some recent progress in understanding the spectrum of
energies/dimensions of strings/operators in AdS5 x S5 -- planar N=4 super
Yang-Mills correspondence. We consider leading strong coupling corrections to
the energy of lightest massive string modes in AdS5 x S5, which should be dual
to members of the Konishi operator multiplet in the SYM theory. This determines
the general structure of strong-coupling expansion of the anomalous dimension
of the Konishi operator. Following arXiv:0906.4294 we use 1-loop results for
semiclassical string states to extract information about the leading
coefficients in this expansion.
