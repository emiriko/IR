We report a comprehensive discussion of quantum interference effects due to
the finite structure of excitons in quantum rings and their first experimental
corroboration observed in the optical recombinations. Anomalous features that
appear in the experiments are analyzed according to theoretical models that
describe the modulation of the interference pattern by temperature and built-in
electric fields.
