We study the concentration dependence of the superconducting critical
temperature Tc in a boron-doped diamond. We evaluate the density of states at
Fermi level within the dynamical cluster approximation obtaining higher values
than from the coherent potential approximation. We discuss the Tc as a function
of density of states within the BCS, the McMillan, and the Belitz theory. The
simplified Belitz theory gives the best agreement with experimental data. Since
the density of states follows a simple power-law for accessible doping
concetrations, the present theory offers an analytical formula for Tc(x).
