We have experimentally studied the impact of an initially planar axisymmetric
vortex ring, incident at an oblique angle, upon a gravity-induced interface
separating two fluids of differing densities. After impact, the vortex ring was
found to exhibit a variety of subsequent trajectories, which we organize
according to both the incidence angle, $\theta_i$, and the interface strength,
defined as the ratio of the Atwood and Froude numbers, $A/F$. For grazing
incidence angles ($\theta_i \gtrsim 70$ deg.) vortices either penetrate or
reflect from the interface, depending on whether the interface is weak or
strong. In some cases, reflected vortices execute damped oscillations before
finally disintegrating. For smaller incidence angles ($\theta_i \lesssim 70$
deg.) vortices penetrate the interface. When there is a strong interface, these
vortices are observed to curve back up toward the interface. When there is a
weak interface, these vortices are observed to refract downward, away from the
interface. The critical interface strength below which vortex ring refraction
is observed is given by $\log_{10}{(A/F)}= -2.38 \pm 0.05$.
