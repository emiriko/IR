The Poincar\'e group can be interpreted as the group of isometries of a
minkowskian space. This point of view suggests to consider the group of
isometries of a given space as the suitable group to construct a gauge theory
of gravity. We extend these ideas to the case of maximally symmetric spaces to
reach a realistic theory including the presence of a cosmological constant.
Introducing the concept of "minimal tetrads" we deduce Einstein gravity in the
vacuum as a gauge theory of translations.
