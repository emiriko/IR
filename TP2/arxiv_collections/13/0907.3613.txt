We introduce EXOFIT, a Bayesian tool for estimating orbital parameters of
extrasolar planets from radial velocity measurements. EXOFIT can search for
either one or two planets at present. EXOFIT employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method implemented in an object oriented manner. As an example we re-analyze
the orbital solution of HD155358 and the results are compared with that of the
published orbital parameters. In order to check the agreement of the EXOFIT
orbital parameters with the published ones we examined radial velocity data of
30 stars taken randomly from www.exoplanet.eu. We show that while orbital
periods agree in both methods, EXOFIT prefers lower eccentricity solutions for
planets with higher (e >=0.5) orbital eccentricities.
