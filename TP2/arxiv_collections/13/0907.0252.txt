Localization properties of particles in one-dimensional incommensurate
lattices without interaction are investigated with models beyond the
tight-binding Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model. Based on a tight-binding t_1 - t_2
model with finite next-nearest-neighbor hopping t_2, we find the localization
properties qualitatively different from those of the AA model, signaled by the
appearance of mobility edges. We then further go beyond the tight-binding
assumption and directly study the system based on the more fundamental
single-particle Schr\"odinger equation. With this approach, we also observe the
presence of mobility edges and localization properties dependent on
incommensuration.
