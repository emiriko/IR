The supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT) system IGR J17544-2619 has
displayed many large outbursts in the past and is considered an archetypal
example of SFXTs. A search of the INTEGRAL/ISGRI data archive from MJD
52698-54354 has revealed 11 outbursts and timing analysis of the light curve
identifies a period of 4.926$\pm$0.001 days which we interpret as the orbital
period of the system. We find that large outbursts occasionally occur outside
of periastron and place an upper limit for the radius of the supergiant of
<23R$_{\sun}$.
