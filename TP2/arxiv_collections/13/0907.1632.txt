We develop an approach to incorporate additional knowledge, in the form of
general purpose integrity constraints (ICs), to reduce uncertainty in
probabilistic databases. While incorporating ICs improves data quality (and
hence quality of answers to a query), it significantly complicates query
processing. To overcome the additional complexity, we develop an approach to
map an uncertain relation U with ICs to another uncertain relation U', that
approximates the set of consistent worlds represented by U. Queries over U can
instead be evaluated over U' achieving higher quality (due to reduced
uncertainty in U') without additional complexity in query processing due to
ICs. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach to large
data-sets with complex constraints. We also present experimental results
demonstrating the utility of incorporating integrity constraints in uncertain
relations, in the context of an information extraction application.
