A number of deeply virtual exclusive experiments will allow us to access the
Generalized Parton Distributions which are embedded in the complex amplitudes
for such processes. The extraction from experiment is particularly challenging
both because of the large number of kinematical variables and observables to be
pinned down in each experimental analysis and because, at variance with
inclusive experiments, the variables representing the quark momentum fraction
appear integrated over in the physical amplitudes and cannot be accessed
directly. We present a strategy for the extraction from experiment that makes
use of constraints from both elastic and inclusive scattering as well as
information from lattice QCD results.
