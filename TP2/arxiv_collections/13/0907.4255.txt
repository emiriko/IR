Dilepton production in In+In collisions at 158 AGeV is studied within the
microscopic Parton-Hadron-Strings Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which is
based on a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice
QCD results in thermodynamic equilibrium. A comparison to the data of the NA60
Collaboration shows that the low mass dilepton spectra are well described by
including a collisional broadening of vector mesons, while the spectra in the
intermediate mass range are dominated by off-shell quark-antiquark annihilation
in the nonperturbative QGP. In particular, the observed softening of the mT
spectra at intermediate masses is reproduced.
