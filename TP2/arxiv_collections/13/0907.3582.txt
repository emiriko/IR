We report first results on a deep sub-threshold production of the doubly
strange hyperon $\Xi^-$ in a heavy-ion reaction. At a beam energy of 1.76A GeV
the reaction Ar+KCl was studied with the High Acceptance Di-Electron
Spectrometer (HADES) at SIS18/GSI. A high-statistics and high-purity $\Lambda$
sample was collected, allowing for the investigation of the decay channel
$\Xi^- \to \Lambda \pi^-$. The deduced $\Xi^-/(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)$ production
ratio of $(5.6 \pm 1.2 ^{+1.8}_{-1.7})\cdot 10^{-3}$ is significantly larger
than available model predictions.
