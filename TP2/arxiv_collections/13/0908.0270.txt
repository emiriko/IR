A Lagrangian analysis explains the numerical results of Valentini and Westman
(2005) which demonstrate that an initially arbitrary particle density, stirred
by the field of de Broglie velocities associated with a Schrodinger wave
function, relaxes to the Born probability density provided both densities are
coarse-grained.
