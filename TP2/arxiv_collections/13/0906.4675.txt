We present a dynamical model for rewiring and attachment in bipartite
networks in which edges are added between nodes that belong to catalogs that
can either be fixed in size or growing in size. The model is motivated by an
empirical study of data from the video rental service Netflix, which invites
its users to give ratings to the videos available in its catalog. We find that
the distribution of the number of ratings given by users and that of the number
of ratings received by videos both follow a power law with an exponential
cutoff. We also examine the activity patterns of Netflix users and find bursts
of intense video-rating activity followed by long periods of inactivity. We
derive ordinary differential equations to model the acquisition of edges by the
nodes over time and obtain the corresponding time-dependent degree
distributions. We then compare our results with the Netflix data and find good
agreement. We conclude with a discussion of how catalog models can be used to
study systems in which agents are forced to choose, rate, or prioritize their
interactions from a very large set of options.
