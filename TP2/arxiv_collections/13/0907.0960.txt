The MAGIC gamma-ray observatory has recently been upgraded by a second
Cherenkov telescope at a distance of 85 m from the first one. Simultaneous
observation of air showers with the two MAGIC telescopes (stereoscopic mode)
will improve the reconstruction of the shower axis and solve the ambiguity in
the impact point occurring in single-telescope mode. Also, the stereo
observation will result in a better angular resolution, energy estimation and
cosmic-ray background rejection. It is expected that the sensitivity of MAGIC
improves significantly over the full energy range (60 GeV - 20 TeV). Here, we
present the performance estimated from Monte Carlo simulations.
