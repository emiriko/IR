Cake filtration is a widely used solid-liquid separation process. However,
the high flow resistance of the nanoporous filter cake lowers the efficiency of
the process significantly. The structure and thus the permeability of the
filter cakes depend on the compressive load acting on the particles, the
particles size, and the agglomeration of the particles. The latter is
determined by the particle charge and the ionic strength of the suspension, as
described by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. In this paper,
we propose a combined stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) and molecular dynamics
(MD) methodology to simulate the cake formation. The simulations give further
insight into the dependency of the filter cakes' structure on the agglomeration
of the particles, which cannot be accessed experimentally. The permeability, as
investigated with lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations of flow through the
discretized cake, depends on the particle size and porosity, and thus on the
agglomeration of the particles. Our results agree qualitatively with
experimental data obtained from colloidal boehmite suspensions.
