We propose novel coherent-state phase concentration by probabilistic
measurement-induced ampli- fication. The amplification scheme uses novel
architecture, thermal noise addition (instead of single photon addition)
followed by feasible multiple photon subtraction using realistic photon-number
resolving detector. It allows to substantially amplify weak coherent states and
simultaneously reduce their phase uncertainty, contrary to the deterministic
amplifier.
