We recall the main features of the Regge approach used to understand soft
interactions at LHC and higher energies. Unitarity tames the power growth of
the elastic proton-proton scattering amplitude with energy, and leads to the
migration of the secondary particles produced in high-energy proton-proton
collisions to larger transverse momenta. We discuss, in qualitative terms, the
role of processes containing large rapidity gaps (LRG), and the probability
that the gaps survive population by secondaries produced in additional soft
interactions. We explain how the Regge diagram corresponding to a LRG event
simultaneously describes events with different (single, double, etc.) particle
density in the same rapidity interval. We show that the role of these,
enhanced, multi-Pomeron diagrams can be studied by measuring multiplicity
fluctuations and long-range rapidity correlations between secondaries produced
at the Tevatron and the LHC. Finally, we make a list of the characteristic
features of the multi-Pomeron description of soft interactions that may be
observed at the high energies accessible at the Tevatron and the LHC.
