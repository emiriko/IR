Atomic diffusion may lead to heavy element accumulation inside stars in
certain specific layers. Iron accumulation in the Z-bump opacity region has
been invoked by several authors to quantitatively account for abundance
anomalies observed in some stars, or to account for stellar oscillations
through the induced $\kappa$-mechanism. These authors however never took into
account the fact that such an accumulation creates an inverse $\mu$-gradient,
unstable for thermohaline convection. Here, we present results for A-F stars,
where abundance variations are computed with and without this process. We show
that iron accumulation is still present when thermohaline convection is taken
into account, but much reduced compared to when this physical process is
neglected. The consequences of thermohaline convection for A-type stars as well
as for other types of stars are presented
