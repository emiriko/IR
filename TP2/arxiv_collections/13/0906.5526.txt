The Higgs sector of the U(1)-extended supersymmetric model is studied with
great detail. We calculate the masses of the Higgs bosons at the one-loop
level. We also calculate at the one-loop level the gluon-involving processes
for the productions and decays of the scalar Higgs bosons of the model at the
energy of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the radiative corrections
due to the loops of top, bottom, and exotic quarks and their scalar partners
are taken into account. We find that the exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks
in the model may manifest themselves at the LHC, since the production of the
heaviest scalar Higgs boson via gluon fusion processes is mediated virtually by
the loops of exotic quark and exotic scalar quarks, for a reasonable parameter
set of the model.
