Discrete mixture models provide a well-known basis for effective clustering
algorithms, although technical challenges have limited their scope. In the
context of gene-expression data analysis, a model is presented that mixes over
a finite catalog of structures, each one representing equality and inequality
constraints among latent expected values. Computations depend on the
probability that independent gamma-distributed variables attain each of their
possible orderings. Each ordering event is equivalent to an event in
independent negative-binomial random variables, and this finding guides a
dynamic-programming calculation. The structuring of mixture-model components
according to constraints among latent means leads to strict concavity of the
mixture log likelihood. In addition to its beneficial numerical properties, the
clustering method shows promising results in an empirical study.
