Radiation of X-ray bursts and of accretion shocks in weakly magnetized
neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries is produced in plane-parallel
atmospheres dominated by electron scattering. We first discuss polarization
produced by single (non-magnetic) Compton scattering, in particular the
depolarizing effect of high electron temperature, and then the polarization due
to multiply electron scattering in a slab. We further predict the X-ray pulse
profiles and polarization properties of nuclear- and accretion-powered
millisecond pulsars. We introduce a relativistic rotation vector model, which
includes the effect of rotation of polarization plane due to the rapid motion
of the hot spot as well as the light bending. Future observations of the X-ray
polarization will provide a valuable tool to test the geometry of the emission
region in pulsars and its physical characteristics.
