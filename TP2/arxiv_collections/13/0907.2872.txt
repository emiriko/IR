The total energy deposited into the medium per unit length by a fast parton
traversing a quark-gluon plasma is calculated. We take the medium excitation
due to collisions to be given by the well known expression for the collisional
drag force. The parton's radiative energy loss contributes to the energy
deposition because each radiated gluon acts as an additional source of
collisional energy loss in the medium. In our model, this leads to a length
dependence on the differential energy loss due to the interactions of radiated
gluons with the medium. The final result, which is a sum of the primary and the
secondary contributions, is then treated as the coefficient of a local
hydrodynamic source term. Results are presented for energy density wave induced
by two fast, back-to-back partons created in an initial hard interaction.
