We report the discovery of 19 variable stars and two blue-stragglers in the
field of the open cluster NGC6866. Three of the variable stars we classify as
delta Sct, two, as gamma Dor, four, as WUMa, two, as ellipsoidal variables, and
one, as an eclipsing binary. Seven stars show irregular variability. Two of the
pulsators, a delta Sct star NGC 6866-29 and a gamma Dor star NGC6866-21, are
multiperiodic. From an analysis of proper motions, we conclude that the delta
Sct stars, one of the gamma Dor stars and both blue-stragglers are very
probable members of the cluster. The position on the color-magnitude diagram of
seven other variables suggests that they also belong to the cluster. The
eclipsing binary, which we discover to be a new high-velocity star, and the
seven irregular variables are non-members. Then, we discuss in detail the age
and metallicity of open clusters that host gamma Dor stars and we show that
none of these parameters is correlated with the number of gamma Dor stars in
cluster.
