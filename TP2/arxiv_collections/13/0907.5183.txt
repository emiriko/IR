We investigate multichromophoric energy transfer allowing for bath-induced
fluctuations at different sites to be correlated. As a prototype system we
consider a light-harvesting antenna surrounding a reaction center. We show that
the interplay between quantum coherence and correlated fluctuations can
generate a room temperature transfer process featuring a marked dependence on
the degree of symmetry and delocalization of the initial exciton state. Our
work illustrates how these quantum features could support fine tuning of energy
transfer efficiencies in closely-packed natural and artificial light-harvesting
complexes
