Status of the new experimental program to study hadron production in
hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS will be
presented. A physics motivation will be given for the part of the program
related to the physics of strongly interacting matter. Upgrades of the NA61
experimental set-up and data taking plans will be described in detail.
