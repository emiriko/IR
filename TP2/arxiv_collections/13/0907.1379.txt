We give a slight improvement of the best known lower bound for the supremum
of autoconvolutions of nonnegative functions supported in a compact interval.
Also, by means of explicit examples we disprove a long standing natural
conjecture of Schinzel and Schmidt concerning the extremal function for such
autoconvolutions.
