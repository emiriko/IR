We have investigated a contribution of the density of state (DOS) to the Mott
metal-insulator transition (MIT). The MIT condition is given by the DOS, which
usually requires the complicated fundamental equations. To simplify the
process, we have derived a general solution of the MIT condition by an integral
contains the DOS in the framework of coherent potential approximation. The
formula is concise and presents the direct relationship between the MIT
condition and the DOS. It is able to calculate the contribution quantitatively
and to compare various DOSs analytically.
