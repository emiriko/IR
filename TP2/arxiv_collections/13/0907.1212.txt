The motivation behind mathematically modeling the human operator is to help
explain the response characteristics of the complex dynamical system including
the human manual controller. In this paper, we present two different fuzzy
logic strategies for human operator and sport modeling: fixed fuzzy-logic
inference control and adaptive fuzzy-logic control, including
neuro-fuzzy-fractal control. As an application of the presented fuzzy
strategies, we present a fuzzy-control based tennis simulator.
