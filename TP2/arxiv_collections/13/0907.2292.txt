New magnetometry techniques based on Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defects in diamond
allow for the imaging of static (DC) and oscillatory (AC) nanoscopic magnetic
systems. However, these techniques require accurate knowledge and control of
the sample dynamics, and are thus limited in their ability to image fields
arising from rapidly fluctuating (FC) environments. We show here that FC fields
place restrictions on the DC field sensitivity of an NV qubit magnetometer, and
that by probing the dephasing rate of the qubit in a magnetic FC environment,
we are able to measure fluctuation rates and RMS field strengths that would be
otherwise inaccessible with the use of DC and AC magnetometry techniques. FC
sensitivities are shown to be comparable to those of AC fields, whilst
requiring no additional experimental overheads or control over the sample.
