Relativistic mean field calculations of multi-$\bar{K}$ hypernuclei are
performed by adding $K^-$ mesons to particle-stable configurations of nucleons,
$\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons. For a given hypernuclear core, the calculated
$\bar{K}$ separation energy $B_{\bar{K}}$ saturates with the number of
$\bar{K}$ mesons for more than roughly 10 mesons, with $B_{\bar{K}}$ bounded
from above by 200 MeV. The associated baryonic densities saturate at values 2-3
times nuclear-matter density within a small region where the $\bar{K}$-meson
densities peak, similarly to what was found for multi-$\bar{K}$ nuclei. The
calculations demonstrate that particle-stable multistrange $\{N,\Lambda,\Xi \}$
configurations are stable against strong-interaction conversions $\Lambda \to N
\bar{K}$ and $\Xi \to N \bar{K} \bar{K}$, confirming and strengthening the
conclusion that kaon condensation is unlikely to occur in strong-interaction
self-bound strange hadronic matter.
