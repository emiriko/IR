In this paper, the mining of hybrid association rules with rough set approach
is investigated as the algorithm RSHAR.The RSHAR algorithm is constituted of
two steps mainly. At first, to join the participant tables into a general table
to generate the rules which is expressing the relationship between two or more
domains that belong to several different tables in a database. Then we apply
the mapping code on selected dimension, which can be added directly into the
information system as one certain attribute. To find the association rules,
frequent itemsets are generated in second step where candidate itemsets are
generated through equivalence classes and also transforming the mapping code in
to real dimensions. The searching method for candidate itemset is similar to
apriori algorithm. The analysis of the performance of algorithm has been
carried out.
