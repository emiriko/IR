A central paradigm behind process semantics based on observability and
testing is that the exact moment of occurring of an internal nondeterministic
choice is unobservable. It is natural, therefore, for this property to hold
when the internal choice is quantified with probabilities. However, ever since
probabilities have been introduced in process semantics, it has been a
challenge to preserve the unobservability of the random choice, while not
violating the other laws of process theory and probability theory. This paper
addresses this problem. It proposes two semantics for processes where the
internal nondeterminism has been quantified with probabilities. The first one
is based on the notion of testing, i.e. interaction between the process and its
environment. The second one, the probabilistic ready trace semantics, is based
on the notion of observability. Both are shown to coincide. They are also
preserved under the standard operators.
