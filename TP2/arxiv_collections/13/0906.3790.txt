In this talk I want to convey an idea about the perspectives for precise
lattice QCD computations. Some emphasis is put on the field of flavour physics,
where lattice QCD seems to be needed the most in the quantitative
interpretation of present and future experiments (in particular this is the
reason for section 4.3). I do not want to discuss the latest numbers but will
focus on the principle, the challenges and the perspectives. I mainly address
those in the audience who know little about the field and therefore take a bit
of a bird's-eye view of the field. So I do not hesitate to also list trivial
facts (e.g. section 4.2) and my personal opinion on what is relevant for the
future.
