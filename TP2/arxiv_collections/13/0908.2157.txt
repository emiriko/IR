The next generation tau-charm factory, the third Beijing Electron
Spectrometer (BESIII) at the new Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPCII),
has begun data collection. I discuss the flavor physics reach of the BESIII
charm program and conclude with a discussion on future proposed tau-charm
facilities.
