A relativistic theory of fluctuation -electromagnetic interaction of a small
polarizable particle moving with respect to the equilibrium background
radiation is reviewed. It is assumed that the particle radius is smaller then
characteristic wave length of the background radiation. General relativistic
relations for the particle heating rate and tangential force are obtained and
compared with nonrelativistic and relativistic expressions of other authors.
