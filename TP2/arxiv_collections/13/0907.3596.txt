Reliable predictions of general relativity theory are extracted using
approximation methods. Among these, the powerful post-Newtonian approximation
provides us with our best insights into the problems of motion and
gravitational radiation of systems of compact objects. This approximation has
reached an impressive mature status, because of important progress regarding
its theoretical foundations, and the successful construction of templates of
gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling compact binaries. The
post-Newtonian predictions are routinely used for searching and analyzing the
very weak signals of gravitational waves in current generations of detectors.
High-accuracy comparisons with the results of numerical simulations for the
merger and ring-down of binary black holes are going on. In this article we
give an overview on the general formulation of the post-Newtonian approximation
and present up-to-date results for the templates of compact binary inspiral.
