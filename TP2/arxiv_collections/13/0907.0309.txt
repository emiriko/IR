It has been recently shown that the percolation transition is discontinuous
in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and square lattices in two dimensions under the
Achlioptas Process (AP). Here, we show that when the structure is highly
heterogeneous as in scale-free networks, a discontinuous transition does not
always occur: a continuous transition is also possible depending on the degree
distribution of the scale-free network. This originates from the competition
between the AP that discourages the formation of a giant component and the
existence of hubs that encourages it. We also estimate the value of the
characteristic degree exponent that separates the two transition types.
