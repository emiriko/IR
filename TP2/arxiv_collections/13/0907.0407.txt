Transport through carbon nanotube (CNT) quantum dots (QDs) in a magnetic
field is discussed. The evolution of the system from the ultraviolet to the
infrared is analyzed; the strongly correlated (SC) states arising in the
infrared are investigated. Experimental consequences of the physics are
presented -- the SC states arising at various fillings are shown to be
drastically different, with distinct signatures in the conductance and, in
particular, the noise. Besides CNT QDs, our results are also relevant to double
QD systems.
