The transport and noise properties of Pr_{0.7}Ca_{0.3}MnO_{3} epitaxial thin
films in the temperature range from room temperature to 160 K are reported. It
is shown that both the broadband 1/f noise properties and the dependence of
resistance on electric field are consistent with the idea of a collective
electrical transport, as in the classical model of sliding charge density
waves. On the other hand, the observations cannot be reconciled with standard
models of charge ordering and charge melting. Methodologically, it is proposed
to consider noise-spectra analysis as a unique tool for the identification of
the transport mechanism in such highly correlated systems. On the basis of the
results, the electrical transport is envisaged as one of the most effective
ways to understand the nature of the insulating, charge-modulated ground states
in manganites.
