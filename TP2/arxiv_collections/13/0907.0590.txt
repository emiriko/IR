The charm fragmentation function has been measured in photoproduction of jets
containing D^*+- mesons. The measured function has been used to extract free
parameters of different fragmentation models. Measurements of excited charm,
D_1(2420)^0 and D_2^*(2460)^0, and charm-strange, D_{s1}(2536)^+-, mesons and a
search for the radially excited charm meson, D^{*'}(2640)^+-, were also
performed. The results are compared with those measured previously and with
theoretical expectation.
