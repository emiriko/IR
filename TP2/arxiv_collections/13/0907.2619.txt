We criticize Colbeck and Renner's (CR's) statement that "any hidden variable
model can only be compatible with quantum mechanics if its local part is
trivial" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050403 (2008)]. We note that CR's attempt to
divide a nonlocal hidden variable model into a "local part" and a "nonlocal
part" contains a restriction on the latter. This restriction implies that the
division is really into a "local part" and a "nonsignaling nonlocal part." CR's
nonsignaling requirement on the "nonlocal part" cannot be physically motivated,
since the hidden variables cannot be accessed by experimenters. Nor is it a
natural mathematical generalization from the local hidden variable case, since
it is simple to make a generalization without CR's requirement. We give an
explicit nonlocal hidden variable model that, in the case the restriction is
not enforced, contains nontrivial local hidden variables.
