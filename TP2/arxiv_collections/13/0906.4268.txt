Initiation of nuclear reactions in Thorium nuclei is experimentally studied
under laser exposure of Au nanoparticles suspended in the aqueous solution of
Th(NO3)4 (232Th). It is found that the reaction pathway depends in which water,
either H2O or D2O, the laser exposure is carried out. Saturation of the liquids
(H2O or D2O) with gaseous H2 or D2, respectively, enhances the nuclear
reactions under laser exposure allowing their excitation at peak intensity as
low as 1010 W/cm2. Enhanced gamma-activity of the probe is observed after the
end of laser exposure for several hours.
