We report our recent work on a hadronic molecule state of the KbarKN system
with I=1/2 and J^P=1/2^+. We assume that the Lambda(1405) resonance and the
scalar mesons, f_{0}(980), a_{0}(980), are reproduced as quasi-bound states of
KbarN and KbarK, respectively. Performing non-relativistic three-body
calculations with a variational method for this system, we find a quasibound
state of the KbarKN system around 1910 MeV below the three-body breakup
threshold. This state corresponds to a new baryon resonance of N* with
J^P=1/2^+. We find also that this resonance has the cluster structure of the
two-body bound states keeping their properties as in the isolated two-particle
systems. We also briefly discuss another hadronic molecular state composed by
two Kbar and one N, which corresponds to a Xi^* resonance.
