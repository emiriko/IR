We explore planet formation in binary systems around the central star where
the protoplanetary disk plane is highly inclined with respect to the companion
star orbit. This might be the most frequent scenario for binary separations
larger than 40 AU, according to Hale (1994). We focus on planetesimal accretion
and compute average impact velocities in the habitable region and up to 6 AU
from the primary.
