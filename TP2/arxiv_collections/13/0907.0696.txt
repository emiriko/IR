We construct Penrose diagrams for Schwarzschild spacetimes joined by massless
shells of matter, in the process correcting minor flaws in the similar diagrams
drawn by Dray and 't Hooft, and confirming their result that such shells
generate a horizon shift. We then consider shells with negative energy density,
showing that the horizon shift in this case allows for travel between the
heretofore causally separated exterior regions of the Schwarzschild geometry.
These drawing techniques are then used to investigate the properties of
successive shells, joining multiple Schwarzschild regions. Again, the presence
of negative-energy shells leads to a causal connection between the exterior
regions, even in (some) cases with two successive shells of equal but opposite
total energy.
