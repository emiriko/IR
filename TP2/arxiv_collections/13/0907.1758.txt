After recent improvements to the Pavia model of two-nucleon knockout from
$^{16}$O with electromagnetic probes the calculated cross sections are compared
to experimental data from such reactions. Comparison with data from a
measurement of the $^{16}$O(e,e$'$pn) reaction show much better agreement
between experiment and theory than was previously observed. In a comparison
with recent data from a measurement of the $^{16}$O($\gamma$,pn) reaction the
model over-predicts the measured cross section at low missing momentum.
