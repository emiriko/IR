We investigate intensity oscillations observed simultaneously in the quiet
chromosphere and in the corona, above an enhanced network area at the boundary
of an equatorial coronal hole. A Fourier analysis is applied to a sequence of
images observed in the 171 A and 1600 A passbands of TRACE. Four interesting
features above the magnetic network are further investigated by using a wavelet
analysis. Our results reveal that, in both the 171 A and 1600 A passbands,
oscillations above the magnetic network show a lack of power at high
frequencies (5.0-8.3 mHz), and a significant power at low (1.3-2.0 mHz) and
intermediate frequencies (2.6-4.0 mHz). The global 5-min oscillation is clearly
present in the 4 analyzed features when seen in the 1600 A passband, and is
also found with enhanced power in feature 1 (leg of a large coronal loop) and
feature 2 (legs of a coronal bright point loop) when seen in the 171 A
passband. Two features above an enhanced network element (feature 3 and feature
4) show repeated propagating behaviors with a dominant period of 10 min and 5
min, respectively. We suggest these oscillations are likely to be slow
magneto-acoustic waves propagating along inclined magnetic field lines, from
the lower solar atmosphere into the corona. The energy flux carried by these
waves is estimated of the order of 40 erg cm\^{-2} s\^{-1} for the 171 A
passband and is far lower than the energy required to heat the quiet corona.
For the 1600 A passband, the energy flux is about 1.4*10^6 erg cm\^{-2}
s\^{-1}, which is about one third of the required energy budget for the
chromosphere.
