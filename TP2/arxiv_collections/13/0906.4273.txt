Within an exactly solvable model I discuss the influence of the medium
dependent finite width of quark gluon plasma (QGP) bags on their equation of
state. It is shown that the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the
observed deficit in the number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the
reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states
in a hadronic phase. I show how the model allows one to estimate the minimal
value of the width of QGP bags being heavier than 2.5 GeV from a variety of the
lattice QCD data and to get the minimal resonance width at zero temperature of
about 600 MeV. The Regge trajectories of large and heavy QGP bags are
established both in a vacuum and in a strongly interacting medium. It is shown
that at high temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in
accordance with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear
asymptotics), whereas at low temperatures (below a half of the Hagedorn
temperature T_H [1] they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory
asymptotics (the square root one). Thus, for temperatures below T_H/2 the spin
of the QGP bags is restricted from above, whereas for temperatures above T_H/2
these bags demonstrate the typical Regge behavior consistent with the string
models.
