While the number of metastable landscape vacua in string theory is vast, the
number of supermoduli vacua which lead to distinct low energy physics is even
larger, perhaps infinitely so. From the anthropic perspective it is therefore
important to understand whether complex life is possible on moduli space --
i.e., in low energy effective theories with 1. exact supersymmetry and 2. some
massless multiplets (moduli). Unless life is essentially impossible on moduli
space as a consequence of these characteristics, anthropic reasoning in string
theory suggests that the overwhelming majority of sentient beings would observe
1-2. We investigate whether 1 and 2 are by themselves automatically inimical to
life and conclude, tentatively, that they are not. In particular, we describe
moduli scenarios in which complex life seems possible.
