We study the structure of domain walls in multiferroic magnets with the
conical spiral ordering. We formulate a simple spin model which has a conical
spiral ground state in absence of magnetic anisotropies. We find a transition
from the regime where ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain walls are clamped
to the regime where they are decoupled and derive a continuum model describing
rotation of the spiral plane at the domain wall. The importance of these
results for the switching phenomena observed in CoCr2O4 is discussed.
