Discovered by us [1] special (permanent) resonance mechanism of spectral zone
creation in periodic structures is generalized to the case of discrete space
lattices and finite difference Schroedinger equation with local V(n) and
minimally nonlocal U(n). It would be interesting to generalize the periodicity
formalism to the multidiagonal finite-difference potentials.
