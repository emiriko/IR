We study drag-induced diffusion of massive particles in scale-free velocity
fields, where superdiffusive behavior emerges due to the scale-free size
distribution of the vortices of the underlying velocity field. The results show
qualitative resemblance to what is observed in fluid systems, namely the
diffusive exponent for the mean square separation of pairs of particles and the
preferential concentration of the particles, both as a function of the response
time.
