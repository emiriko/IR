In many Dark Matter (DM) scenarios, the annihilation of DM particles can
produce gamma rays with a continuum spectrum that extends up to very high
energies of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale (hundreds of
GeV). Astrophysical structures supposed to be dynamically dominated by DM, such
as dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies, Galaxy Clusters (the largest ones in the local
Universe being mostly observable from the northern hemisphere) and Intermediate
Mass Black Holes, can be considered as interesting targets to look for DM
annihilation with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Instead,
the center of our Galaxy seems to be strongly contaminated with astrophysical
sources. The 17m Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC-I)
Telescope, situated in the Canary island of La Palma (2200 m a.s.l.), is best
suited for DM searches, due to its unique combination of high sensitivity and
low energy threshold among current IACTs which can potentially allow to provide
clues on the high energy end, and possibly peak, of the gamma-ray DM-induced
spectrum constrained at lower energies with the Fermi Space Telescope. The
recent results achieved by MAGIC-I for some of the best candidates, as well as
the DM detection prospects for the MAGIC Phase II, are reported.
