We consider periodic solutions to equations of Korteweg-Devries type. While
the stability theory for periodic waves has received much some attention the
theory is much less developed than the analogous theory for solitary wave
stability, and appears to be mathematically richer. We prove an index theorem
giving an exact count of the number of unstable eigenvalues of the linearized
operator in terms of the number of zeros of the derivative of the traveling
wave profile together with geometric information about a certain map between
the constants of integration of the ordinary differential equation and the
conserved quantities of the partial differential equation.
  This index can be regarded as a generalization of both the Sturm oscillation
theorem and the classical stability theory for solitary wave solutions for
equations of Korteweg-de Vries type. In the case of a polynomial nonlinearity
this index, together with a related one introduced earlier by Bronski and
Johnson, can be expressed in terms of derivatives of period integrals on a
Riemann surface. Since these period integrals satisfy a Picard-Fuchs equation
these derivatives can be expressed in terms of the integrals themselves,
leading to an expression in terms of various moments of the solution. We
conclude with some illustrative examples.
