Considerable effort has been applied towards understanding the precise
shaping mechanisms responsible for the diverse range of morphologies exhibited
by planetary nebulae (PNe). A binary companion is increasingly gaining support
as a dominant shaping mechanism, however morphological studies of the few PNe
that we know for certain were shaped by binary evolution are scarce or biased.
Newly discovered binary central stars (CSPN) from the OGLE-III photometric
variability survey have significantly increased the sample of post
common-envelope (CE) nebulae available for morphological analysis. We present
Gemini South narrow-band images for most of the new sample to complement
existing data in a qualitative morphological study of 30 post-CE nebulae.
Nearly 30% of nebulae have canonical bipolar morphologies, however this rises
to 60% once inclination effects are incorporated with the aid of geometric
models. This is the strongest observational evidence yet linking CE evolution
to bipolar morphologies. A higher than average proportion of the sample shows
low-ionisation knots, filaments or jets suggestive of a binary origin. These
features are also common around emission-line nuclei which may be explained by
speculative binary formation scenarios for H-deficient CSPN.
