We report on a possible measurement at the LHC using the first data and a
luminosity of 10 pb$^{-1}$ of $W$ and $Z$ pair production via two-photon
exchange. This measurement allows to increase the present sensitivity on
$WW\gamma \gamma$ and $ZZ\gamma \gamma$ quartic anomalous couplings from the
LEP experiments by almost three orders of magnitude.
