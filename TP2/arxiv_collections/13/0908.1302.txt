In this paper we establish the theory on semiglobal classical solution to
first order quasilinear hyperbolic systems with a kind of nonlocal boundary
conditions, and based on this, the corresponding exact boundary controllability
and observability are obtained by a constructive method. Moreover, with the
linearized Saint-Venant system and the 1-D linear wave equation as examples, we
show that the number of both boundary controls and boundary observations can
not be reduced, and consequently, we conclude that the exact boundary
controllability for a hyperbolic system in a network with loop can not be
realized generically.
