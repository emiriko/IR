Molecular motors convert chemical energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP
into mechanical energy. A well-studied model of a molecular motor is the
flashing ratchet model. We show that this model exhibits a fluctuation relation
known as the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry. Our study highlights the fact that the
symmetry is present only if the chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom are
both included in the description.
