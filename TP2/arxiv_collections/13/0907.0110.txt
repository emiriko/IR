We report on Landauer-B\"uttiker studies of anomalous Hall transport in a
two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a
magnetization provided by localized magnetic moments. Our system is described
by a discretized tight-binding model in a four-terminal geometry. We consider
both the case of magnetically disordered systems as well as ballistic transport
in disorder-free systems with spatially homoge- neous magnetization. In the
latter case we investigate both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetizations. We
numerically establish a close connection between singularities in the density
of states and peaks in the Hall conductance close to the lower band edge.
Consistent with previous theoretical studies based on diagrammatic perturbation
expansions, these peaks occur at Fermi energies where only the lower dispersion
branch is occupied. Moreover, for large magnetization the Hall conductance is,
along with the density of states, sup- pressed. This numerical finding can be
understood from analytical properties of the underlying model in the limit of
an infinite system.
