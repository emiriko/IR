We derive the amplitude for the process $e^+e^-\to \pi^0\pi^0$ at large
invariant energy. The process goes through the two-photon exchange and its
amplitude is expressed in terms of the convolution integral which depends on
the shape of the pion distribution amplitude (DA) and the centre of mass
scattering angle. Remarkable feature of the integral is that it is very
sensitive to the end-point behaviour of the pion DA -- it starts to diverge if
pion DA nullifies at the end-point as $\sqrt x$ or slower. That makes the
$e^+e^-\to \pi^0\pi^0$ process unique probe of the shape of the meson DAs. The
estimated cross section is rather small, for $\sqrt s = 3$ GeV it ranges from a
fraction of femtobarn (for the asymptotic DA) to couple of femtobarn (for the
Chernyak-Zhitnitsky DA). The observation of the process $e^+e^-\to\pi^0\pi^0$
with the cross section higher as estimated here would imply very unusual form
of the pion DA, e.g. the flat one. The derived amplitude can be easily
generalized to other processes like $e^+e^-\to \sigma\sigma, K_SK_S, \eta\eta,
\eta^\prime\eta, \pi^0 f_2$, etc.
