We design three-dimensional (3D) metallic nanowire media with different
structures and numerically demonstrate that they can be homogeneous effective
indefinite anisotropic media by showing that their dispersion relations are
hyperbolic. For a finite slab, a nice fitting procedure is exploited to obtain
the dispersion relations from which we retrieve the effective permittivities.
The pseudo focusing for the real 3D wire medium agrees very well with the
homogeneous medium having the effective permittivity tensor of the wire medium.
Studies also show that in the long-wavelength limit, the hyperbolic dispersion
relation of the 3D wire medium can be valid even for evanescent modes.
