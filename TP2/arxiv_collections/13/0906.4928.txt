The origin and stability of a thin sheet of plasma in the magnetosphere of an
accreting neutron star is investigated. First the radial extension of such a
magnetospheric disc is explored. Then a mechanism for magnetospheric accretion
is proposed, reconsidering the bending wave explored by Agapitou, Papaloizou &
Terquem (1997), that was found to be stable in ideal MHD. We show that this
warping becomes unstable and can reach high amplitudes, in a variant of
Pringle's radiation-driven model for the warping of AGN accretion discs
(Pringle (1996)). Finally we discuss how this mechanism might give a clue to
explain the observed X-ray kHz QPO of neutron star binaries.
