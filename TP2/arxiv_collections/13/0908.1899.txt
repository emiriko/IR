We have carried out a detailed and systematic study of the correlation
energies of inert gas atoms Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe using relativistic many-body
perturbation theory and relativistic coupled-cluster theory. In the
relativistic coupled-cluster calculations, we implement perturbative triples
and include these in the correlation energy calculations. We then calculate the
dipole polarizability of the ground states using perturbed coupled-cluster
theory.
