We report on partial and global generalized synchronization in exemplar
bidirectionally coupled non-identical chaotic systems with multiple time
delays. We derive conditions for such synchronization regimes. The general
approach is applied to the case of multiple time delay laser systems with
electro-optical feedback. We also study the effect of signal sampling on the
signatures of time delays in the autocorrelation function of the multiple time
delay laser output.
