We study the correlations between two neutrons in borromian nuclei $^{11}$Li
and $^6$He by using a three-body model with a density-dependent contact
two-body interaction. It is shown that the two neutrons show a compact bound
feature at the nuclear surface due to the mixing of single particle states of
different parity. We study the Coulomb breakup cross sections of $^{11}$Li and
$^6$He using the same three-body model. We show that the concentration of the
B(E1) strength near the threshold can be well reproduced with this model as a
typical nature of the halo nuclei. The energy distributions of two emitted
neutrons from dipole excitations are also studied using the correlated wave
functions of dipole excitations.
