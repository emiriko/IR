Transport measurements in the hole-doped cuprates show a "strange metal"
normal state with an electrical resistance which varies linearly with
temperature. This strange metal phase is often identified with the quantum
critical region of a zero temperature quantum critical point (QCP) at hole
density x=x_m, near optimal doping. A long-standing problem with this picture
is that low temperature experiments within the superconducting phase have not
shown convincing signatures of such a optimal doping QCP (except in some
cuprates with small superconducting critical temperatures). I review
theoretical work which proposes a simple resolution of this enigma.
  The crossovers in the normal state are argued to be controlled by a QCP at
x_m linked to the onset of spin density wave (SDW) order in a "large" Fermi
surface metal, leading to small Fermi pockets for x<x_m. A key effect is that
the onset of superconductivity at low temperatures disrupts the simplest
canonical quantum critical crossover phase diagram. In particular, the
competition between superconductivity and SDW order_shifts_ the actual QCP to a
lower doping x_s < x_m in the underdoped regime, so that SDW order is only
present for x<x_s. I review the phase transitions and crossovers associated
with the QCPs at x_m and x_s: the resulting phase diagram as a function of x,
temperature, and applied magnetic field consistently explains a number of
recent experiments.
