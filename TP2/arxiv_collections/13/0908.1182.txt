Disorder can profoundly affect the transport properties of a wide range of
quantum materials. Presently, there is significant disagreement regarding the
effect of disorder on transport in the disordered Bose-Hubbard (DBH) model,
which is the paradigm used to theoretically study disorder in strongly
correlated bosonic systems. We experimentally realize the DBH model by using
optical speckle to introduce precisely known, controllable, and fine-grained
disorder to an optical lattice5. Here, by measuring the dissipation strength
for transport, we discover a disorder-induced SF-to-insulator (IN) transition
in this system, but we find no evidence for an IN-to-SF transition. Emergence
of the IN at disorder strengths several hundred times the tunnelling energy
agrees with a predicted SF--Bose glass (BG) transition from recent quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) work. Both the SF--IN transition and correlated changes in
the atomic quasimomentum distribution--which verify a simple model for the
interplay of disorder and interactions in this system--are phenomena new to the
unit filling regime explored in this work, compared with the high filling limit
probed previously. We find that increasing disorder strength generically leads
to greater dissipation in the regime of mixed SF and Mott-insulator (MI)
phases, excluding predictions of a disorder-induced, or "re-entrant," SF (RSF).
While the absence of an RSF may be explained by the effect of finite
temperature, we strongly constrain theories by measuring bounds on the entropy
per particle in the disordered lattice.
