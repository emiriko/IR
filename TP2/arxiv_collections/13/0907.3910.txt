Inspired by the physics of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) a simplified coupled
Burgers-like model in one dimension (1d), a generalization of the Burgers model
to coupled degrees of freedom, is proposed to describe 1dMHD. In addition to
MHD, this model serves as a 1d reduced model for driven binary fluid mixtures.
Here we have performed a comprehensive study of the universal properties of the
generalized d-dimensional version of the reduced model. We employ both
analytical and numerical approaches. In particular, we determine the scaling
exponents and the amplitude-ratios of the relevant two-point time-dependent
correlation functions in the model. We demonstrate that these quantities vary
continuously with the amplitude of the noise cross-correlation. Further our
numerical studies corroborate the continuous dependence of long wavelength and
long time-scale physics of the model on the amplitude of the noise
cross-correlations, as found in our analytical studies. We construct and
simulate lattice-gas models of coupled degrees of freedom in 1d, belonging to
the universality class of our coupled Burgers-like model, which display similar
behavior. We use a variety of numerical (Monte-Carlo and Pseudospectral
methods) and analytical (Dynamic Renormalization Group, Self-Consistent
Mode-Coupling Theory and Functional Renormalization Group) approaches for our
work. The results from our different approaches complement one another.
Possible realizations of our results in various nonequilibrium models are
discussed.
