Electronic structures of the quantum critical superconductor beta-YbAlB4 and
its polymorph alpha-YbAlB4 are investigated by using bulk-sensitive hard x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy. From the Yb 3d core level spectra, the values of
the Yb valence are estimated to be ~2.73 and ~2.75 for alpha- and beta-YbAlB4,
respectively, thus providing clear evidence for valence fluctuations. The
valence band spectra of these compounds also show Yb2+ peaks at the Fermi
level. These observations establish an unambiguous case of a strong mixed
valence at quantum criticality for the first time among heavy fermion systems,
calling for a novel scheme for a quantum critical model beyond the conventional
Doniach picture in beta-YbAlB4.
