It is demonstrated that non-resonant wave front reversal (WFR) of spin-wave
pulses caused by pulsed parametric pumping can be effectively used for
microwave signal processing. When the frequency band of signal amplification by
pumping is narrower than the spectral width of the signal, the non-resonant WFR
can be used for the analysis of the signal spectrum. In the opposite case the
non-resonant WFR can be used for active (with amplification) filtering of the
input signal.
