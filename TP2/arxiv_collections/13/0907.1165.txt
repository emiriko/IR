We perform a systematic analysis of the density dependence of the nuclear
symmetry energy within the microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock (BHF) approach
using the realistic Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon potential plus a
phenomenological three body force of Urbana type. Our results are compared
thoroughly to those arising from several Skyrme and relativistic effective
models. The values of the parameters characterizing the BHF equation of state
of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter fall within the trends predicted by those
models and are compatible with recent constraints coming from heavy ion
collisions, giant monopole resonances or isobaric analog states. In particular
we find a value of the slope parameter $L=66.5$ MeV, compatible with recent
experimental constraints from isospin diffusion, $L=88 \pm 25$ MeV. The
correlation between the neutron skin thickness of neutron-rich isotopes and the
slope, $L$, and curvature, $K_{sym}$, parameters of the symmetry energy is
studied. Our BHF results are in very good agreement with the correlations
already predicted by other authors using non-relativistic and relativistic
effective models. The correlations of these two parameters and the neutron skin
thickness with the transition density from non-uniform to $\beta$-stable matter
in neutron stars are also analyzed. Our results confirm that there is an
inverse correlation between the neutron skin thickness and the transition
density.
