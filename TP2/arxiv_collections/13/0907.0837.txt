We report on the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope
observation of two low core density globular clusters, NGC6144 and E3. By
comparing the number of X-ray sources inside the half-mass radius to those
outside, we found 6 X-ray sources within the half-mass radius of NGC6144, among
which 4 are expected to be background sources; 3 X-ray sources are also found
within the half-mass radius of E3, of which 3 is expected to be background
source. Therefore, we cannot exclude that all our sources are background
sources. However, combining the results from X-ray and optical observations, we
found that 1-2 sources in NGC6144 and 1 source in E3 are likely to be
cataclysmic variables and that 1 source in NGC6144 is an active binary, based
on the X-ray and optical properties. The number of faint X-ray sources in
NGC6144 and E3 found with Chandra and HST is higher than a prediction based on
collision frequency, but is closer to that based on mass. Our observations
strongly suggest that the compact binary systems in NGC6144 and E3 are
primordial in origin.
