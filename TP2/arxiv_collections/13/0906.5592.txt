We show that first approximations to the bulk viscosity $\eta_v$ are
expressible in terms of factors that depend on the sound speed $v_s$, the
enthalpy, and the interaction (elastic and inelastic) cross section. The
explicit dependence of $\eta_v$ on the factor $(\frac 13 - v_s^2)$ is
demonstrated in the Chapman-Enskog approximation as well as the variational and
relaxation time approaches. The interesting feature of bulk viscosity is that
the dominant contributions at a given temperature arise from particles which
are neither extremely nonrelativistic nor extremely relativistic. Numerical
results for a model binary mixture are reported.
