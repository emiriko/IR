Energy states of the universe is obtained when the scale factor is defined as
a=At^n, and n varies as -1<=n<=1,with the aid of the wavefunction which was
constructed in, Mahgoub Salih, A Canonical Quantization formalism of curvature
squared action. we found new properties of early Phantom energy, which it`s
energy density increases with time while w=-1/3 .
