We apply recently developed phenomenological theory of polar liquids to
calculate the repulsive pressure between two hydrophilic membranes at
nm-distances. We find that the repulsion does show up in the model and the
solution to the problem fits the published experimental data well both
qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, we find that the repulsion is
practically independent on temperature, and thus put some extra weight in
favour of the so called hydration over entropic hypothesis for the membranes
interactions explanation. The calculation is a good proof of concept example a
continuous water model application to non-trivial interactions on -size bodies
in water arising from long-range correlations between the water molecules.
