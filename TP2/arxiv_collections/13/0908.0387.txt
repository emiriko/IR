The infrared structure of MHV gluon amplitudes in ${\cal N}=4$ super
Yang-Mills theory is considered in the next-to-leading order of PT. Explicit
cancelation of the infrared divergencies in properly defined cross-sections is
demonstrated. The remaining finite parts for some inclusive differential
cross-sections are calculated analytically. In general, contrary to the virtual
corrections, they do not reveal any simple structure.
