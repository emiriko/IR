The compound, Sr3NiPtO6, belonging to a K4CdCl6-type rhombohedral structure,
has been reported not to exhibit magnetic ordering at least down to 1.8 K,
despite a relatively large value of paramagnetic Curie temperature. This is
attributable to geometrical frustration. Here we report the results of our
efforts to gradually replace Sr by Ba and to probe the influence of positive
(external) and negative (chemical) pressure on the magnetic behavior of this
compound. In the Ba substituted series, single phase is formed up to x= 1.0
with Ba substituting for Sr. The magnetic properties of the parent compound in
the entire temperature range of investigation are not influenced at all in any
of the compositions studied as well as under external pressure (investigated up
to 10 kbar). Spin-liquid-like heat-capacity behavior (finite linear term) is
observed even in Ba substituted specimens. Thus, the magnetic anomalies of this
compound are quite robust.
