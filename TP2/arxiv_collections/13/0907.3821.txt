We present the experimental observation of the superlensing effect in a slab
of a one-dimensional photonic crystal made of tilted dielectric elements. We
show that this flat lens can achieve subwavelength resolution in different
frequency bands. We also demonstrate that the introduction of a proper
corrugation on the lens surface can dramatically improve both the transmission
and the resolution of the imaged signal.
