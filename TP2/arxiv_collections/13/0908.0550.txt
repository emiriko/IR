We observed water film accumulation on silica surfaces in the air to 2
picometer resolution using optical land-contrast (LC) interferometry. The
land-contrast approach is non-destructive and allows real-time measurement of
thickness variation of small molecular films on a surface. Water accumulation
rates are observed to be different on bare or protein monolayer coated silica
surfaces. This suggests that water contributes false signals to mass-sensitive
biosensors for protein microarray.
