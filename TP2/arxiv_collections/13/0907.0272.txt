We study the interference effect induced by the Aharonov-Casher phase on the
Josephson current through a semiconducting ring attached to superconducting
leads. Using a 1D model that incorporates spin-orbit coupling in the
semiconducting ring, we calculate the Andreev levels analytically and
numerically, and predict oscillations of the Josephson current due to the AC
phase. This result is valid from the point contact limit to the long channel
length limit, as defined by the ratio of the junction length and the BCS
healing length. We show in the long channel length limit that the impurity
scattering has no effect on the oscillation of the Josephson current, in
contrast to the case of conductivity oscillations in a spin-orbit coupled ring
system attached to normal leads where impurity scattering reduces the amplitude
of oscillations. Our results suggest a new scheme to measure the AC phase with,
in principle, higher sensitivity. In addition, this effect allows for control
of the Josephson current through the gate voltage tuned AC phase.
