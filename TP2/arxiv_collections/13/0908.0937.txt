We discuss Quantum Chromodynamics calculations using the lattice regulator.
The theory of the strong force is a cornerstone of the Standard Model of
particle physics. We present USQCD collaboration results obtained on Argonne
National Lab's Intrepid supercomputer that deepen our understanding of these
fundamental theories of Nature and provide critical support to frontier
particle physics experiments and phenomenology.
