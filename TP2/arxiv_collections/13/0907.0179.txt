We present a method for detecting the entanglement of a state using
non-equilibrium processes. A comparison of relative entropies allows us to
construct an entanglement witness. The relative entropy can further be related
to the quantum Jarzynski equality, allowing non-equilibrium work to be used in
entanglement detection. To exemplify our results, we consider two different
spin chains.
