We explore a connection between generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and
modified Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. The GUP density function may be
replaced by the cutoff function for the renormalization group of modified
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. We find the GUP-corrected graviton propagators and
compare these with tensor propagators in the HL gravity. Two are qualitatively
similar, but the $p^5$-term arisen from Cotton tensor is missed in the
GUP-corrected graviton propagator.
