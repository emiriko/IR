We present a new method for the analysis of Abell 1835 observed by
XMM-Newton. The method is a combination of the Direct Demodulation technique
and deprojection. We eliminate the effects of the point spread function (PSF)
with the Direct Demodulation technique. We then use a traditional depro-jection
technique to study the properties of Abell 1835. Compared to that of
deprojection method only, the central electron density derived from this method
increases by 30%, while the temperature profile is similar.
