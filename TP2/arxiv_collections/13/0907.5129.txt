The density-density correlation profiles obtained superimposing absorption
images from atomic clouds freely expanding after the release of the confining
optical lattice can be theoretically described in terms of a generalized
quantum measure based on coherent-like states. We show that the corresponding
density patterns differ in a testable way from those computed using standard
many-body mean values, usually adopted in fitting experimental data.
