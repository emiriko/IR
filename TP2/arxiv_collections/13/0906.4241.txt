We discuss transportation and redistribution of energy and angular momentum
in the magnetic connection (MC) process and Blandford-Payne (BP) process. The
MC results in readjusting the interior viscous torque, and its effects are
operative not only in but also beyond the MC region. The BP process is invoked
to transfer the "excessive" angular momentum from an accretion disc. In
addition, we derive a criterion for the interior viscous torque to resolve the
puzzle of the overall equilibrium of angular momentum in disc accretion. It
turns out that the BP efficiency of extracting angular momentum and the
intensity of the outflow are required to be greater than some critical values.
