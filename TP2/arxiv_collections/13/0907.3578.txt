A simple inhomogeneous cosmological model with a local void is constrained
with the latest Union supernova compilation. To fit the supernova data, a large
local void on the scales of 1 Gpc is found, contrary to the small scales of 200
Mpc in the previous finding. A more realistic inhomogeneous cosmological model
may be required to fit the supernova data. Alternatively, a clumpy universe
with clumpiness parameter < 1 can fit the supernova data with reduced local
void scales.
