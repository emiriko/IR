This article describes a new type of artificial neuron, called the authors
"cyberneuron". Unlike classical models of artificial neurons, this type of
neuron used table substitution instead of the operation of multiplication of
input values for the weights. This allowed to significantly increase the
information capacity of a single neuron, but also greatly simplify the process
of learning. Considered an example of the use of "cyberneuron" with the task of
detecting computer viruses.
