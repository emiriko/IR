We propose a simple approach to the calculation of the entanglement entropy
of a spherically symmetric quantum system composed of two separate regions. We
consider bound states of the system described by a wave function that is scale
invariant and vanishes exponentially at infinity. Our result is in accordance
with the holographic bound on entropy and shows that entanglement entropy
scales with the area of the boundary.
