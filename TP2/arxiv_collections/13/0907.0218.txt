Solitons and polarons at nonequilibrium steady states are investigated for
the spinless Takayama Lin-Liu Maki model. Polarons are found to be possible
{\it only out of equilibrium}. This polaron formation is a genuine
nonequilibrium phenomenon, as there is a lower threshold current below which
they cannot exist. It is considered to be an example of microscopic dissipative
structure.
