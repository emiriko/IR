Only two isospin-singlet scalar mesons $f_0(600)$ ($\sigma$) and $f_0(980)$
exist below 1 GeV, so that it is natural to suppose that they are two energy
eigenstates which are mixtures of ${1\over\sqrt 2}(u\bar u+d\bar d)$ and $s\bar
s$. Is this picture right? Generally, it is considered that $f_0(600)$ mainly
consists of ${1\over\sqrt 2}(u\bar u+d\bar d)$, if so, the dominant component
of $f_0(980)$ should be $s\bar s$. The recent measurement of the CLEO
collaboration on the branching ratio of $D_s\to f_0(980) e^+ \nu_e$ provides an
excellent opportunity to testify the structure of $f_0(980)$, namely whether
the data can be understood as long as it consists of mainly the conventional
$q\bar q$ structure. We calculate the form factors of $D_s\to f_0(980)$ in the
light-front quark model (LFQM) and the corresponding branching ratio of the
semileptonic decay. By fitting the data, we obtain the mixing angle $\phi$. The
obtained mixing angle shows that the $s\bar s$ component in $f_0(980)$ may not
be dominant.
