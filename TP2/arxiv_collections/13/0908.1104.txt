A simple quasi-static model applicable to a wide class of wire media is
developed that explains strong non-locality in the dielectric response of wire
media in clear physical terms of effective inductance and capacitance per unit
length of a wire. The model is checked against known solutions and found to be
in excellent agreement with the results obtained by much more sophisticated
analytical and numerical methods. Special attention is given to suppression of
the spatial dispersion effects in wire media.
