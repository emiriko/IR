In this work, we present the results obtained from a multi-wavelength
campaign, as well as from the public Swift/BAT, XRT, and UVOT data of GRB
060111B for which a bright optical emission was measured with good temporal
resolution during the prompt phase. We identified the host galaxy at R~25 mag;
its featureless spectral continuum and brightness, as well as the non-detection
of any associated supernova 16 days after the trigger and other independent
redshift estimates, converge to z~1-2. From the analysis of the early afterglow
SED, we find that non-negligible host galaxy dust extinction, in addition to
the Galactic one, affects the observed flux in the optical regime. The
extinction-corrected optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distribution during
the prompt emission shows a flux density ratio $F_{\gamma}/F_{opt}$=0.01-0.0001
with spectral index $\beta_{\gamma,opt}> \beta_{\gamma}$, strongly suggesting a
separate origin of the optical and gamma-ray components. This result is
supported by the lack of correlated behavior in the prompt emission light
curves observed in the two energy domains. The properties of the prompt optical
emission observed during GRB 060111B favor interpretation of this optical light
as radiation from the reverse shock in a thick shell limit and in the slow
cooling regime. The expected peak flux is consistent with the observed one
corrected for the host extinction, likely indicating that the starting time of
the TAROT observations is very near to or coincident with the peak time. The
estimated fireball initial Lorentz factor is >260-360 at z=1-2, similar to the
Lorentz factors obtained from other GRBs. GRB 060111B is a rare, good test case
of the reverse shock emission mechanism in both the X-ray and optical energy
ranges.
