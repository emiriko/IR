Recently, a chaotic cryptographic scheme based on composition maps was
proposed. This paper studies the security of the scheme and reports the
following findings: 1) the scheme can be broken by a differential attack with
$6+\lceil\log_L(MN)\rceil$ chosen-plaintext, where $MN$ is the size of
plaintext and $L$ is the number of different elements in plain-text; 2) the
scheme is not sensitive to the changes of plaintext; 3) the two composition
maps do not work well as a secure and efficient random number source.
