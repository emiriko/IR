Propagation of relativistic particles in the Schwarzschild gravitational
field is studied. Particles emitted radially outward with speed at infinity
exceeding c/2^0.5 are observed to be accelerated in the gravitational field by
a distant observer. This is the Shapiro effect for relativistic particles.
Slower particles are decelerated, as in Newtonian gravity. A speed-dependent
potential for relativistic particles corresponding to the speed measured in
terms of the coordinate time is derived to be $V=GM gamma(gamma^2 -2)/r which
is repulsive for v>c/2^0.5. The gravitational repulsion could be revealed in
satellite experiments with beams of relativistic particles subject to very
precise time measurements. Principles of laboratory measurements able to test
kinetic energy changes of relativistic particles in the Earth gravitational
field are discussed.
