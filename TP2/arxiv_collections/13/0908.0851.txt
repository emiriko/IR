We have developed a track fitting procedure based on Kalman Filter technique
for an Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) prototype detector when the detector is flushed
with single muon tracks. The relevant track parameters i.e., momentum,
direction and charge are reconstructed and analyzed. This paper discusses the
design of the prototype detector, its geometry simulation by Geant4, and the
detector response with the cosmic ray muons. Finally we show the resolution of
reconstructed momenta and also the charge identification efficiency of $\mu^+$
and $\mu^-$ events in the magnetized ICAL.
