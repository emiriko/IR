We measured the photometric flux of the cataclysmic variable TT Arietis
(BD+14 341) using the MOST space telescope. Periodic oscillations of the flux
reveal the orbital period as well as other features of this binary system. We
applied a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on a reduced dataset to retrieve the
frequencies of TT Arietis. The analysis of the system revealed a photometric
period of 3.19 hours. Though the MOST data has a high cadence of 52.8 seconds,
a fine structure of the accretion disk is not obvious.
