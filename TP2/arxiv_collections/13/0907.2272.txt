(Abridged) We present simultaneous optical--to--X-ray spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) from Swift's X-ray and UV--optical telescopes (XRT and
UVOT) for a well-selected sample of 26 low-redshift (z<0.1) AGN from the
Swift/BAT 9-month catalogue, the largest well-studied, hard X-ray selected
survey of local AGN to date. Our subsample consists of AGN with low intrinsic
X-ray absorption (N_H<10^22 cm^-2) and minimal spectral complexity, to more
accurately recover the intrinsic accretion luminosity in these sources. We
perform a correction for host galaxy contamination in all available UVOT filter
images to recover the intrinsic AGN emission, and estimate intrinsic dust
extinction from the resultant nuclear SEDs. Black hole mass estimates are
determined from the host-galaxy 2MASS K-band bulge luminosity. Accretion rates
determined from our SEDs are on average low (Eddington ratios <~ 0.1) and hard
X-ray bolometric corrections cluster at ~10-20, in contrast with the higher
values seen for quasars. An average SED for the 22 low accretion rate
(Eddington ratio < 0.1) objects is presented, with and without correction for
intrinsic extinction. We do not find a correlation of optical--to--X-ray
spectral index with Eddington ratio, regardless of the optical reference
wavelength chosen for defining the spectral index. The low accretion rates and
bolometric corrections found for this representative low-redshift sample are of
particular importance for studies of AGN accretion history.
