Emission spectra from magnetars in the soft X-ray band likely contain a
thermal component emerging directly from the neutron star surface. However, the
lack of observed absorption-like features in quiescent spectra makes it
difficult to directly constrain physical properties of the atmosphere. We argue
that future X-ray polarization measurements represent a promising technique for
directly constraining the magnetar magnetic field strength and geometry. We
construct models of the observed polarization signal from a finite surface
hotspot, using the latest NS atmosphere models for magnetic fields B = 4 x
10^13--5 x 10^14 G. Our calculations are strongly dependent on the NS magnetic
field strength and geometry, and are more weakly dependent on the NS equation
of state and atmosphere composition. We discuss how the complementary
dependencies of phase-resolved spectroscopy and polarimetry might resolve
degeneracies that currently hamper the determination of magnetar physical
parameters using thermal models.
