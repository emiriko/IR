Forward $\pi^0$ production has been measured at STAR with the new Forward
Meson Spectrometer (FMS) from p+p and d+Au collisions during the 2008 RHIC run.
We present the first FMS results of azimuthal correlation involving a forward
$\pi^0$ produced in p+p and d+Au collisions to search for the onset of gluon
density saturation, expected to occur at small momentum fractions.
