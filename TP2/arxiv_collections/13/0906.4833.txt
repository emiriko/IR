SCTE intends to provide a simple, yet powerful, framework for building data
acquisition and equipment control systems for experimental Physics, and
correlated areas. Via its SCTE::Instrument module, RS-232, USB, and LAN buses
are supported, and the intricacies of hardware communication are encapsulated
underneath an object oriented abstraction layer. Written in Perl, and using the
SCPI protocol, enabled instruments can be easily programmed to perform a wide
variety of tasks. While this work presents general aspects of the development
of data acquisition systems using the SCTE framework, it is illustrated by
particular applications designed for the calibration of several in-house
developed devices for power measurement in the tokamak TCABR Alfv\'en Waves
Excitement System.
