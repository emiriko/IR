Resistivity measurements have been made on Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si single crystals
between 2 and 300K for $x$ = 0, 0.05, 0.08, 0.12 and 0.15. Fe doping is found
to depress the magnetic ordering temperature from 30K for $x$ = 0 to below 2K
for $x$ = 0.15. Although Fe doping results in a large increase of the
low-temperature residual resistivity, the temperature dependence of the
resistivity above the magnetic transition remains practically unaffected by
increasing Fe content. An analysis of the temperature derivative of the
resistivity provides strong evidence for the existence of a non-Fermi-liquid
ground state near $x$ = 0.15 and thus for a quantum critical point tuned by Fe
content.
