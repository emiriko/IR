We study the heavy quark effective theory prediction for semileptonic $B$
decays into an orbital excited $F$-wave charmed doublet, the ($2^{+}$, $3^{+}$)
states ($D^{*'}_{2}$, $D_{3}$), at the leading order of heavy quark expansion.
The corresponding universal form factor is estimated by using the QCD sum rule
method. The decay rates we predict are $\Gamma_{B\to
D^{*'}_{2}\ell\overline{\nu}}=1.85\times10^{-19} {GeV}$ and $\Gamma_{B\to
D_{3}\ell\overline{\nu}}=1.78\times10^{-19} {GeV}$. The branching ratios are
$\mathcal {B}(B\to D_{2}^{*'}\ell\overline{\nu})=4.6\times10^{-7}$ and
$\mathcal {B}(B\to D_{3}\ell\overline{\nu})=4.4\times10^{-7}$, respectively.
