We review the results of a timing analysis of the observations for ten bright
X-ray pulsars (with fluxes >100 mCrab in the 20-100 keV energy band) that fell
within the INTEGRAL field of view from 2003 to 2007. The dependence of the
pulse profile on the energy and intrinsic source luminosity has been
investigated; particular attention has been paid to searching for changes in
the pulse profile near the cyclotron frequency. The dependence of the pulsed
fraction for X-ray pulsars on their luminosity and energy band has been studied
in detail for the first time.
