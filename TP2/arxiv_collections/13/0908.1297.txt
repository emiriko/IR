Recent advances in the photon tagging facilities together with the novel,
high resolution fast calorimetry made possible to perform photoproduction cross
section measurements of pseudoscalar mesons on nuclei with a percent level
accuracy. The extraction of the radiative decay widths, needed for testing the
symmetry breaking effects in QCD, from these measurements at small angles is
done by the Primakoff method. This method requires theoretical treatment of all
processes participating in these reactions at the same percent level. The most
updated description of general processes, including the nuclear coherent
amplitude, is done in our previous paper. In this work, based on the framework
of Glauber multiple scattering theory, we obtain analytical expressions for the
incoherent cross section of the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons off
nuclei accounting for the mesons absorption in nuclei and Pauli suppression at
forward production angles. As illustrations of the obtained formulas, we
calculate the incoherent cross section for photoproduction from a closed shell
nucleus, 16^O, and from an unclosed shell nucleus, 12^C. These calculations
allow one to compare different approaches and estimate their impact on the
incoherent cross section of the processes under consideration.
