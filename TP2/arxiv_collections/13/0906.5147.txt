In this paper a new model method for describing of the electrostatic
screening in single-component systems which is free of Debye-Huckel's
non-physical properties is presented. The method is appropriate for the
determination of screening parameters in the case of the systems of higher
non-ideality degree. The obtained screening characteristics are presented in a
simple analytic form. The presented results make basic elements of a method for
determination of screening characteristics in dense two-component plasmas,
which are discussed in Part2 and Part 3 of this work.
