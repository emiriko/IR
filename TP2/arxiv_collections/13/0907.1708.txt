Recent work on fault-tolerant quantum computation making use of topological
error correction shows great potential, with the 2d surface code possessing a
threshold error rate approaching 1% (NJoP 9:199, 2007), (arXiv:0905.0531).
However, the 2d surface code requires the use of a complex state distillation
procedure to achieve universal quantum computation. The colour code of (PRL
97:180501, 2006) is a related scheme partially solving the problem, providing a
means to perform all Clifford group gates transversally. We review the colour
code and its error correcting methodology, discussing one approximate technique
based on graph matching. We derive an analytic lower bound to the threshold
error rate of 6.25% under error-free syndrome extraction, while numerical
simulations indicate it may be as high as 13.3%. Inclusion of faulty syndrome
extraction circuits drops the threshold to approximately 0.1%.
