We report on observations of the CoRoT IR01 field with the Berlin Exoplanet
Search Telescope (BEST). BEST is a small aperture telescope with a wide field
of view (FOV). It is dedicated to search for variable stars within the target
fields of the CoRoT space mission to aid in minimizing false-alarm rates and
identify potential targets for additional science. CoRoT's observational
programm started in February 2007 with the "initial run" field (IR01) observed
for about two months. BEST observed this field for 12 nights spread over three
months in winter 2006. From the total of 30426 stars observed in the IR01 field
3769 were marked as suspected variable stars and 54 from them showed clear
periodicity. From these 19 periodic stars are within the part of the CoRoT FOV
covered in our data set.
