Production of W bosons in longitudinally polarized pp collisions provides an
excellent tool to probe the flavor-dependence of sea quark polarizations in the
polarized proton. Current status and future plans for the W physics program
with the STAR detector at RHIC are presented along with remarks concerning our
knowledge of the nature and origin of the partonic sea.
