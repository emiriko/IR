Long-lived (>20 days) sunspot groups extracted from the Greenwich Photo-
heliographic Results (GPR) are examined for evidence of decadal change. The
problem of identifying sunspot groups which are observed on consecutive solar
rotations (recurrent sunspot groups) is tackled by first constructing manually
an example dataset of recurrent sunspot groups and then using machine learning
to generalise this subset to the whole GPR. The resulting dataset of recurrent
sunspot groups is verified against previous work by A. Maunder and other Royal
Greenwich Observatory (RGO) compilers. Recurrent groups are found to exhibit a
slightly larger value for the Gnevyshev-Waldmeier Relationship than the value
found by Petrovay and van Driel-Gesztelyi (Solar Phys. 51, 25, 1997), who used
recurrence data from the Debrecen Photoheliographic Results. Evidence for
sunspot group lifetime change over the previous century is observed within
recurrent groups. A lifetime increase of 1.4 between 1915 and 1940 is found,
which closely agrees with results from Blanter et al. (Solar Phys. 237, 329,
2006). Furthermore, this increase is found to exist over a longer period (1915
to 1950) than previously thought and provisional evidence is found for a
decline between 1950 and 1965. Possible applications of machine-learning
procedures to the analysis of historical sunspot observations, the
determination of the magnetic topology of the solar corona and the incidence of
severe space-weather events are outlined briefly.
