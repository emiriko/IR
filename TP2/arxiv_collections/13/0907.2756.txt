We will discuss the relevant conditions to observe a critical tunneling
current [New J. Phys. 10, 045018 (2008)] in electron double-layer systems at a
total filling factor of 1 and find they are related to the effective layer
separation and the temperature. Our studies suggest that the intensity of the
critical tunneling behavior is also directly linked to the area of the sample.
