We derive the steady state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation that
describes the dynamics of the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator in
the truncated Wigner representation of the density operator. The adiabatic
limit of strong pump damping is assumed. This phase space image provides a
clear view of the intracavity two-mode entangled state valid in all operating
regimes of the OPO. A nongaussian distribution is obtained for the above
threshold solution.
