We study the spin-down of a neutron star during its early stages due to the
neutrino emission. The mechanism we consider is the subsequent collisions of
the produced neutrinos with the outer shells of the star. We find that this
mechanism can indeed slow down the star rotation but only in the first tens of
seconds of the core formation, which is when the appropriate conditions of flux
and collision rate are met. We find that this mechanism can extract less than 1
% of the star angular momentum, a result which is much less than previously
estimated by other authors.
