We review recent theoretical results on generalized parton distributions
(GPDs) of nuclei, emphasizing the following three roles of nuclear GPDs: (i)
complementarity to free proton GPDs, (ii) the enhancement of traditional
nuclear effects such as nuclear binding, EMC effect, nuclear shadowing, and
(iii) an access to novel nuclear effects such as medium modifications of bound
nucleons.
