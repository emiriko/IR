We generalize the constructions of Eisenbud, Fl{\o}ystad, and Weyman for
equivariant minimal free resolutions over the general linear group, and we
construct equivariant resolutions over the orthogonal and symplectic groups. We
also conjecture and provide some partial results for the existence of an
equivariant analogue of Boij-S\"oderberg decompositions for Betti tables, which
were proven to exist in the non-equivariant setting by Eisenbud and Schreyer.
Many examples are given.
