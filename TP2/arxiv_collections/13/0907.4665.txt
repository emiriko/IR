A direct observation of nucleation of Ge hut clusters formed by ultrahigh
vacuum molecular beam epitaxy is reported for the first time. The nuclei of the
pyramidal and wedge-like clusters have been observed on the wetting layer
blocks and found to have different structures. The growth of the clusters of
both species goes on following different scenarios: Formation of the second
atomic layer of the wedge-like cluster results in rearrangement of its first
layer. Its ridge structure does not replicate the structure of the nucleus. The
pyramidal cluster grows without phase transitions. The structure of its vertex
copies the structure of the nucleus. The wedge-like clusters contain point
defects on the triangular faces and have preferential directions of growth
along the ridges.
  The derived structure of the {105} facet corresponds to the PD model. The
critical epinucleation phenomenon may be responsible for hut formation.
