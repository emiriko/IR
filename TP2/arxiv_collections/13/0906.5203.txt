The large change in electromagnetic impedance in ferromagnetic state of soft
magnetic metals in presence of biasing magnetic field is associated with change
in screening of electromagnetic field. The screening depends on the
permeability of the metal. Apart from dependence on intrinsic properties of
metal the permeability depends on size of the sample. It is observed that the
decrease in MI in amorphous ferromagnetic ribbon of Fe40Ni40B20 alloy is large
for long sample whereas corresponding change is small for short one with same
biasing field. As intrinsic magnetic properties and bias field are same and the
demagnetization factor increases with reduction of length of the sample the
reduction of MI effect is associated with demagnetization field.
