Analytical series expansions for the bending of light in the equatorial plane
of a Kerr black hole are presented in both the strong and weak deflection
regimes. It is critical that these are known in analytical form so further
analysis can be done for predicting different properties of images formed in
gravitational lensing. Starting with the exact bending angle in terms of the
spin parameter, we apply a perturbative scheme for rewriting the bending angle
as series expansions in terms of the impact parameter of the incident light
ray. The asymmetry introduced by the black hole spin results in spin-dependent
shifts in image positions. We apply our results for the case of a galactic
supermassive black hole to predict angular shifts of relativistic images from
the optic axis. This would not be possible without the perturbative expansions
in the strong deflection regime, only in which relativistic images have a
chance of being resolved by future telescopes.
