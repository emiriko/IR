Accuracy standards have been developed to ensure that the waveforms used for
gravitational-wave data analysis are good enough to serve their intended
purposes. These standards place constraints on certain norms of the
frequency-domain representations of the waveform errors. Examples are given
here of possible misinterpretations and misapplications of these standards,
whose effect could be to vitiate the quality control they were intended to
enforce. Suggestions are given for ways to avoid these problems.
