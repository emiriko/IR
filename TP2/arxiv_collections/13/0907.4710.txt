BRAHMS has measured rapidity density distributions of protons and antiprotons
in both p+p and Au+Au collisions at 62 GeV and 200 GeV. From these
distributions the yields of so-called "net-protons", that is the difference
between the proton and antiproton yields, can be determined. The rapidity
dependence of the net-proton yields from peripheral Au+Au collisions is found
to have a similar behaviour to that found for the p+p results, while a quite
different rapidity dependence is found for central Au+Au collisions. The
net-proton distributions can be used together with model calculations to find
the net-baryon yields as a function of rapidity, thus yielding information on
the average rapidity loss of beam particles, the baryon transport properties of
the medium, and the amount of "stopping" in these collisions.
