We discuss a novel method of efficiently producing multi-photon states using
repeated spontaneous parametric downconversion. Specifically, by attempting
downconversion several times, we can pseudo-deterministically add photons to a
mode, producing various several-photon states. We discuss both expected
performance and experimental limitations.
