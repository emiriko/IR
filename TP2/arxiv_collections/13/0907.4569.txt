We develop a generalized version of heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory
to describe pion-nucleon scattering in a kinematic domain that extends
continuously from threshold to the delta-isobar peak. The $P$-wave phase shifts
are used to illustrate this framework. We also compare our approach with those
in the literature that concern the delta resonance.
