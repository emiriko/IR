It is a challenge to explain why neutrinos are so light compared to other
leptons. Small neutrino masses can be explained if right-handed fermions
propagate in large extra dimensions. Fermions propagating in the bulk would
have implications on Higgs boson decays. If the Higgs boson is discovered at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a detailed analysis may reveal the presence of
large extra dimensions. This paper reviews the status of large
extra-dimensional models in the context of the current limits on Higgs boson
masses and the fundamental Planck scale in extra dimensions.
