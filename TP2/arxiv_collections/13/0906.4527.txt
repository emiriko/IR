I review two mechanisms by which gravitational waves can be generated at the
end of inflation: preheating, and gravitons Hawking radiated during the decay
of very small primordial black holes. These mechanisms are contrasted with the
gravitational waves during inflation, and may provide a window into the
physical processes that govern the end of the inflationary phase.
