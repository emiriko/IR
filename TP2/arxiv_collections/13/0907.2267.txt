In this paper, we consider the optimal design of photonic crystal band
structures for two-dimensional square lattices. The mathematical formulation of
the band gap optimization problem leads to an infinite-dimensional Hermitian
eigenvalue optimization problem parametrized by the dielectric material and the
wave vector. To make the problem tractable, the original eigenvalue problem is
discretized using the finite element method into a series of finite-dimensional
eigenvalue problems for multiple values of the wave vector parameter. The
resulting optimization problem is large-scale and non-convex, with low
regularity and non-differentiable objective. By restricting to appropriate
eigenspaces, we reduce the large-scale non-convex optimization problem via
reparametrization to a sequence of small-scale convex semidefinite programs
(SDPs) for which modern SDP solvers can be efficiently applied. Numerical
results are presented for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric
(TE) polarizations at several frequency bands. The optimized structures exhibit
patterns which go far beyond typical physical intuition on periodic media
design.
