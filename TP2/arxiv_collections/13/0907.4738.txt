Marked correlations are reported between the ionization of the X-ray line
spectra of normal OB stars, as observed by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and
their optical spectral types. These correlations include the progressive
weakening of the higher ionization relative to the lower ionization X-ray lines
with advancing spectral type, and the similarly decreasing intensity ratios of
the H-like to He-like lines of the alpha ions. These relationships were not
predicted by models, nor have they been clearly evident in astrophysical
studies of a few objects; rather, they have emerged from morphological analysis
of an adequate (albeit still small) sample, from which known peculiar objects
such as magnetic stars and very rapid rotators have been isolated to reveal the
normal trends. This process is analogous to that which first demonstrated the
strong relationships between the UV wind profiles and the optical spectral
types of normal OB stars, which likely bear a physical as well as a historical
connection to the present X-ray results. Since the optical spectral types are
calibrated in terms of fundamental stellar parameters, it follows that the
winds and X-ray spectra are determined by the latter. These observations
provide strong guidance for further astrophysical modeling of these phenomena.
