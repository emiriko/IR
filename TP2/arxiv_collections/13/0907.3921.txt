The high-mass X-ray binary system LS I +61 303 is well known as a rare
example of a variable Galactic GeV and TeV gamma-ray emitter. Despite years of
study, many aspects of the system remain unclear; the nature of the compact
object, the particle acceleration mechanisms and the gamma-ray emission and
absorption processes can all be modelled in a variety of different scenarios.
Here we report on a deep exposure of LS I +61 303 made with the VERITAS array
during the 2008-2009 observing season. These are the first TeV observations
made with contemporaneous coverage at lower energies by the LAT onboard Fermi,
and as such provide a new set of constraints for system models.
