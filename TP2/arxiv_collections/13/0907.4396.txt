We present analysis of J/$\psi$ production over the range $-1.0 < \eta < 4.2$
in p+p and d+Au collisions using di-electron data taken during the 2008 run
with the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. STAR's unique
forward capabilities, especially the Forward Meson Spectrometer electromagnetic
calorimeter, allow us the possibility of investigating the intrinsic charm
components of the proton wave function using high-$x_F$ forward particles
produced in asymmetric partonic collisions. Mid-rapidity measurements in d+Au
collisions extend our understanding of the mechanisms underlying heavy
quarkonium production and its transport through cold nuclear matter.
