For the solid state double-dot interferometer, the phase shifted interference
pattern induced by the interplay of inter-dot Coulomb correlation and multiple
reflections is analyzed by harmonic decomposition. Unexpected result is
uncovered, and is discussed in connection with the which-path detection and
electron loss.
