We suggest a new generalization of Pontryagin duality from the category of
Abelian locally compact groups to a category which includes all Moore groups,
i.e. groups whose irreducible representations are finite-dimensional. Objects
in this category are pro-C*-algebras with a structure of Hopf algebras (in the
strict algebraic sense) with respect to a certain topological tensor product.
