The reconstruction of quantum states from a sufficient set of experimental
data can be achieved with arbitrarily weak measurement interactions. Since such
weak measurements have negligible back-action, the quantum state reconstruction
is also valid for the post-selected sub-ensembles usually considered in weak
measurement paradoxes. It is shown that post-selection can then be identified
with a statistical decomposition of the initial density matrix into transient
density matrices conditioned by the anticipated measurement outcomes. This
result indicates that it is possible to ascribe the properties determined by
the final measurement outcome to each individual quantum system before the
measurement has taken place. The ``collapse'' of the pure state wavefunction in
a measurement can then be understood in terms of the classical ``collapse'' of
a probability distribution as new information becomes available.
