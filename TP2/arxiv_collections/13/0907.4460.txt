This paper aims to study the configuration of two components caused by
rotational and tidal distortions in the model of a binary system. The
potentials of the two distorted components can be approximated to 2nd-degree
harmonics. Furthermore, both the accretion luminosity ($\sigma_{i}$) and the
irradiative luminosity are included in stellar structure equations. The
equilibrium structure of rotationally and tidally distorted star is exactly a
triaxial ellipsoids. A formula describing the isobars is presented, and the
rotational velocity and the gravitational acceleration at the primary surface
simulated. The results show the distortion at the outer layers of the primary
increases with temporal variation and system evolution. Besides, it was
observed that the luminosity accretion is unstable, and the curve of the
energy-generation rate fluctuates after the main sequence in rotation
sequences. The luminosity in rotation sequences is slightly weaker than that in
non-rotation sequences. As a result, the volume expands slowly. Polar ejection
is intensified by the tidal effect. The ejection of an equatorial ring may be
favoured by both the opacity effect and the $g_{e}(\theta,\varphi)$-effect in
the binary system.
