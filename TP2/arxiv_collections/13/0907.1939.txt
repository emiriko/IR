We investigate the problem of the typical rotation states of the small
planetary satellites from the viewpoint of the dynamical stability of their
rotation. We show that the majority of the discovered satellites with unknown
rotation periods cannot rotate synchronously, because no stable synchronous 1:1
spin-orbit state exists for them. They rotate either much faster than
synchronously (those tidally unevolved) or, what is much less probable,
chaotically (tidally evolved objects or captured slow rotators).
