In this paper we attempt to introduce an econophysics approach to evaluate
some aspects of the risks in financial markets. For this purpose, the
thermodynamical methods and statistical physics results about entropy and
equilibrium states in the physical systems are used. Some considerations on
economic value and financial information are made. Finally, on this basis, a
new index for the financial risk estimation of the stock-exchange market
transactions, named macrostate parameter, was introduced and discussed.
  Keywords: econophysics, stock-exchange markets, financial risk, informational
fascicle, entropy, macrostate parameter.
