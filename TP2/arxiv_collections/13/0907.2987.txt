The masses and their variation with energy of the elementary particles
obtained by solving the one loop renormalization group equation (RGE) in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is considered. A mass about 115
GeV for all the fermions at GUT scale is found as the possible solution of RGE.
The mass spectra of all the fermions are also obtained within acceptable
errors. They are shown graphically to desend for the top quark but ascend for
all other fermions from the laboratory to the GUT scale.
