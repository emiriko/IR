We study classical and quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnets with exchange
anisotropy of XXZ-type and crystal field single-ion terms of quadratic and
cubic form in a field. The magnets display a variety of phases, including the
spin-flop (or, in the quantum case, spin-liquid) and biconical (corresponding,
in the quantum lattice gas description, to supersolid) phases. Applying
ground-state considerations, Monte Carlo and density matrix renormalization
group methods, the impact of quantum effects and lattice dimension is analysed.
Interesting critical and multicritical behaviour may occur at quantum and
thermal phase transitions.
