The low mass X-ray binary and Z source GX 17+2 undergoes infrared K-band
brightening episodes of at least 3.5 magnitudes. The source of these episodes
is not known. Prior published K-band magnitudes and new K-band measurements
acquired between 2006 and 2008 suggest that the episodes last at least 4 hours
and have a period of 3.01254 $\pm$ 0.00002 days. Future bright episodes can be
predicted using the ephemeris JD_{max} (n) = 2454550.79829 + (3.01254 $\pm$
0.00002)(n) days. A growing body of evidence suggests that the GX 17+2 could
have a synchrotron jet, which could cause this activity.
