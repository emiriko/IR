We discuss the role of flavour physics in building effective theories at the
TeV scale. Particular attention is devoted to the Minimal Flavour Violation
hypothesis, both in the quark and in the lepton sector. Alternative
flavour-protection mechanisms, such as the hierarchical fermion profiles of
models with a warped fifth dimension, are also briefly discussed.
