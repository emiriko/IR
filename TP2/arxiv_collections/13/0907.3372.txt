We study Markov processes generated by iterated function systems (IFS). The
constituent maps of the IFS are monotonic transformations of the interval. We
first obtain an upper bound on the number of SRB (Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measures
for the IFS. Then, when all the constituent maps have common fixed points at 0
and 1, theorems are given to analyze properties of the ergodic invariant
measures $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$. In particular, sufficient conditions for
$\delta_0$ and/or $\delta_1$ to be, or not to be, SRB measures are given. We
apply some of our results to asset market games.
