We use very deep near-infrared (NIR) imaging data obtained in MOIRCS Deep
Survey (MODS) to investigate the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function
back to z~3. The MODS data reach J=24.2, H=23.1, K=23.1 (5sigma, Vega
magnitude) over 103 arcmin^2 (wide) and J=25.1, H=23.7, K=24.1 over 28 arcmin^2
(deep) in the GOODS-North region. The wide and very deep NIR data allow us to
measure the number density of galaxies down to low stellar mass (10^9-10^10
Msun) even at high redshift with high statistical accuracy. The normalization
of the mass function decreases with redshift and the integrated stellar mass
density becomes ~ 8-18% of the local value at z~2 and ~ 4-9% at z~3, which are
consistent with results of previous studies in general fields. Furthermore, we
found that the low-mass slope becomes steeper with redshift from alpha ~- 1.3
at z~1 to alpha ~- 1.6 at z~3, and that the evolution of the number density of
low-mass (10^9-10^10 Msun) galaxies is weaker than that of M* (~10^11 Msun)
galaxies. This indicates that the contribution of low-mass galaxies to the
total stellar mass density has been significant at high redshift. The
steepening of the low-mass slope with redshift is opposite trend expected from
the stellar mass dependence of the specific star formation rate reported in
previous studies. The present result suggests that the hierarchical merging
process overwhelmed the effect of the stellar mass growth by star formation and
was very important for the stellar mass assembly of these galaxies at 1<~z<~3.
