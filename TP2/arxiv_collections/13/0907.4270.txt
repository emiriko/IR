Equations describing the linear evolution of a non-dissipative Langmuir wave
in inhomogeneous nonstationary anisotropic plasma without magnetic field are
derived in the geometrical optics approximation. A continuity equation is
obtained for the wave action density, and the conditions for the action
conservation are formulated. In homogeneous plasma, the wave field E
universally scales with the electron density N as E ~ N^{3/4}, whereas the
wavevector evolution varies depending on the wave geometry.
