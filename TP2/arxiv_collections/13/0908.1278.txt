A tunnel magnetic junction is considered with magnetic hard and magnetic soft
layers of cubic symmetry. The magnetic switching is analyzed of the layers by a
magnetic field perpendicular to the initial magnetizations. In such a
situation, an additional peak of the TMR ratio appears at the magnetic field
value lower substantially than the anisotropy energy of the soft layer.
