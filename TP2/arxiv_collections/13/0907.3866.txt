We briefly review some recent Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models. Our main focus
are charge symmetric models of WIMPs which are not the standard SUSY LSP's
(Lightest Supersymmetric Partners). We indicate which experiments are most
sensitive to certain aspects of the models. In particular we discuss the
manifestations of the new models in neutrino telescopes and other set-ups. We
also discuss some direct detection experiments and comment on measuring the
direction of recoil ions--which is correlated with the direction of the
incoming WIMP. This could yield daily variations providing along with the
annual modulation signatures for CDM.
