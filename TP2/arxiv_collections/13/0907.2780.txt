We report the experimental realization of entanglement localization which
restores polarization entanglement completely redirected after a linear
coupling with incoherent and noisy surrounding photon. The method, based only
on measurements of the surrounding photon after the coupling and on
post-selection, can localize the entanglement back to original systems for any
linear coupling.
