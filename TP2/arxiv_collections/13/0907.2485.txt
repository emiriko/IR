Cloud Computing is rising fast, with its data centres growing at an
unprecedented rate. However, this has come with concerns over privacy,
efficiency at the expense of resilience, and environmental sustainability,
because of the dependence on Cloud vendors such as Google, Amazon and
Microsoft. Our response is an alternative model for the Cloud
conceptualisation, providing a paradigm for Clouds in the community, utilising
networked personal computers for liberation from the centralised vendor model.
Community Cloud Computing (C3) offers an alternative architecture, created by
combing the Cloud with paradigms from Grid Computing, principles from Digital
Ecosystems, and sustainability from Green Computing, while remaining true to
the original vision of the Internet. It is more technically challenging than
Cloud Computing, having to deal with distributed computing issues, including
heterogeneous nodes, varying quality of service, and additional security
constraints. However, these are not insurmountable challenges, and with the
need to retain control over our digital lives and the potential environmental
consequences, it is a challenge we must pursue.
