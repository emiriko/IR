The timing data of the binary pulsar PSR1913+16, are used to establish an
upper limit on the rate of continuous neutrino emission from neutron stars.
Neutrino emission from each of the neutron stars of the binary system,
increases the star binding energy and thus translates to a decrease in their
masses. This in turn implies an increase with time of the binary period. Using
the pulsar data we obtain an upper limit on the allowed rate of mass reduction
: $| \dot{M}| <1.1 \times 10^{-12} yr^{-1} M $, where $M$ is the total mass of
the binary. This constrains exotic nuclear equations of state that predict
continuous neutrino emissions. The limit applies also to other channels of
energy loss, e.g. axion emission. Continued timing measurements of additional
binary pulsars, should yield a stronger limit in the future.
