The thermal dependence of the electrical conductance of the single-electron
transistor (SET) in the zero-bias Kondo regime is discussed. An exact mapping
to the universal curve for the symmetric Anderson model is established. Linear,
the mapping is parametrized by the Kondo temperature and the charge in the
Kondo cloud. Illustrative numerical renormalization-group results, in excellent
agreement with the mapping, are presented.
