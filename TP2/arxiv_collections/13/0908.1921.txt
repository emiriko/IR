It is known that quantum computers, if available, would allow an exponential
decrease in the computational cost of quantum simulations. We extend this
result to show that the computation of molecular properties (energy
derivatives) could also be sped up using quantum computers. We provide a
quantum algorithm for the numerical evaluation of molecular properties, whose
time cost is a constant multiple of the time needed to compute the molecular
energy, regardless of the size of the system. Molecular properties computed
with the proposed approach could also be used for the optimization of molecular
geometries or other properties. For that purpose, we discuss the benefits of
quantum techniques for Newton's method and Householder methods. Finally, global
minima for the proposed optimizations can be found using the quantum basin
hopper algorithm, which offers an additional quadratic reduction in cost over
classical multi-start techniques.
