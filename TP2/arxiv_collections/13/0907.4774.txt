Using the most general form of the interpolating current of the heavy spin
1/2, $\Sigma_{b}$ baryon and distribution amplitudes of the nucleon, the
transition form factors of the semileptonic $\Sigma_{b}\to Nl\nu$ decay are
calculated in the framework of light cone QCD sum rules. It is obtained that
the form factors satisfy the heavy quark effective theory relations. The
obtained results for the related form factors are used to estimate the decay
rate of this transition.
