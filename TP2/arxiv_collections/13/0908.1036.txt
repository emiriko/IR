We present a computer simulation model that is a one-to-one copy of a quantum
eraser experiment with photons (P. D. D. Schwindt {\sl et al.}, Phys. Rev. A
60, 4285 (1999)). The model is solely based on experimental facts, satisfies
Einstein's criterion of local causality and does not require knowledge of the
solution of a wave equation. Nevertheless, the simulation model reproduces the
averages as obtained from the wave mechanical description of the quantum eraser
experiment, proving that it is possible to give a particle-only description of
quantum eraser experiments with photons. We demonstrate that although the
visibility can be used as a measure for the interference, it cannot be used to
quantify the wave character of a photon. The classical particle-like simulation
model renders the concept of wave-particle duality, used to explain the outcome
of the quantum eraser experiment with photons, superfluous.
