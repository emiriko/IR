The mass of the eta_b(1S), measured recently by BABAR, is significantly lower
than expected from QCD predictions for the Upsilon(1S) - eta_b(1S) hyperfine
splitting. We suggest that the observed eta_b(1S) mass is shifted downwards due
to a mixing with a CP-odd Higgs scalar A with a mass m_A in the range 9.4 -
10.5 GeV compatible with LEP, CLEO and BABAR constraints. We determine the
resulting predictions for the spectrum of the eta_b(nS) - A system and the
branching ratios into tau^+ tau^- as functions of m_A.
