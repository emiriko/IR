The two-neutrino positron double-$\beta $ decay modes of $^{156}$Dy isotope
are studied in the Projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov framework for the
$0^{+}\to 0^{+}$ transition. Theoretically calculated half-lives of
electron-positron conversion and double-electron capture modes are presented.
The effect of the quadrupolar deformation on nuclear transition matrix element
$M_{2\nu}$ is also investigated.
