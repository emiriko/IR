Short lived resonances are sensitive to the medium properties in heavy-ion
collisions. Heavy hadrons have larger probability to be produced within the
quark gluon plasma phase due to their short formation times. Therefore heavy
mass resonances are more likely to be affected by the medium, and the
identification of early produced resonances from jet fragmentation might be a
viable option to study chirality. The high momentum resonances on the away-side
of a triggered di-jet are likely to be the most modified by the partonic or
early hadronic medium. We will discuss first results of triggered
hadron-resonance correlations in Cu+Cu heavy ion collisions.
