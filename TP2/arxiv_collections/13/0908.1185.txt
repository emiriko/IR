We propose a new scheme of attack on the Microsoft's ASIRRA CAPTCHA which
represents a significant shortcut to the intended attacking path, as it is not
based in any advance in the state of the art on the field of image recognition.
After studying the ASIRRA Public Corpus, we conclude that the security margin
as stated by their authors seems to be quite optimistic. Then, we analyze which
of the studied parameters for the image files seems to disclose the most
valuable information for helping in correct classification, arriving at a
surprising discovery. This represents a completely new approach to breaking
CAPTCHAs that can be applied to many of the currently proposed image-labeling
algorithms, and to prove this point we show how to use the very same approach
against the HumanAuth CAPTCHA. Lastly, we investigate some measures that could
be used to secure the ASIRRA and HumanAuth schemes, but conclude no easy
solutions are at hand.
