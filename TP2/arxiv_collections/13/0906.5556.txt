We calculate the gravitational correction to the phase difference between
neutrino mass eigenstates. There is a number of papers, where this correction
was calculated for the spherically symmetric gravitational field described by
the Schwarzschild metric. The results of these papers differ from each other.
Our result is close to that of Bhattachary, Habib and Mottola (see ref. [3,6])
and differs only by a coefficient: our correction is twice smaller.
