Many plasmas of interest to the astrophysical and fusion communities are
weakly collisional. In such plasmas, small scales can develop in the
distribution of particle velocities, potentially affecting observable
quantities such as turbulent fluxes. Consequently, it is necessary to monitor
velocity space resolution in gyrokinetic simulations. In this paper, we present
a set of computationally efficient diagnostics for measuring velocity space
resolution in gyrokinetic simulations and apply them to a range of plasma
physics phenomena using the continuum gyrokinetic code GS2. For the cases
considered here, it is found that the use of a collisionality at or below
experimental values allows for the resolution of plasma dynamics with
relatively few velocity space grid points. Additionally, we describe
implementation of an adaptive collision frequency which can be used to improve
velocity space resolution in the collisionless regime, where results are
expected to be independent of collision frequency.
