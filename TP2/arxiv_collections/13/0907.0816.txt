We report spectroscopic observations of 23 candidates for Kepler
asteroseismic targets and 10 other stars in the Kepler field, carried out at
two observatories (see the footnote). For all these stars, we derive the radial
velocities, effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, the projected
rotational velocity, and estimate the MK type. HIP 97513 and HIP 92132 are
classified as suspected new single-lined spectroscopic binaries. For 28 stars,
the radial velocity is measured for the first time.
