A Chow test for structural breaks in the surface temperature series is used
to investigate two common claims about global warming. Quirk (2009) proposed
that the increase in Australian temperature from 1910 to the present was
largely confined to a regime-shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)
between 1976 and 1979. The test finds a step change in both Australian and
global temperature trends in 1978 (HadCRU3GL), and in Australian rainfall in
1982 with flat temperatures before and after. Easterling & Wehner (2009)
claimed that singling out the apparent flatness in global temperature since
1997 is 'cherry picking' to reinforce an arbitrary point of view. On the
contrary, we find evidence for a significant change in the temperature series
around 1997, corroborated with evidence of a coincident oceanographic
regime-shift. We use the trends between these significant change points to
generate a forecast of future global temperature under specific assumptions.
