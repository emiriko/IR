We present VIMOS integral field spectroscopic observations of the
ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) pair IRAS 19254-7245 (the Superantennae).
We resolve H alpha, [N II], [O I], and [S II] emission both spatially and
spectroscopically and separate the emission into multiple velocity components.
We identify spectral line emission characteristic of star formation associated
with both galaxies, broad spectral line emission from the nucleus of the
southern progenitor, and potential outflows with shock-excited spectral
features near both nuclei. We estimate that <~10% of the 24 micron flux density
originates from star formation, implying that most of the 24 micron emission
originates from the AGN in the southern nucleus. We also measure a gas
consumption time of ~1 Gyr, which is consistent with other measurements of
ULIRGs.
