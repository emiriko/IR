This chapter will focus on the multiobjective formulation of an optimization
problem and highlight the assets of a multiobjective Tabu implementation for
such problems. An illustration of a specific Multiobjective Tabu heuristic
(referred to as MO Tabu in the following) will be given for 2 particular
problems arising in wireless systems. The first problem addresses the planning
of access points for a WLAN network with some Quality of Service requirements
and the second one provides an evaluation mean to assess the performance
evaluation of a wireless sensor network. The chapter will begin with an
overview of multiobjective (MO) optimization featuring the definitions and
concepts of the domain (e.g. Dominance, Pareto front,...) and the main MO
search heuristics available so far. We will then emphasize on the definition of
a problem as a multiobjective optimization problem and illustrate it by the two
examples from the field of wireless networking. The next part will focus on MO
Tabu, a Tabu-inspired multiobjective heuristic and describe its assets compared
to other MO heuristics. The last part of the chapter will show the results
obtained with this MO Tabu strategy on the 2 wireless networks related
problems. Conclusion on the use of Tabu as a multiobjective heuristic will be
drawn based on the results presented so far.
