We present a method of automatic translation (French/English) of Complex
Lexical Units (CLU) for aiming at extracting a bilingual lexicon. Our modular
system is based on linguistic properties (compositionality, polysemy, etc.).
Different aspects of the multilingual Web are used to validate candidate
translations and collect new terms. We first build a French corpus of Web pages
to collect CLU. Three adapted processing stages are applied for each linguistic
property : compositional and non polysemous translations, compositional
polysemous translations and non compositional translations. Our evaluation on a
sample of CLU shows that our technique based on the Web can reach a very high
precision.
