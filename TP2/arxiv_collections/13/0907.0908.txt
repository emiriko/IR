Many significant results have been achieved in the fields of ghost imaging,
in which the beam splitter is an indispensable optical component. This paper
introduces a method to realize ghost imaging without beam splitter. And we
study this method experimentally and theoretically. Finally, we suggest that
our device can be applied to implement the ghost imaging when we use the Sun
light as the light source.
