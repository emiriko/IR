Shear viscosity measures the amount of internal friction in a simple fluid.
In kinetic theory shear viscosity is related to momentum transport by
quasi-particles, and the uncertainty relation implies that the ratio of shear
viscosity eta to entropy density s is bounded by a constant multiplied by
hbar/k_B, where hbar is Planck's constant and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. A
specific bound has been proposed on the basis of string theory. In a large
class of theories that can be studied using string theory methods the constant
is 1/(4\pi). Experiments at RHIC indicate that eta/s of the quark gluon plasma
is close to this prediction. We will refer to a fluid that saturates the string
theory bound as a perfect fluid. In this contribution we summarizes the
theoretical and experimental information on the fluidity of the main classes of
strongly interacting quantum fluids.
