The science of complexity is far from being fully understood and even its
foundations are not well established. On the other hand, during the last
decade, the random motion of particles or waves - the so-called diffusion - has
been known better. In this paper, we discuss how simple ideas of diffusion can
be used to deal with the description of most complex structure.
