We quantify noise-induced phase deviations of dispersion-managed solitons in
optical fiber communications and femtosecond lasers. We first develop a
perturbation theory for the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schrodinger equation
(DMNLSE) in order to compute the noise-induced mean and variance of the soliton
parameters. We then use the analytical results to guide importance-sampled
Monte-Carlo simulations of the noise-driven DMNLSE. Comparison of these results
with those from the original, un-averaged, governing equations confirm the
validity of the DMNLSE as a model for many dispersion-managed systems, and
quantify the increased robustness of dispersion-managed solitons with respect
to noise-induced phase jitter.
