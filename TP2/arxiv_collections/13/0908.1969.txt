We present the first simulation capable of resolving the structure of
neutrino clustering on Mpc scales. The method combines grid- and particle-based
methods and achieves very good accuracy on both small and large scales, while
keeping CPU consumption under control. Such simulations are not only ideal for
calculating the non-linear matter power spectrum but also particularly relevant
for studies of how neutrinos cluster in galaxy- or cluster-sized halos. We
perform the largest neutrino N-body simulation to date, effectively containing
10 different neutrino hot dark matter components with different thermal
properties.
