We incorporate chiral symmetry breaking in a soft-wall version of the AdS/QCD
model by using a modified dilaton profile and a quartic term in the bulk scalar
potential. This allows one to separate the dependence on spontaneous and
explicit chiral symmetry breaking. The resulting mass spectra in the scalar,
vector and axial-vector sectors compares favorably with the respective QCD
resonances.
