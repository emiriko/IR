New type of plasmonic nanoparticles - silver octopods that can be synthesized
with a variety of shapes - have been demonstrated to show versatile optical
response using the discrete dipole approximation. The octopods show a complex
behavior at optical (visible, IR) wavelengths, with three major resonances that
can be tuned up to a desired response that makes them especially attractive to
use in e.g. high-performance surface enhanced Raman (SERS) detectors. The
excited resonant modes strongly depend on the geometrical parameters of the
stars, while dependence on their orientation with respect to an incident
radiation is moderate, owing to cubic symmetry. The field "hot spots" are
formed with the local field enhancement up to 50 times compared to an incident
field. They are usually localized at the surface between the arms and may be
both "electric" and "magnetic". While the former are of primary importance for
SERS, the latter may be identified by trapping magnetic nanoparticles in their
vicinity. The results are in very good agreement with the data where available
and may be used as a type of a "shape spectroscopy" for the nanoparticles.
