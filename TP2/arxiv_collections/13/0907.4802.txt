The suppression of high-P_T particles in heavy ion collisions was one of the
key discoveries at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. This is usually
parameterized by the average rate of momentum-transfer squared to this
particle, qhat. Here we argue that measurements of identified particles at high
P_T can lead to complementary information about the medium. The leading
particle of a jet can change its identity through interactions with the medium.
Tracing such flavor conversions could allow us to constrain the mean free path.
Here we review the basic concepts of flavor conversions and discuss
applications to particle ratios and elliptic flow. We make a prediction that
strangeness is enhanced at high P_T at RHIC energies while its elliptic flow is
suppressed.
