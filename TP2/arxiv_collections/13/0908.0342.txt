Lee-Wick partners to the Standard Model Higgs doublet may appear at a mass
scale that is significantly lower than that of the remaining Lee-Wick partner
states. The relevant effective theory is a two-Higgs doublet model in which one
doublet has wrong-sign kinetic and mass terms. We determine bounds on this
effective theory, including those from neutral B-meson mixing, b --> X_s gamma,
and Z --> b b-bar. The results differ from those of conventional two-Higgs
doublet models and lead to meaningful constraints on the Lee-Wick Higgs sector.
