The ternary commutator or ternutator, defined as the alternating sum of the
product of three operators, has recently drawn much attention as an interesting
structure generalising the commutator. The ternutator satisfies cubic
identities analogous to the quadratic Jacobi identity for the commutator. We
present various forms of these identities and discuss the possibility of using
them to define ternary algebras.
