Non-commutativity of the Einstein velocity addition, in case of non-collinear
velocities, seemingly gives rise to a conflict with reciprocity principle.
However, Thomas rotation comes at a rescue and the paradox is avoided. It is
shown that such a resolution of the so called Mocanu paradox is completely
natural from the point of view of basic premises of special relativity.
