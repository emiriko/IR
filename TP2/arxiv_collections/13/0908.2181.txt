We investigate the computational power and unified resource use of hybrid
quantum-classical computations, such as teleportation and measurement-based
computing. We introduce a physically causal and local graphical calculus for
quantum information theory, which enables high-level intuitive reasoning about
quantum information processes. The graphical calculus defines a local
information flow in a computation which satisfies conditions for physical
causality. We show how quantum and classical processing units can now be
formally integrated, and give an analysis of the joint resources used in a
typical measurement-based computation. Finally, we discuss how this picture may
be used to give a high-level unified model for hybrid quantum computing.
