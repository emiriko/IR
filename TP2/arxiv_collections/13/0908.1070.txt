We use microwave excitation to elucidate the dynamics of long superconductor
/ normal metal / superconductor Josephson junctions. By varying the excitation
frequency in the range 10 MHz - 40 GHz, we observe that the critical and
retrapping currents, deduced from the dc voltage vs. dc current characteristics
of the junction, are set by two different time scales. The critical current
increases when the ac frequency is larger than the inverse diffusion time in
the normal metal, whereas the retrapping current is strongly modified when the
excitation frequency is above the electron-phonon rate in the normal metal.
Therefore the critical and retrapping currents are associated with elastic and
inelastic scattering, respectively.
