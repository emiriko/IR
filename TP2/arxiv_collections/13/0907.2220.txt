We observed (22) Kalliope and its companion Linus with the integral-field
spectrograph OSIRIS, which is coupled to the adaptive optics system at the W.M.
Keck II telescope on March 25 2008. We present, for the first time,
component-resolved spectra acquired simultaneously in each of the Zbb (1-1.18
um), Jbb (1.18-1.42 um), Hbb (1.47-1.80 um), and Kbb (1.97-2.38 um) bands. The
spectra of the two bodies are remarkably similar and imply that both bodies
were formed at the same time from the same material; such as via incomplete
re-accretion after a major impact on the precursor body.
