We propose a novel approach for analysing time series using complex network
theory. We identify the recurrence matrix calculated from time series with the
adjacency matrix of a complex network, and apply measures for the
characterisation of complex networks to this recurrence matrix. By using the
logistic map, we illustrate the potentials of these complex network measures
for detecting dynamical transitions. Finally we apply the proposed approach to
a marine palaeo-climate record and identify subtle changes of the climate
regime.
