We examine the magnetic properties of the localized states induced by lattice
vacancies in bilayer graphene with an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation. We
show that with realistic values of the parameters and for experimentally
accessible gate voltages we can have a magnetic switching between an
unpolarized and a fully polarized system.
