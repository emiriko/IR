The hierarchy problem can be addressed by extending the four-dimensional
space-time to include an extra compact spatial dimension with non-trivial
"warped" metric, as first suggested by Randall and Sundrum. If the
Randall-Sundrum framework is realized in string theory, the effective value of
the string scale in the vicinity of the infrared boundary should be in the TeV
domain. The most attractive models of this type embed the Standard Model
particles as zero-modes of five-dimensional fields. In such models, Regge
excitations of the Standard Model states should appear around the TeV scale. We
construct a toy model that describes tensor (spin-2) excitations of the
Standard Model gauge bosons, and their on-shell couplings with light matter and
gauge fields, within this framework. We use this toy model to predict the
phenomenologically important features of the tensor Regge gluon, such as its
mass, production cross section at the LHC, and decay patterns.
