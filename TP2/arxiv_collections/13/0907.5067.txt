A new 3DAP reconstruction procedure is proposed that accounts for the
evaporation field of a secondary phase. It applies the existing cluster
selection software to identify the atoms of the second phase and, subsequently,
an iterative algorithm to homogenise the volume laterally. This Procedure,
easily implementable on existing reconstruction software, has been applied
successfully on simulated and real 3DAP analyses.
