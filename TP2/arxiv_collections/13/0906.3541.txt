We have investigated the antiferromagnetic insulating phase of the
Mott-Hubbard insulator V$_2$O$_3$ by resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction at the
vanadium K-edge. Combining the information obtained from azimuthal angle scans,
linear incoming polarization scans and by fitting collected data to the
scattering amplitude derived from the established chemical I2/a and magnetic
space groups we provide evidence of the ordering motif of anapolar moments
(which results from parity violation coupling to an electromagnetic field).
Experimental data (azimuthal dependence and polarization analysis) collected at
space-group forbidden Bragg reflections are successfully accounted within our
model in terms of vanadium magnetoelectric multipoles. We demonstrate that
resonant x-ray diffraction intensities in all space-group forbidden Bragg
reflections of the kind $(hkl)_m$ with odd $h$ are produced by an E1-E2 event.
The determined tensorial parameters offer a test for ab-initio calculations in
this material, that can lead to a deeper and more quantitative understanding of
the physical properties of V$_2$O$_3$.
