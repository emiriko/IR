The air-shower observatory Milagro has detected a large-scale anisotropy of
unknown origin in the flux of TeV cosmic rays. We propose that this anisotropy
is caused by galactic magnetic fields, in particular, that it results from the
combined effects of the regular and the turbulent (fluctuating) magnetic fields
in our vicinity. Instead of a diffusion equation, we integrate Boltzmann's
equation to show that the turbulence may define a preferred direction in the
cosmic-ray propagation that is orthogonal to the local regular magnetic field.
The approximate dipole anisotropy that we obtain explains well Milagro's data.
