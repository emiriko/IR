The total electronic Raman scattering spectrum, including the nonresonant,
mixed and resonant components, is determined for the charge-density-wave (CDW)
phase of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model at half filling within dynamical
mean-field theory. Its frequency dependence is investigated for different
values of the energy of the incident photons. The spectra reflect the different
structures in the density of states and how they are modified by screening and
resonance effects. The calculations are performed for the $B_{\rm 1g}$, $B_{\rm
2g}$ and $A_{\rm 1g}$ symmetries (which are typically examined in experiment).
Our results for the resonance effects of the Raman spectra, found by tuning the
energy of the incident photons, give information about the many-body charge
dynamics of the CDW-ordered phase.
