We study the radiative and semileptonic B decays involving a spin-$J$
resonant $K_J^{(*)}$ with parity $(-1)^J$ for $K_J^*$ and $(-1)^{J+1}$ for
$K_J$ in the final state. Using the large energy effective theory (LEET)
techniques, we formulate $B \to K_J^{(*)}$ transition form factors in the large
recoil region in terms of two independent LEET functions
$\zeta_\perp^{K_J^{(*)}}$ and $\zeta_\parallel^{K_J^{(*)}}$, the values of
which at zero momentum transfer are estimated in the BSW model. According to
the QCD counting rules, $\zeta_{\perp,\parallel}^{K_J^{(*)}}$ exhibit a dipole
dependence in $q^2$. We predict the decay rates for $B \to K_J^{(*)} \gamma$,
$B \to K_J^{(*)} \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B \to K_J^{(*)}\nu \bar{\nu}$. The
branching fractions for these decays with higher $K$-resonances in the final
state are suppressed due to the smaller phase spaces and the smaller values of
$\zeta^{K_J^{(*)}}_{\perp,\parallel}$. Furthermore, if the spin of $K_J^{(*)}$
becomes larger, the branching fractions will be further suppressed due to the
smaller Clebsch-Gordan coefficients defined by the polarization tensors of the
$K_J^{(*)}$. We also calculate the forward backward asymmetry of the $B \to
K_J^{(*)} \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay, for which the zero is highly insensitive to the
$K$-resonances in the LEET parametrization.
