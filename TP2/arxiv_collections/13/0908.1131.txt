We examine signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of Kaluza-Klein modes,
in volume-truncated "Little Randall-Sundrum" (LRS) models of flavor,
characterized by 5D cutoff scales M_5 that are small compared to the 4D Planck
mass M_P ~ 10^{19} GeV. In particular, for the phenomenologically viable choice
M_5 ~ 10^4 TeV, the discovery of a 2 (3)-TeV "Little" Z' at the LHC requires
about 1 (4) 1/fb at \sqrt{s}=10 (14) TeV, in the clean di-lepton channel. Our
results highlight the possibility of probing interesting values of M_5,
starting with the early LHC data. With M_5 ~ 10^4 TeV, discovering the second
KK mode Z'', at about 4.3 TeV, requires O(100) 1/fb at \sqrt{s}=14 TeV,
providing a probe of the warped nature of the bulk that is encoded in the mass
ratio of the first two KK modes, at design luminosity. By comparison,
discovering a 3-TeV Z' of the Planck-weak hierarchy models (with M_5 ~ M_P), in
any channel, would require upwards of O(300) 1/fb at \sqrt{s}=14 TeV. We also
point out that discovery prospects markedly improve for Little KK gluons as
well, but the challenging reconstruction of their t tbar decay products may not
allow an appreciable advantage for early discovery, over the Little Z' case.
