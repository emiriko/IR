Based on symmetry principles, we derive a fusion algebra generated from
repeated fusions of the irreducible modules appearing in the W-extended
logarithmic minimal model WLM(p,p'). In addition to the irreducible modules
themselves, closure of the commutative and associative fusion algebra requires
the participation of a variety of reducible yet indecomposable modules. We
conjecture that this fusion algebra is the same as the one obtained by
application of the Nahm-Gaberdiel-Kausch algorithm and find that it reproduces
the known such results for WLM(1,p') and WLM(2,3). For p>1, this fusion algebra
does not contain a unit. Requiring that the spectrum of modules is invariant
under a natural notion of conjugation, however, introduces an additional
(p-1)(p'-1) reducible yet indecomposable rank-1 modules, among which the
identity is found, still yielding a well-defined fusion algebra. In this
greater fusion algebra, the aforementioned symmetries are generated by fusions
with the three irreducible modules of conformal weights Delta_{kp-1,1},
k=1,2,3. We also identify polynomial fusion rings associated with our fusion
algebras.
