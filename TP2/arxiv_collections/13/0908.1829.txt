Interference of a single photon generated from a single quantum dot is
observed between two photon polarization modes. Each emitted single photon has
two orthogonal polarization modes associated with the solid-state single photon
source, in which two non-degenerate neutral exciton states are involved. The
interference between the two modes takes place only under the condition that
the emitted photon is free from which-mode information.
