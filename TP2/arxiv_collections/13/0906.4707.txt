We show that the observed non-monotonic behavior of the thermal conductance
between two nanoparticles when they are brought into contact is originated by
an intricate phase space dynamics. Here it is assumed that this dynamics
results from the thermally activated jumping through a rough energy landscape.
A hierarchy of relaxation times plays the key role in the description of this
complex phase space behaviour. Our theory enables us to analyze the heat
transfer just before and at the moment of contact.
