We present a new solution for the dispersive element in astronomical
spectrographs, which in many cases can provide an upgrade path to enhance the
spectral resolution of existing moderate-resolution reflection-grating
spectrographs. We demonstrate that in the case of LRIS-R at the Keck 1
Telescope a spectral resolution of 18,000 can be achieved with reasonable
throughput under good seeing conditions.
