New ZEUS data are added into the NLO QCD analysis of the ZEUS-JETS PDF fit.
The addition of high-$Q^2$ NC and CC $e^-p$ inclusive cross-section data
improves the determination of the $u$-valence quark at high $x$. The addition
of high-$Q^2$ CC $e^+p$ inclusive cross-section data improves the determination
of the $d$-valence quark at high $x$. The addition of lower-$Q^2$ NC $e^+p$
inclusive cross-section data, run at three different proton beam energies,
improves the determination of the sea and gluon PDFs at small $x$. The new PDF
fit is called the ZEUS09 PDF fit.
