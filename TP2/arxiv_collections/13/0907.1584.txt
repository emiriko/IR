We report on the creation of three-vortex clusters in a $^{87}Rb$
Bose-Einstein condensate by oscillatory excitation of the condensate. This
procedure can create vortices of both circulation, so that we are able to
create several types of vortex clusters using the same mechanism. The
three-vortex configurations are dominated by two types, namely, an
equilateral-triangle arrangement and a linear arrangement. We interpret these
most stable configurations respectively as three vortices with the same
circulation, and as a vortex-antivortex-vortex cluster. The linear
configurations are very likely the first experimental signatures of predicted
stationary vortex clusters.
