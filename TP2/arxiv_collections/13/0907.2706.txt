The partial decay widths of positive parity baryons belonging to 56-plets of
SU(6) are analyzed in the framework of the 1/Nc expansion. The channels
considered are those with emission of a single pion, K or K-bar mesons, and the
analysis is carried out to subleading order in 1/Nc and to first order in SU(3)
symmetry breaking. The results for the multiplet [56,0+], to which the Roper
resonance belongs, indicate a poor description at leading order, requiring
important next to leading order corrections. For the multiplet [56,2+], the
P-wave decays in the non-strange sector are well described at leading order,
while the F-wave decays require the next to leading order corrections, which
turn out to be of natural magnitude. SU(3) breaking effects are poorly
determined, because only few decays with K meson in final state are
established, and their widths are not known with sufficient accuracy.
