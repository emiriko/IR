The phase shift a neutron interferometer caused by the gravitational field
and the rotation of the earth is derived in a unified way from the standpoint
of general relativity. General relativistic quantum interference effects in the
slowly rotating braneworld as the Sagnac effect and phase shift effect of
interfering particle in neutron interferometer are considered. It was found
that in the case of the Sagnac effect the influence of brane parameter is
becoming important due to the fact that the angular velocity of the locally non
rotating observer must be larger than one in the Kerr space-time. In the case
of neutron interferometry it is found that due to the presence of the parameter
$Q^{*}$ an additional term in the phase shift of interfering particle emerges
from the results of the recent experiments we have obtained upper limit for the
tidal charge as $Q^{*}\lesssim 10^{7} \rm{cm}^{2}$. Finally, as an example, we
apply the obtained results to the calculation of the (ultra-cold neutrons)
energy level modification in the braneworld.
