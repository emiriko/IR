We found a finite temperature glass transition in the absence of quenched
disorder in frustrated Josephson junction arrays (JJA) on a square lattice with
anisotropic Josephson couplings by numerical simulations. The vortexes develop
zigzag stripes into the direction of weaker coupling at low temperatures. The
whole amorphous vortex solid can flow smoothly into the direction of stronger
coupling by non-trivial soft modes. As the result the macroscopic phase
coherence is destroyed being reminiscent of vortex flow in pure bulk
superconductors or spin-chirality decoupling in frustrated magnets. On the
contrary such soft-modes are absent into the direction of weaker coupling.
Consequently the system behaves as a Ohmic (unjammed) liquid or superconducting
(jammed) solid with respect to injection of external electric current, i. e.
shear, along different directions. This jamming-glass transition can be
regarded as a two dimensional realization of the Aubry's transition.
