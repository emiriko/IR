We report magnetic penetration depth and thermal conductivity data for
high-quality single crystals of BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ ($T_c=30$\,K)
which provide strong evidence that this material has line nodes in its energy
gap. This is distinctly different from the nodeless gap found for
(Ba,K)Fe$_2$As$_2$ which has similar $T_c$ and phase diagram. Our results
indicate that repulsive electronic interactions play an essential role for
Fe-based high-$T_c$ superconductivity but that uniquely there are distinctly
different pairing states, with and without nodes, which have comparable $T_c$.
