Prescriptions for numerical self-force calculations have traditionally been
designed for frequency-domain or (1+1) time-domain codes which employ a mode
decomposition to facilitate in carrying out a delicate regularization scheme.
This has prevented self-force analyses from benefiting from the powerful suite
of tools developed and used by numerical relativists for simulations of the
evolution of comparable-mass black hole binaries. In this work, we revisit a
previously-introduced (3+1) method for self-force calculations, and demonstrate
its viability by applying it to the test case of a scalar charge moving in a
circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Two (3+1) codes originally
developed for numerical relativity applications were independently employed,
and in each we were able to compute the two independent components of the
self-force and the energy flux correctly to within $< 1%$. We also demonstrate
consistency between $t$-component of the self-force and the scalar energy flux.
Our results constitute the first successful calculation of a self-force in a
(3+1) framework, and thus open opportunities for the numerical relativity
community in self-force analyses and the perturbative modeling of
extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.
