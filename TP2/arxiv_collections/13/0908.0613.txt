The convergence to the self-consistency in the dynamical-mean-field-theory
(DMFT) calculations for models of correlated electron systems can be
significantly accelerated by using an appropriate mixing of hybridization
functions which are used as the input to the impurity solver. It is shown that
the techniques and the past experience with the mixing of input charge
densities in the density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations are also
effective in DMFT. As an example, the increase of the computational
requirements near the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model due
to critical slowing down can be strongly reduced by using the modified
Broyden's method to numerically solve the non-linear self-consistency equation.
Speed-up factors as high as 3 were observed in practical calculations even for
this relatively well behaved problem. Furthermore, the convergence can be
achieved in difficult cases where simple linear mixing is either not effective
or even leads to divergence. Unstable and metastable solutions can also be
obtained. We also determine the linear response of the system with respect to
the variations of the hybridization function, which is related to the
propagation of the information between the different energy scales during the
iteration.
