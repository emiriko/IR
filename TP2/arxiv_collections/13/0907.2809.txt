Recently, two-dimensional (2D) periodically L and C loaded transmission-line
(TL) networks have been applied to represent metamaterials. The commercial
Agilent's Advanced Design System (ADS) is a commonly-used tool to simulate the
TL metamaterials. However, it takes a lot of time to set up the TL network and
perform numerical simulations using ADS, making the metamaterial analysis
inefficient, especially for large-scale TL networks. In this paper, we propose
transmission-matrix method (TMM) to simulate and analyze the TL-network
metamaterials efficiently. Compared to the ADS commercial software, TMM
provides nearly the same simulation results for the same networks. However, the
model-process and simulation time has been greatly reduced. The proposed TMM
can serve as an efficient tool to study the TL-network metamaterials.
