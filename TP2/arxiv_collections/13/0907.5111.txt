We investigate the state size of DFAs accepting the shuffle of two words. We
provide words u and v, such that the minimal DFA for u shuffled with v requires
an exponential number of states. We also show some conditions for the words u
and v which ensure a quadratic upper bound on the state size of u shuffled with
v. Moreover, switching only two letters within one of u or v is enough to
trigger the change from quadratic to exponential.
