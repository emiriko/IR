The existence of bright solitons in the model of the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas
with dipole-dipole (DD) interactions is reported. The governing equation is
taken as the quintic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with the
nonlocal cubic term accounting for the DD attraction. In different regions of
the parameter space (the dipole moment and atom number), matter-wave solitons
feature flat-top or compacton-like shapes. For the flat-top states, the NLSE
with the local cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is shown to be a good
approximation. Specific dynamical effects are studied assuming that the
strength of the DD interactions is ramped up or drops to zero. Generation of
dark-soliton pairs in the gas shrinking under the action of the intensifying DD
attraction is observed. Dark solitons exhibit the particle-like collision
behavior. Peculiarities of dipole solitons in the TG gas are highlighted by
comparison with the NLSE including the local CQ terms. Collisions between the
solitons are studied too. In many cases, the collisions result in merger of the
solitons into a breather, due to strong attraction between them.
