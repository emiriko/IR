By studying laser systems with multiple time delays, we demonstrate that the
signatures of time delays in the autocorrelation coefficient and the mutual
information of the laser output can be erased for systems with variable time
delays. This property makes such laser systems highly suitable for secure
chaos-based communication systems. We also present the first report on chaos
synchronization in both unidirectionally and bidirectionally coupled variable
multiple time delay laser diodes with electro-optical feedbacks.
