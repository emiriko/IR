We investigate the ground-state properties of the Anderson single impurity
model (finite Coulomb impurity repulsion) with the Coupled Cluster Method. We
consider different CCM reference states and approximation schemes and make
comparison with exact Green's function results for the non-interacting model
and with Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory for the full interacting model.
Our results show that coupled cluster techniques are well suited to quantum
impurity problems.
