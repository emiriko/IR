We investigate the propagation of wave-packets on graphene in a perpendicular
magnetic field and the appearance of collapses and revivals in the
time-evolution of an initially localised wave-packet. The wave-packet evolution
in graphene differs drastically from the one in an electron gas and shows a
rich revival structure similar to the dynamics of highly excited Rydberg
states.
  We present a novel numerical wave-packet propagation scheme in order to solve
the effective single-particle Dirac-Hamiltonian of graphene and show how the
collapse and revival dynamics is affected by the presence of disorder. Our
effective numerical method is of general interest for the solution of the Dirac
equation in the presence of potentials and magnetic fields.
