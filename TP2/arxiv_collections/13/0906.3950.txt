Distinctive patterns are predicted by quenched quark models and unquenched
quark models for the lowest SU(3) baryon nonet with spin parity $J^P=1/2^-$.
While the quenched quark models predict the lowest $1/2^-$ $\Sigma^*$ resonance
to be above 1600 MeV, the unquenched quark models predict it to be around
$\Sigma^*(1385)$ energy. Here we re-examine some old data of the $\kp \to \la$
reaction and find that besides the well established $\Sigma^{*}(1385)$ with
$J^P=3/2^+$, there is indeed some evidence for the possible existence of a new
$\Sigma^{*}$ resonance with $J^P=1/2^-$ around the same mass but with broader
decay width. Higher statistic data on relevant reactions are needed to clarify
the situation.
