Recent experiments measuring the electrical conductivity of DNA molecules
highlight the need for a theoretical model of ion transport along a charged
surface. Here we present a simple theory based on the idea of unbinding of ion
pairs. The strong humidity dependence of conductivity is explained by the
decrease in the electrostatic self-energy of a separated pair when a layer of
water (with high dielectric constant) is adsorbed to the surface. We compare
our prediction for conductivity to experiment, and discuss the limits of its
applicability.
