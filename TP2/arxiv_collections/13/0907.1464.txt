Despite great technological importance and many investigations, a material
with measured hardness comparable to that of diamond or cubic boron nitride has
yet to be identified. Combined theoretical and experimental investigations led
to the discovery of a new polymorph of titanium dioxide with titanium
nine-coordinated to oxygen in the cotunnite (PbCl2) structure. Hardness
measurements on the cotunnite-structured TiO2 synthesized at pressures above 60
GPa and temperatures above 1000 K reveal that this material is the hardest
oxide yet discovered. Furthermore, it is one of the least compressible (with a
measured bulk modulus of 431 GPa) and hardest (with a microhardness of 38 GPa)
polycrystalline materials studied thus far.
