The tendencies described in this work were revealed in the course of
examination of adenine and uracil distribution in the mRNA encoding sequence.
The study also discusses the usage of codons occupied by the amino acid
arginine in the table of the universal genetic code. All of the described
tendencies are qualitative, so neither sophisticated methods nor cumbersome
calculations are necessary to reveal and interpret them.
