Multideterminant calculations have been performed on model systems to
emphasize the role of many-body effects in the general description of charge
quantization experiments. We show numerically and derive analytically that a
closed-shell ansatz, the usual ingredient of mean-field methods, does not
properly describe the step-like electron transfer characteristic in weakly
coupled systems. With the multideterminant results as a benchmark, we have
evaluated the performance of common ab initio mean field techniques, such as
Hartree Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) with local and hybrid
exchange correlation functionals, with a special focus on spin-polarization
effects. For HF and hybrid DFT, a qualitatively correct open-shell solution
with distinct steps in the electron transfer behaviour can be obtained with a
spin-unrestricted (i.e., spin-polarized) ansatz though this solution differs
quantitatively from the multideterminant reference. We also discuss the
relationship between the electronic eigenvalue gap and the onset of charge
transfer for both HF and DFT and relate our findings to recently proposed
practical schemes for calculating the addition energies in the Coulomb blockade
regime for single molecule junctions from closed-shell DFT within the local
density approximation.
