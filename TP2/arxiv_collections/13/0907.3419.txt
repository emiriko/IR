I discuss some of the main interpretations given to explain the
indeterministic nature of quantum measurements and show that all has some
loopholes in one corner or another. I propose an alternative interpretation
based on the notion of continued re-creation of the physical properties. The
rate at which the system is re-created is a measure of the determinism of the
measurements. The existence of uncertainties is better explained through this
view, the meaning of incompatible observables becomes clearer and with the
notion of re-creation and the origin of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
becomes more vivid.
