We use the functional renormalization group approach with partial
bosonization in the particle-particle channel to study the effect of order
parameter fluctuations on the BCS-BEC crossover of superfluid fermions in three
dimensions. Our approach is based on a new truncation of the vertex expansion
where the renormalization group flow of bosonic two-point functions is closed
by means of Dyson-Schwinger equations and the superfluid order parameter is
related to the single particle gap via a Ward identity. We explicitly calculate
the chemical potential, the single-particle gap, and the superfluid order
parameter at the unitary point and compare our results with experiments and
previous calculations.
