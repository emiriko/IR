We present a technique to determine the orbital and physical parameters of
eclipsing eccentric Wolf-Rayet + O-star binaries, where one eclipse is produced
by the absorption of the O-star light by the stellar wind of the W-R star. Our
method is based on the use of the empirical moments of the light curve that are
integral transforms evaluated from the observed light curves. The optical depth
along the line of sight and the limb darkening of the W-R star are modelled by
simple mathematical functions, and we derive analytical expressions for the
moments of the light curve as a function of the orbital parameters and the key
parameters of the transparency and limb-darkening functions. These analytical
expressions are then inverted in order to derive the values of the orbital
inclination, the stellar radii, the fractional luminosities, and the parameters
of the wind transparency and limb-darkening laws. The method is applied to the
SMC W-R eclipsing binary HD 5980, a remarkable object that underwent an
LBV-like event in August 1994. The analysis refers to the pre-outburst
observational data. A synthetic light curve based on the elements derived for
the system allows a quality assessment of the results obtained.
