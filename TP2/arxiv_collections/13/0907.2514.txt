In this paper, we use the time super-operator formalism in the 2-level
Friedrichs model \cite{fried} to obtain a phenomenological model of mesons
decay. Our approach provides a fairly good estimation of the CP symmetry
violation parameter in the case of K, B and D mesons. We also propose a crucial
test aimed at discriminating between the standard approach and the time
super-operator approach developed throughout the paper.
