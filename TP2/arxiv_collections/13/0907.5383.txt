We study the competition between Kondo physics and dissipation within an
Anderson model of a magnetic impurity level that hybridizes with a metallic
host and is also coupled, via the impurity charge, to the displacement of a
bosonic bath having a spectral density proportional to \omega^s. As the
impurity-bath coupling increases from zero, the effective Coulomb interaction
between two electrons in the impurity level is progressively renormalized from
its repulsive bare value until it eventually becomes attractive. For weak
hybridization, this renormalization in turn produces a crossover from a
conventional, spin-sector Kondo effect to a charge Kondo effect. At
particle-hole symmetry, and for sub-Ohmic bath exponents 0 < s < 1, further
increase of the impurity-bath coupling results in a continuous,
zero-temperature transition to a broken-symmetry phase in which the
ground-state impurity occupancy \n_d acquires an expectation value <\n_d>_0 \ne
1. The response of the impurity occupancy to a locally applied electric
potential features the hyperscaling of critical exponents and \omega/T scaling
that are expected at an interacting critical point. The numerical values of the
critical exponents suggest that the transition lies in the same universality
class as that of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model. For the Ohmic case s = 1, the
transition is instead of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Away from particle-hole
symmetry, the quantum phase transition is replaced by a smooth crossover, but
signatures of the symmetric quantum critical point remain in the physical
properties at elevated temperatures and/or frequencies.
