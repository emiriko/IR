One of the benchmark processes for the optimisation of the detector concepts
proposed for the International Linear Collider is Chargino and Neutralino pair
production in an mSugra scenario where Chargino-1 and Neutralino-2 are mass
degenerate and decay into W+Neutralino-1 and Z+Neutralino-1, respectively. In
this case the separation of both processes in the fully hadronic decay mode is
very sensitive to the jet energy resolution and thus to the particle flow
performance. The mass resolutions and cross-section uncertainties achievable
with the ILD detector concept are studied in full simulation at a center of
mass energy of 500 GeV, an integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 and beam
polarisations of P(e+,e-) = (30%, -80%). For the Chargino-1 and Neutralino-2
pair production cross-sections, statistical precisions of 0.84% and 2.75% are
achieved, respectively. The masses of Chargino-1, Neutralino-2 and Neutralino-1
can be determined with a statistical precision of 2.9 GeV, 1.7 GeV and 1.0 GeV,
respectively.
