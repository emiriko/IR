Based on Newton's laws reformulated in the Hamiltonian dynamics combined with
statistical mechanics, we formulate a statistical mechanical theory supporting
the hypothesis of a closed oscillating universe. We find that the behaviour of
the universe as a whole can be represented by a free entropic oscillator whose
lifespan is nonhomogeneous, thus implying that time is shorter or longer
according to the state of the universe itself given through its entropy. We
conclude that time reduces to the entropy production of the universe and that a
nonzero entropy production means that local fluctuations could exist giving
rise to the appearance of masses and to the curvature of the space.
