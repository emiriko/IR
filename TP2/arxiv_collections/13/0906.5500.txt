Time-dependent close-coupling calculations of the ionization and excitation
cross section for antiproton collisions with molecular hydrogen ions are
performed in an impact-energy range from 0.5 keV to 10 MeV. The
Born-Oppenheimer and Franck-Condon approximations as well as the impact
parameter method are applied in order to describe the target molecule and the
collision process. It is shown that three perpendicular orientations of the
molecular axis with respect to the trajectory are sufficient to accurately
reproduce the ionization cross section calculated by [Sakimoto, Phys. Rev. A
71, 062704 (2005)] reducing the numerical effort drastically. The
independent-event model is employed to approximate the cross section for double
ionization and H+ production in antiproton collisions with H2.
