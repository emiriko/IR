Digital logic forms the functional basics of most modern electronic equipment
and as such the creation of novel digital logic circuits is an active area of
computer engineering research. This study demonstrates that genetic algorithms
can be used to evolve functionally useful sets of logic gate interconnections
to create useful digital logic circuits. The efficacy of this approach is
illustrated via the evolution of AND, OR, XOR, NOR, and XNOR functionality from
sets of NAND gates, thereby illustrating that evolutionary methods have the
potential be applied to the design of digital electronics.
