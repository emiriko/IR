It is shown that, if inclusive lepton scattering off nuclei at high momentum
transfer is analyzed in terms of proper scaling variables, useful information
on Nucleon-Nucleon short range correlations in nuclei can be obtained. The
traditional approach to Y-scaling is critically analyzed and a novel approach
to Y-scaling, which incorporates the effects from two- and three-nucleon
correlations in nuclei, is illustrated.
