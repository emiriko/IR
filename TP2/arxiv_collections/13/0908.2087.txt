For the family of model soft Coulomb potentials represented by V(r) =
-\frac{Z}{(r^q+\beta^q)^{\frac{1}{q}}}, with the parameters
  Z>0, \beta>0, q \ge 1, it is shown analytically that the potentials and
eigenvalues, E_{\nu\ell}, are monotonic in each parameter. The potential
envelope method is applied to obtain approximate analytic estimates in terms of
the known exact spectra for pure power potentials. For the case q =1, the
Asymptotic Iteration Method is used to find exact analytic results for the
eigenvalues E_{\nu\ell} and corresponding wave functions, expressed in terms of
Z and \beta. A proof is presented establishing the general concavity of the
scaled electron density near the nucleus resulting from the truncated
potentials for all q. Based on an analysis of extensive numerical calculations,
it is conjectured that the crossing between the pair of states
[(\nu,\ell),(\nu',\ell')], is given by the condition \nu'\geq (\nu+1) and \ell'
\geq (\ell+3). The significance of these results for the interaction of an
intense laser field with an atom is pointed out. Differences in the observed
level-crossing effects between the soft potentials and the hydrogen atom
confined inside an impenetrable sphere are discussed.
