A quantum analogue of the famous Blackwell Theorem in classical statistics
has recently been proposed. Given two quantum channels A and B, a set of payoff
functions have been proven to have values for B at least as high as they are
for A if and only if there exists a quantum garbling channel E such that A=EB.
When such a channel E exists, we can globally compare A and B in terms of their
`noisiness'. We show that this method of channel noise comparison is equivalent
to one obtained by considering the degradation of the distinguishability of
states. Here, the channel A is said to be at least as noisy as the channel B if
any ensemble of states, fed into each channel and possibly entangled with
ancillae, emerges no more distinguishable from A than it does from channel B,
where distinguishability is quantified by the minimum error discrimination
probability. We also provide a novel application to eavesdropper detection in
quantum cryptography.
