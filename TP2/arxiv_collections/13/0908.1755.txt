We study non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the presence of a minimal length.
In particular we obtain exact solutions of a non-Hermitian displaced harmonic
oscillator and the Swanson model with minimal length uncertainty. The spectrum
in both the cases are found to be real. It is also shown that the models are
$\eta$ pseudo-Hermitian and the metric operator is found explicitly in both the
cases.
