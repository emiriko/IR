We elucidate the role of time scales that determine heavy quark dynamics in
the QGP. Quark-antiquark potentials extracted from the lattice are used to
demonstrate the existence of open heavy flavor bound-state solutions in the
vicinity of the critical temperature, and their light cone wavefunctions are
obtained. We use these wavefunctions to calculate the in-medium modification of
the heavy quark distribution and decay probabilities. For the case of high
transverse momentum D or B mesons traversing the QGP, we combine the new meson
formation and dissociation mechanism with the traditional parton-level charm
and beauty quark quenching to obtain predictions for the heavy meson and
non-photonic electron suppression in Cu+Cu and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the
LHC, respectively.
