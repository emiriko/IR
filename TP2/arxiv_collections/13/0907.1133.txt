We obtain the renormalization group(RG) functions for the massless scalar
field theory where symmetry breaking occurs radiatively. After obtaining the
effective potential for the radiative symmetry breaking scheme from that of the
minimal subtraction(MS) scheme by finite transformations for the classical
field and coupling constant, we calculate the corresponding change of the RG
functions.
