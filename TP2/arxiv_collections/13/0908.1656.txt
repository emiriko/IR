It is shown that the superconducting intermetallic compound MgB2 possesses a
narrow, partly filled "superconducting band" with Wannier functions of special
symmetry in its band structure. This result corroborates previous observations
about the band structures of numerous superconductors and non-superconductors
showing that evidently superconductivity is always connected with such
superconducting bands. These findings are interpreted in the framework of a
nonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model. Within this new
group-theoretical model of correlated systems, Cooper pairs are stabilized by a
nonadiabatic mechanism of constraining forces effective in narrow
superconducting bands. The formation of Cooper pairs in a superconducting band
is mediated by the energetically lowest boson excitations in the considered
material that carry the crystal spin-angular momentum 1 x h-bar. These
crystal-spin-1 bosons are proposed to determine whether the material is a
conventional low-Tc or a high-Tc superconductor. This interpretation provides
the electron-phonon mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional
superconductors.
