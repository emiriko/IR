One of the problems of producing spectrographs for Extremely Large Telescopes
(ELTs) is that the beam size is required to scale with telescope aperture if
all other parameters are held constant, leading to enormous size and implied
cost. This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the
diffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are
not initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of
the instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples.
In this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the
effective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger
detectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By
the means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated
using existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for
ELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the
reference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the
predictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The
model predicts major cost savings (2 - 100x) by slicing with factors of 5-20
depending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is
better to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph
rather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel
architecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to
integral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved...
