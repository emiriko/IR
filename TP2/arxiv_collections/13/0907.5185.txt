Gauge fixing in the non-perturbative domain of non-Abelian gauge theories is
obstructed by the Gribov-Singer ambiguity. To compare results from different
methods it is necessary to resolve this ambiguity explicitly. Such a resolution
is proposed using conditions on correlation functions for a family of
non-perturbative Landau gauges. As a consequence, the various results available
for correlation functions could possibly correspond to different
non-perturbative Landau gauges, discriminated by an additional non-perturbative
gauge parameter. The proposal, the necessary assumptions, and evidence from
lattice gauge theory calculations, are presented in detail.
