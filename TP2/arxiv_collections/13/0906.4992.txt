This paper explores the consequences of denying the "emptiness of paths not
taken," EPNT, premise of Bernstein, Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (BGHZ) in
their paper titled, Bell theorem without inequalities.[ ] Carrying out the
negation of EPNT leads to the concept of a "shadow stream." Streams are
essentially particle implementations of the paths in Feynman path-integrals,
resulting in a simple and consistent extension of the standard axioms for
quantum mechanics. The construct provides elegant resolutions of single- and
multi-particle interference paradoxes. Moreover, combining the argument of this
paper with that of BGHZ shows that there are just two choices for quantum
foundations: interpretations closely similar to the present one or those that
harbor instantaneous action at a distance.
