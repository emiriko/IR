Inclusion of heavy metal atoms in a polymer backbone allows transitions
between the singlet and triplet manifolds. Interfacial dissociation of triplet
excitons constitutes a viable mechanism for enhancing photovoltaic (PV)
efficiencies in polymer heterojunction-based solar cells. The PV efficiency
from polymer solar cells utilizing a ladder-type poly (para-phenylene) polymer
(PhLPPP) with trace quantity of Pd atoms and a fullerene derivative (PCBM) is
much higher than its counterpart (MeLPPP) with no Pd atom. Evidence is
presented for the formation of a weak ground-state charge-transfer complex
(CTC) in the blended films of the polymer and PCBM, using photo-induced
absorption (PIA) spectroscopy. The CTC state in MeLPPP:PCBM has a singlet
character to it, resulting in a radiative recombination. In contrast, the CTC
states in PhLPPP:PCBM are more localized with a triplet character. An
absorption peak at 1.65 eV is observed in PhLPPP:PCBM blend in the PIA, which
may be converted to weakly-bound polaron-pairs, contributing to the enhancement
of PV efficiency.
