In the spectra of 139 early-type Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stars observed
with FUSE and with deep radio Parkes HI 21-cm observations along those stars,
we search for and analyze the absorption and emission from high-velocity gas at
+90<v<+175 km/s. The HI column density of the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) along
these sightlines ranges from <10^18.4 to 10^19.2 cm^-2. The incidence of the
HVC metal absorption is 70%, significantly higher than the HI emission
occurrence of 32%. We find that the mean metallicity of the HVC is [OI/HI] =
-0.51 (+0.12,-0.16). There is no strong evidence for a large variation in the
HVC metallicity, implying that thes e HVCs have a similar origin and are part
of the same complex. The mean and scatter of the HVC metallicities are more
consistent with the present-day LMC oxygen abundance than that of the Small
Magellanic Cloud or the Milky Way. We find that on average [SiII/OI] = +0.48
(+0.15,- 0.25) and [FeII/OI] = +0.33 (+0.14,-0.21), implying that the HVC
complex is dominantly ionized. The HVC complex has a multiphase structure with
a neutral (OI, FeII), weakly ionized (FeII, NII), and highly ionized (OVI)
components, and has evidence of dust but no molecules. All the observed
properties of the HVC can be explained by an energetic outflow from the LMC.
This is the first example of a large (>10^6 M_sun) HVC complex that is linked
to stellar feedback occurring in a dwarf spiral galaxy.
