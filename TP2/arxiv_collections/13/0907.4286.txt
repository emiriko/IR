We present the first measurements at a hadron collider of differential cross
sections for Z+jet+X production in delta phi(Z, jet), |delta y(Z, jet)| and
|y_boost(Z, jet)|. Vector boson production in association with jets is an
excellent probe of QCD and constitutes the main background to many small cross
section processes, such as associated Higgs production. These measurements are
crucial tests of the predictions of perturbative QCD and current event
generators, which have varied success in describing the data. Using these
measurements as inputs in tuning event generators will increase the
experimental sensitivity to rare signals.
