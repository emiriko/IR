The issue of the "eternal return" is examined from the perspective of the
topology of spacetime. Constraints on dynamical laws for the periodic evolution
of a system or universe are highlighted. Using a Fourier series expansion, an
infinite set of simultaneous linear equations is formulated for the periodic
evolution of a system/universe.
