We study ultracold three-body collisions of bosons and fermions when the
interatomic interaction is tuned near a narrow Feshbach resonance. We show that
the width of the resonance has a substantial impact on the collisional
properties of ultracold gases in the strongly interacting regime. We obtain
numerical and analytical results that allow us to identify universal features
related to the resonance width. For narrow resonances, we have found a
suppression of all inelastic processes in boson systems leading to deeply bound
states and an enhancement for fermion systems.
