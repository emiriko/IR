In this paper we present an approach for supporting users in the difficult
task of searching for video. We use collaborative feedback mined from the
interactions of earlier users of a video search system to help users in their
current search tasks. Our objective is to improve the quality of the results
that users find, and in doing so also assist users to explore a large and
complex information space. It is hoped that this will lead to them considering
search options that they may not have considered otherwise. We performed a user
centred evaluation. The results of our evaluation indicate that we achieved our
goals, the performance of the users in finding relevant video clips was
enhanced with our system; users were able to explore the collection of video
clips more and users demonstrated a preference for our system that provided
recommendations.
