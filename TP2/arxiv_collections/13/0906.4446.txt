We analyze features that resemble type i spicules in two different 3D
numerical simulations in which we include horizontal magnetic flux emergence in
a computational domain spanning the upper layers of the convection zone to the
lower corona. The two simulations differ mainly in the preexisting ambient
magnetic field strength and in the properties of the inserted flux tube. We use
the Oslo Staggered Code (OSC) to solve the full MHD equations with non-grey and
non-LTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field
lines. We find a multitude of features that show a spatiotemporal evolution
that is similar to that observed in type i spicules, which are characterized by
parabolic height vs. time profiles, and are dominated by rapid upward motion at
speeds of 10-30 km/s, followed by downward motion at similar velocities. We
measured the parameters of the parabolic profile of the spicules and find
similar correlations between the parameters as those found in observations. The
values for height (or length) and duration of the spicules found in the
simulations are more limited in range than those in the observations. The
spicules found in the simulation with higher preexisting ambient field have
shorter length and smaller velocities. From the simulations, it appears that
these kinds of spicules can, in principle, be driven by a variety of mechanisms
that include p-modes, collapsing granules, magnetic energy release in the
photosphere and lower chromosphere and convective buffeting of flux
concentrations.
