Much of the present experimental effort at RHIC is now directed towards
understanding the properties of the hot and dense colored medium created in A+A
collisions. Recent results from PHENIX on the dynamical evolution of the medium
and its response to high momentum probes are presented, and their impact on our
overall understanding of heavy-ion collisions is discussed.
