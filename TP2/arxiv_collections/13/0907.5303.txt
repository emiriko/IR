Which non-local hidden variables could complement the description of physical
reality? The present model of extended Newtonian dynamics (MEND) is generalize
but not alternative to Newtonian Dynamics because its extended Newtonian
Dynamics to arbitrary reference frames. It Is Physics of Arbitrary Reference
Frames. Generalize and alternative is not the same. MEND describes the dynamics
of mechanical systems for arbitrary reference frames and not only for inertial
reference frames as Newtonian Dynamics. Newtonian Dynamics can describe
non-inertial reference frames as well introducing fiction forces. In MEND we
have fiction forces naturally and automatically from new axiomatic and we
needn't have inertial reference frame. MEND is differs from Newtonian Dynamics
in the case of micro-objects description.
