Pandres has developed a theory in which the geometrical structure of a real
four-dimensional space-time is expressed by a real orthonormal tetrad, and the
group of diffeomorphisms is replaced by a larger group called the conservation
group. This paper extends the geometrical foundation for Pandres' theory by
developing an appropriate covariant derivative which is covariant under all
local Lorentz (frame) transformations, including complex Lorentz
transformations, as well as conservative transformations. After defining this
extended covariant derivative, an appropriate Lagrangian and its resulting
field equations are derived. As in Pandres' theory, these field equations
result in a stress-energy tensor that has terms which may automatically
represent the electroweak field. Finally, the theory is extended to include
2-spinors and 4-spinors.
