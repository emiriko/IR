We propose a model in which intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with mass
of ~10000 Msun are formed in early dark matter halos. We carry out detailed
stellar evolution calculations for accreting primordial stars including
annihilation energy of dark matter particles. We follow the stellar core
evolution consistently up to gravitational collapse. We show that very massive
stars, as massive as 10000 Msun, can be formed in an early dark matter halo.
Such stars are extremely bright with Log L/Lsun > 8.2. They gravitationally
collapse to form IMBHs. These black holes could have seeded the formation of
early super-massive blackholes.
