We apply the BV formalism to non-commutative field theories, introduce BRST
symmetry, and gauge-fix the models. Interestingly, we find that treating the
full gauge symmetry in non-commutative models can lead to reducible gauge
algebras. As one example we apply the formalism to the Connes-Lott two-point
model. Finally, we offer a derivation of a superversion of the
Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral.
