Obtaining the rest mass of leptons with electric charge minus 1 is pursued by
considering the existence of a medium made up of sub-quantum particles, called
etherons, having a rest energy at the lowest limit which is possible in the
Universe. This medium is assumed to have a periodic structure, that generates
zones of allowed and forbidden energy. The basic assumption consists in
considering the photon interaction with this hypothetical medium to be similar
with the interaction of the electrons with the particles of a crystalline
lattice. It is further assumed that an inverse particle-antiparticle
annihilation process in the presence of the periodical sub-quantum field
generates the particles of the Universe. The quantization of the photons in
this sub-quantum lattice is achieved with the help of the operator of the
square of the energy and a well-known formula of F. Bloch has been further used
to empirically fix the lattice parameters. The rest energy of fundamental
particles would correspond to zones of allowed energy.
