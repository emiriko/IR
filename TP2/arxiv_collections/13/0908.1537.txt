Axions are very light, very weakly interacting particles postulated more than
30 years ago in the context of the Standard Model of particle physics. Their
existence could explain the missing dark matter of the universe. However,
despite intensive searches, they have yet to be detected. In this work, we show
that magnetic fluctuations of topological insulators couple to the
electromagnetic fields exactly like the axions, and propose several experiments
to detect this dynamical axion field. In particular, we show that the axion
coupling enables a nonlinear modulation of the electromagnetic field, leading
to attenuated total reflection. We propose a novel optical modulators device
based on this principle.
