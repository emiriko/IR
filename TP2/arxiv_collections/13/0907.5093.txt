The local antimatter fluxes induced by an individual dark matter (DM)
substructure can be significantly dependent on the proper motion of the source.
We derive analytic solutions to the propagation equation for time-dependent
positron and antiproton primary sources, finding that the static limit is a
fair approximation only for very high energy particles and nearby sources. We
discuss weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) models fitting the PAMELA
positron excess and the FERMI all-electron data. We show that, for a single
non-static DM point-source, one cannot extract from the data, in a unique way,
model independent particle physics observables, such as the WIMP mass, the pair
annihilation cross section, and the annihilation yield. The gamma-ray emission
associated to WIMP models inducing a significant local flux of positrons or
antiprotons is found to be compatible with EGRET measurements, but it can be
definitely singled out with the FERMI-LAT telescope.
