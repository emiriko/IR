We give chain homotopy maps of Khovanov-type link homology of a universal
differential. The universal differential, discussed by Mikhail Khovanov, Marco
Mackaay, Paul Turner and Pedro Vaz, contains the original Khovanov's
differential and Lee's differential. We also consider the conditions of any
differential ensuring the Reidemeister invariance for the chain homotopy maps.
