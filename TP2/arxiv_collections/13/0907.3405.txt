* Aims. We describe here the main functionalities of the LAEX (Laboratorio de
Astrofisica Estelar y Exoplanetas/Laboratory for Stellar Astrophysics and
Exoplanets) and NASA portals for CoRoT Public Data. The CoRoT archive at LAEX
was opened to the community in January 2009 and is managed in the framework of
the Spanish Virtual Observatory. NStED (NASA Star and Exoplanet Database)
serves as the CoRoT portal for the US astronomical community. NStED is a
general purpose stellar and exoplanet archive with the aim of providing support
for NASA planet finding and characterisation goals, and the planning and
support of NASA and other space missions. CoRoT data at LAEX and NStED can be
accessed at http://sdc.laeff.inta.es/corotfa/ and
http://nsted.ipac.caltech.edu,respectively.
  * Methods. Based on considerable experience with astronomical archives, the
aforementioned archives are designed with the aim of delivering science-quality
data in a simple and efficient way.
  * Results. LAEX and NStED not only provide access to CoRoT Public Data but
furthermore serve a variety of observed and calculated astrophysical data. In
particular, NStED provides scientifically validated information on stellar and
planetary data related to the search for and characterization of extrasolar
planets, and LAEX makes any information from Virtual Observatory services
available to the astronomical community.
