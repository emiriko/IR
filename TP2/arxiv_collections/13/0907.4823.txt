We discuss two questions related to the concept of weak values as seen from
the standard quantum-mechanics point of view. In the first part of the paper,
we describe a scenario where unphysical results similar to those encountered in
the study of weak values are obtained using a simple experimental setup that
does not involve weak measurements. In the second part of the paper, we discuss
the correct physical description, according to quantum mechanics, of what is
being measured in a weak-value-type experiment.
