The paper introduces and studies hedging for game (Israeli) style extension
of swing options considered as multiple exercise derivatives. Assuming that the
underlying security can be traded without restrictions we derive a formula for
valuation of multiple exercise options via classical hedging arguments.
Introducing the notion of the shortfall risk for such options we study also
partial hedging which leads to minimization of this risk.
