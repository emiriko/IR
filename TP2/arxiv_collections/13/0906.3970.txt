We have observed millisecond-long coherent evolution of nuclear spins in a
quantum wire at 1.2 K. Local, all-electrical manipulation of nuclear spins is
achieved by dynamic nuclear polarization in the breakdown regime of the Integer
Quantum Hall Effect combined with pulsed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The
excitation thresholds for the breakdown are significantly smaller than what
would be expected for our sample and the direction of the nuclear polarization
can be controlled by the voltage bias. As a four-level spin system, the device
is equivalent to two qubits.
