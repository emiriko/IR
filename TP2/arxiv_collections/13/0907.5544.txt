We elucidate the termination surface of cleaved single crystals of the
BaFe_(2-x)Co_(x)As_(2) and Fe_(y)Se_(1-x)Te_(x) families of the high
temperature iron based superconductors. By combining scanning tunneling
microscopic data with low energy electron diffraction we prove that the
termination layer of the Ba122 systems is a remnant of the Ba layer, which
exhibits a complex diversity of ordered and disordered structures. The observed
surface topographies and their accompanying superstructure reflections in
electron diffraction depend on the cleavage temperature. In stark contrast,
Fe_(y)Se_(1-x)Te_(x) possesses only a single termination structure - that of
the tetragonally ordered Se_(1-x)Te_(x) layer.
