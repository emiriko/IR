In this work, we numerically study the Fizeau-Doppler shift of surface modes
in a moving plasmonic metamaterial. At proper surface plasmon resonance
conditions, a slow group velocity is resulted in the metamaterials, and our
simulation indicates a phase shift up to 4 orders of magnitude larger than the
normal mode. In addition, both appreciable positive and negative photon drag
could be observed. We also found an abrupt transition in the sign of phase
shift when silver film reaches a critical thickness. This opens new
opportunities in applications such as compact optical gyroscopes and
accelerometers.
