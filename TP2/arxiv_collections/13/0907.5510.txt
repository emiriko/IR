We construct normalizable, semi-classical states for the previously proposed
model of quantum gravity which is formulated as a spectral triple over holonomy
loops. The semi-classical limit of the spectral triple gives the Dirac
Hamiltonian in 3+1 dimensions. Also, time-independent lapse and shift fields
emerge from the semi-classical states. Our analysis shows that the model might
contain fermionic matter degrees of freedom.
  The semi-classical analysis presented in this paper does away with most of
the ambiguities found in the initial semi-finite spectral triple construction.
The cubic lattices play the role of a coordinate system and a divergent
sequence of free parameters found in the Dirac type operator is identified as a
certain inverse infinitesimal volume element.
