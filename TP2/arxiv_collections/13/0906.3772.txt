Data integrity is the fundamental for data authentication. A major problem
for XML data authentication is that signed XML data can be copied to another
document but still keep signature valid. This is caused by XML data integrity
protecting. Through investigation, the paper discovered that besides data
content integrity, XML data integrity should also protect element location
information, and context referential integrity under fine-grained security
situation. The aim of this paper is to propose a model for XML data integrity
considering XML data features. The paper presents an XML data integrity model
named as CSR (content integrity, structure integrity, context referential
integrity) based on a concatenated hash function. XML data content integrity is
ensured using an iterative hash process, structure integrity is protected by
hashing an absolute path string from root node, and context referential
integrity is ensured by protecting context-related elements. Presented XML data
integrity model can satisfy integrity requirements under situation of
fine-grained security, and compatible with XML signature. Through evaluation,
the integrity model presented has a higher efficiency on digest
value-generation than the Merkle hash tree-based integrity model for XML data.
