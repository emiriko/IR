High-mass microquasars are binary systems composed by a massive star and a
compact object from which relativistic jets are launched. Regarding the
companion star, observational evidence supports the idea that winds of hot
stars are formed by clumps. Then, these inhomogeneities may interact with the
jets producing a flaring activity. In the present contribution we study the
interaction between a jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass
microquasar. This interaction produces a shock in the jet, where particles may
be accelerated up to relativistic energies. We calculate the spectral energy
distributions of the dominant non-thermal processes: synchrotron radiation,
inverse Compton scattering, and proton-proton collisions. Significant levels of
X- and gamma-ray emission are predicted, with luminosities in the different
domains up to ~ 10^{34} - 10^{35} erg/s on a timescale of about ~ 1 h. Finally,
jet-clump interactions in high-mass microquasars could be detectable at high
energies. These phenomena may be behind the fast TeV variability found in some
high-mass X-ray binary systems, such as Cygnus X-1, LS 5039 and LS I+61 303. In
addition, our model can help to derive information on the properties of jets
and clumpy winds.
