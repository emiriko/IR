he upcoming new perspective of the high redshift Universe in the 21 cm line
of atomic hydrogen opens possibilities to explore topics of spiral disk
evolution, hitherto reserved for the optical regime. The growth of spiral gas
disks over Cosmic time can be explored with the new generation of radio
telescopes, notably the SKA, and its precursors, as accurately as with the
Hubble Space Telescope for stellar disks. Since the atomic hydrogen gas is the
building block of these disks, it should trace their formation accurately.
Morphology of HI disks can now equally be quantified over Cosmic time. In
studies of HST deep fields, the optical or UV morphology of high-redshift
galaxy disks have been characterized using a few quantities: concentration (C),
asymmetry (A), smoothness (S), second-order-moment (M20), the GINI coefficient
(G), and Ellipticity (E). We have applied these parameters across wavelengths
and compared them to the HI morphology over the THINGS sample. NGC 3184, an
unperturbed disk, and NGC 5194, the canonical 3:1 interaction, serve as
examples for quantified morphology. We find that morphology parameters
determined in HI are as good or better a tracer of interaction compared to
those in any other wavelength, notably in Asymmetry, Gini and M20. This opens
the possibility of using them in the parameterization pipeline for SKA
precursor catalogues to select interacting or harassed galaxies from their HI
morphology. Asymmetry, Gini and M20 may be redefined for use on data-cubes
rather than HI column density image.
