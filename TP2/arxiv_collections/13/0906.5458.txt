In this paper, we will employ the Opial and Wirtinger type inequalities to
derive some conditional and unconditional lower bounds for the gaps between the
zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. First, we prove (unconditionally) that the
consecutive nontrivial zeros often differ by at least 1.9902 times the average
spacing. This value improves the value 1.9 due to Mueller and the value 1.9799
due to Montogomery and Odlyzko. Second, on the hypothesis that the 2k-th mixed
moments of the Hardy Z-function and its derivative are correctly predicted by
random matrix theory, we derive some explicit formulae for the gaps and use
them to establish new (conditional) large gaps.
