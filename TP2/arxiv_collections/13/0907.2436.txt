In this letter, we investigate the nature of the dramatic `super-bubble'
emission structures associated with the z=2.44 radio galaxy MRC 0406-244, using
rest-frame optical spectroscopy and an archival HST NICMOS image. Based on the
optical line ratios and the HST morphology, we conclude that the gas in the
superbubbles is photoionized by the obscured active nucleus. We suggest that
this type of structure might be related to the spatially extended HI absorbers
that are detected in front of many high-z radio galaxies. We also suggest that
we may be witnessing the destruction of the extended emission line region. In
addition, we investigate the nature of the emission line brightness asymmetry
in MRC 0406-244: we conclude that this asymmetry is due to an asymmetry in the
mass of ionized gas, confirming the scenario of McCarthy, van Breugel & Kapahi,
and leading us to reject that of Gopal-Krishna & Wiita.
