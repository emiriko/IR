We present preliminary results from a study of the compact star cluster
populations in three local luminous blue compact galaxies: ESO 185-IG 013, ESO
350-IG 038 (a.k.a. Haro 11), and MRK 930. These systems show peculiar
morphologies and the presence of hundreds of SCs that have been produced by the
past, recent, and/or current starburst phases. We use a complete set of HST
images ranging from the UV to IR for each galaxy. Deep images in V
(WFPC2/f606w) and I (WFPC2/f814w) are used to capture most of the star cluster
candidates up to the old ones (fainter) which have had, in the past, less
possibility to be detected. The other bands are used in the SED fitting
technique for constraining ages and masses. Our goals are to investigate the
evolution of these three blue compact galaxies and the star cluster formation
impact on their star formation history.
