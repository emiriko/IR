It is shown that a complex normal projective variety has non-positive Kodaira
dimension if it admits a non-isomorphic quasi-polarized endomorphism. The
geometric structure of the variety is described by methods of equivariant
lifting and fibrations. (For endomorphisms of projective spaces, see version
1).
