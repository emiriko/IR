We construct a DGP-inspired braneworld model where induced gravity on the
brane is modified in the spirit of $f(R)$ gravity and stringy effects are taken
into account by incorporation of the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action. We
explore cosmological dynamics of this model and we show that this scenario is a
successful alternative for dark energy proposal. Interestingly, it realizes the
phantom-like behavior without introduction of any phantom field on the brane
and the effective equation of state parameter crosses the cosmological constant
line naturally in the same way as observational data suggest.
