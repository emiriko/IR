Several interesting correlations among Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) prompt and
afterglow properties have been found in the recent years. Some of these
correlations have been proposed also to standardize GRB energetics to use them
as standard candles in constraining the expansion history of the universe up to
z>6. However, given the still unexplained nature of most of these correlations,
only the less scattered correlations can be used for constraining the
cosmological parameters. The updated E_peak-E_gamma correlation is presented.
Caveats of alternative methods of standardizing GRB energetics are discussed.
