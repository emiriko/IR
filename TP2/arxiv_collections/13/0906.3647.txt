In many applications, the two-dimensional trajectories of fluid particles are
available, but little is known about the underlying flow. Oceanic floats are a
clear example. To extract quantitative information from such data, one can
measure single-particle dispersion coefficients, but this only uses one
trajectory at a time, so much of the information on relative motion is lost. In
some circumstances the trajectories happen to remain close long enough to
measure finite-time Lyapunov exponents, but this is rare. We propose to use
tools from braid theory and the topology of surface mappings to approximate the
topological entropy of the underlying flow. The procedure uses all the
trajectory data and is inherently global. The topological entropy is a measure
of the entanglement of the trajectories, and converges to zero if they are not
entangled in a complex manner (for instance, if the trajectories are all in a
large vortex). We illustrate the techniques on some simple dynamical systems
and on float data from the Labrador sea.
