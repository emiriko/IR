We reconsider a plasma with an anisotropy imposed on the momentum
distribution of the system and study the real time static potential for
quarkonia. The distribution function is normalised so as to preserve the
particle number in an ideal gas, as required in the Keldysh-Schwinger
formalism. In contrast to recent findings without this normalisation, a weak
anisotropy does not lead to an increase in the melting temperature for bound
states. To test for the maximal effect, we also investigate a gluonic medium in
the limit of an asymptotically strong anisotropy. The spectral function of
quarkonium is calculated for this case and found to be in remarkable agreement
with the corresponding results for an isotropic medium.
