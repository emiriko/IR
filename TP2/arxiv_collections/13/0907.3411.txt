Using a cold atomic gas exposed to laser pulses -- a realization of the
chaotic quasiperiodic kicked rotor with three incommensurate frequencies -- we
study experimentally and theoretically the Anderson metal-insulator transition
in three dimensions. Sensitive measurements of the atomic wavefunction and the
use of finite-size scaling techniques make it possible to unambiguously
demonstrate the existence of a quantum phase transition and to measure its
critical exponents. By taking proper account of systematic corrections to
one-parameter scaling, we show the universality of the critical exponent
$\nu=1.59\pm0.01,$ which is found to be equal to the one previously computed
for the Anderson model.
