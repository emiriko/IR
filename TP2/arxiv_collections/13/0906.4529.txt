We use the combinatorial and number-theoretical methods developed in previous
work by the authors to study black hole entropy in the new proposal put forward
by Engle, Noui and Perez. Specifically we give the generating functions
relevant for the computation of the entropy and use them to derive its
asymptotic behavior including the value of the Immirzi parameter and the
coefficient of the logarithmic correction.
