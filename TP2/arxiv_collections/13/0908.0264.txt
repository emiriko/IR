At a quantum critical point (QCP) -- a zero-temperature singularity in which
a line of continuous phase transition terminates -- quantum fluctuations
diverge in space and time, leading to exotic phenomena that can be observed at
non-zero temperatures. Using a quantum antiferromagnet, we present calorimetric
evidence that nuclear spins frozen in a high-temperature metastable state by
temperature quenching are annealed by quantum fluctuations near the QCP. This
phenomenon, with readily detectable heat release from the nuclear spins as they
are annealed, serves as an excellent marker of a quantum critical region around
the QCP and provides a probe of the dynamics of the divergent quantum
fluctuations.
