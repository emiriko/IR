Spatial maps of the high-pass frequency filtered time-averaged
root-mean-squared (RMS) Doppler velocities tend to show substantial decrements
within regions of strong field and curiously, randomly distributed patches of
enhancement in the vicinity. We propose that these haloes or enhancements are a
consequence of magnetic-field-induced mode mixing (scattering), resulting in
the preferential powering of waves that possess strong surface velocity
signatures (i.e. scattering from low to high wavenumbers). Evidently, this
process can occur in the reverse, and therefore in order to determine if the
haloes are indeed caused by mode mixing, we must answer the question: {\it how
are acoustic waves scattered by magnetic fields?} Through simulations of the
interactions between waves and sunspots and models of plage, we demonstrate
that the high to low modal order scattering channels are favoured. With
increasing frequency and consequently, decreasing wavelength, a growing number
of modes are scattered by the sunspot, thereby rendering the enhancements most
visible around the high-frequency parts of the spectrum. The haloes obtained
from the simulations are on the same order of magnitude but weaker than those
observed. We also present observational evidence to support this theory:
observations of active region AR9787 are firstly frequency filtered to isolate
the 5-6 mHz signals and secondly, decomposed into three wavenumber bandpasses,
$l - [0,400], [400,800], [800,2222]$. With increasing wavenumber, the extent of
the halo effect is seen increase dramatically, in line with theoretical
expectation.
