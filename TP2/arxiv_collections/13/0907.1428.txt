Measurements of the double-differential pi+/- production cross-section in the
range of momentum 100 MeV/c <= p <= 800 MeV/c and angle 0.35 rad <= theta <=
2.15 rad using pi+/- beams incident on beryllium, aluminium, carbon, copper,
tin, tantalum and lead targets are presented. The data were taken with the
large acceptance HARP detector in the T9 beam line of the CERN Proton
Synchrotron. The secondary pions were produced by beams in a momentum range
from 3 GeV/c to 12.9 GeV/c hitting a solid target with a thickness of 5% of a
nuclear interaction length. The tracking and identification of the produced
particles was performed using a small-radius cylindrical time projection
chamber (TPC) placed inside a solenoidal magnet. Incident particles were
identified by an elaborate system of beam detectors. Results are obtained for
the double-differential cross-sections d2sigma/dpdtheta at six incident beam
momenta. Data at 3 GeV/c, 5 GeV/c, 8 GeV/c, and 12 GeV/c are available for all
targets while additional data at 8.9 GeV/c and 12.9 GeV/c were taken in
positive particle beams on Be and Al targets, respectively. The measurements
are compared with several generators of GEANT4 and the MARS Monte Carlo
simulation.
