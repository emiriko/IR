By exploiting the concepts of magnetic group theory we show how
unidirectional behavior can be obtained in two-dimensional magneto-photonic
crystals (MOPhC) with uniform magnetization. This group theory approach
generalizes all previous investigations of one-way MOPhCs including those based
on the use of antiparallel magnetic domains in the elementary crystal cell.
Here, the theoretical approach is illustrated for one MOPhC example where
unidirectional behavior is obtained by appropriately lowering the geometrical
symmetry of the elementary motifs. One-way transmission is numerically
demonstrated for a photonic crystal slice.
