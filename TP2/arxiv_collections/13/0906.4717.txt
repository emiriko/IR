We review the polarization properties of X-ray emission from highly
magnetized neutron stars, focusing on emission from the stellar surfaces. We
discuss how x-ray polarization can be used to constrain neutron star magnetic
field and emission geometry, and to probe strong-field quantum electrodynamics
and possibly constrain the properties of axions.
