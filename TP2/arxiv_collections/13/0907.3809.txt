A cluster imaging technique for Transmission Electron Microscopy with a
direct detection CMOS pixel sensor is presented. Charge centre-of-gravity
reconstruction for individual electron clusters improves the spatial resolution
and thus the point spread function. Data collected with a CMOS sensor with 9.5
micron pixels show an improvement of a factor of two in point spread function
to 2.7 micron at 300 keV and of a factor of three in the image contrast,
compared to traditional bright field illumination.
