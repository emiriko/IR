All theoretical models (Heisenberg, Ising etc.) assume a negligible role for
thermal vibrations in alloy and magnetic phase transitions. Analysis of
diffraction data conclusively proves that this assumption is incorrect. A
simple criterion emerges that theoretical models can ignore the role of thermal
vibrations only if the Debye-Waller Factor is ignored in the analysis of
diffraction data. Diffraction data constrain all theoretical models to
incorporate the role of thermal vibrations. This conclusion is also supported
by other experimental results, the effect of thermal vibrations on ordering
energy that is of the same order of magnitude as ordering energy and an isotope
effect on magnetic phase transitions. An electron-phonon interaction (EPI)
formalism that incorporates the Debye-Waller Factor in electronic structure
calculations already exists and must be adopted for a correct understanding of
phase transitions as it can account for all the different experimental results
mentioned above. The discrepancy between experimental and theoretical ordering
energy in Ni3V is direct evidence for the role of thermal vibrations in
altering ordering energy. The inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if
zero point vibrations are incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald
sum method. The three dimensional Ising model cannot represent order-disorder
transition in beta brass, CuZn. An isotope effect is predicted for magnetic
phase transitions if the transition temperature is below Debye temperature. The
long range order parameter obtained from diffraction data can only be compared
with predictions of models that incorporate the role of thermal vibrations and
not otherwise.
