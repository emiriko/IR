To study the dynamics of discharge of a brane black hole in TeV gravity
scenarios, we obtain the approximate electromagnetic field due to the charged
black hole, by solving Maxwell's equations perturbatively on the brane. In
addition, arguments are given for brane metric corrections due to backreaction.
We couple brane scalar and brane fermion fields with non-zero mass and charge
to the background, and study the Hawking radiation process using well known low
energy approximations as well as a WKB approximation in the high energy limit.
We argue that contrary to common claims, the initial evaporation is not
dominated by fast Schwinger discharge.
