This paper introduces a modeling framework for distributed regression with
agents/experts observing attribute-distributed data (heterogeneous data). Under
this model, a new algorithm, the iterative covariance optimization algorithm
(ICOA), is designed to reshape the covariance matrix of the training residuals
of individual agents so that the linear combination of the individual
estimators minimizes the ensemble training error. Moreover, a scheme (Minimax
Protection) is designed to provide a trade-off between the number of data
instances transmitted among the agents and the performance of the ensemble
estimator without undermining the convergence of the algorithm. This scheme
also provides an upper bound (with high probability) on the test error of the
ensemble estimator. The efficacy of ICOA combined with Minimax Protection and
the comparison between the upper bound and actual performance are both
demonstrated by simulations.
