In this paper we present a specialised algebraic manipulation package devoted
to Celestial Mechanics. The system, called Piranha, is built on top of a
generic and extensible framework, which allows to treat efficiently and in a
unified way the algebraic structures most commonly encountered in Celestial
Mechanics (such as multivariate polynomials and Poisson series). In this
contribution we explain the architecture of the software, with special focus on
the implementation of series arithmetics, show its current capabilities, and
present benchmarks indicating that Piranha is competitive, performance-wise,
with other specialised manipulators.
