The cosmological evolution in the radiation dominated regimen is usually
computed by assuming an ideal relativistic thermal bath. In this note, we
discuss the deviation from the non-interaction assumption. In either the
standard model (SM) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the
main contribution comes from the strong interaction. An understanding of these
effects are important for precision measurements and for the evolution of
scalar modes, where the commented corrections constitute the main source of the
dynamics.
