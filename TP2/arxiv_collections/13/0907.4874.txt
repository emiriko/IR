A microscopic magnetic model for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain compound
CuSe2O5 is developed based on the results of a joint experimental and
theoretical study. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data give evidence
for quasi-1D magnetism with leading antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings and an
AFM ordering temperature of 17 K. For microscopic insight, full-potential DFT
calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) were performed. Using
the resulting band structure, a consistent set of transfer integrals for an
effective one-band tight-binding model was obtained. Electronic correlations
were treated on a mean-field level starting from LDA (LSDA+U method) and on a
model level (Hubbard model). In excellent agreement of experiment and theory,
we find that only two couplings in CuSe2O5 are relevant: the nearest-neighbour
intra-chain interaction of 165 K and a non-frustrated inter-chain coupling of
20 K. From a comparison with structurally related systems (Sr2Cu(PO4)2,
Bi2CuO4), general implications for a magnetic ordering in presence of
inter-chain frustration are made.
