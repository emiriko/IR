The transport and magnetic studies are performed on high quality
FeTe0.60Se0.40 single crystals to determine the upper critical fields (Hc2),
lower critical field (Hc1) and the Critical current density (Jc). The value of
upper critical field Hc2 are very large, whereas the activation energy as
determined from the slope of the Arrhenius plots are was found to be lower than
that in the FeAs122 superconductor. The lower critical field was determined in
ab direction and c direction of the crystal, and was found to have a anisotropy
of 'gamma'{=(Hc1//c) / (Hc1//b)} ~ 4. The magnetic isotherms measured up to 12
Tesla shows the presence of fishtail behavior. The critical current densities
at 1.8K of the single crystal was found to almost same in both ab and c
direction as 1X105 Amp/cm2 in low field regime.
