We investigate the prospects for the discovery of a neutral Higgs boson
produced with one bottom quark followed by Higgs decay into a pair of bottom
quarks at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider. We work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard
model. The dominant physics background is calculated with realistic acceptance
cuts and efficiencies including the production of $bb\bar{b}$,
$\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $jb\bar{b}$ ($j = g, q, \bar{q}$; $q = u, d, s, c$),
$t\bar{t} \to b\bar{b}jj\ell\nu$, and $t\bar{t} \to b\bar{b}jjjj$. Promising
results are found for the CP-odd pseudoscalar ($A^0$) and the heavier CP-even
scalar ($H^0$) Higgs bosons with masses up to 800 GeV for the LHC with an
integrated luminosity ($L$) of 30 fb$^{-1}$ and up to 1 TeV for $L =$ 300
fb$^{-1}$.
