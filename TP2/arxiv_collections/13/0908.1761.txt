We present a brief pedagogical introduction into the basic physics of the
Josephson effect in superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates. We show how
the critical Josephson current between two superconductors can be derived
microscopically. We also shortly discuss the Josephson effect in superfluid
Helium.
