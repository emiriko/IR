We study connections between recollements of the derived category D(Mod-R) of
a ring R and tilting theory. We first provide constructions of tilting objects
from given recollements, recovering several different results from the
literature. Secondly, we show how to construct a recollement from a tilting
module of projective dimension one. Our results will be employed in a
forthcoming paper in order to investigate stratifications of D(Mod-R).
