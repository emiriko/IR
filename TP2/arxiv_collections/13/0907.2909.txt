Chaos is an active research subject in the fields of science in recent years.
it is a complex and an erratic behavior that is possible in very simple
systems. in the present day, the chaotic behavior can be observed in
experiments. Many studies have been made in chaotic dynamics during the past
three decades and many simple chaotic systems have been discovered. in this
work-bifurcations and chaos in simple dynamical systems - the behavior of some
simple dynamical systems is studied by constructing mathematical models.
investigations are made on the periodic orbits for continuous maps and idea of
sensitive dependence on initial conditions,which is the hallmark of chaos, is
obtained.
