We show that interface bound states are formed at isolated
graphene-superconductor junctions. These states arise due to the interplay of
virtual Andreev and normal reflections taking place at these interfaces. Simple
analytical expressions for their dispersion are obtained considering interfaces
formed along armchair or zig-zag edges. It is shown that the states are
sensitive to a supercurrent flowing on the superconducting electrode. The
states provide long range superconducting correlations on the graphene layer
which may be exploited for the detection of crossed Andreev processes.
