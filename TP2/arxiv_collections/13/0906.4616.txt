We study experimentally the propagation dynamics and interaction of spatial
optical solitons in a bias-free cell filled with nematic liquid crystals. We
reveal and measure long-range effects due to the cell boundaries for a single
nematicon as well as for the interacting in-phase and out-of-phase nematicons.
We discuss the effect of initial beam focusing and relative input angle on the
interaction of in-phase nematicons.
