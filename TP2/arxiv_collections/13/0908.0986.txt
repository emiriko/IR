Ethernet topology discovery has gained increasing interest in the recent
years. This trend is motivated mostly by increasing number of carrier Ethernet
networks as well as the size of these networks, and consequently the increasing
sales of these networks. To manage these networks efficiently, detailed and
accurate knowledge of their topology is needed. Knowledge of a network's
entities and the physical connections between them can be useful in various
prospective. Administrators can use topology information for network planning
and fault detecting. Topology information can also be used during protocol and
routing algorithm development, for performance prediction and as a basis for
accurate network simulations. From a network security perspective, threat
detection, network monitoring, network access control and forensic
investigations can benefit from accurate network topology information. In this
paper, we analyze market trends and investigate current tools available for
both research and commercial purposes.
