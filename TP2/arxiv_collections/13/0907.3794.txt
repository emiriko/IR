Let f be a holomorphic automorphism of positive entropy on a compact Kaehler
surface. We show that the equilibrium measure of f is exponentially mixing. The
proof uses some recent development on the pluripotential theory. The result
also holds for automorphisms on compact Kaehler manifolds of higher dimension
under a natural condition on their dynamical degrees.
