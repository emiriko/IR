Starting from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation we derive a 1D
generalized nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation, which describes the dynamics of
Bose-Einstein condensates under the action of a generic potential in the
longitudinal axial direction and of an anisotropic harmonic potential in the
transverse radial direction. This equation reduces to the familiar 1D
nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation [Phys. Rev. A 65, 043614 (2002)] in the case
of isotropic transverse harmonic confinement. In addition, we show that if the
longitudinal potential models a periodic optical lattice the 3D GPE can be
mapped into a 1D generalized discrete nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation.
