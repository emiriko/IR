We study numerically the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD with one flavor
of massless staggered quarks. We determine the complete phase diagram as a
function of temperature and chemical potential, including a tricritical point.
We clarify the nature of the low temperature dense phase, which is strongly
bound nuclear matter. This strong binding is explained by the nuclear
potential, which we measure. Finally, we determine, from this first-principle
limiting case of QCD, the masses of atomic nuclei up to A=12 "carbon".
