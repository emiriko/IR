Inaccessible web pages are part of the browsing experience. The content of
these pages however is often not completely lost but rather missing. Lexical
signatures (LS) generated from the web pages' textual content have been shown
to be suitable as search engine queries when trying to discover a (missing) web
page. Since LSs are expensive to generate, we investigate the potential of web
pages' titles as they are available at a lower cost. We present the results
from studying the change of titles over time. We take titles from copies
provided by the Internet Archive of randomly sampled web pages and show the
frequency of change as well as the degree of change in terms of the Levenshtein
score. We found very low frequencies of change and high Levenshtein scores
indicating that titles, on average, change little from their original, first
observed values (rooted comparison) and even less from the values of their
previous observation (sliding).
