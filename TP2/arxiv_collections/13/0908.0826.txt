Let $G$ be a connected semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically
closed field $k$. In 1965 Steinberg proved that if $G$ is simply connected,
then in $G$ there exists a closed irreducible cross-section of the set of
closures of regular conjugacy classes. We prove that in arbitrary $G$ such a
cross-section exists if and only if the universal covering isogeny $\tau\colon
\tG\to G$ is bijective; this answers Grothendieck's question cited in the
epigraph. In particular, for ${\rm char}\,k=0$, the converse to Steinberg's
theorem holds. The existence of a cross-section in $G$ implies, at least for
${\rm char}\,k=0$, that the algebra $k[G]^G$ of class functions on $G$ is
generated by ${\rm rk}\,G$ elements. We describe, for arbitrary $G$, a minimal
generating set of $k[G]^G$ and that of the representation ring of $G$ and
answer two Grothendieck's questions on constructing generating sets of
$k[G]^G$. We prove the existence of a rational (i.e., local) section of the
quotient morphism for arbitrary $G$ and the existence of a rational
cross-section in $G$ (for ${\rm char}\,k=0$, this has been proved earlier);
this answers the other Grothendieck's question cited in the epigraph. We also
prove that the existence of a rational section is equivalent to the existence
of a rational $W$-equivariant map $T\dashrightarrow G/T$ where $T$ is a maximal
torus of $G$ and $W$ the Weyl group.
