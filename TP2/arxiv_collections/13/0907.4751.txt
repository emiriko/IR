Generically the probabilities of observational results depend upon both the
quantum state and the rules for extracting the probabilities from it. It is
often argued that inflation may make our observations independent of the
quantum state. In a framework in which one considers the state and the rules as
logically separate, it is shown how it is possible that the probabilities are
indeed independent of the state, but the rules for achieving this seem somewhat
implausible.
