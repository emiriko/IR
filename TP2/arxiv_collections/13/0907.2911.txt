High-resolution photoemission spectroscopy and realistic ab-initio
calculations have been employed to analyze the onset and progression of d-sp
hybridization in Fe impurities deposited on alkali metal films. The interplay
between delocalization, mediated by the free-electron environment, and Coulomb
interaction among d-electrons gives rise to complex electronic configurations.
The multiplet structure of a single Fe atom evolves and gradually dissolves
into a quasiparticle peak near the Fermi level with increasing the host
electron density. The effective multi-orbital impurity problem within the exact
diagonalization scheme describes the whole range of hybridizations.
