We prove that the Faddeev-Popov ghost dressing function in the Yang-Mills
theory is non-zero and finite in the limit of vanishing momenta and hence the
ghost propagator behaves like free in the deep infrared regime, within the
Gribov-Zwanziger framework of the $D$-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in
the Landau gauge for any $D>2$. This result implies that the Kugo-Ojima color
confinement criterion is not satisfied in its original form. We point out that
the result crucially depends on the explicit form of the non-local horizon term
adopted. The original Gribov prediction in the Landau gauge should be
reconsidered in connection with color confinement.
