Until recently, determinations of alpha_s(M_Z) from hadronic tau decays and
the analysis of short-distance-sensitive lattice observables yielded results
which, though precise, were not in good agreement. I review new analyses that
bring these into good agreement and provide some details on the source of the
main changes in the tau decay analysis.
