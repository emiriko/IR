In this paper we consider the problem of tracking the state of a quantum
system via a continuous measurement. If the system Hamiltonian is known
precisely, this merely requires integrating the appropriate stochastic master
equation. However, even a small error in the assumed Hamiltonian can render
this approach useless. The natural answer to this problem is to include the
parameters of the Hamiltonian as part of the estimation problem, and the full
Bayesian solution to this task provides a state-estimate that is robust against
uncertainties. However, this approach requires considerable computational
overhead. Here we consider a single qubit in which the Hamiltonian contains a
single unknown parameter. We show that classical frequency estimation
techniques greatly reduce the computational overhead associated with Bayesian
estimation and provide accurate estimates for the qubit frequency
