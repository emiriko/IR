We have investigated the effects of inplane and interplane nearest neighbour
overlap integrals ($s_0$ and $s_1$) and site energy difference between atoms in
two different sublattices in the same graphene layer ($\Delta$) on the
electronic dispersion of bilayer graphene within tight binding model. Also,
modifications in bilayer graphene bands due to inplane next nearest neighbour
interactions ($\gamma_{1i}$, $s_{1i}$) and next to next nearest neighbour
interactions ($\gamma_{2i}$, $s_{2i}$) have been studied. It is observed that
$s_1$ introduces further asymmetry in energy positions of top conduction band
and bottom valence band at the $K$ point on top of the asymmetry due to
$\Delta$. Moreover, $s_0$, $s_1$ as well as the other inplane coupling
parameters induce noticable electron-hole asymmetry in the slope of the bands
and changes in band widths. The density of states of bilayer graphene has also
been calculated within the same model.
