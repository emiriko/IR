We explore the effects of over-specificity in learning algorithms by
investigating the behavior of a student, suited to learn optimally from a
teacher $\mathbf{B}$, learning from a teacher $\mathbf{B}'\neq\mathbf{B}$. We
only considered the supervised, on-line learning scenario with teachers
selected from a particular family. We found that, in the general case, the
application of the optimal algorithm to the wrong teacher produces a residual
generalization error, even if the right teacher is harder. By imposing mild
conditions to the learning algorithm form we obtained an approximation for the
residual generalization error. Simulations carried in finite networks validate
the estimate found.
