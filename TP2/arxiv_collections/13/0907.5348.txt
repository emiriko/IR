A compact polarized positron source for Jefferson Lab is discussed. This
scheme relies upon a high polarization (85%), high current (1 mA), low-energy
(<100 MeV) electron beam to generate polarized positrons in a conversion target
via polarized bremsstrahlung and pair creation. GEANT4 is used to simulate
source distributions suitable for a CEBAF-like injector with positron
polarization ~60% and nano-Ampere intensity. An experiment to test this scheme
is outlined.
