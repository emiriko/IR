Barrett, Hardy, and Kent have shown in 2005 that protocols for quantum key
agreement exist the security of which can be proven under the assumption that
quantum or relativity theory is correct. More precisely, this is based on the
non-local behavior of certain quantum systems, combined with the non-signaling
postulate from relativity. An advantage is that the resulting security is
independent of what (quantum) systems the legitimate parties' devices operate
on: they do not have to be trusted. Unfortunately, the protocol proposed by
Barrett et al. cannot tolerate any errors caused by noise in the quantum
channel. Furthermore, even in the error-free case it is inefficient: its
communication complexity is Theta(1/epsilon) when forcing the attacker's
information below epsilon, even if only a single key bit is generated.
Potentially, the problem can be solved by privacy amplification of relativistic
- or non-signaling - secrecy. We show, however, that such privacy amplification
is impossible with respect to the most important form of non-local behavior,
and application of arbitrary hash functions.
