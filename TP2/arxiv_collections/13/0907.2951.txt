Monitoring the performance of large shared computing systems such as the
cloud computing infrastructure raises many challenging algorithmic problems.
One common problem is to track users with the largest deviation from the norm
(outliers), for some measure of performance. Taking a stream-computing
perspective, we can think of each user's performance profile as a stream of
numbers (such as response times), and the aggregate performance profile of the
shared infrastructure as a "braid" of these intermixed streams. The monitoring
system's goal then is to untangle this braid sufficiently to track the top k
outliers. This paper investigates the space complexity of one-pass algorithms
for approximating outliers of this kind, proves lower bounds using multi-party
communication complexity, and proposes small-memory heuristic algorithms. On
one hand, stream outliers are easily tracked for simple measures, such as max
or min, but our theoretical results rule out even good approximations for most
of the natural measures such as average, median, or the quantiles. On the other
hand, we show through simulation that our proposed heuristics perform quite
well for a variety of synthetic data.
