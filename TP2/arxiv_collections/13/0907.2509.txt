In this work Peter principle (in the hierarchical structure any competent
member tends to rise to his level of incompetence) is consistently interpreted
as the discrete form of the well-known logistic (Verhulst or Maltusian)
equation of the population dynamics. According to such interpretation
anti-Peter principle (in the hierarchical structure any incompetent member
tends to rise to his level of competence) is formulated too.
