During the last 4 years the MAGIC collaboration has searched for high-energy
gamma-ray emission of some of the most promising pulsar candidates. The low
energy threshold of MAGIC offered the opportunity for a high sensitivity search
just above 50-100 GeV (since 2008 a new trigger system has decreased the energy
threshold to 25 GeV), an energy region up to now not reachable to ground based
instruments and past satellite borne detectors. No pulsed gamma-ray emission
has been detected from any pulsar observed during the observation campaigns of
2005-2006. Here we present the upper limits obtained for tow canonical pulsars
(PSR J0205+6449 and PSR J2229+6114) and their host nebulae (3C 58 and
Boomerang, respectively) and the millisecond pulsar PSR J0218+4232. Physics
implications will be discussed.
