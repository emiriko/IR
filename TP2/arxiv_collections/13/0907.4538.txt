We present the analysis of $\Upsilon\to e^{+}e^{-}$ production in d+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV from the STAR experiment. Using higher
level dedicated $\Upsilon$ triggers, STAR has sampled 32 nb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity in year 2008 d+Au run. The cross section is found as
$BR\times{({{d\sigma}\over{dy}})}_{y=0}^{\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)}=35\pm4(stat.)\pm5(sys.)$
nb and it is consistent with NLO CEM prediction with anti-shadowing effects. In
addition we calculated the nuclear modification factor
$R_{dAu}=0.98\pm0.32(stat.)\pm0.28(sys.)$, which suggests the
$\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production follows $N_{bin}$ scaling.
