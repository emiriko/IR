We present optical long-slit and SparsePak Integral Field Unit emission line
spectroscopy along with optical broadband and near IR images of the edge-on
spiral galaxy NGC 2683. We find a multi-valued, figure-of-eight velocity
structure in the inner 45 arcsec of the long-slit spectrum and twisted
isovelocity contours in the velocity field. We also find, regardless of
wavelength, that the galaxy isophotes are boxy. We argue that taken together,
these kinematic and photometric features are evidence for the presence of a bar
in NGC 2683. We use our data to constrain the orientation and strength of the
bar.
