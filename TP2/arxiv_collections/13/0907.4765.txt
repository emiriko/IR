A model of the regular arrangement of leaves on a plant stem (phyllotactic
patterns) is proposed, based on a new plant pattern algorithm. Tripartite
patterning is proposed to occur by the interaction of two signaling pathways.
Each pathway produces stimulated extracellular emission of like ligand upon
activation of its respective receptor, as well as inhibiting such emission from
the other pathway. Patterns arise spontaneously from zero density of activated
receptor. All known phyllotactic patterns are reproduced, Fibonacci,
distichous, decussate, and whorls, as well as the rare monostichy, with only
one leaf directly above the previous.
