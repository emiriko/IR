The ability of soft matter such as drops and bubbles to change shape
dynamically during interaction can give rise to counter-intuitive behaviour
that may be expected of rigid materials. Here we show that dimple formation on
approach and the possibility of coalescence on separation of proximal drops in
relative motion are examples of this general dynamic behaviour of soft matter
that arise from the coupling between hydrodynamic forces and geometric
deformations. The key parameter is a film capillary number Caf =
(muVo/sigma)(R/Ho)2 that depends on viscosity mu, interfacial tension sigma,
the Laplace radius R, characteristic film thickness Ho and velocity Vo.
