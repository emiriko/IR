We report on growth of high-aspect-ratio ($\gtrsim300$) zinc sulfide
nanotubes with variable, precisely tunable, wall thicknesses and tube diameters
into highly ordered pores of anodic alumina templates by atomic layer
deposition (ALD) at temperatures as low as 75 $^{\circ}$C. Various
characterization techniques are employed to gain information on the
composition, morphology, and crystal structure of the synthesized samples.
Besides practical applications, the ALD-grown tubes could be envisaged as model
systems for the study of a certain class of size-dependent quantum and
classical phenomena.
