We investigate the possibility that the dark matter consists of clusters of
the heavy family quarks and leptons with zero Yukawa couplings to the lower
families. Such a family is predicted by the approach unifying spins and charges
as the fifth family. We make a rough estimation of properties of baryons of
this new family members and study possible limitations on the family properties
due to the direct experimental and the cosmological evidences, studying the
cosmological evolution of the fifth family clusters.
