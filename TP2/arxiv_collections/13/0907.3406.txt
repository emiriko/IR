Measurements of the effect of a magnetic field on the light output and
current through an organic light emitting diode made with deuterated aluminium
tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) have shown that hyperfine coupling with protons is not
the cause of the intrinsic organic magnetoresistance. We suggest that
interactions with unpaired electrons in the device may be responsible.
