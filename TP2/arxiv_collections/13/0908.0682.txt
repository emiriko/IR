Recurring international financial crises have adverse socioeconomic effects
and demand novel regulatory instruments or strategies for risk management and
market stabilization. However, the complex web of market interactions often
impedes rational decisions that would absolutely minimize the risk. Here we
show that, for any given expected return, investors can overcome this
complexity and globally minimize their financial risk in portfolio selection
models, which is mathematically equivalent to computing the ground state of
spin glass models in physics, provided the margin requirement remains below a
critical, empirically measurable value. For markets with centrally regulated
margin requirements, this result suggests a potentially stabilizing
intervention strategy.
