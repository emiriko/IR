Experimental evidence of strong coupling between excitons confined in a
quantum well and the photonic modes of a two-dimensional dielectric lattice is
reported. Both resonant scattering and photoluminescence spectra at low
temperature show the anticrossing of the polariton branches, fingerprint of
strong coupling regime. The experiments are successfully interpreted in terms
of a quantum theory of exciton-photon coupling in the investigated structure.
These results show that the polariton dispersion can be tailored by properly
varying the photonic crystal lattice parameter, which opens the possibility to
obtain the generation of entangled photon pairs through polariton stimulated
scattering.
