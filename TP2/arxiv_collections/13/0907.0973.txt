The ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique is currently the
most powerful observation method for very high energy gamma rays. With its
specially designed camera and readout system, the MAGIC Telescope is capable of
observing also during nights with a comparatively high level of night-sky
background light. This allows to extend the MAGIC duty cycle by 30% compared to
dark-night observations without moon. Here we investigate the impact of
increased background light on single-pixel level and show the performance of
observations in the presence of moonlight conditions to be consistent with dark
night observations.
