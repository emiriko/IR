The low-carrier ordered phase below the metal-non-metal transition
temperature T_MI ~ 63 K of PrRu4P12 is explored by probing magnetoresistance,
magnetic susceptibility, thermoelectric power, and Hall effect on high quality
single crystals. All the measured properties exhibit the signature of
decimation of the Fermi surface below T_MI and anomalous behaviors below 30 K
including a large thermoelectric power ~-200 uV/K and a giant negative
magnetoresistance (93% at ~0.4 K). The results indicate an additional structure
below 30 K and a semimetal-like ground state. The observed anomalous behaviors
are most likely associated with the novel role of c-f hybridization between
conduction electrons and Pr 4f electrons, whose crystalline electric field
level schemes show drastic change below T_MI.
