The "good" diquark is employed to study $\Lambda_c^{+}$ baryons within a mass
loaded flux tube model. The study indicates that all $\Lambda_c^{+}$ baryons
candidates in the 2008 review by the Particle Data Group (PDG) are well
described in the mass loaded flux tube model. The quantum numbers $J^P$ of
these $\Lambda_c^{+}$ candidates are assigned. If $\Lambda_c(2765)^{+}$ is an
orbitally excited $\Lambda^+_c$, it is likely the $J^P={3\over 2}^+$ one. If
$\Lambda_c(2765)^+$ is an orbitally excited $\Sigma_c$, there ought to be
another $J^P={3\over 2}^+$ $\Lambda^+_c$ with mass $\approx 2770$ MeV. In the
model, there exists no $J^P={1\over 2}^+$ $\Lambda_c(\approx 2700)^+$ predicted
in existing literature. $\Lambda_c(2940)^{+}$ is very possible the orbitally
excited baryon with $J^P={5\over 2}^-$.
