We propose a self-consistent model taking into account variations in
adsorption properties of the adsorbent surface in the process of
adsorption--desorption of molecules of gas on it. We introduce a dimensionless
coupling parameter that characterizes the interaction of an adsorbed molecule
with polarized medium. It is established that the system can be bistable if the
coupling parameter is greater than a critical value and the concentration of
gas belongs to a certain interval. We show that the adsorption isotherms
obtained within the framework of the proposed model essentially differ from the
Langmuir isotherms and establish that the Zeldovich hysteresis is possible. The
kinetics of the surface coverage is analyzed in detail. We show that taking
account of variations in adsorption properties of the surface in the process of
adsorption--desorption leads to new phenomena: a "quasistationary" state in the
case of the overdamped approximation and self-oscillations of the system in the
general case.
