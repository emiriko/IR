The present study is focused on the superscaling behavior of electron-nucleus
cross sections in the region lying above the quasielastic peak, especially the
region dominated by electroexcitation of the Delta. Non-quasielastic cross
sections are obtained from all available high-quality data for Carbon 12 by
subtracting effective quasielastic cross sections based on the superscaling
hypothesis. These residuals are then compared with results obtained within a
scaling-based extension of the relativistic Fermi gas model, including an
investigation of violations of scaling of the first kind in the region above
the quasielastic peak. A way potentially to isolate effects related to
meson-exchange currents by subtracting both impulsive quasielastic and
impulsive inelastic contributions from the experimental cross sections is also
presented.
