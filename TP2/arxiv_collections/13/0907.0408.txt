Extensive studies have demonstrated that finite-range regularization (FRR)
offers significantly improved chiral extrapolations for lattice QCD. These
studies have typically relied on selecting the finite-regularization scale
based upon phenomenological input. Here we report on a preliminary
investigation of a procedure to determine a preferred range of FRR scale based
on nonperturbative lattice results -- without any phenomenological prejudice.
