Epitaxial bilayered thin films consisting of La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (LSMO) and 0.7
Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3 0.3 PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) layers of relatively different thicknesses
were fabricated on LaNiO3 coated LaAlO3 (100) single crystal substrates by
pulsed laser ablation technique. Ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
characteristics of these heterostructures confirmed their biferroic nature. The
magnetization and ferroelectric polarization of the bilayered heterostructures
were enhanced with increasing PMN-PT layer thickness owing to the effect of
lattice strain. Dielectric properties of these heterostructures studied over a
wide range of temperature under different magnetic field strength suggested a
possible role of elastic strain mediated magnetoelectric coupling behind the
observed magneto-dielectric effect in addition to the influence of
rearrangement of the interfacial charge carriers under an applied magnetic
field.
