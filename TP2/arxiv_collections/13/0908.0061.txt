Low energy excitations in the multiferroic material TbMnO3 have been
investigated by Raman spectroscopy. Our observations reveal the existence of
two peaks at 30 cm-1 and 60 cm-1. They are observed in the cycloidal phase
below the Curie temperature but not in the sinusoidal phase, suggesting their
magnetoelectric origin. While the peak energies coincide with the frequencies
of electromagnons measured previously by transmission spectroscopy, they show
surprisingly different selection rules, with the 30 cm-1 excitation enhanced by
the electric field of light along the spontaneous polarization. The origins of
the modes are discussed under Raman and infrared selection rules
considerations.
