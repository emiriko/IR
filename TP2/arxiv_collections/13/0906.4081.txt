Recent results on nucleon resonance studies in $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}p$ electro-
production off protons with the CLAS detector are presented. The analysis of
CLAS data allowed us to determine all essential contributing mechanisms,
providing a credible separation between resonant and non-resonant parts of the
cross sections in a wide kinematical area of invariant masses of the final
hadronic system $1.3<W<1.8$ GeV and photon virtualities $0.2<Q^{2}<1.5$
$GeV^2$. Electrocouplings of several excited proton states with masses less
than 1.8 GeV were obtained for the first time from the analysis of
$\pi^{+}\pi^{-}p$ exclusive electroproduction channel.
