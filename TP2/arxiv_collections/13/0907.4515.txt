We study numerically the edge magnetoconductance of a quantum spin Hall
insulator in the presence of quenched nonmagnetic disorder. For a finite
magnetic field B and disorder strength W on the order of the bulk gap E_g, the
conductance deviates from its quantized value in a manner which appears to be
linear in |B| at small B. The observed behavior is in qualitative agreement
with the cusp-like features observed in recent magnetotransport measurements on
HgTe quantum wells. We propose a dimensional crossover scenario as a function
of W, in which for weak disorder W < E_g the edge liquid is analogous to a
disordered spinless 1D quantum wire, while for strong disorder W > E_g, the
disorder causes frequent virtual transitions to the 2D bulk, where the
originally 1D edge electrons can undergo 2D diffusive motion and 2D
antilocalization.
