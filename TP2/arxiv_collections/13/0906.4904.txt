A global Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of published eclipse photometry
and radial velocities is presented for the transiting planet HD 80606b. Despite
the lack of a complete transit light curve, the size of the planet is measured
with a good level of precision (R_p = 1.04 +0.05-0.09 R_Jup), while the orbital
parameters are refined. This global analysis reveals that the orbital axis of
the planet is significatively inclined relative to the spin axis of the host
star (Beta = -59 +18-28 deg), providing a compelling evidence that HD 80606b
owes its peculiar orbit to the Kozai migration mechanism.
