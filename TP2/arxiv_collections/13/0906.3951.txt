Solar-like oscillations have been observed in numerous red giants from ground
and from space. An important question arises: could we expect to detect
non-radial modes probing the internal structure of these stars? We investigate
under what physical circumstances non-radial modes could be observable in red
giants; what would be their amplitudes, lifetimes and heights in the power
spectrum (PS)? Using a non-radial non-adiabatic pulsation code including a
non-local time-dependent treatment of convection, we compute the theoretical
lifetimes of radial and non-radial modes in several red giant models. Next,
using a stochastic excitation model, we compute the amplitudes of these modes
and their heights in the PS. Very distinct results are found depending on the
evolutionary status of the star.
