We present an approach to simulating quantum computation based on a classical
model that directly imitates discrete quantum systems. Qubits are represented
as harmonic functions in a 2D vector space. Multiplication of qubit
representations of different frequencies results in exponential growth of the
state space similar to the tensor-product composition of qubit spaces in
quantum mechanics. Individual qubits remain accessible in a composite system,
which is represented as a complex function of a single variable, though
entanglement imposes a demand on resources that scales exponentially with the
number of entangled qubits. We carry out a simulation of Shor's algorithm and
discuss a simpler implementation in this classical model.
