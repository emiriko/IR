Magnetars are rotating neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields (~
10^14-10^15 G). X-ray and soft gamma-ray observations have revealed the
existence of non-thermal particle populations which may suggest emission of
very high energy photons. VERITAS, an array of four 12m imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes, is designed to observe gamma-ray emission between 100 GeV
and 30 TeV. Here we present the results of VERITAS observations of two
magnetars, 4U 0142+61 and 1E 2259+586.
