The design and the implementation of a genetic algorithm are described. The
applicability domain is on structure-activity relationships expressed as
multiple linear regressions and predictor variables are from families of
structure-based molecular descriptors. An experiment to compare different
selection and survival strategies was designed and realized. The genetic
algorithm was run using the designed experiment on a set of 206 polychlorinated
biphenyls searching on structure-activity relationships having known the
measured octanol-water partition coefficients and a family of molecular
descriptors. The experiment shows that different selection and survival
strategies create different partitions on the entire population of all possible
genotypes.
