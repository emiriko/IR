We prove that a composition operator is bounded on the Hardy space $H^2$ of
the right half-plane if and only if the inducing map fixes the point at
infinity non-tangentially, and has a finite angular derivative $\lambda$ there.
In this case the norm, essential norm, and spectral radius of the operator are
all equal to $\sqrt{\lambda}$.
