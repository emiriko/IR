Brundan and Kleshchev showed that some parts of the representation theory of
the affine Hecke-Clifford superalgebras and its finite-dimensional "cyclotomic"
quotients are controlled by the Lie theory of type $A^{(2)}_{2l}$ when the
quantum parameter $q$ is a primitive $(2l+1)$-th root of unity. We show in this
paper that similar theorems hold when $q$ is a primitive $4l$-th root of unity
by replacing the Lie theory of type $A^{(2)}_{2l}$ with that of type
$D^{(2)}_{l}$.
