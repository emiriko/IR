We apply the theory of non-inertial frames in Minkowski space-time, developed
in the previous paper, to various relevant physical systems. We give the 3+1
description without coordinate-singularities of the rotating disk and the
Sagnac effect, with added comments on pulsar magnetosphere and on a
relativistic extension of the Earth-fixed coordinate system. Then we study
properties of Maxwell equations in non-inertial frames like the wrap-up effect
and the Faraday rotation in astrophysics.
