We show that flat spectrum of small perturbations of field(s) is generated in
a simple way in a theory of multi-component scalar field provided this theory
is conformally invariant, it has some global symmetry and the quartic potential
is negative. We suggest a mechanism of converting these field perturbations
into adiabatic scalar perturbations with flat spectrum.
