For Dynamical Systems, a strong bound on multiple correlations implies the
Central Limit Theorem (CLT) [ChMa]. In Chernov's paper [Ch2], such a bound is
derived for dynamically Holder continuous observables of dispersing Billiards.
Here we weaken the regularity assumption and subsequently show that the bound
on multiple correlations follows directly from the bound on pair correlations.
Thus, a strong bound on pair correlations alone implies the CLT, for a wider
class of observables. The result is extended to Anosov diffeomorphisms in any
dimension.
