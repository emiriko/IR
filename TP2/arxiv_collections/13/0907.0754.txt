Anhomomorphic logic is a new interpretation of Quantum Theory (due to R.
Sorkin). It is a histories formulation (c.f. consistent histories, quantum
measure theory). In this approach, reality is a co-event, which is essentially
an assignment of a truth value {True, False} to each question. The way this
assignment is done mimics classical physics in as much as possible allowing
however for sufficient flexibility to accommodate quantum 'paradoxes', as is
shown by the analysis of Kochen-Specker theorem. In this contribution, after
briefly reviewing the approach, we will examine how probabilistic predictions
can arise. The Cournot principle and the use of approximate preclusions will
play a crucial role. Facing similar problems in interpreting probability as in
classical probability theory, we will resort to the weak form of Cournot
principle, where possible realities will be preclusive co-events and the
quantum measure is used to obtain predictions. Examples considered, includes
the fair coin and the double slit pattern arguably one of the most important
paradigms for quantum theory.
