The spectral energy distribution from the X-ray to the very high energy
regime ($>100$ GeV) has been investigated for the $\gamma$-ray binary system
PSR B1259-63/SS2883 as a function of orbital phase within the framework of a
simple model of a pulsar wind nebula. The emission model is based on the
synchrotron radiation process for the X-ray regime and the inverse Compton
scattering process boosting stellar photons from the Be star companion to the
very high energy (100GeV-TeV) regime. With this model, the observed temporal
behavior can, in principle, be used to probe the pulsar wind properties at the
shock as a function of the orbital phase. Due to theoretical uncertainties in
the detailed microphysics of the acceleration process and the conversion of
magnetic energy into particle kinetic energy, the observed X-ray data for the
entire orbit are fit using two different methods.
