The problem of center-of-mass (CM) contaminations in ab initio nuclear
structure calculations using configuration interaction (CI) and coupled-cluster
(CC) approaches is analyzed. A rigorous and quantitative scheme for diagnosing
the CM contamination of intrinsic observables is proposed and applied to
ground-state calculations for He-4 and O-16. The CI and CC calculations for
O-16 based on model spaces defined via a truncation of the single-particle
basis lead to sizable CM contaminations, while the importance-truncated no-core
shell model based on the $N_{\max}\hbar\Omega$ space is virtually free of CM
contaminations.
