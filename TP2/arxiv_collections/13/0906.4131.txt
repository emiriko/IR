Image segmentation techniques are predominately based on parameter-laden
optimization. The objective function typically involves weights for balancing
competing image fidelity and segmentation regularization cost terms. Setting
these weights suitably has been a painstaking, empirical process. Even if such
ideal weights are found for a novel image, most current approaches fix the
weight across the whole image domain, ignoring the spatially-varying properties
of object shape and image appearance. We propose a novel technique that
autonomously balances these terms in a spatially-adaptive manner through the
incorporation of image reliability in a graph-based segmentation framework. We
validate on synthetic data achieving a reduction in mean error of 47% (p-value
<< 0.05) when compared to the best fixed parameter segmentation. We also
present results on medical images (including segmentations of the corpus
callosum and brain tissue in MRI data) and on natural images.
