Spontaneous CP violation motivates the introduction of two Higgs doublets in
the electroweak theory, such a simple extension of the standard model has five
physical Higgs bosons and rich CP-violating sources. Exploration on more than
one Higgs boson is a direct evidence for new physics beyond the standard model.
The neutral Higgs production at LHC is investigated in such a general two Higgs
doublet model with spontaneous CP violation, it is shown that the production
cross section and decays of the neutral Higgs boson can significantly be
different from the predictions from the standard model.
