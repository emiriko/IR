AdS/QCD is an extra-dimensional approach to modeling hadronic physics,
motivated by the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory. AdS/QCD models are
often more accurate than would have been expected at energies below a few GeV.
We address the question of why these models are so successful, and respond to
some of the criticisms that have been waged against these models.
