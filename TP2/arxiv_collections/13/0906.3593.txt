A crab cavity is required in the CLIC to allow effective head-on collision of
bunches at the IP. A high operating frequency is preferred as the deflection
voltage required for a given rotation angle and the RF phase tolerance for a
crab cavity are inversely proportional to the operating frequency. The short
bunch spacing of the CLIC scheme and the high sensitivity of the crab cavity to
dipole kicks demand very high damping of the inter-bunch wakes, the major
contributor to the luminosity loss of colliding bunches. This paper
investigates the nature of the wakefields in the CLIC crab cavity and the
possibility of using various damping schemes to suppress them effectively.
