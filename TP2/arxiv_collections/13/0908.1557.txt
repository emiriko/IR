An affine rearrangement inequality is established which strengthens and
implies the recently obtained affine P\'olya--Szeg\"o symmetrization principle
for functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Several applications of this new inequality
are derived. In particular, a sharp affine logarithmic Sobolev inequality is
established which is stronger than its classical Euclidean counterpart.
