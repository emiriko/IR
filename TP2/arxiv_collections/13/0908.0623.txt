We implemented a triply entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ)-like state
and coherently manipulated the spin, path, and energy degrees of freedom in a
single neutron system. The GHZ-like state was analyzed with an inequality
derived by Mermin: we determined the four expectation values and finally
obtained M = 2.558 +/- 0.004 > 2, which exhibits a clear violation of the
noncontextual assumption and confirms quantum contextuality.
