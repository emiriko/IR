Using a semiclassical ansatz we analytically predict for the fidelity of
delta-kicked rotors the occurrence of revivals and the disappearance of
intermediate revival peaks arising from the breaking of a symmetry in the
initial conditions. A numerical verification of the predicted effects is given
and experimental ramifications are discussed.
