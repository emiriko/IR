In this letter, we report on all-optical fiber approach to the generation of
ultra-low noise microwave signals. We make use of two erbium fiber mode-locked
lasers phase locked to a common ultra-stable laser source to generate an 11.55
GHz signal with an unprecedented relative phase noise of -111 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz
from the carrier.The residual frequency instability of the microwave signals
derived from the two optical frequency combs is below 2.3 10^(-16) at 1s and
about 4 10^(-19) at 6.5 10^(4)s (in 5 Hz bandwidth, three days continuous
operation).
