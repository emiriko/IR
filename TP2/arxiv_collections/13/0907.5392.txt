The PAMELA positron excess is analyzed within the framework of nonuniversal
SUGRA models with an extended $U(1)^n$ gauge symmetry in the hidden sector
leading to neutralino dark matter with either a mixed Higgsino-wino LSP or an
essentially pure wino dominated LSP. The Higgsino-wino LSP can produce the
observed PAMELA positron excess and satisfy relic density constraints in the
extended class of models due to a near degeneracy of the mass spectrum of the
extended neutralino sector with the LSP mass. The simultaneous satisfaction of
the WMAP relic density data and the PAMELA data is accomplished through a
co-annihilation mechanism ($B_{\rm Co}-mechanism$), and leads to predictions of
a neutralino and a chargino in the mass range (180-200) GeV as well as low
lying sparticles accessible at colliders. We show that the models are
consistent with the antiproton constraints from PAMELA as well as photon flux
data from EGRET and FERMI-LAT. Predictions for the scalar neutralino proton
cross section relevant for the direct detection of dark matter are also
discussed and signatures at the LHC for these PAMELA inspired models are
analyzed. It is shown that the mixed Higgsino-wino LSP model will be
discoverable with as little as 1 fb$^{-1}$ of data and is thus a prime
candidate for discovery in the low luminosity runs at the LHC.
