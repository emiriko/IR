The large number and all-sky distribution of quasars from different surveys,
along with their presence in large, deep astrometric catalogs,enables the
building of an optical materialization of the ICRS following its defining
principles. Namely: that it is kinematically non-rotating with respect to the
ensemble of distant extragalactic objects; aligned with the mean equator and
dynamical equinox of J2000; and realized by a list of adopted coordinates of
extragalatic sources. Starting from the updated and presumably complete LQAC
list of QSOs, the initial optical positions of those quasars are found in the
USNO B1.0 and GSC2.3 catalogs, and from the SDSS DR5. The initial positions are
next placed onto UCAC2-based reference frames, following by an alignment with
the ICRF, to which were added the most precise sources from the VLBA calibrator
list and the VLA calibrator list - when reliable optical counterparts exist.
Finally, the LQRF axes are inspected through spherical harmonics, contemplating
to define right ascension, declination and magnitude terms. The LQRF contains
J2000 referred equatorial coordinates for 100,165 quasars, well represented
across the sky, from -83.5 to +88.5 degrees in declination, and with 10 arcmin
being the average distance between adjacent elements. The global alignment with
the ICRF is 1.5 mas, and the individual position accuracies are represented by
a Poisson distribution that peaks at 139 mas in right ascension and 130 mas in
declination. It is complemented by redshift and photometry information from the
LQAC. The LQRF is designed to be an astrometric frame, but it is also the basis
for the GAIA mission initial quasars' list, and can be used as a test bench for
quasars' space distribution and luminosity function studies.
