Since 1997 the neutrino telescope AMANDA at the geographic South Pole has
been monitoring our Galaxy for neutrino bursts from supernovae. Triggers were
introduced in 2004 to submit burst candidates to the Supernova Early Warning
System SNEWS. From 2007 the burst search was extended to the much larger
IceCube telescope, which now supersedes AMANDA. By exploiting the low
photomultiplier noise in the antarctic ice (on average 280Hz for IceCube),
neutrino bursts from nearby supernovae can be identified by the induced
collective rise in the pulse rates. Although only a counting experiment,
IceCube will provide the world's most precise measurement of the time profile
of a neutrino burst near the galactic center. The sensitivity to neutrino
properties such as the theta13 mixing angle and the neutrino hierarchy are
discussed as well as the possibility to detect the deleptonization burst.
