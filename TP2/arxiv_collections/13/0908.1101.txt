We investigate the collisional stability of a sample of 40K atoms immersed in
a tunable spin mixture of 6Li atoms. In this three-component Fermi-Fermi
mixture, we find very low loss rates in a wide range of interactions as long as
molecule formation of 6Li is avoided. The stable fermionic mixture with two
resonantly interacting spin states of one species together with another species
is a promising system for a broad variety of phenomena in few- and many-body
quantum physics.
