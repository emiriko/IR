The symmetry of the superconductivity in Bechgaard salts is still unknown,
though the triplet pairing has been established by Hc2 and NMR for (TMTSF)2PF6.
The large upper critical field at T = 0K (Hc2 ~ 5 Tesla) both for H || a and H
|| b also indicates strongly the triplet pairing.
  Here we start with a low energy effective Hamiltonian and study the
temperature dependence of the corresponding Hc2(T)'s.
  The present analysis suggests that one chiral f-wave superconductor should be
the most likely candidate near the upper critical field.
