According to GSI experiment Phys.Lett.B 664, 162 (2008), the rate of the
daughter ion production by the K-shell electron capture (with neutrino
emission) in H-like ions 142Pm, 140Pr and 152I is modulated with a period of 6
to 7 seconds. In PRL 103, 062502, 2009 by Ivanov and Kienle (also by Lipkin})
there is a claim that neutrino oscillations may explain this result. In
arXiv:0811.2302 by Lambiase et al a different explanation is suggested which is
based on the rotation of electron and nuclear spins. The aim of this Comment is
to show why these explanations are not satisfactory and to discuss other
possibilities.
