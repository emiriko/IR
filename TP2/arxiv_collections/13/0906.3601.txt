The temperature dependence of the magnetic order of stripe-ordered
La(1.725)Sr(0.275)NiO(4) is investigated by neutron diffraction. Upon cooling,
the widths if the magnetic Bragg peaks are observed to broaden. The degree of
broadening is found to be very different for l = odd-integer and l =
even-integer magnetic peaks. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result
of competition between magnetic and charge order.
