The standard theory of cosmic structure formation posits that the present-day
rich structure of the Universe developed through gravitational amplification of
tiny matter density fluctuations generated in its very early history. Recent
observations of the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and
distant supernovae determined the energy content of the Universe and the basic
statistics of the initial density field with great accuracy. It has become
possible to make accurate predictions for the formation and nonlinear growth of
structure from early to the present epochs. We review recent progress in the
theory of structure formation in the universe. We focus on the formation of the
first cosmological objects. Results from state-of-the-art numerical simulations
are presented. Finally, we discuss prospects for future observations of the
first generation of stars and galaxies.
