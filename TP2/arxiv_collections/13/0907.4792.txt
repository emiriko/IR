M87 is a nearby radio galaxy and because of its misaligned jet, it is
possible to correlate detailed spatially-resolved emission regions in the
radio, optical to X-ray waveband with unresolved but contemporaneous flux
measurements in the TeV regime. Hence, M87 provides a unique opportunity to
reveal the emission mechanisms responsible for high energy gamma-ray emission
from active galactic nuclei. Observations with VERITAS since 2007 have resulted
in 90 hours of data while 2008 observations were part of a concerted effort
involving the three major atmospheric Cherenkov observatories: H.E.S.S., MAGIC
and VERITAS. As a result of the TeV campaign, a high flux state of M87 was
detected in February 2008 showing multiple flares with rapid variability. We
will present the comprehensive results from VERITAS observations since 2007 and
also show preliminary results from the 2009 campaign.
