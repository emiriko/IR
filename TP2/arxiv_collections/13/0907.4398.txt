We present a direct measurement of trilinear gauge boson couplings at gammaWW
and ZWW vertices in WW and WZ events produced in pp-bar collisions at
sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. We consider events with one electron or muon, missing
transverse energy, and at least two jets. The data were collected using the D0
detector and correspond to 1.1/fb of integrated luminosity. Considering two
different relations between the couplings at the gammaWW and ZWW vertices, we
measure these couplings at 68% C.L. to be kappa_{gamma}=1.07^{+0.26}_{-0.29},
lambda =0.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06} and g_{1}^{Z}=1.04^{+0.09}_{-0.09} in a scenario
respecting SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge symmetry and kappa =1.04^{+0.11}_{-0.11} and
lambda=0.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06} in an "equal couplings" scenario.
