We investigate a linear sigma model with global chiral $U(2)_{R} \times
U(2)_{L}$ symmetry. The mesonic degrees of freedom are the standard scalar and
pseudoscalar mesons and the vector and axial-vector mesons. The baryonic
degrees of freedom are the nucleon, $N$, and its chiral partner, $N^{*}$, which
is usually identified with N(1535). The chiral partner is incorporated in the
so-called mirror assignment, where the nucleon mass is not solely generated by
the chiral condensate but also by a chirally invariant mass term, $m_{0}$. The
presence of (axial-) vector fields modifies the expressions for the axial
coupling constants of the nucleon, $g_{A}^{N}$, and its partner,
$g_{A}^{N^{*}}$. Using experimental data for the decays $N^{*} \to N \pi$ and
$a_{1} \to\pi\gamma$, as well as lattice results for $g_{A}^{N^{*}}$ we infer
$m_{0}\sim500$ MeV, i.e., an appreciable amount of the nucleon mass originates
from sources other than the chiral condensate. We test our model by evaluating
the decay $N^{*} \to N \eta$ and the s-wave nucleon-pion scattering lengths
$a_{0}^{(\pm)}$.
