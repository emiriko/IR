In this article, we study the pseudoscalar bound state $\eta_c'f_0(980)$
(irrespective of the hadro-charmonium and the molecular state) with the QCD sum
rules. Considering the SU(3) symmetry of the light flavor quarks and the heavy
quark symmetry, we also study the bound states $\eta_c'\sigma(400-1200)$,
$\eta_b'''f_0(980)$ and $\eta_b'''\sigma(400-1200)$, and make reasonable
predictions for their masses.
