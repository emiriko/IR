In this work, we study the radiative open-charm decays $Y(4140)\to
{D}_s^{\ast+} D_s^- \gamma$ and $Y(3930)\to{D}^{\ast+} D^-\gamma$ under the
assignments of $D_{s}^*\bar{D}_s^*$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ as molecular states for
Y(4140) and Y(3930) respectively. Based on our numerical result, we propose the
experimental measurement of the photon spectrum of $Y(4140)\to {D}_s^{\ast+}
D_s^- \gamma, D_{s}^+D_{s}^{*-}\gamma$ and $Y(3930)\to D^{*0}\bar{D}^0\gamma,
D^{0}\bar{D}^{*0}\gamma, D^{*+}D^-\gamma, D^+D^{*-}\gamma$ can further test the
molecular assignment for Y(4140) and Y(3930).
