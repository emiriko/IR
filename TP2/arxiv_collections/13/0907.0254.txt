The asymmetry in the angular distribution of n p --> d pi^0 due to Charge
Symmetry Breaking is calculated using Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory.
Recent developments in power counting have proven successful in describing
total cross sections, and we apply them to the asymmetry calculation.
Reducibility in one of the leading order diagrams is examined. We compare the
updated theory with experimental results for a range of physically reasonable
parameters and find over-prediction for the entire range.
