We present an effective Lagrangian for low-scale technicolor. It describes
the interactions at energies near the mass of the lowest-lying bound states of
the lightest technifermion doublet -- the spin-one $\rho_T,\omega_T, a_T, f_T$
and the corresponding technipions $\pi_T$. This Lagrangian is intended to put
on firmer ground the technicolor straw-man phenomenology used for collider
searches of low-scale technicolor. The technivectors are described using the
hidden local symmetry (HLS) formalism of Bando et al. The Lagrangian is based
on $SU(2)\otimes U(1)\otimes U(2)_L \otimes U(2)_R$, where $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$
is the electroweak gauge group and $U(2)_L \otimes U(2)_R$ is the HLS gauge
group. Special attention is paid to the higher-derivative standard HLS and
Wess-Zumino-Witten interactions needed to describe radiative and other decays
of the $a_T$ and $\rho_T/\omega_T$, respectively.
