Using a sample of 2.59 x 10^7$ psi(2S) decays collected by the CLEO--c
detector, we present results of a search for the decay chain psi(2S) -> pi^0
h_c, h_c -> n(pi^+ pi^-) pi^0, n=1,2,3. We observe no significant signals for
n=1 and n=3 and set upper limits for the corresponding decay rates. First
evidence for the decay h_c {\o}pi^+ pi^- pi^+ pi^- pi^0 is presented, and a
product branching fraction of B(psi(2S) -> h_c) x B(h_c -> 2(pi^+ pi^-)
pi^0)=1.88^{+0.48+0.47}_{-0.45-0.30} x 10^{-5} is measured. This result implies
that h_c -> $ hadrons and h_c -> gamma eta_c have comparable rates, in
agreement with expectations.
