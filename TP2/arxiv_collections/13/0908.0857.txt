Relations between the gaugino masses have been shown to alleviate the degree
of fine-tuning in the MSSM. In this paper we consider specific models of
supersymmetry breaking with gravity mediation and demonstrate that within both
GUT and string constructions it is possible to generate these relations in a
natural way. We have numerically studied the degree of fine-tuning in these
models, including one-loop corrections, and have found regions of parameter
space that can satisfy all known collider constraints with fine-tunings less
than 20%. We discuss some of the phenomenological features of these models
within the regions of reduced fine-tuning.
