In this paper we present the results of a study of the spatial distribution
and asymmetry of solar active prominences (SAP) for the period 1996-2007 (solar
cycle 23). For more meaningful statistical analysis we have analysed the
distribution and asymmetry of SAP in two subdivisions viz. Group1 (ADF, APR,
DSF, CRN, CAP) and Group2 (AFS, ASR, BSD, BSL, DSD, SPY, LPS). The north-south
(N-S) latitudinal distribution shows that the SAP events are most prolific in
the 21-30degree slice in the northern and southern hemispheres and east-west
(E-W) longitudinal distribution study shows that the SAP events are most
prolific (best visible) in the 81-90degree slice in the eastern and western
hemispheres. It has been found that the SAP activity during this cycle is low
compared to previous solar cycles. The present study indicates that during the
rising phase of the cycle the number of SAP events were roughly equal on the
north and south hemispheres. However, activity on the southern hemisphere has
been dominant since 1999. Our statistical study shows that the N-S asymmetry is
more significant then the E-W asymmetry.
