We report an optical investigation on the in-plane charge dynamics for
Na$_{1-\delta}$FeAs single crystal. A clear optical evidence for the
spin-density wave (SDW) gap is observed. As the structural/magnetic transitions
are separated in the Na$_{1-\delta}$FeAs case, we find the SDW gap opens in
accordance with the magnetic transition. Comparing with the optical response of
other FeAs-based parent compounds, both the gap value 2$\Delta$ and the energy
scale for the gap-induced spectral weight redistribution are smaller in
Na$_{1-\delta}$FeAs. Our findings support the itinerant origin of the
antiferromagnetic transition in the FeAs-based system.
