We report on the measurements of strange hadron ($K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$)
production in the most central (0-20%) d+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200
GeV in STAR. Significant strangeness enhancement is observed in the most
central d+Au collisions, especially for multi-strange hyperons ($\Xi$). The
nuclear modification factor ($R_{dAu}$) of identified particles shows possible
particle type -- baryon (protons, $\Lambda$), meson ($\pi$,$K^0_S$, $\phi$) --
dependence at intermediate $p_T$ (2 - 3.5 GeV/c), indicating that the final
state may have an impact on the Cronin effect.
