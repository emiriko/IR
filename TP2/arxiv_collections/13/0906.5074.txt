We develop a statistical theory that describes quantum-mechanical scattering
of a particle by a cavity when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics
is chaotic. This picture is relevant to a variety of physical systems, ranging
from atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems and microwave cavities; the main
application to be discussed in this contribution is to electronic transport
through mesoscopic ballistic structures or quantum dots. The theory describes
the regime in which there are two distinct time scales, associated with a
prompt and an equilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of
scattering amplitudes S. We construct the ensemble of S matrices using a
maximum-entropy approach which incorporates the requirements of flux
conservation, causality and ergodicity, and the system-specific average of S
which quantifies the effect of prompt processes. The resulting ensemble, known
as Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those situations in which any other
information is irrelevant. The results of this formulation have been compared
with the numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation for cavities in which
the assumptions of the theory hold. The model has a remarkable predictive
power: it describes statistical properties of the quantum conductance of
quantum dots, like its average, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in
several cases. We also discuss situations that have been found recently, in
which the notion of stationarity and ergodicity is not fulfilled, and yet
Poisson's kernel gives a good description of the data. At the present moment we
are unable to give an explanation of this fact.
