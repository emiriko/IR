We study the matter-wave bistability in coupled atom-molecule quantum gases,
in which heteronuclear molecules are created via an interspecies Feshbach
resonance involving either two-species Bose or two-species Fermi atoms at zero
temperature. We show that the resonant two-channel Bose model is equivalent to
the nondegenerate parametric down-conversion in quantum optics, while the
corresponding Fermi model can be mapped to a quantum optics model that
describes a single-mode laser field interacting with an ensemble of
inhomogeneously broadened two-level atoms. Using these analogy and the fact
that both models are subject to the Kerr nonlinearity due to the two-body
s-wave collisions, we show that under proper conditions, the population in the
molecular state in both models can be made to change with the Feshbach detuning
in a bistable fashion.
