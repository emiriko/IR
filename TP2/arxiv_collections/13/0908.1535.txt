A simple exact covariant model in which a scalar particle is modeled as a
bound state of two different particles is used to elucidate relativistic
aspects of electromagnetic form factors. The model form factor is computed
using an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and
shown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning
of transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing
us to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form
factor. We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not
observable because of the failure to uphold current conservation. Neutral
systems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier
one is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is
argued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in
pion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The
non-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy
to that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the
influence of relativistic effects. The exact relativistic formula for the form
factor reduces to the familiar one of the three-dimensional Fourier transform
of a square of a wave function for a very limited range of parameters. For
masses that mimic the quark-di-quark model of the nucleon we find substantial
relativistic corrections for any value of $Q^2$. A schematic model of the
lowest s-states of nuclei is used to find that relativistic effects decrease
the form factor for light nuclei but increase the form factor for heavy nuclei.
Furthermore, these states are strongly influenced by relativity.
