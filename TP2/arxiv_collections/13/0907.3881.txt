We analyze the diffusion processes associated to equations of Wright-Fisher
type in one spatial dimension. These are defined by a degenerate second order
operator on the interval [0, 1], where the coefficient of the second order term
vanishes simply at the endpoints, and the first order term is an
inward-pointing vector field. We consider various aspects of this problem,
motivated by applications in population genetics, including a sharp regularity
theory for the zero flux boundary conditions, as well as a derivation of the
precise asymptotics for solutions of this equation, both as t goes to 0 and
infinity, and as x goes to 0, 1.
