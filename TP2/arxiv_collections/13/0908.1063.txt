The most popular method to construct initial data for black-hole-binary
simulations is the puncture method, in which compactified wormholes are given
linear and angular momentum via the Bowen-York extrinsic curvature. When these
data are evolved, they quickly approach a ``trumpet'' topology, suggesting that
it would be preferable to use data that are in trumpet form from the outset. To
achieve this, we extend the puncture method to allow the construction of
Bowen-York trumpets, including an outline of an existence and uniqueness proof
of the solutions. We construct boosted, spinning and binary Bowen-York puncture
trumpets using a single-domain pseudospectral elliptic solver, and evolve the
binary data and compare with standard wormhole-data results. We also show that
for boosted trumpets the black-hole mass can be prescribed {\it a priori},
without recourse to the iterative procedure that is necessary for wormhole
data.
