Here, for the first time we predict a giant surface plasmon-induced drag
effect (SPIDEr), which exists under conditions of the extreme nanoplasmonic
confinement. Under realistic conditions, in nanowires, this giant SPIDEr
generates rectified THz potential differences up to 10 V and extremely strong
electric fields up to 10^5-10^6 V/cm. The SPIDEr is an ultrafast effect whose
bandwidth for nanometric wires is 20 THz. The giant SPIDEr opens up a new field
of ultraintense THz nanooptics with wide potential applications in
nanotechnology and nanoscience, including microelectronics,nanoplasmonics, and
biomedicine.
