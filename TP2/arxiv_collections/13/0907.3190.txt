We report on recent inter-calibration studies featuring Swift's Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) and Fermi's Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) based upon correlated
observations of GRBs 080804 and 080810, via their resultant joint spectral
analysis. Swift's intrinsic multi-wavelength instrumentation and dynamical
response complement Fermi's superior energy range. The addition of BAT's
spectral response will (i) facilitate in-orbit GBM detector response
calibration, (ii) augment Fermi's low energy sensitivity, (iii) enable
ground-based follow-up efforts of Fermi GRBs, and (iv) help identify a subset
of GRBs discovered via off-line GBM data analysis, for an annual estimate of
~30 GRBs. The synergy of BAT and GBM augments previous successful joint
spectral fit efforts by enabling the study of peak photon energies (Epeak),
while leveraging the over eleven energy decades afforded by Fermi's Large Area
Telescope (LAT), in conjunction with Swift's X-Ray (XRT) and
Ultraviolet-Optical (UVOT) Telescopes, for an unprecedented probe of broad-band
spectral and temporal evolution, throughout their contemporaneous orbital
tenure over the next decade.
