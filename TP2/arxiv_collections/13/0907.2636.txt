We study the energetic aspects of hybrid pressure-gravity modes pulsations.
The case of hybrid beta Cephei-SPB pulsators is considered with special
attention. In addition to the already known sensitivity of the driving
mechanism to the heavy elements mixture (mainly the iron abundance), we show
that the characteristics of the propagation and evanescent regions play also a
major role, determining the extension of the stable gap in the frequency domain
between the unstable low order pressure and high order gravity modes. Finally,
we consider the case of hybrid delta Sct-gamma Dor pulsators.
