By tuning several experimental observables, such as momentum and reaction
plane, the PHENIX experiment has performed a systematic study of high $p_T$
parton energy loss in hot nuclear matter, as well as jet induced medium
modifications, such as the ridge and shoulder. Baseline d+Au measurements are
also studied to provide the comparison as control of cold nuclear matter
effect.
