We have designed, fabricated and operated a scalable system for applying
independently programmable time-independent, and limited time-dependent flux
biases to control superconducting devices in an integrated circuit. Here we
report on the operation of a system designed to supply 64 flux biases to
devices in a circuit designed to be a unit cell for a superconducting adiabatic
quantum optimization system. The system requires six digital address lines, two
power lines, and a handful of global analog lines.
