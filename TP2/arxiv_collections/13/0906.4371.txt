Five new correlations between sunspot activity and orbiting position of the
Jovian planets are detected. In order to explain these correlations it is
suggested that the resonance of the outer planets destabilizes the orbit of
Kuiper Belt Objects and generates a cyclical impact frequency on the Sun. The
vaporization of the object initiates a shock way disrupting the upwelling of
the plasma resulting in a sunspot formation. The proposed model is able to
explain the length of the cycle, the latitude distribution of the sunspots and
the extremely long term stability of the cycles. Calculating the positions of
the Jovian planets at conjunction and opposition allows the long term
prediction of the solar activity.
