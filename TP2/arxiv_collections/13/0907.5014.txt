In an earlier work (arXiv:0808.0953) we established that causal
Israel-Stewart viscous hydrodynamics is only accurate in RHIC applications at
very low shear viscosities 4 pi eta_s / s < ~ 1.5-2. We show here that the
region of applicability is significantly reduced if bulk viscosity plays a role
in the dynamics.
