In this article we introduce a generalization of the popular DFT+U method
based on the extended Hubbard model that includes on-site and inter-site
electronic interactions. The novel corrective Hamiltonian is designed to study
systems for which electrons are not completely localized on atomic states
(according to the general scheme of Mott localization) and hybridization
between orbitals from different sites plays an important role. The application
of the extended functional to archetypal Mott - charge-transfer (NiO) and
covalently bonded insulators (Si and GaAs) demonstrates its accuracy and
versatility and the possibility to obtain a unifying and equally accurate
description for a broad range of very diverse systems.
