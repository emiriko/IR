Fundamental symmetry tests with neutrons can provide unique information about
whatever will be the new Standard Model of fundamental interactions. I review
two aspects of this possibility: searches for the permanent electric dipole
moment of the neutron and its relation to the origin of baryonic matter, and
precision studies of neutron decay that can probe new symmetries. I discuss the
complementarity of these experiments with other low-energy precision tests and
high energy collider searches for new physics.
