The total set of the 14 active galactic nuclei detected by MAGIC so far
includes well-studied bright blazars like Mkn 501, the giant radio galaxy M 87,
but also the distant flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 279, and an intriguing
gamma-ray source in the 3C 66A/B region, whose energy spectrum is not
compatible with the expectations from 3C 66A. Besides scheduled observations,
so far MAGIC succeeded in discovering TeV gamma rays from three blazars
following triggers from high optical states. I report selected highlights from
recent MAGIC observations of extragalactic TeV gamma-ray sources, emphasizing
and discussing the new physics insights the MAGIC observations were able to
contribute.
