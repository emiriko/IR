We study the interplay between flavor symmetries and leptogenesis in the case
when the scale of flavor symmetry breaking is higher than the scale at which
lepton number is violated. We show that when the heavy Majorana neutrinos
belong to an irreducible representation of the flavor group, all the
leptogenesis CP asymmetries vanish in the limit of exact symmetry. In the case
of reducible representations we identify a general condition that, if
satisfied, guarantees the same result. We then focus on the case of a model in
which an $A_4$ flavor symmetry yields a drastic reduction in the number of free
parameters, implying that at leading order several quantities are only a
function of the lightest neutrino mass $m_l$, which in turn is strongly
constrained. For normal ordering (NO) we find m_l\simeq (0.0044 \div 0.0056) eV
while for inverted ordering (IO) m_l\gtrsim 0.017 eV. For the 0\nu2\beta decay
parameter this yields |m_{ee}|\simeq (0.006\div 0.007) eV (NO) and
|m_{ee}|\gsim 0.017 eV (IO). We show that the leptogenesis CP asymmetries only
depend on m_l, on a single non-hierarchical Yukawa coupling y, and on two
parameters that quantify the flavor symmetry breaking effects, and we argue
that the unflavored regime for leptogenesis is strongly preferred in our model,
thus realizing a rather predictive scenario. Performing a calculation of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry we find that for NO the observed value is easily
reproduced for natural values of the symmetry breaking parameters. For IO
successful leptogenesis is possible for a limited choice of the parameters
implying rather large reheating temperatures T_reh\gtrsim 5*10^13 GeV.
