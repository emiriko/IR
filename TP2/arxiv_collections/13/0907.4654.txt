Violation of a Bell-like inequality for a spin-energy entangled neutron state
has been confirmed in a polarimetric experiment. The proposed inequality, in
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) formalism, relies on correlations between the
spin and energy degree of freedom in a single-neutron system. The entangled
states are generated utilizing a suitable combination of two radio-frequency
fields in a neutron polarimeter setup. The correlation function S is determined
to be 2.333+/-0.005, which violates the Bell-like CHSH inequality by more than
66 standard deviations.
