Whilst not all spreadsheet defects are structural in nature, poor layout
choices can compromise spreadsheet quality. These defects may be avoided at the
development stage by some simple mistake prevention and detection devices.
Poka-Yoke (Japanese for Mistake Proofing), which owes its genesis to the Toyota
Production System (the standard for manufacturing excellence throughout the
world) offers some principles that may be applied to reducing spreadsheet
defects. In this paper we examine spreadsheet structure and how it can lead to
defects and illustrate some basic spreadsheet Poka-Yokes to reduce them. These
include guidelines on how to arrange areas of cells so that whole rows and
columns can be inserted anywhere without causing errors, and rules for when to
use relative and absolute references with respect to what type of area is being
referred to.
