We propose ten puzzles in particle theory: quark, asymmetries of quantum
numbers in the Standard Model, point particle and interaction-distance, mystic
Higgs mechanism, possible violation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle and some
basic principles, neutrino and its oscillation, uncertainty principle and
superstring, the superposition principle and entangled state, the wave property
and duality, dark matter and dark energy. In particular, it is discussed that
quarks possess many questions, and are possibly only some symmetrical magic
particles.
