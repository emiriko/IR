A new model method for describing of the electrostatic screening in
two-component systems (electron-ion plasmas, dusty plasmas, electrolytes, etc)
is developed. The method is applicable to the systems of higher non-ideality
degree. The expressions for all the screening parameters introduced in the
previous paper (Part 1) of this work, as well as for an additional parameter
characteristic for multi-component systems, are obtained. All these parameters
are presented in a simple analytic form suitable for operative laboratory
usage, especially for theoretical interpretation of experimental data.
