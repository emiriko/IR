The SUSY breaking in Cybersusy is proportional to the VEV that breaks the
gauge symmetry SU(2) X U(1) down to U(1), and it is rather specific to models
like the SSM. Assuming full breaking, as explained below, for the leptons,
Cybersusy predicts a spectrum of SUSY breaking that is in accord with
experimental results so far. In particular, for the choice of parameters below,
Cybersusy predicts that the lowest mass superpartner for the charged leptons is
a charged vector boson lepton (the Velectron), which has a mass of 316 Gev .
The Selectron has a mass of 771 Gev for that choice of parameters. The theory
also leads to a zero cosmological constant after SUSY breaking. The mechanism
generates equations that restrict models like the SSM. This version of this
paper incorporates recent results and changes discovered subsequent to the
talk.
