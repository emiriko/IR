This is a written version of the opening talk at the 6th International
Workshop on Chiral Dynamics, at the University of Bern, Switzerland, July 6,
2009, to be published in the proceedings of the Workshop. In it, I reminisce
about the early development of effective field theories of the strong
interactions, comment briefly on some other applications of effective field
theories, and then take up the idea that the Standard Model and General
Relativity are the leading terms in an effective field theory. Finally, I cite
recent calculations that suggest that the effective field theory of gravitation
and matter is asymptotically safe.
