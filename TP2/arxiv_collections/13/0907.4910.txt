In this paper we consider the new agegraphic model of interacting dark energy
in non-flat universe. We show that the interacting agegraphic dark energy can
be described by a phantom scalar field. Then we show this phantomic description
of the agegraphic dark energy and reconstruct the potential of the phantom
scalar field.
