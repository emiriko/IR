Point configurations have been widely used as model systems in condensed
matter physics, materials science and biology. Statistical descriptors such as
the $n$-body distribution function $g_n$ is usually employed to characterize
the point configurations, among which the most extensively used is the pair
distribution function $g_2$. An intriguing inverse problem of practical
importance that has been receiving considerable attention is the degree to
which a point configuration can be reconstructed from the pair distribution
function of a target configuration. Although it is known that the pair-distance
information contained in $g_2$ is in general insufficient to uniquely determine
a point configuration, this concept does not seem to be widely appreciated and
general claims of uniqueness of the reconstructions using pair information have
been made based on numerical studies. In this paper, we introduce the idea of
the distance space, called the $\mathbb{D}$ space. The pair distances of a
specific point configuration are then represented by a single point in the
$\mathbb{D}$ space. We derive the conditions on the pair distances that can be
associated with a point configuration, which are equivalent to the
realizability conditions of the pair distribution function $g_2$. Moreover, we
derive the conditions on the pair distances that can be assembled into distinct
configurations. These conditions define a bounded region in the $\mathbb{D}$
space. By explicitly constructing a variety of degenerate point configurations
using the $\mathbb{D}$ space, we show that pair information is indeed
insufficient to uniquely determine the configuration in general. We also
discuss several important problems in statistical physics based on the
$\mathbb{D}$ space.
