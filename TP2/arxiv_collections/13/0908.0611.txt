We report a model that makes it possible to analyze quantitatively the dipole
blockade effect on the dynamical evolution of a two two-level atom system
driven by an external laser field. The multiple excitations of the atomic
sample are taken into account. We find very large concurrence in the dipole
blockade regime. We further find that entanglement can be tuned by changing the
intensity of the exciting laser. We also report a way to lift the dipole
blockade paving the way to manipulate in a controllable way the blockade
effects. We finally report how a continuous monitoring of the dipole blockade
would be possible using photon-photon correlations of the scattered light in a
regime where the spontaneous emission would dominate dissipation in the sample.
