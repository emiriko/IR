A systematic survey to establish the true incidence rate of the Blazhko
modulation among short-period, fundamental-mode, Galactic field RR Lyrae stars
has been accomplished. The Konkoly Blazhko Survey (KBS) was initiated in 2004.
Since then more than 750 nights of observation have been devoted to this
project. A sample of 30 RRab stars was extensively observed, and light-curve
modulation was detected in 14 cases. The 47% occurrence rate of the modulation
is much larger than any previous estimate. The significant increase of the
detected incidence rate is mostly due to the discovery of small-amplitude
modulation. Half of the Blazhko variables in our sample show modulation with so
small amplitude that definitely have been missed in the previous surveys. We
have found that the modulation can be very unstable in some cases, e.g. RY Com
showed regular modulation only during one part of the observations while during
two seasons it had stable light curve with abrupt, small changes in the
pulsation amplitude. This type of light-curve variability is also hard to
detect in other Survey's data. The larger frequency of the light-curve
modulation of RRab stars makes it even more important to find the still lacking
explanation of the Blazhko phenomenon. The validity of the [Fe/H](P,phi_{31})
relation using the mean light curves of Blazhko variables is checked in our
sample. We have found that the formula gives accurate result for
small-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars, and this is also the case for
large-modulation-amplitude stars if the light curve has complete phase
coverage. However, if the data of large-modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars are
not extended enough (e.g. < 500 data points from < 15 nights), the formula may
give false result due to the distorted shape of the mean light curve used.
