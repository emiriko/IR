We aim to derive the chemical behavior of a significant sample of PNe and HII
regions in the irregular galaxy NGC 6822 The selected objects are distributed
in different zones of the galaxy. Due to the faintness of PNe and HII regions
in NGC 6822, to gather spectroscopic data with large telescopes is necessary.
We obtained a well suited sample of spectra by employing VLT-FORS 2 and
Gemini-GMOS spectrographs. Ionic and total abundances are calculated for the
objects where electron temperatures can be determined through the detection of
[OIII] \lambda 4363 or/and [NII] \lambda 5755 lines. A "simple" chemical
evolution model has been developed and the observed data are used to compute a
model for NGC 6822 in order to infer a preliminary chemical history in this
galaxy. Confident determinations of He, O, N, Ne, S and Ar abundances were
derived for a sample of 11 PNe and one HII region. We confirm that the present
ISM is chemically homogeneous, at least in the central 2 kpc of the galaxy,
showing a value 12+log O/H = 8.06$\pm$0.04. From the abundance pattern of PNe,
we identified two populations: a group of young PNe with abundances similar to
HII regions and a group of older objects with abundances a factor of two lower.
A couple of extreme Type I PNe were found. No third dredge-up O enrichement was
detected in PNe of this galaxy. The abundance determinations allow us to
discuss the chemical behavior of the present and past ISM in NGC 6822. Our
preliminary chemical evolution model predicts that an important gas-mass lost
occurred during the first 5.3 Gyr, that no star higher than 40 M$_\odot$ was
formed, and that 1% of all 3-15 M$_\odot$ stars became binary systems
progenitors to SNIa.
