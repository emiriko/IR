To obtain the modelling of an ICP torch that can be used as a test case, we
have to determine all the thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients.
To calculate the data we have first to determine the composition and the
collisions integrals for all the species in the purpose to calculate the
transport coefficients. We apply the calculation to the Mars and to the Titan
atmosphere compositions. The intensities of the spectral lines are determined
versus temperature.
