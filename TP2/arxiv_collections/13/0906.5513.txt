Single reference coupled-cluster (CC) methods for electronic excitation are
based on a biorthogonal representation (bCC) of the (shifted) Hamiltonian in
terms of excited CC states, also referred to as correlated excited (CE) states,
and an associated set of states biorthogonal to the CE states, the latter being
essentially configuration interaction (CI) configurations. The bCC
representation generates a non-hermitian secular matrix, the eigenvalues
representing excitation energies, while the corresponding spectral intensities
are to be derived from both the left and right eigenvectors. Using the
perspective of the bCC representation, a systematic and comprehensive analysis
of the excited-state CC methods is given, extending and generalizing previous
such studies. Here, the essential topics are the truncation error
characteristics and the separability properties, the latter being crucial for
designing size-consistent approximation schemes. Based on the general order
relations for the bCC secular matrix and the (left and right) eigenvector
matrices, formulas for the perturbation-theoretical (PT) order of the
truncation errors (TEO) are derived for energies, transition moments, and
property matrix elements of arbitrary excitation classes and truncation levels.
In the analysis of the separability properties of the transition moments, the
decisive role of the so-called dual ground state is revealed. Due to the use of
CE states the bCC approach can be compared to so-called intermediate state
representation (ISR) methods based exclusively on suitably orthonormalized CE
states. As the present analysis shows, the bCC approach has decisive advantages
over the conventional CI treatment, but also distinctly weaker TEO and
separability properties in comparison with a full (and hermitian) ISR method.
