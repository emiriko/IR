A quasi-free quantum particle endowed with Heaviside position dependent mass
jump is observed to experience scattering effects manifested by its by-product
introduction of the derivative of the Dirac's-delta point dipole interaction.
Using proper parametric mappings, the reflection and transmission coefficients
are obtained. A new ordering ambiguity parameters set, as the only feasibly
admissible within the current methodical proposal, is suggested.
