Geigermode avalanche photodiodes (G-APD) are novel photodetectors, which can
detect single photons. This type of diodes might become an alternative to
photomultipliers (PMT) in next-generation Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes.
Prospects, limitations and development directions are be discussed. Results
from first tests are reported.
