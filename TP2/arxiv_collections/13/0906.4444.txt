It is shown that Majorana fermions trapped in three vortices in a p-wave
superfluid form a qubit in a topological quantum computing (TQC). Several
similar ideas have already been proposed: Ivanov [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86},
268 (2001)] and Zhang {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 220502 (2007)]
have proposed schemes in which a qubit is implemented with two and four
Majorana fermions, respectively, where a qubit operation is performed by
exchanging the positions of Majorana fermions. The set of gates thus obtained
is a discrete subset of the relevant unitary group. We propose, in this paper,
a new scheme, where three Majorana fermions form a qubit. We show that
continuous 1-qubit gate operations are possible by exchanging the positions of
Majorana fermions complemented with dynamical phase change. 2-qubit gates are
realized through the use of the coupling between Majorana fermions of different
qubits.
