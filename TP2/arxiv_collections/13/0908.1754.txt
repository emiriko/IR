We describe non-standard contributions to semileptonic processes in a model
independent way in terms of an SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y invariant effective lagrangian
at the weak scale, from which we derive the low-energy effective lagrangian
governing muon and beta decays. We find that the deviation from Cabibbo
universality, \Delta_CKM = |V_ud|^2 + |V_us|^2 + |V_ub|^2 - 1, receives
contributions from four effective operators. The phenomenological bound of
\Delta_CKM = -1E-4 +- 6E-4 provides strong constraints on all four operators,
corresponding to an effective scale greater than 11 TeV (90% CL). Depending on
the operator, this constraint is at the same level or better then the Z pole
observables. Conversely, precision electroweak constraints alone would allow
universality violations as large as \Delta_CKM = -0.01 (90% CL). An observed
nonzero \Delta_CKM at this level could be explained in terms of a single
four-fermion operator which is relatively poorly constrained by electroweak
precision measurements.
