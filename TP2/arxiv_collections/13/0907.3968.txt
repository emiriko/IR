Effective stochastic resonance (SR) is numerically and analytically studied
using a model with coupled two particles exposed to heterogeneous, i.e.,
particles dependent, amplitude of noise. Compared to previous SR models of
single particle and to those of coupled two particles exposed to equivalent
amplitude of noise, the present model exhibits a more intensive resonance of,
at least, one particle exposed to the non-larger amplitude of noise with the
assistance of another particle. In a certain range of conditions, this
effective resonance of one particle overwhelms the poor resonance of the other
particle, meaning that heterogeneous amplitude of noise leads the system, not
only locally but also in the average of the whole, to the effective SR.
