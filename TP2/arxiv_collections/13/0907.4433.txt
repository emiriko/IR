The electron and positron cosmic rays observations have impulsed a hot debate
regarding the origin of such particles. Their propagation in the galactic
medium is modeled according to a successfully tested two--zone propagation
model. The theoretical uncertainties related to their propagation and
production are studied for three cases: secondary production, Dark Matter
annihilation, and originating from supernovae remnants.
