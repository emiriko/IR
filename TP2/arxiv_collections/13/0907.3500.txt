We report the first demonstration of a long-distance ultra stable frequency
dissemination in the microwave range. A 9.15 GHz signal is transferred through
a 86-km urban optical link with a fractional frequency stability of 1.3x10-15
at 1 s integration time and below 10-18 at one day. The optical link phase
noise compensation is performed with a round-trip method. To achieve such a
result we implement light polarisation scrambling and dispersion compensation.
This link outperforms all the previous radiofrequency links and compares well
with recently demonstrated full optical links.
