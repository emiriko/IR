A large number of carbon-rich evolved objects (asymptotic giant branch stars,
protoplanetary nebulae, and planetary nebulae) in both the Milky Way galaxy and
the Magellanic Clouds exhibit an enigmatic broad emission feature at 30 micron.
This feature, extending from 24 micron to 45 micron, is very strong and
accounts for up to 30% of the total infrared luminosity of the object. In
literature it is tentatively attributed to magnesium sulfide (MgS) dust. Using
the prototypical protoplanetary nebula around HD 56126 for illustrative
purpose, however, in this work we show that in order for MgS to be responsible
for the 30 micron feature, one would require an amount of MgS mass
substantially exceeding what would be available in this source. We therefore
argue that MgS is unlikely the carrier of the 30 micron feature seen in this
source and in other sources as well.
