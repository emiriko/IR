Dimtri Mihalas' textbooks in the 70's and 80's on "Stellar Atmospheres" and
"Foundations of Radiation Hydrodynamics" helped lay the early groundwork for
understanding the moving atmospheres and winds of massive, luminous stars.
Indeed, the central role of the momentum of stellar radiation in driving the
mass outflow makes such massive-star winds key prototypes for radiation
hydrodynamical processes. This paper reviews the dynamics of such radiative
driving, building first upon the standard CAK model, and then discussing
subtleties associated with the development and saturation of instabilities, and
wind initiation near the sonic point base. An overall goal is to illuminate the
rich physics of radiative driving and the challenges that lie ahead in
developing dynamical models that can explain the broad scaling of mass loss
rate and flow speed with stellar properties, as well as the often complex
structure and variability observed in massive-star outflows.
