We study proximity effect in diffusive
ferromagnet/normal-metal/superconductor junction with precessing magnetization
of the ferromagnet. We find that the odd-frequency pairing induced in the
normal metal is modified by spin pumping from the ferromagnet and hence can be
tuned by changing the precessional frequency. At the frequency corresponding to
twice the superconducting gap, the odd-frequency pairing is strongly enhanced.
We find a crossover from the even- to the odd-frequency superconductivity in
the normal metal by tuning the precessional frequency. This gives a clearcut
signature of the odd-frequency superconductivity observable by scanning
tunneling microscopy. According to the pairing symmetries in the normal metal,
we find a crossover from the gap to the peak structure in the tunneling
conductance between the normal metal and a scanning tunneling microscope tip.
