Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are employed in order to study the dynamic
critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising magnet, with algebraically
decaying long-range interactions of the form $\frac{1}{r^{d+\sigma}}$, with
$\sigma=0.75$. The critical temperature, as well as the critical exponents, is
evaluated from the power-law behavior of suitable physical observables when the
system is quenched from uncorrelated states, corresponding to infinite
temperature, to the critical point. These results are compared with those
obtained from the dynamic evolution of the system when it is suddenly annealed
at the critical point from the ordered state. Also, the critical temperature in
the infinite interaction limit is obtained by means of a finite-range scaling
analysis of data measured with different cutoffs of the interaction range. All
the estimated static critical exponents ($\gamma /\nu $, $\beta /\nu $, and
$1/\nu $) are in good agreement with Renormalization Group (RG) predictions and
previously reported numerical data obtained under equilibrium conditions. It is
found that the dynamic exponent $z$ is different for quenching and annealing
experiments, most likely due to the influence of the Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition occurring at relatively similar algebraic decay of the interactions
with $\sigma =1$. However, for annealing experiments the measured exponent $z$
is close to the RG predictions. On the other hand, the relevant exponents of
the dynamic behavior ($z$ and $\theta$) are slightly different than the RG
predictions, most likely due to the fact that they may depend on the especific
dynamics used (Metropolis in the present paper).
