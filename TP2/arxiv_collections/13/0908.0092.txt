We have succeeded to develop a model pair interaction which when added to a
system of interacting particles can be tuned to arrange the interacting objects
into sheets. The interaction is based on the decomposition of the dipole-dipole
interaction into two components, one parallel and one perpendicular to the
connecting line between the dipoles, and keeping only perpendicular part here.
Various aspects of this simple interaction are discussed, in particular in
connection to two recent papers on self assembly of carbon nanostructures. On
the other hand, the features discussed are quite general and might be of
interest in different areas of microscopic modeling.
