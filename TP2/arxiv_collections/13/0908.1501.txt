Laser- assisted antihydrogen formation cross sections (differential and
total) via the three - body recombination (TBR) process in a plasma of
antiprotons and positrons are studied for the ground and excited states .
Significantly large cross sections are obtained for low energies. The ground
state antihydrogen cross section dominates throughout the energy range,
essential for high precision spectroscopics studies in order to test the CPT
theorem. The formation cross section are found to be much higher for unequal
energies of the two positrons than for equal energies.
