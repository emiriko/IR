We show that electrons on liquid helium display intrinsic bistability of
resonant inter-subband absorption. The bistability occurs for comparatively
weak microwave power. The underlying giant nonlinearity of the many-electron
response results from the interplay of the strong short-range electron
correlations, the long relaxation time, and the multi-subband character of the
electron energy spectrum.
