In this note, we perform Sklyanin's construction of commuting
open-chain/boundary transfer matrices to the q-deformed SU(2|2) bulk S-matrix
of Beisert and Koroteev and a corresponding boundary S-matrix. This also
includes a corresponding commuting transfer matrix using the graded version of
the q-deformed bulk S-matrix. Utilizing the crossing property for the bulk
S-matrix, we argue that the transfer matrix for both graded and non-graded
versions contains a crucial factor which is essential for commutativity.
