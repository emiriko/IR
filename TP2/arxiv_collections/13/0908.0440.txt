We consider the problem of deciding if a given three-party entangled pure
state can be converted, with a non-zero success probability, into a given
two-party pure state through local quantum operations and classical
communication. We show that this question is equivalent to the well-known
computational problem of deciding if a multivariate polynomial is identically
zero. Efficient randomized algorithms developed to study the latter can thus be
applied to the question of tripartite to bipartite entanglement
transformations.
