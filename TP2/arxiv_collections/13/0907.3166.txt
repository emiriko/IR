This article
  * provides an overview of post-election audit sampling research and compares
various approaches to calculating post-election audit sample sizes, focusing on
risklimiting audits,
  * discusses fundamental concepts common to all risk-limiting post-election
audits, presenting new margin error bounds, sampling weights and sampling
probabilities that improve upon existing approaches and work for any size audit
unit and for single or multi-winner election contests,
  * provides two new simple formulas for estimating post-election audit sample
sizes in cases when detailed data, expertise, or tools are not available,
  * summarizes four improved methods for calculating risk-limiting election
audit sample sizes, showing how to apply precise margin error bounds to improve
the accuracy and efficacy of existing methods, and
  * discusses sampling mistakes that reduce post-election audit effectiveness.
