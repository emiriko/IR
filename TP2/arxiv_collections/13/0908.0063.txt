Phosphorous alloying of GaMnAs thin films has been used for the manipulation
of the magnetic anisotropies in ferromagnetic Ga0.93Mn0.07As1-yPy layers. We
have determined the anisotropy constants as a function of temperature for
phosphorous alloying levels between 0 and 8.8 at % for a Mn doping level of ~
7at%. We show that it is possible to obtain layers with robust ferromagnetism
and either in-plane or out-of plane easy axes with small barriers for
magnetization reorientation by phosphorous alloying with y< 6at% or y> 6at%.
The critical temperatures are not significantly increased by the P alloying.
