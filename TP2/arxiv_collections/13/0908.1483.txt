Motivated by the recent discovery that a reflecting wall moving with a
square-root in time trajectory behaves as a universal stopper of classical
particles regardless of their initial velocities, we compare linear in time and
square-root in time expansions of a box to achieve efficient atom cooling. For
the quantum single-atom wavefunctions studied the square-root in time expansion
presents important advantages: asymptotically it leads to zero average energy
whereas any linear in time (constant box-wall velocity) expansion leaves a
non-zero residual energy, except in the limit of an infinitely slow expansion.
For finite final times and box lengths we set a number of bounds and cooling
principles which again confirm the superior performance of the square-root in
time expansion, even more clearly for increasing excitation of the initial
state. Breakdown of adiabaticity is generally fatal for cooling with the linear
expansion but not so with the square-root expansion.
