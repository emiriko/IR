Graphene was epitaxially grown on both the C- and Si-faces of 4H- and
6H-SiC(0001) under an argon atmosphere and under high vacuum conditions.
Following growth, samples were imaged with Nomarski interference contrast and
atomic force microscopies and it was found that growth under argon led to
improved morphologies on the C-face films but the Si-face films were not
significantly affected. Free carrier transport studies were conducted through
Hall effect measurements, and carrier mobilities were found to increase and
sheet carrier densities were found to decrease for those films grown under
argon as compared to high vacuum conditions. The improved mobilities and
concurrent decreases in sheet carrier densities suggest a decrease in
scattering in the films grown under argon.
