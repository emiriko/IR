We present the living application, a method to autonomously manage
applications on the grid. During its execution on the grid, the living
application makes choices on the resources to use in order to complete its
tasks. These choices can be based on the internal state, or on autonomously
acquired knowledge from external sensors. By giving limited user capabilities
to a living application, the living application is able to port itself from one
resource topology to another. The application performs these actions at
run-time without depending on users or external workflow tools. We demonstrate
this new concept in a special case of a living application: the living
simulation. Today, many simulations require a wide range of numerical solvers
and run most efficiently if specialized nodes are matched to the solvers. The
idea of the living simulation is that it decides itself which grid machines to
use based on the numerical solver currently in use. In this paper we apply the
living simulation to modelling the collision between two galaxies in a test
setup with two specialized computers. This simulation switces at run-time
between a GPU-enabled computer in the Netherlands and a GRAPE-enabled machine
that resides in the United States, using an oct-tree N-body code whenever it
runs in the Netherlands and a direct N-body solver in the United States.
