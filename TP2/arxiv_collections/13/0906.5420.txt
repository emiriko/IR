We analyze the back-action influence of nuclear spins on the motion of the
cantilever of a magnetic force resonance microscope. We calculate the
contribution of nuclear spins to the damping and frequency shift of the
cantilever. We show that, at the Rabi frequency, the energy exchange between
the cantilever and the spin system cools or heats the cantilever depending on
the sign of the high-frequency detuning. We also show that the spin noise leads
to a significant damping of the cantilever motion.
