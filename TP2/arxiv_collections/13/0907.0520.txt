Scenarios are pen-pictures of plausible futures, used for strategic planning.
The aim of this investigation is to expand the horizon of scenario-based
planning through computational models that are able to aid the analyst in the
planning process. The investigation builds upon the advances of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) to create a novel, flexible and customizable
computational capability-based planning methodology that is practical and
theoretically sound. We will show how evolutionary computation, in particular
evolutionary multi-objective optimization, can play a central role - both as an
optimizer and as a source for innovation.
