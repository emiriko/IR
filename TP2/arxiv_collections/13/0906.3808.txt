We construct a holographic dark energy model with a non-minimally coupled
scalar field on the brane where Gauss-Bonnet and Induced Gravity effects are
taken into account. This model provides a wide parameter space with several
interesting cosmological implications. Especially, the equation of state
parameter of the model crosses the phantom divide line and it is possible to
realize bouncing solutions in this setup.
