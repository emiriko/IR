Holographic optical tweezers allow the three dimensional, dynamic, multipoint
manipulation of micron sized dielectric objects. Exploiting the massive
parallel architecture of modern GPUs we can generate highly optimized holograms
at video frame rate allowing the interactive micro-manipulation of 3D
structures.
