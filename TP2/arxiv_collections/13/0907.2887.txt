Neutrinos decoupled from the rest of the cosmic plasma when the Universe was
less than one second old, far earlier than the photons which decoupled at
t=380,000 years. Surprisingly, though, the last scattering surface of the
neutrinos is much closer to us than that of the photons. Here we calculate the
properties of the last scattering surfaces of the three species of neutrinos.
