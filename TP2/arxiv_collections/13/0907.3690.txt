Results of the HADES measurement of inclusive dielectron production in Ar+KCl
collisions at a kinetic beam energy of 1.76 AGeV are presented. For the first
time, high mass resolution spectroscopy was performed. The invariant mass
spectrum of dielectrons is compared with predictions of UrQMD and HSD transport
codes.
