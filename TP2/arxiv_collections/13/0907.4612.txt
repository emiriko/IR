Fermionic polar molecules in deep 1D optical lattices may form self-assembled
filaments when the electric dipoles are oriented along the lattice axis. These
composites are bosons or fermions depending on the number of molecules per
chain, leading to a peculiar and complex Bose-Fermi mixture, which we discuss
in detail for the simplest case of a three-well potential. We show that the
interplay between filament binding energy, transverse filament modes, and
trimer Fermi energy leads to a rich variety of possible scenarios ranging from
a degenerate Fermi gas of trimers to a binary mixture of two different types of
bosonic dimers. We study the intriguing zero temperature and finite temperature
physics of these composites for the particular case of an ideal filament gas
loaded in 1D sites, and discuss possible methods to probe these chain mixtures.
