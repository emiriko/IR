We study various physical quantities associated with holographic s-wave
superconductors as functions of the scaling dimensions of the dual condensates.
A bulk scalar field with negative mass squared $m^2$, satisfying the
Breitenlohner-Freedman stability bound and the unitarity bound, and allowed to
vary in $0.5$ unit intervals, were considered. We observe that all the physical
quantities investigated are sensitive to the scaling dimensions of the dual
condensates. For all the $m^2$, the characteristic lengths diverge at the
critical temperature in agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The
Ginzburg-Landau parameter, obtained from these length scales indicates that the
holographic superconductors can be type I or type II depending on the charge
and the scaling dimensions of the dual condensates. For a fixed charge, there
exists a critical scaling dimension, above which a holographic superconductor
is type I, below which it becomes a type II.
