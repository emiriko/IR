The dispersion of electrons and phonons near the K point of bilayer graphene
was investigated in a resonant Raman study using different laser excitation
energies in the near infrared and visible range. The electronic structure was
analyzed within the tight-binding approximation, and the
Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure (SWM) parameters were obtained from the analysis of
the dispersive behavior of the Raman features. A softening of the phonon
branches was observed near the K point, and results evidence the Kohn anomaly
and the importance of considering electron-phonon and electron-electron
interactions to correctly describe the phonon dispersion in graphene systems.
