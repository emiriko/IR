We present 19 nearby (z<0.3) 3CR radio galaxies imaged at low- and
high-excitation as part of a Cycle 15 Hubble Space Telescope snapshot survey
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys. These images consist of exposures of the
H-alpha (6563 \AA, plus [NII] contamination) and [OIII] 5007 \AA emission lines
using narrow-band linear ramp filters adjusted according to the redshift of the
target. To facilitate continuum subtraction, a single-pointing 60 s line-free
exposure was taken with a medium-band filter appropriate for the target's
redshift. We discuss the steps taken to reduce these images independently of
the automated recalibration pipeline so as to use more recent ACS flat-field
data as well as to better reject cosmic rays. We describe the method used to
produce continuum-free (pure line-emission) images, and present these images
along with qualitative descriptions of the narrow-line region morphologies we
observe. We present H-alpha+[NII] and [OIII] line fluxes from aperture
photometry, finding the values to fall expectedly on the redshift-luminosity
trend from a past HST/WFPC2 emission line study of a larger, generally higher
redshift subset of the 3CR. We also find expected trends between emission line
luminosity and total radio power, as well as a positive correlation between the
size of the emission line region and redshift. We discuss the associated
interpretation of these results, and conclude with a summary of future work
enabled by this dataset.
