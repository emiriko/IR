We compute the eigenfunctions, energies and Bethe equations for a class of
generalized integrable Hubbard models based on gl(n|m)\oplus gl(2)
superalgebras. The Bethe equations appear to be similar to the Hubbard model
ones, up to a phase due to the integration of a subset of `simple' Bethe
equations. We discuss relations with AdS/CFT correspondence, and with condensed
matter physics.
