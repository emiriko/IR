We investigate the role of the initialization for the stability of the
k-means clustering algorithm. As opposed to other papers, we consider the
actual k-means algorithm and do not ignore its property of getting stuck in
local optima. We are interested in the actual clustering, not only in the costs
of the solution. We analyze when different initializations lead to the same
local optimum, and when they lead to different local optima. This enables us to
prove that it is reasonable to select the number of clusters based on stability
scores.
