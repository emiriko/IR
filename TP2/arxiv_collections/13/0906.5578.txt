We propose a method for optical nano-imaging in which the structure of a
three-dimensional inhomogeneous medium may be recovered from far-field power
measurements. Neither phase control of the illuminating field nor phase
measurements of the scattered field are necessary. The method is based on the
solution to the inverse scattering problem for a system consisting of a
weakly-scattering dielectric sample and a strongly-scattering nano-particle
tip. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the results.
