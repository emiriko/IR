Conventional kinesin is a homodimeric motor protein that is capable of
walking unidirectionally along a cytoskeletal filament. While previous
experiments indicated unyielding unidirectionality against an opposing load up
to the so-called stall force, recent experiments also observed limited
processive backwalking under superstall loads. This theoretical study seeks to
elucidate the molecular mechanical basis for kinesin's steps over the full
range of external loads that can possibly be applied to the dimer. We found
that kinesin's load-resisting capacity is largely determined by a synergic
ratchet-and-pawl mechanism inherent in the dimer. Load susceptibility of this
inner molecular mechanical mechanism underlies kinesin's response to various
levels of external loads. Computational implementation of the mechanism enabled
us to rationalize major trends observed experimentally in kinesin's stalemate
and consecutive back steps. The study also predicts several distinct features
of kinesin's load-affected motility, which are seemingly counterintuitive but
readily verifiable by future experiment.
