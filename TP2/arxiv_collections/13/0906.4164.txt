We investigate the Compton scattering vertex of charged scalars and photons
in scalar quantum electrodynamics (SQED). We carry out its non perturbative
construction consistent with Ward-Fradkin-Green-Takahashi identity (WFGTI)
which relates 3-point vertices to the 4-point ones. There is an undetermined
part which is transverse to one or both the external photons, and needs to be
evaluated through perturbation theory. We present in detail how the transverse
part at the 1-loop order can be evaluated for completely general kinematics of
momenta involved in covariant gauges and dimensions. This involves the
calculation of genuine 4-point functions with three massive propagators, the
most non-trivial integrals reported in this paper. We also discuss possible
applications of our results.
