We present a search for charged Higgs bosons in decays of top quarks, in the
mass range $80 < m_{H^{\pm} < 155$ GeV, assuming the subsequent decay $H^{+}
\to \tau^{+} \nu_\tau$ (and its charge conjugate). Using 0.9 fb$^{-1}$ of
lepton+jets data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
$p\bar{p}$ collider, operating at a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV,
we find no evidence for a $H^{\pm}$ signal. Hence, we exclude branching ratios
$B(t \to H^+b) > 0.24$ for $m_{H^{\pm}=80$ GeV, and $B(t \to H^+b) > 0.19$ for
$m_{H^{\pm}=155$ GeV, at the 95% C.L.
