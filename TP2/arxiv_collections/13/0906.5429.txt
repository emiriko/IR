The backreaction of inhomogeneities on the cosmic dynamics is studied in the
context of scalar-tensor gravity. Due to terms of indefinite sign in the
non-canonical effective energy tensor of the Brans-Dicke-like scalar field,
extra contributions to the cosmic acceleration can arise. Brans-Dicke and
metric f(R) gravity are presented as specific examples. Certain representation
problems of the formalism peculiar to these theories are pointed out.
