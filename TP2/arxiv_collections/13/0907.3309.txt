The graph theoretic concept of maximal independent set arises in several
practical problems in computer science as well as in game theory. A maximal
independent set is defined by the set of occupied nodes that satisfy some
packing and covering constraints. It is known that finding minimum and
maximum-density maximal independent sets are hard optimization problems. In
this paper, we use cavity method of statistical physics and Monte Carlo
simulations to study the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem on
random graphs. We obtain the entropy of maximal independent sets within the
replica symmetric and one-step replica symmetry breaking frameworks, shedding
light on the metric structure of the landscape of solutions and suggesting a
class of possible algorithms. This is of particular relevance for the
application to the study of strategic interactions in social and economic
networks, where maximal independent sets correspond to pure Nash equilibria of
a graphical game of public goods allocation.
