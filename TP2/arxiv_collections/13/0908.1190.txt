Spreadsheets are ubiquitous in business with the financial sector
particularly heavily reliant on the technology. It is known that the level of
spreadsheet error can be high and that it is often necessary to review
spreadsheets based on a structured methodology which includes a cell by cell
examination of the spreadsheet. This paper outlines the early research that has
been carried out into the use of Bayesian Statistical methods to estimate the
level of error in large spreadsheets during cell be cell examination based on
expert knowledge and partial spreadsheet test data. The estimate can aid in the
decision as to the quality of the spreadsheet and the necessity to conduct
further testing or not.
