Microquasars, X-ray binaries displaying relativistic jets driven by accretion
onto a compact object, are some of the most efficient accelerators in the
Galaxy. Theoretical models predict Very High Energy (VHE) emission at the base
of the jet where particles are accelerated to multi-TeV energies. This emission
could be detected by present IACTs. %Moreover, gamma-ray fluxes should increase
during flaring events when accretion rates are enhanced. The MAGIC telescope
observed the microquasars GRS 1915+105, Cyg X-3, Cyg X-1 and SS433 for ~ 150
hours in total from 2005 to 2008. We triggered our observations by using multi
wavelength information through radio flaring alerts with the RATAN telescope as
well as by ensuring the low/hard state of the source through RXTE/ASM and
Swift/BAT monitoring data. We report on the upper limits on steady and variable
emission from these sources over this long period.
