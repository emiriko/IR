A selection of known and newly-discovered northern hemisphere Cepheids and
related objects are being monitored regularly through CCD observations at the
automated Abbey Ridge Observatory, near Halifax, and photoelectric photometry
from the Saint Mary's University Burke-Gaffney Observatory. Included is
Polaris, which is displaying unusual fluctuations in its growing light
amplitude, and a short-period, double-mode Cepheid, HDE 344787, with an
amplitude smaller than that of Polaris, along with a selection of other
classical Cepheids in need of additional observations. The observations are
being used to establish basic parameters for the Cepheids, for application to
the Galactic calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation as well as
studies of Galactic structure.
