We propose a 3500 ton (3000 ton fiducial volume) SiO_2 neutrino detector with
sampling calorimetry, charged particle tracking, and muon spectrometers to run
in a Tevatron Fixed Target Program. Improvements to the Fermilab accelerator
complex should allow substantial increases in the neutrino flux over the
previous NuTeV quad triplet beamline. With 4E19 protons on target/year, a 5
year run would achieve event statistics more than 100 times higher than NuTeV.
With 100 times the statistics of previous high energy neutrino experiments, the
purely weak processes [\nu_{\mu} e^- \to \nu_{\mu}+ e^-] and [\nu_{\mu} e^- \to
\nu_e + \mu^-] (inverse muon decay) can be measured with high accuracy for the
first time. The inverse muon decay process is independent of strong interaction
effects and can be used to significantly improve the flux normalization for all
other processes. The high neutrino and antineutrino fluxes also make new
searches for lepton flavor violation and neutral heavy leptons possible. In
this document, we give a first look at the physics opportunities, detector and
beam design, and calibration procedures.
