Weak gravitational lensing leaves a characteristic imprint on the cosmic
microwave background temperature and polarization angular power spectra. Here
we investigate the possible constraints on the integrated lensing potential
from future CMB angular spectra measurements expected from Planck and EPIC. We
find that Planck and EPIC will constrain the amplitude of the integrated
projected potential responsible for lensing at 6% and 1% level, respectively
with very little sensitivity to the shape of the lensing potential. We discuss
the implications of such a measurement in constraining dark energy and modified
gravity scalar-tensor theories. We then discuss the impact of a wrong
assumption on the weak lensing potential amplitude on cosmological parameter
inference.
