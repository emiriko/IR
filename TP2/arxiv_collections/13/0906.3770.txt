Quality control is an important issue in the ceramic tile industry. On the
other hand maintaining the rate of production with respect to time is also a
major issue in ceramic tile manufacturing. Again, price of ceramic tiles also
depends on purity of texture, accuracy of color, shape etc. Considering this
criteria, an automated defect detection and classification technique has been
proposed in this report that can have ensured the better quality of tiles in
manufacturing process as well as production rate. Our proposed method plays an
important role in ceramic tiles industries to detect the defects and to control
the quality of ceramic tiles. This automated classification method helps us to
acquire knowledge about the pattern of defect within a very short period of
time and also to decide about the recovery process so that the defected tiles
may not be mixed with the fresh tiles.
