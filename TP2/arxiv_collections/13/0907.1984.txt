We present next-to-leading order QCD predictions for a variety of
distributions in W+3-jet production at both the Tevatron and the Large Hadron
Collider. We include all subprocesses and incorporate the decay of the W boson
into leptons. Our results are in excellent agreement with existing Tevatron
data and provide the first quantitatively precise next-to-leading order
predictions for the LHC. We include all terms in an expansion in the number of
colors, confirming that the specific leading-color approximation used in our
previous study is accurate to within three percent. The dependence of the cross
section on renormalization and factorization scales is reduced significantly
with respect to a leading-order calculation. We study different dynamical scale
choices, and find that the total transverse energy is significantly better than
choices used in previous phenomenological studies. We compute the one-loop
matrix elements using on-shell methods, as numerically implemented in the
BlackHat code. The remaining parts of the calculation, including generation of
the real-emission contributions and integration over phase space, are handled
by the SHERPA package.
