Our current understanding of split, Jupiter-family comets is reviewed. The
focus is on what recent studies of comets have told us about the nature of the
splitting phenomenon. The goal is to not repeat the information given in recent
reviews of split comets, but to build upon it. In particular, we discuss comets
that have suffered splitting or fragmentation events in the past few years.
These include comets (a) 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte, observed with a long
train of fragments in 2002; (b) 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, which split in 1995
and was extensively studied during its relatively close passage to Earth in
2006, during which dozens of fragments were discovered and studied; and (c)
174P/Echeclus, a Centaur and potentially future JFC, which split in late 2005
and was the first such Centaur observed to do so. We also discuss recent
observations by SOHO of split comets that are likely of short-period. The
Spitzer Space Telescope has observed many JFCs and provided us with
unprecedented detailed views of cometary debris trails, which may be thought of
as a middle ground between "normal" ejection of micron-sized dust grains and
the cleaving off of meter-to-kilometer sized fragments. We will also discuss
potential breakthroughs in studying splitting JFCs that may come from future
surveys.
