An important dynamic parameter of barred galaxies is the bar pattern speed.
Among several methods that are used for the determination of the pattern speed
the Tremaine-Weinberg method has the advantage of model independency and
accuracy. In this work we apply the method to a simulated bar including gas
dynamics and study the effect of 2D spectroscopy data quality on robustness of
the method. We added a white noise and a Gaussian random field to the data and
measured the corresponding errors in the pattern speed. We found that a signal
to noise ratio in surface density ~5 introduces errors of ~20% for the Gaussian
noise, while for the white noise the corresponding errors reach ~50%. At the
same time the velocity field is less sensitive to contamination. On the basis
of the performed study we applied the method to the NGC 3367 spiral galaxy
using H{\alpha} Fabry-Perot interferometry data. We found for the pattern speed
43 \pm 6 km/s/kpc for this galaxy.
