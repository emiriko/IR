Dimarco, L. Pareschi, Hybrid multiscale methods II. Kinetic equations, SIAM
Multiscale Modeling and Simulation Vol 6., No 4,pp. 1169-1197, (2008)] we
developed a general framework for the construction of hybrid algorithms which
are able to face efficiently the multiscale nature of some hyperbolic and
kinetic problems. Here, at variance with respect to the previous methods, we
construct a method form-fitting to any type of finite volume or finite
difference scheme for the reduced equilibrium system. Thanks to the coupling of
Monte Carlo techniques for the solution of the kinetic equations with
macroscopic methods for the limiting fluid equations, we show how it is
possible to solve multiscale fluid dynamic phenomena faster with respect to
traditional deterministic/stochastic methods for the full kinetic equations. In
addition, due to the hybrid nature of the schemes, the numerical solution is
affected by less fluctuations when compared to standard Monte Carlo schemes.
Applications to the Boltzmann-BGK equation are presented to show the
performance of the new methods in comparison with classical approaches used in
the simulation of kinetic equations.
