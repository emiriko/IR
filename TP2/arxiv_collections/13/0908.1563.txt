We give an explicit formula for the correspondence between simple
Yetter-Drinfeld modules for certain finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras
$H$ and those for cocycle twists $H^{\sigma}$ of $H$. This implies an
equivalence between modules for their Drinfeld doubles. To illustrate our
results, we consider the restricted two-parameter quantum groups
${\mathfrak{u}}_{r,s}({\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$ under conditions on the parameters
guaranteeing that ${\mathfrak{u}}_{r,s}({\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$ is a Drinfeld
double of its Borel subalgebra. We determine explicit correspondences between
${\mathfrak{u}}_{r,s}({\mathfrak{sl}}_n)$-modules for different values of $r$
and $s$ and provide examples where no such correspondence can exist. Our
examples were obtained via the computer algebra system {\sc Singular::Plural}.
