We show that the angular range of the transmission through magnetic barrier
structures can be efficiently controlled in single-layer and bilayer graphenes
and this renders the structure's efficient wavevector filters. As the number of
magnetic barriers increases, this range shrinks, the gaps in the transmission
versus energy become wider, and the conductance oscillates with the Fermi
energy.
