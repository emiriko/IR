Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering and electroproduction of mesons involve
amplitudes that are analytic in energy. Analyticity enables Dispersion
Relations (DR's) for such amplitudes, relating real and imaginary parts. Lately
it has been suggested that DR's be applied to the integrated Generalized Parton
Distributions that embody the spin-dependent soft, but factorizable part of the
scattering. However, at non-zero momentum transfer, DRs require integration
over unphysical regions of the variables. We show that the relevant unphysical
region of the non-forward DRs is considerable, vitiating efforts to avoid the
actual measurement of the real parts more directly.
