In this work we derive an exact solution for the exterior metric of a local
cosmic string in an effective theory of gravity, the so-called NDL theory,
which is inspired in the Born-Infeld theory. The solution is given by a family
of parameters which presents quite different features from that of the General
Relativity theory. The differences come from the specific choice of the
gravitation Lagrangian which is based on a spin-1 construction of the
gravitation theory.
