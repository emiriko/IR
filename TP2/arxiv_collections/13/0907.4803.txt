We study the problem of graph partitioning, or clustering, in sparse networks
with prior information about the clusters. Specifically, we assume that for a
fraction $\rho$ of the nodes their true cluster assignments are known in
advance. This can be understood as a semi--supervised version of clustering, in
contrast to unsupervised clustering where the only available information is the
graph structure. In the unsupervised case, it is known that there is a
threshold of the inter--cluster connectivity beyond which clusters cannot be
detected. Here we study the impact of the prior information on the detection
threshold, and show that even minute [but generic] values of $\rho>0$ shift the
threshold downwards to its lowest possible value. For weighted graphs we show
that a small semi--supervising can be used for a non-trivial definition of
communities.
