We study the statistical properties of coherent, small-scales,
filamentary-like structures in Turbulence. In order to follow in time such
complex spatial structures, we integrate Lagrangian and Eulerian measurements
by seeding the flow with light particles. We show that light particles
preferentially concentrate in small filamentary regions of high persistent
vorticity (vortex filaments). We measure the fractal dimension of the
attracting set and the probability that two particles do not separate for long
time lapses. We fortify the signal-to-noise ratio by exploiting multi-particles
correlations on the dynamics of bunches of particles. In doing that, we are
able to give a first quantitative estimation of the vortex-filaments
life-times, showing the presence of events as long as the integral correlation
time. The same technique introduced here could be used in experiments as long
as one is capable to track clouds of bubbles in turbulence for a relatively
long period of time, at high Reynolds numbers; shading light on the dynamics of
small-scale vorticity in realistic turbulent flows.
