We consider the dynamics of polymer translocation out of confined
environments. Analytic scaling arguments lead to the prediction that the
translocation time scales like $\tau\sim
N^{\beta+\nu_{2D}}R^{1+(1-\nu_{2D})/\nu}$ for translocation out of a planar
confinement between two walls with separation $R$ into a 3D environment, and
$\tau \sim N^{\beta+1}R$ for translocation out of two strips with separation
$R$ into a 2D environment. Here, $N$ is the chain length, $\nu$ and $\nu_{2D}$
are the Flory exponents in 3D and 2D, and $\beta$ is the scaling exponent of
translocation velocity with $N$, whose value for the present choice of
parameters is $\beta \approx 0.8$ based on Langevin dynamics simulations. These
scaling exponents improve on earlier predictions.
