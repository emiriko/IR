We calculate the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations of the 3-form
inflation and we find that the curvature perturbations decay at late times. As
as result, although a non-minimally coupled massive 3-form field may drive
inflation at early times, it should be assisted by other fields in order to
reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations of the CMB sky.
