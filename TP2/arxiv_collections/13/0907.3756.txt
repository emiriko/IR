Faussurier et al. [Phys. Rev. E 65, 016403 (2001)] proposed to use a
variational principle relying on Jensen-Feynman (or Gibbs-Bogoliubov)
inequality in order to optimize the accounting for two-particle interactions in
the calculation of canonical partition functions. It consists in a
decomposition into a reference electron system and a first-order correction.
The procedure appears to be very efficient in order to evaluate the free energy
and the orbital populations. In this work, we present numerical applications of
the method and propose to extend it using a reference energy which includes the
interaction between two electrons inside a given orbital. This is possible
thanks to our efficient recursion relation for the calculation of partition
functions. We also show that a linear reference energy, however, is usually
sufficient to achieve a good precision and that the most promising way to
improve the approach of Faussurier et al. is to apply Jensen's inequality to a
more convenient convex function.
