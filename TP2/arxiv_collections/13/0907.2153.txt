We present a follow-up analysis of the unique magnetic luminosity-variable
carbon-atmosphere white dwarf SDSS J142625.71+575218.3. This includes the
results of some 106.4 h of integrated light photometry which have revealed,
among other things, the presence of a new periodicity at 319.720 s which is not
harmonically related to the dominant oscillation (417.707 s) previously known
in that star. Using our photometry and available spectroscopy, we consider the
suggestion made by Montgomery et al. (2008) that the luminosity variations in
SDSS J142625.71+575218.3 may not be caused by pulsational instabilities, but
rather by photometric activity in a carbon-transferring analog of AM CVn. This
includes a detailed search for possible radial velocity variations due to rapid
orbital motion on the basis of MMT spectroscopy. At the end of the exercise, we
unequivocally rule out the interacting binary hypothesis and conclude instead
that, indeed, the luminosity variations are caused by g-mode pulsations as in
other pulsating white dwarfs. This is in line with the preferred possibility
put forward by Montgomery et al. (2008).
