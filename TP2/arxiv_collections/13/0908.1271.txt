We calculate the diffusion coefficients of persistent random walks on
lattices, where the direction of a walker at a given step depends on the memory
of a certain number of previous steps. In particular, we describe a simple
method which enables us to obtain explicit expressions for the diffusion
coefficients of walks with two-step memory on different classes of one-, two-
and higher-dimensional lattices.
