Ever since its discovery, the Berry phase has permeated through all branches
of physics. Over the last three decades, it was gradually realized that the
Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on
material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as
ferroelectricity, orbital magnetism, various (quantum/anomalous/spin) Hall
effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a
pedagogical manner in this review. We start with a brief summary of necessary
background, followed by a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a
variety of solid state applications. A common thread of the review is the
semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in
the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and
more general perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate a re-quantization method
that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is
clear that the Berry phase should be added as a basic ingredient to our
understanding of basic material properties.
