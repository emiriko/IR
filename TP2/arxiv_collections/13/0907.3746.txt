The independence of the dynamic conductivity of intrinsic graphene of
frequency takes its origin in the compensation of the vanishing density of
states by the diverging matrix element of the corresponding interband
transition. The applicability of the linear response approach, however, breaks
down when this matrix element becomes comparable with the inverse electron
lifetime. We show that the physics of the ac conductivity in this regime is
determined by Rabi oscillations and obtain it beyond the first order
perturbation theory. Under strong applied electric fields the induced current
eventually saturates at a value determined by the frequency and the lifetime.
We also calculate the electromagnetic response of a graphene sheet and find
that the optical transparency is increased by the non-linear effects and make
experimental predictions.
