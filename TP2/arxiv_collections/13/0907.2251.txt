This work presents the results of a Chandra study of 21 broad absorption line
(BAL) radio-loud quasars (RLQs). We conducted a Chandra snapshot survey of 12
bright BAL RLQs selected from SDSS/FIRST data and possessing a wide range of
radio and CIV absorption properties. Optical spectra were obtained nearly
contemporaneously with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope; no strong flux or BAL
variability was seen between epochs. We also include in our sample 9 additional
BAL RLQs possessing archival Chandra coverage. We compare the properties of
(predominantly high-ionization) BAL RLQs to those of non-BAL RLQs as well as to
BAL radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) and non-BAL RQQs for context.
  All 12 snapshot and 8/9 archival BAL RLQs are detected, with observed X-ray
luminosities less than those of non-BAL RLQs having comparable optical/UV
luminosities by typical factors of 4.1-8.5. (BAL RLQs are also X-ray weak by
typical factors of 2.0-4.5 relative to non-BAL RLQs having both comparable
optical/UV and radio luminosities.) However, BAL RLQs are not as X-ray weak
relative to non-BAL RLQs as are BAL RQQs relative to non-BAL RQQs. While some
BAL RLQs have harder X-ray spectra than typical non-BAL RLQs, some have
hardness ratios consistent with those of non-BAL RLQs, and there does not
appear to be a correlation between X-ray weakness and spectral hardness, in
contrast to the situation for BAL RQQs. RLQs are expected to have X-ray
continuum contributions from both disk-corona and small-scale jet emission.
While the entire X-ray continuum in BAL RLQs cannot be obscured to the same
degree as in BAL RQQs, we calculate that the jet is likely partially covered in
many BAL RLQs. We comment briefly on implications for geometries and source
ages in BAL RLQs.
