We predict and theoretically investigate the new coherent effect of nonlinear
quantum optics -- spatial propagation of Rabi oscillations (Rabi waves) in
one-dimensional quantum dot (QD) chain. QD-chain is modeled by the set of
two-level quantum systems with tunnel coupling between neighboring QDs. The
space propagation of Rabi waves in the form of traveling waves and wave packets
is considered. It is shown, that traveling Rabi waves are quantum states of
QD-chain dressed by radiation. The dispersion characteristics of traveling Rabi
waves are investigated and their dependence on average number of photons in
wave is demonstrated. The propagation of Rabi wave packets is accompanied by
the transfer of the inversion and quantum correlations along the QD-chain and
by the transformation of quantum light statistics. The conditions of
experimental observability are analyzed. The effect can find practical use in
quantum computing and quantum informatics.
