We examine correlations between the masses, sizes, and star formation
histories for a large sample of low-redshift early-type galaxies, using a
simple suite of dynamical and stellar populations models. We confirm an
anti-correlation between size and stellar age, and survey for trends with the
central content of dark matter (DM). An average relation between central DM
density and galaxy size of <rho_DM> ~ Reff^-2 provides the first clear
indication of cuspy DM haloes in these galaxies -- akin to standard LCDM haloes
that have undergone adiabatic contraction. The DM density scales with galaxy
mass as expected, deviating from suggestions of a universal halo profile for
dwarf and late-type galaxies. We introduce a new fundamental constraint on
galaxy formation by finding that the central DM fraction decreases with stellar
age. This result is only partially explained by the size-age dependencies, and
the residual trend is in the opposite direction to basic DM halo expectations.
Therefore we suggest that there may be a connection between age and halo
contraction, and that galaxies forming earlier had stronger baryonic feedback
which expanded their haloes, or else lumpier baryonic accretion that avoided
halo contraction. An alternative explanation is a lighter initial mass function
for older stellar populations.
