We study the nature of the low-lying dipole strength in neutron-rich nuclei,
often associated to the Pygmy Dipole Resonance. The states are described within
the Hartree-Fock plus RPA formalism, using different parametrizations of the
Skyrme interaction. We show how the information from combined reactions
processes involving the Coulomb and different mixtures of isoscalar and
isovector nuclear interactions can provide a clue to reveal the characteristic
features of these states.
