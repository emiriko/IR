We construct an equivariant colored sl(N)-homology for links, which
generalizes both the colored sl(N)-homology defined by the author and the
equivariant sl(N)-homology defined by Krasner. The construction is a
straightforward generalization of that of the colored sl(N)-homology. The proof
of invariance is based on a simple observation which allows us to translate the
proof of the invariance of the colored sl(N)-homology into the new setting.
  As an application, we prove that deformations over C of the colored
sl(N)-homology are link invariants. We also construct a spectral sequence
connecting the colored sl(N)-homology to its deformations over C, which
generalizes the spectral sequence given by Lee and Gornik.
