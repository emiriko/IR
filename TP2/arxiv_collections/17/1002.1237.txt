We present the fundamental principles behind quantum key distribution and
discuss a few well-known QKD protocols. Bearing in mind that the majority of
our readers are from engineering and experimental optics, we focus more on the
experimental implementation of various QKD protocols rather than security
analysis. Another important topic that is covered here is the study of the
security of practical QKD systems.
