The assembly of filamentous bundles with controlled diameters is common in
biological systems and desirable for the development of nanomaterials. We
discuss dynamical simulations and free energy calculations on patchy spheres
with chiral pair interactions that spontaneously assemble into filamentous
bundles. The chirality frustrates long-range crystal order by introducing twist
between interacting subunits. For some ranges of system parameters this
constraint leads to bundles with a finite diameter as the equilibrium state,
and in other cases frustration is relieved by the formation of defects. While
some self-limited structures can be modeled as twisted filaments arranged with
local hexagonal symmetry, other structures are surprising in their complexity.
