Based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a new
charging method that should be capable of charging a Lithium-ion battery in a
fraction of the time needed when using traditional methods. This charging
method uses an additional applied oscillatory electric field. Our simulation
results show that this charging method offers a great reduction in the average
intercalation time for Li+ ions, which dominates the charging time. The
oscillating field not only increases the diffusion rate of Li+ ions in the
electrolyte but, more importantly, also enhances intercalation by lowering the
corresponding overall energy barrier.
