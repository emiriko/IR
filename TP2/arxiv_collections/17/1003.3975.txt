Evidence to the case that classical gravitation provides the clue to make
sense out of quantum gravity is presented. The key observation is the existence
in classical gravitation of child universe solutions or "almost" solutions,
"almost" because of some singularity problems. The difficulties of these child
universe solutions due to their generic singularity problems will be very
likely be cured by quantum effects, just like for example "almost" instanton
solutions are made relevant in gauge theories with breaking of conformal
invariance. Some well motivated modifcations of General Relativity where these
singularity problems are absent even at the classical level are discussed. High
energy density excitations, responsible for UV divergences in quantum field
theories, including quantum gravity, are likely to be the source of child
universes which carry them out of the original space time. This decoupling
could prevent these high UV excitations from having any influence on physical
amplitudes. Child universe production could therefore be responsible for UV
regularization in quantum field theories which take into account
semiclassically gravitational effects. Child universe production in the last
stages of black hole evaporation, the prediction of absence of tranplanckian
primordial perturbations, connection to the minimum length hypothesis and in
particular the connection to the maximal curvature hypothesis are discussed.
Some discussion of superexcited states in the case these states are Kaluza
Klein excitations is carried out. Finally, the posibility of obtaining "string
like" effects from the wormholes associated with the child universes is
discussed.
