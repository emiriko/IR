Though flux freezing is a good approximation frequently assumed for molecular
clouds, ambipolar diffusion (AD) is inevitable at certain scales. The scale at
which AD sets in can be a crucial parameter for turbulence and the star
formation process. However, both observation and simulation of AD are very
challenging and our knowledge of it is very limited. We proposed earlier (Li
and Houde 2008) that the difference between ion and neutral velocity spectra is
a signature of turbulent AD and can be used to estimate the AD scales and
magnetic field strength. Here we present observational evidence showing that
this difference between the velocity dispersions from coexistent ions and
neutrals is indeed correlated with magnetic field strength.
