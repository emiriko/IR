Motivated by the anisotropic long-range nature of the interactions between
cold dipolar atoms or molecules in an optical lattice, we study the anisotropic
quantum Heisenberg model with Curie-Weiss-type long-range interactions. Absence
of a heat bath in optical lattice experiments suggests a study of this model
within the microcanonical ensemble. The microcanonical entropy is calculated
analytically, and nonequivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles is
found for a range of anisotropy parameters. From the shape of the entropy it
follows that the Curie-Weiss Heisenberg model is indistinguishable from the
Curie-Weiss Ising model in canonical thermodynamics, although their
microcanonical thermodynamics differs. Qualitatively, the observed features of
nonequivalent ensembles are expected to be relevant for long-range quantum spin
systems realized in optical lattice experiments.
