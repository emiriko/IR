The main principle of affine quantum gravity is the strict positivity of the
matrix \{\hat g_{ab}(x)\} composed of the spatial components of the local
metric operator. Canonical commutation relations are incompatible with this
principle, and they can be replaced by noncanonical, affine commutation
relations. Due to the partial second-class nature of the quantum gravitational
constraints, it is advantageous to use the projection operator method, which
treats all quantum constraints on an equal footing. Using this method,
enforcement of regularized versions of the gravitational constraint operators
is formulated quite naturally as a novel and relatively well-defined functional
integral involving only the same set of variables that appears in the usual
classical formulation. Although perturbatively nonrenormalizable, gravity may
possibly be understood nonperturbatively from a hard-core perspective that has
proved valuable for specialized models.
