The intrinsic spin-orbit interactions in bilayer graphene and in graphite are
studied, using a tight binding model, and an intraatomic LS coupling. The
spin-orbit interactions in bilayer graphene and graphite are larger, by about
one order of magnitude, than the interactions in single layer graphene, due to
the mixing of pi and sigma bands by interlayer hopping. Their value is in the
range 0.1 - 1K. The spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in bilayer graphene, and it
also gives rise to two edge modes. The spin-orbit couplings are largest, 1-4K,
in orthorhombic graphite, which does not have a center of inversion.
