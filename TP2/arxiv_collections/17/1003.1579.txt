In the following paper, certain blackhole dynamic potentials have been
developed definitively on the lines of classical thermodynamics. These
potentials have been refined in view of the small differences in the equations
of the laws of blackhole dynamics as given by Bekenstein and those of
thermodynamics. Nine fundamental blackhole dynamical relations have been
developed akin to the four fundamental thermodynamic relations of Maxwell. The
specific heats and have been defined. For a blackhole, these quantities are
negative. The equation has been obtained as an application of these fundamental
relations. Time reversible processes observing constancy of surface gravity are
considered and an equation connecting the internal energy of the blackhole, the
additional available energy defined as the first free energy function, and the
surface gravity, has been obtained. Finally as a further application of the
fundamental relations, it has been proved for a homogeneous gravitational field
in blackhole spacetimes that . This is dubbed as the homogeneous fluid
approximation in context of the blackholes.
