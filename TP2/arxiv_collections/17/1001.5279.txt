In this short paper we generalize the classical inequality between the norms
in Lebesgue spaces of the functions and its derivatives, which in the
multidimensional case are called Sobolev's inequalities, on the many popular
classes pairs of rearrangement invariant (r.i.) spaces, namely, on the
so-called moment rearrangement invariant spaces.
