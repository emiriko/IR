We propose a method for achieving dynamically controllable transport of
highly mobile matter-wave solitons in a driven two-dimensional optical lattice.
Our numerical analysis based on the mean-field model and the theory based on
the time-averaging approach, demonstrate that a fast time-periodic rocking of
the two-dimensional optical lattice enables efficient stabilization and
manipulation of spatially localized matter wavepackets via induced
reconfigurable mobility channels.
