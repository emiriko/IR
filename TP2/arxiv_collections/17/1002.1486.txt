The observation that AGN host galaxies preferentially inhabit the "green
valley" between the blue cloud and the red sequence has significant
consequences for our understanding of the co-evolution of galaxies and black
holes via accretion events. I discuss the interpretation of green valley AGN
host galaxy colours with particular focus on early-type galaxies.
