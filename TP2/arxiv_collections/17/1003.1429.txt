We investigate the strong gravitational lensing in a Kaluza-Klein black hole
with squashed horizons. We find the size of the extra dimension imprints in the
radius of the photon sphere, the deflection angle, the angular position and
magnification of the relativistic images. Supposing that the gravitational
field of the supermassive central object of the Galaxy can be described by this
metric, we estimated the numerical values of the coefficients and observables
for gravitational lensing in the strong field limit.
