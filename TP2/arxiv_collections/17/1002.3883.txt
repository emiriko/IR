We state and verify up to weight 172 a conjecture on the existence of a
certain generating set for spaces of classical Siegel modular forms. This
conjecture is particularly useful for calculations involving Fourier
expansions. Using this generating set we verify the Boecherer conjec- ture for
non-rational eigenforms. As one further application we verify another
conjectures for weights up to 150 and investigate an analogue of the
Victor-Miller basis. Additionally, we describe some arithmetic properties of
the basis we found.
