We study the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for a Brownian particle driven
into a nonequilibrium steady state experimentally. We validate two different
theoretical variants of a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the choice of variables crucially affects the
accuracy of determining the nonequilibrium response from steady state
nonequilibrium fluctuations.
