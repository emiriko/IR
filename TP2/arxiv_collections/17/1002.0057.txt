Spin-dependent transport was investigated in a spin metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistors (spin MOSFET) with ferromagnetic MnAs source and drain
(S/D) contacts. The spin MOSFET of bottom-gate type was fabricated by
photolithography using an epitaxial MnAs film grown on a silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) substrate. In-plane magnetoresistance showed spin-valve-type hysteretic
behavior, when the measurements were performed with constant source-drain and
source-gate biases. By comparing with the magnetization-related resistance
change resulting from the MnAs contacts, we conclude that the spin-polarized
electrons are injected from the MnAs source into the Si MOS inversion channel,
and detected by the MnAs drain.
