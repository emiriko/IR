Using helioseismic holography strong evidence is presented that the phase (or
equivalent travel-time) of helioseismic signatures in Dopplergrams within
sunspots depend upon the line-of-sight angle in the plane containing the
magnetic field and vertical directions. This is shown for the velocity signal
in the penumbrae of two sunspots at 3, 4 and 5 mHz. Phase-sensitive holography
demonstrates that they are significantly affected in a strong, moderately
inclined magnetic field. This research indicates that the effects of the
surface magnetic field are potentially very significant for local helioseismic
analysis of active regions.
