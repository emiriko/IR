The number of eigenmodes in plasmonic nanostructures increases with
complexity due to mode hybridization, raising the need for efficient mode
characterization and selection. Here we experimentally demonstrate direct
imaging and selective excitation of the bonding and antibonding plasmon mode in
symmetric dipole nanoantennas using confocal two-photon photoluminescence
mapping. Excitation of a high-quality-factor antibonding resonance manifests
itself as a two-lobed pattern instead of the single spot observed for the broad
bonding resonance, in accordance with numerical simulations. The two-lobed
pattern is observed due to the fact that excitation of the antibonding mode is
forbidden for symmetric excitation at the feedgap, while concomitantly the mode
energy splitting is large enough to suppress excitation of the bonding mode.
The controlled excitation of modes in strongly coupled plasmonic nanostructures
is mandatory for efficient sensors, in coherent control as well as for
implementing well-defined functionalities in complex plasmonic devices.
