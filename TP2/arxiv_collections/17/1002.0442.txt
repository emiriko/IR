Some computations made about the Riemann Hypothesis and in particular, the
verification that zeroes of zeta belong on the critical line and the extension
of zero-free region are useful to get better effective estimates of number
theory classical functions which are closely linked to zeta zeroes like psi(x),
theta(x), pi(x) or the k-th prime number.
