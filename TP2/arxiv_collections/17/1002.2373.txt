In this paper, we prove a comparison result between semicontinuous viscosity
sub and supersolutions growing at most quadratically of second-order degenerate
parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Isaacs equations. As an application, we
characterize the value function of a finite horizon stochastic control problem
with unbounded controls as the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding
dynamic programming equation.
