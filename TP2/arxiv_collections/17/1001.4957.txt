Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at 5 K in B-fields up to 7 T, we
investigate the local density of states of a two-dimensional electron system
(2DES) created by Cs adsorption on p-type InSb(110). The 2DES, which in
contrast to previous STS studies exhibits a 2D Fermi level, shows standing
waves at B = 0 T with corrugations decreasing with energy and with wave numbers
in accordance with theory. In magnetic field percolating drift states are
observed within the disorder broadened Landau levels. Due to the large electric
field perpendicular to the surface, a beating pattern of the Landau levels is
found and explained quantitatively by Rashba spin splitting within the lowest
2DES subband. The Rashba splitting does not contribute significantly to the
standing wave patterns in accordance with theory.
