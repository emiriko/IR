We consider two type of upper Hessenberg matrices which determinants are
Fibonacci numbers. Calculating sums of principal minors of the fixed order of
the first type leads us to convolved Fibonacci numbers. Some identities for
these and for Fibonacci numbers are proved.
  We also show that numbers of compositions of a natural number with fixed
number of ones appear as coefficients of characteristic polynomial of a
Hessenberg matrix which determinant is a Fibonacci number. We derive the
explicit formula for the number of such compositions, in terms of convolutions
of Fibonacci numbers.
