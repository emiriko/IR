We discuss fermions for arbitrary dimensions and signature of the metric,
with special emphasis on euclidean space. Generalized Majorana spinors are
defined for $d=2,3,4,8,9$ mod 8, independently of the signature. These objects
permit a consistent analytic continuation of Majorana spinors in Min-kowski
space to euclidean signature. Compatibility of charge conjugation with complex
conjugation requires for euclidean signature a new complex structure which
involves a reflection in euclidean time. The possible complex structures for
Minkowski and euclidean signature can be understood in terms of a modulo two
periodicity in the signature. The concepts of a real action and hermitean
observables depend on the choice of the complex structure. For a real action
the expectation values of all hermitean multi-fermion observables are real.
This holds for arbitrary signature, including euclidean space. In particular, a
chemical potential is compatible with a real action for the euclidean theory.
We also discuss the discrete symmetries of parity, time reversal and charge
conjugation for arbitrary dimension and signature.
