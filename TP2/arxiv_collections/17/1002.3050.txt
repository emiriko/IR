I discuss LHC physics in the historical perspective of the progress in
particle physics. After a recap of the Standard Model of particle physics, I
discuss the high energy colliders leading up to LHC and their role in the
discovery of these SM particles. Then I discuss the two main physics issues of
LHC, i.e. Higgs mechanism and Supersymmetry. I briefly touch upon Higgs and
SUSY searches at LHC along with their cosmological implications.
