The stabilization algorithm of Weisfeiler and Leman has as an input any
square matrix A of order n and returns the minimal cellular (coherent) algebra
W(A) which includes A.
  In case when A=A(G) is the adjacency matrix of a graph G the algorithm
examines all configurations in G having three vertices and, according to this
information, partitions vertices and ordered pairs of vertices into equivalence
classes. The resulting construction allows to associate to each graph G a
matrix algebra W(G):= W(A(G))$ which is an invariant of the graph G. For many
classes of graphs, in particular for most of the molecular graphs, the algebra
W(G) coincides with the centralizer algebra of the automorphism group aut(G).
In such a case the partition returned by the stabilization algorithm is equal
to the partition into orbits of aut(G).
  We give algebraic and combinatorial descriptions of the Weisfeiler--Leman
algorithm and present an efficient computer implementation of the algorithm
written in C. The results obtained by testing the program on a considerable
number of examples of graphs, in particular on some chemical molecular graphs,
are also included.
