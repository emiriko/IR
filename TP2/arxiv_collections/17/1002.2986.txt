We derive the slow-roll conditions for a non-minimally coupled scalar field
(extended quintessence) during the radiation/matter dominated era extending our
previous results for thawing quintessence. We find that the ratio
$\ddot\phi/3H\dot\phi$ becomes constant but negative, in sharp contrast to the
ratio for the minimally coupled scalar field. We also find that the functional
form of the equation of state of the scalar field asymptotically approaches
that of the minimally coupled thawing quintessence.
