In this paper, design of current controller for a two quadrant DC motor drive
was proposed with the help of model order reduction technique. The calculation
of current controller gain with some approximations in the conventional design
process is replaced by proposed model order reduction method. The model order
reduction technique proposed in this paper gives the better controller gain
value for the DC motor drive. The proposed model order reduction method is a
mixed method, where the numerator polynomial of reduced order model is obtained
by using stability equation method and the denominator polynomial is obtained
by using some approximation technique preceded in this paper. The designed
controllers responses were simulated with the help of MATLAB to show the
validity of the proposed method.
