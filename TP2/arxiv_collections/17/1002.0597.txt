The existing understanding of interglacial periods is that they are initiated
by Milankovitch cycles enhanced by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations. During interglacials, global temperature is also believed to be
primarily controlled by carbon dioxide concentrations, modulated by internal
processes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic
Oscillation. Recent work challenges the fundamental basis of these conceptions.
