Ultracold gases of three distinguishable particles with large scattering
lengths are expected to show rich few-body physics related to the Efimov
effect. We have created three different mixtures of ultracold 6Li atoms and
weakly bound 6Li2 dimers consisting of atoms in three different hyperfine
states and studied their inelastic decay via atom-dimer collisions. We have
found resonant enhancement of the decay due to the crossing of Efimov-like
trimer states with the atom-dimer continuum in one mixture as well as minima of
the decay in another mixture, which we interpret as a suppression of exchange
reactions of the type |12>+|3> -> |23>+|1>. Such a suppression is caused by
interference between different decay paths and demonstrates the possiblity to
use Efimov physics to control the rate constants for molecular exchange
reactions in the ultracold regime.
