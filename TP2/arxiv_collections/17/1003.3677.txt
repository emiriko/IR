We study models in which soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM
become universal at some unification scale, $M_{in}$, above the GUT scale,
$\mgut$. We assume that the scalar masses and gaugino masses have common
values, $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ respectively, at $M_{in}$. We use the
renormalization-group equations of the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT to
evaluate their evolutions down to $\mgut$, studying their dependences on the
unknown parameters of the SU(5) superpotential. After displaying some generic
examples of the evolutions of the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we
discuss the effects on physical sparticle masses in some specific examples. We
note, for example, that near-degeneracy between the lightest neutralino and the
lighter stau is progressively disfavoured as $M_{in}$ increases. This has the
consequence, as we show in $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ planes for several different values
of $\tan \beta$, that the stau coannihilation region shrinks as $M_{in}$
increases, and we delineate the regions of the $(M_{in}, \tan \beta)$ plane
where it is absent altogether. Moreover, as $M_{in}$ increases, the focus-point
region recedes to larger values of $m_0$ for any fixed $\tan \beta$ and
$m_{1/2}$. We conclude that the regions of the $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ plane that are
commonly favoured in phenomenological analyses tend to disappear at large
$M_{in}$.
