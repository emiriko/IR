It is shown that a state that is factorizable in the Hilbert space
corresponding to some choice of degrees of freedom, becomes entangled for a
different choice of degrees of freedom. Therefore, entanglement is not a
special case but is ubiquitous in quantum systems. Simple examples are
calculated and a general proof is provided. The physical relevance of the
change of tensor product structure is mentioned.
