The neutron superfluidity in the inner crust of a neutron star has been
traditionally studied considering either homogeneous neutron matter or only a
small number of nucleons confined inside the spherical Wigner-Seitz cell.
Drawing analogies with the recently discovered multi-band superconductors, we
have solved the anisotropic multi-band BCS gap equations with Bloch boundary
conditions, thus providing a unified description taking consistently into
account both the free neutrons and the nuclear clusters. Calculations have been
carried out using the effective interaction underlying our recent
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov nuclear mass model HFB-16. We have found that even
though the presence of inhomogeneities lowers the neutron pairing gaps, the
reduction is much less than that predicted by previous calculations using the
Wigner-Seitz approximation. We have studied the disappearance of superfluidity
with increasing temperature. As an application we have calculated the neutron
specific heat, which is an important ingredient for modeling the thermal
evolution of newly-born neutron stars. This work provides a new scheme for
realistic calculations of superfluidity in neutron-star crusts.
