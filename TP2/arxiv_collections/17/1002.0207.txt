Spin relaxation torque ${\cal T}$ in uniform metallic ferromagnets with the
spin-orbit interaction arising from random impurities is calculated
microscopically. ${\cal T}$ is shown to be written by spatial derivatives of
the electric field, but is not always given as a divergence of a torque dipole
density. The result is due to the fast dissipation of the orbital angular
momentum, and thus a conserving spin current cannot be defined. It is discussed
that the $\beta$ term in the spin transfer torque can also be asymmetric.
