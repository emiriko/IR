We take the MSSM as a complete theory of low energy phenomena, including
neutrino masses and mixings. This immediately implies that the gravitino is the
only possible dark matter candidate. We study the implications of the
astrophysical experiments such as PAMELA and Fermi-LAT, on this scenario. The
theory can account for both the realistic neutrino masses and mixings, and the
PAMELA data as long as the slepton masses lie in the $500-10^6 $TeV range. The
squarks can be either light or heavy, depending on their contribution to
radiative neutrino masses. On the other hand, the Fermi-LAT data imply heavy
superpartners, all out of LHC reach, simply on the grounds of the energy scale
involved, for the gravitino must weigh more than 2 TeV. The perturbativity of
the theory also implies an upper bound on its mass, approximately $6-7 $TeV.
