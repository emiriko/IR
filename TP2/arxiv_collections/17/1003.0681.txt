We report the discovery of kinematic shock signatures associated with a
localized radio jet interaction in the merging Seyfert galaxy NGC 5929. We
explore the velocity-dependent ionization structure of the gas and find that
low ionization gas at the interaction site is significantly more disturbed than
high ionization gas, which we attribute to a local enhancement of shock
ionization due to the influence of the jet. The characteristic width of the
broad low-ionization emission is consistent with shock velocities predicted
from the ionization conditions of the gas. We interpret the relative prominence
of shocks to the high density of gas in nuclear environment of the galaxy and
place some constraints on their importance as a feedback mechanism in Seyferts.
