In topcolor-assisted technicolor models (TC2) the hitherto unconstrained
lepton flavor mixing induced by the new gauge boson $Z'$ will lead to the
lepton flavor violating productions of $\tau\bar \mu$, $\tau\bar e$ and
$\mu\bar e$ in photon-photon collision at the proposed International Linear
Collider (ILC). Through a comparative analysis of these processes, we find that
the better channels to probe the TC2 is the production of $\tau\bar \mu$ or
$\tau\bar e$ which occurs at a much higher rate than $\mu\bar e$ production due
to the large mixing angle and the large flavor changing coupling, and may reach
the detectable level of the ILC for a large part of the parameter space. Since
the rates predicted by the Standard Model are far below the detectable level,
these processes may serve as a sensitive probe for the TC2 model.
