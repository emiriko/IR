We construct a model with D5 branes wrapped on a deformed and resolved $A_6$
singularity which realizes metastable supersymmetry breaking and minimal gauge
mediation. Supersymmetry is broken at tree level by the F--term of singlet
which also obtains a VEV as required in gauge mediation. Three nodes of the
singularity are used to break supersymmetry whereas the other three realize
gauge mediation. The supersymmetry breaking scale is suppressed due to brane
instanton effects which are computed using a geometric transition.
