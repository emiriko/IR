The differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution protocol is formalised
as a prepare-and-measure scheme and translated into an equivalent
entanglement-based protocol. A necessary condition for security is that Bob's
measurement can detect the entanglement of the distributed state in the
entanglement-based translation, which implies that his measurement is described
by non-commuting POVM elements. This condition is shown to be met.
