In this thesis we discuss some applications of the theory of Anosov systems
to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, we perform a
perturbative check of the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation for a simple
Anosov system; we find that the lack of differentiability of the time reversal
operator implies a violation of the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation.
