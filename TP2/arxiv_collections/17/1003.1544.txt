For arbitrary F-algebra, in which the operation of addition is defined, I
explore biring of matrices of mappings. The sum of matrices is determined by
the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product
of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is
called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving
system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a
system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations
contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.
  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of
addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of
the ring. The representation of tensor product A\otimes A in algebra A
generates the set of linear transformations of algebra A.
  The results of this research will be useful for mathematicians and physicists
who deal with different algebras.
