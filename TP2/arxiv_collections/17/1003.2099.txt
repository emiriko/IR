We investigate the mechanism of the nonparaxial propagation of the tightly
focused beams in the view of Fourier optics. It shows that it is the phase of
the angular spectrum which induces the interesting evolution of the tightly
focused beams. Based on the theory of Fourier optics, we propose an approach on
controlling and detecting the focusing spot of the tightly focused beams.
