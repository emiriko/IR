A bot is a piece of software that is usually installed on an infected machine
without the user's knowledge. A bot is controlled remotely by the attacker
under a Command and Control structure. Recent statistics show that bots
represent one of the fastest growing threats to our network by performing
malicious activities such as email spamming or keylogging. However, few bot
detection techniques have been developed to date. In this paper, we investigate
a behavioural algorithm to detect a single bot that uses keylogging activity.
Our approach involves the use of function calls analysis for the detection of
the bot with a keylogging component. Correlation of the frequency of a
specified time-window is performed to enhance he detection scheme. We perform a
range of experiments with the spybot. Our results show that there is a high
correlation between some function calls executed by this bot which indicates
abnormal activity in our system.
