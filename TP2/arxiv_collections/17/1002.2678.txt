Dielectric nano-swithes made of the materials that exhibit piezoelectric
and/or flexoelectric properties with significant electro-mechanical coupling
are considered. In this case, a nonuniform strain field may locally break
inversion symmetry and induce polarization even in nonpiezoelectrics. At
reducing dimensions to the nanoscale, the flexoelectric effect demonstrates the
nonlocality of the dielectric materials and plays more significant role than
piezoelectric effect. The flexoelectric effect is included into consideration
via additional term coupling strain gradient and polarization in the electric
enthalpy density. The equations of motion of the improved Euler-Bernoulli and
Timoshenko beam models, and 2-D plate theory have been obtained.
