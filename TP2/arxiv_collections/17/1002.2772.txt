We consider a quantum linear oscillator coupled to a bath in equilibrium at
an arbitrary temperature and then exposed to an external field arbitrary in
form and strength. We then derive the reduced density operator in closed form
of the coupled oscillator in a non-equilibrium state at an arbitrary time.
