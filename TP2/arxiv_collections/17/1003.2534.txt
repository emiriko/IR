The study gives a decisive answer to the recently risen question about the
type and origin of interaction between spin vortices and spin vacancies in 2D
spin models. The approach is based on the low-temperature approximation of the
2D XY model known as the Villain model and does not involve any additional
approximations, thus preserving the lattice structure. The exact form of the
Hamiltonian describing a system of topological charges and a vacant site
supports the attractive type of interaction between the vacancy and the
charges. The quantitative difference between the characteristics of the vortex
behavior in the 2D XY and Villain models due to the different energy of the
vortex "cores" in the two models is pointed out. This leads to a conclusion
that the interaction between a vortex and a spin vacancy and between a vortex
and the antivortex differs quantitatively for small separations in the two
mentioned models.
