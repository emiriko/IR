The Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) project has collected more
than a billion photometric measurements since 2005 January. These sky survey
data-covering timescales from a fraction of a second to a few hundred days-are
a useful source to study stellar variability. A total of 167 star fields,
mostly along the ecliptic plane, have been selected for photometric monitoring
with the TAOS telescopes. This paper presents our initial analysis of a search
for periodic variable stars from the time-series TAOS data on one particular
TAOS field, No. 151 (RA = 17$^{\rm h}30^{\rm m}6\fs$67, Dec = 27\degr17\arcmin
30\arcsec, J2000), which had been observed over 47 epochs in 2005. A total of
81 candidate variables are identified in the 3 square degree field, with
magnitudes in the range 8 < R < 16. On the basis of the periodicity and shape
of the lightcurves, 29 variables, 15 of which were previously unknown, are
classified as RR Lyrae, Cepheid, delta Scuti, SX Phonencis, semi-regular and
eclipsing binaries.
