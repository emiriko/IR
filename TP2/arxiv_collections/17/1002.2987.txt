When a ligand that is bound to an integral membrane receptor is pulled, the
membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton can deform before either the membrane
delaminates from the cytoskeleton or the ligand detaches from the receptor. If
the membrane delaminates from the cytoskeleton, it may be further extruded and
form a membrane tether. We develop a phenomenological model for this processes
by assuming that deformations obey Hooke's law up to a critical force at which
the cell membrane locally detaches from the cytoskeleton and a membrane tether
forms. We compute the probability of tether formation and show that they can be
extruded only within an intermediate range of force loading rates and pulling
velocities. The mean tether length that arises at the moment of ligand
detachment is computed as are the force loading rates and pulling velocities
that yield the longest tethers.
