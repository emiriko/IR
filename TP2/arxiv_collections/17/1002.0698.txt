We address the problem of classification of contact Fano manifolds. It is
conjectured that every such manifold is necessarily homogeneous. We prove that
the Killing form, the Lie algebra grading and parts of the Lie bracket can be
read from geometry of an arbitrary contact manifold. Minimal rational curves on
contact manifolds (or contact lines) and their chains are the essential
ingredients for our constructions. Along the way we collect several facts about
bundles of projective lines admitting a contractible section, which might be of
independent interest.
