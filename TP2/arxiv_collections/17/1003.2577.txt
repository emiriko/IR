We study the correlations between the Very Long Baseline Array radio emission
at 15 GHz, extended emission at 151 MHz, and optical nuclear emission at 5100
AA for a complete sample of 135 compact jets. We use the partial Kendall's tau
correlation analysis to check the link between radio properties of parsec-scale
jets and optical luminosities of host AGN. We find a significant positive
correlation for 99 quasars between optical nuclear luminosities and total radio
(VLBA) luminosities of unresolved cores at 15 GHz originated at milliarcseconds
scales. For 18 BL Lacs, the optical continuum emission correlates with the
radio emission of the jet at 15 GHz. We suggest that the radio and optical
emission are beamed and originate in the innermost part of the
sub--parsec-scale jet in quasars. Analysis of the relation between the apparent
speed of the jet and the optical nuclear luminosity at 5100 AA supports the
relativistic beaming model for the optical emission generated in the jet, and
allows the peak values of the intrinsic optical luminosity of the jet and its
Lorentz factor to be estimated for the populations of quasars, BL Lacs, and
radio galaxies. The radio-loudness of quasars is found to increase at high
redshifts, which can be a result of lower efficiency of the accretion in AGN
having higher radio luminosities. A strong positive correlation is found
between the intrinsic kinetic power of the jet and the apparent luminosities of
the total and the unresolved core emission of the jet at 15 GHz. This
correlation is interpreted in terms of intrinsically more luminous parsec-scale
jet producing more luminous extended structure which is detectable at low radio
frequencies, 151 MHz. A possibility that the low frequency radio emission is
relativistically beamed in superluminal AGN and therefore correlates with radio
luminosity of the jet at 15 GHz can not be ruled out (abridged).
