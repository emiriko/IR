Wyner's work on wiretap channels and the recent works on information
theoretic security are based on random codes. Achieving information theoretical
security with practical coding schemes is of definite interest. In this note,
the attempt is to overcome this elusive task by employing the polar coding
technique of Ar{\i}kan. It is shown that polar codes achieve non-trivial
perfect secrecy rates for binary-input degraded wiretap channels while enjoying
their low encoding-decoding complexity. In the special case of symmetric main
and eavesdropper channels, this coding technique achieves the secrecy capacity.
Next, fading erasure wiretap channels are considered and a secret key agreement
scheme is proposed, which requires only the statistical knowledge of the
eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). The enabling factor is the
creation of advantage over Eve, by blindly using the proposed scheme over each
fading block, which is then exploited with privacy amplification techniques to
generate secret keys.
