We present observations of newly discovered 24 micron circumstellar
structures detected with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS)
around three evolved stars in the Cygnus-X star forming region. One of the
objects, BD+43 3710, has a bipolar nebula, possibly due to an outflow or a
torus of material. A second, HBHA 4202-22, a Wolf-Rayet candidate, shows a
circular shell of 24 micron emission suggestive of either a limb-brightened
shell or disk seen face-on. No diffuse emission was detected around either of
these two objects in the Spitzer 3.6-8 micron Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
bands. The third object is the luminous blue variable candidate G79.29+0.46. We
resolved the previously known inner ring in all four IRAC bands. The 24 micron
emission from the inner ring extends ~1.2 arcmin beyond the shorter wavelength
emission, well beyond what can be attributed to the difference in resolutions
between MIPS and IRAC. Additionally, we have discovered an outer ring of 24
micron emission, possibly due to an earlier episode of mass loss. For the two
shell stars, we present the results of radiative transfer models, constraining
the stellar and dust shell parameters. The shells are composed of amorphous
carbon grains, plus polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the case of
G79.29+0.46. Both G79.29+0.46 and HBHA 4202-22 lie behind the main Cygnus-X
cloud. Although G79.29+0.46 may simply be on the far side of the cloud, HBHA
4202-22 is unrelated to the Cygnus-X star formation region.
