The formation energies of nanostructures play an important role in
determining their properties, including the catalytic activity. For the case of
15 different rutile and 8 different perovskite metal oxides, we find that the
density functional theory (DFT) calculated formation energies of (2,2)
nanorods, (3,3) nanotubes, and the (110) and (100) surfaces may be described
semi-quantitatively by the fraction of metal--oxygen bonds broken and the
bonding band centers in the bulk metal oxide.
