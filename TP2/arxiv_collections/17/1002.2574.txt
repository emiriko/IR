We investigate the symmetry breaking role of noise in adiabatic quantum
computing using the example of the CNOT gate. In particular, we analyse
situations where the choice of initial configuration leads to symmetries in the
Hamiltonian and degeneracies in the spectrum. We show that, in these
situations, there exists an optimal level of noise that maximises the success
probability and the fidelity of the final state. The effects of an artificial
noise source with a time-dependent amplitude are also explored and it is found
that such a scheme would offer a considerable performance enhancement.
