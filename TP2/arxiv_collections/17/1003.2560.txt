Previous ARPES experiments in NaxCoO2 reported both a strongly renormalized
bandwidth near the Fermi level and moderately renormalized Fermi velocities,
leaving it unclear whether the correlations are weak or strong and how they
could be quantified. We explain why this situation occurs and solve the problem
by extracting clearly the coherent and incoherent parts of the band crossing
the Fermi level. We show that one can use their relative weight to estimate
self-consistently the quasiparticle weight Z, which turns out to be very small
Z=0.15 +/- 0.05. We suggest this method could be a reliable way to study the
evolution of correlations in cobaltates and for comparison with other strongly
correlated systems.
