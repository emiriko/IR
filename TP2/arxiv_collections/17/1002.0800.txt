We present a detailed analysis of the XMM-Newton RGS high resolution X-ray
spectra of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, Mrk573. This analysis is complemented by the
study of the Chandra image, and its comparison to optical (HST) and radio (VLA)
data. The soft X-ray emission is mainly due to gas photoionised by the central
AGN, as indicated by the detection of radiative recombination continua from
OVII and OVIII, as well as by the prominence of the OVII forbidden line. This
result is confirmed by the best fit obtained with a self-consistent CLOUDY
photoionisation model. However, a collisionally excited component is also
required, in order to reproduce the FeXVII lines, accounting for about 1/3 of
the total luminosity in the 15-26 A band. Once adopted the same model in the
Chandra ACIS data, another photoionised component, with higher ionisation
parameter, is needed to take into account emission from higher Z metals. The
broadband ACIS spectrum also confirms the Compton-thick nature of the source.
The imaging analysis shows the close morphological correspondence between the
soft X-ray and the [OIII] emission. The radio emission appears much more
compact, although clearly aligned with the narrow line region. The collisional
phase of the soft X-ray emission may be due to starburst, requiring a star
formation rate of $\simeq5-9$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, but there is no clear
evidence of this kind of activity from other wavelengths. On the other hand, it
may be related to the radio ejecta, responsible for the heating of the plasma
interacting with the outflow, but the estimated pressure of the hot gas is much
larger than the pressure of the radio jets, assuming equipartition and under
reasonable physical parameters.
