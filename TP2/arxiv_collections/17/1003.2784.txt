In this paper non-linear dynamics of a periodically forced excitable glow
discharge plasma has been studied. The experiments were performed in glow
discharge plasma where excitability was achieved for suitable discharge voltage
and gas pressure. The plasma was first perturbed by a sub-threshold sawtooth
periodic signal, and we obtained small sub-threshold oscillations. These
oscillations showed resonance when the frequency of the perturbation was around
the characteristic frequency the plasma, and hence may be useful to estimate
characteristic of an excitable system. On the other hand, when the perturbation
was supra-threshold, system showed frequency entrainments. We obtained harmonic
frequency entrainments for perturbation frequency greater than the
characteristic frequency of the system and for lesser than the characteristic
frequency, system showed only excitable behaviour.
