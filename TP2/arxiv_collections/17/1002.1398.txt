The transport properties of a octane-dithiol (ODT) molecule coupled to
Au(001) leads are analyzed using density functional theory and non-equilibrium
Green functions. It is shown that a symmetric molecule can turn into a diode
under influence of a local electric field created by an external charged probe.
The origin of the asymmetry of the current--voltage ($I-V$) dependence is
traced back to the appearance of a probe induced quasi--local state in the
pseudogap of the ODT molecule. The induced state affects electron transport,
provided it is close to the Fermi level of the leads. An asymmetric placement
of the charged probe along the alkane chain makes the induced quasi--local
state in the energy gap very sensitive to the bias voltage and results in
rectification of the current. The results based on DFT are supported by
independent calculations using a simple one--particle model Hamiltonian.
