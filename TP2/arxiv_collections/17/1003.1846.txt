We study charge pumping when a combination of static potentials and
potentials oscillating with a time period T is applied in a one-dimensional
system of non-interacting electrons. We consider both an infinite system using
the Dirac equation in the continuum approximation, and a periodic ring with a
finite number of sites using the tight-binding model. The infinite system is
taken to be coupled to reservoirs on the two sides which are at the same
chemical potential and temperature. We consider a model in which oscillating
potentials help the electrons to access a transmission resonance produced by
the static potentials, and show that non-adiabatic pumping violates the simple
\sin \phi rule which is obeyed by adiabatic two-site pumping. For the ring, we
do not introduce any reservoirs, and we present a method for calculating the
current averaged over an infinite time using the time evolution operator U(T)
assuming a purely Hamiltonian evolution. We analytically show that the averaged
current is zero if the Hamiltonian is real and time reversal invariant.
Numerical studies indicate another interesting result, namely, that the
integrated current is zero for any time-dependence of the potential if it is
applied to only one site. Finally we study the effects of pumping at two sites
on a ring at resonant and non-resonant frequencies, and show that the pumped
current has different dependences on the pumping amplitude in the two cases.
