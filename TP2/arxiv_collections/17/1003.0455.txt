We report on an on-going test campaign of more than 5000 Schottky CdTe
detectors (4x4x1 mm^3), over a sample of twelve thousands, provided by Acrorad
Co., Ltd (Japan). 6400 of these detectors will be used to build the detection
plane of the ECLAIRs camera on the Chinese-French gamma-ray burst mission SVOM.
These tests are mandatory to fulfill the prime requirement of ECLAIRs to detect
gamma-ray burst photons down to 4 keV. The detectors will be operated at -20C
under a reverse bias of 600 V. We found that 78% of the detectors already
tested could be considered for the flight model. We measured a mean energy
resolution of 1.8 keV at 59.6 keV. We investigated the polarization effect
first at room temperature and low bias voltage for faster analysis. We found
that the spectroscopic degradation in quantum efficiency, gain and energy
resolution, starts as soon as the bias is turned on: first slowly and then
dramatically after a time t_p which depends on the temperature and the voltage
value. Preliminary tests under in-flight conditions (-20C, -600 V) showed that
the detectors should remain stable over a timescale larger than a day. We also
measured the mean activation energy of 170 Schottky CdTe detectors. We found
evidence for two distinct populations of detectors: the main one centered at
0.64 eV, interpreted as due to cadmium vacancies in the crystal, and the second
population centered at 0.54 eV, correlated with a lower apparent resistivity
(abridged).
