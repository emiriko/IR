A molecular level analysis of segmental trajectories obtained from molecular
dynamics simulations is used to obtain the full relaxation time spectrum in
aging polymer glasses subject to three different deformation protocols. As in
experiments, dynamics can be accelerated by several orders of magnitude, and a
narrowing of the distribution of relaxation times during creep is directly
observed. Additionally, the acceleration factor describing the transformation
of the relaxation time distributions is computed and found to obey a universal
dependence on the global strain, independent of age and deformation protocol.
