We report on a detailed abundance analysis of the strongly r-process enhanced
giant star, HE 2327-5642 ([Fe/H] = -2.78, [r/Fe] = +0.99). Determination of
stellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality
VLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionization
balance between Fe I and Fe II, and Ca I and Ca II. Accurate abundances for a
total of 40 elements and for 23 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th
were determined. The heavy element abundance pattern of HE 2327-5642 is in
excellent agreement with those previously derived for other strongly r-process
enhanced stars. Elements in the range from Ba to Hf match the scaled Solar
r-process pattern very well. No firm conclusion can be drawn with respect to a
relationship between the fisrt neutron-capture peak elements, Sr to Pd, in HE
2327-5642 and the Solar r-process, due to the uncertainty of the latter. A
clear distinction in Sr/Eu abundance ratios was found between the halo stars
with different europium enhancement. The strongly r-process enhanced stars
reveal a low Sr/Eu abundance ratio at [Sr/Eu] = -0.92+-0.13, while the stars
with 0 < [Eu/Fe] < 1 and [Eu/Fe] < 0 have 0.36 dex and 0.93 dex larger Sr/Eu
values, respectively. Radioactive dating for HE 2327-5642 with the observed
thorium and rare-earth element abundance pairs results in an average age of
13.3 Gyr, when based on the high-entropy wind calculations, and 5.9 Gyr, when
using the Solar r-residuals. HE 2327-5642 is suspected to be radial-velocity
variable based on our high-resolution spectra, covering ~4.3 years.
