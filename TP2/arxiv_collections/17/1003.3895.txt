This article presents a new mathematical framework to perform statistical
analysis on time-indexed sequences of 2D or 3D shapes. At the core of this
statistical analysis is the task of time interpolation of such data. Current
models in use can be compared to linear interpolation for one dimensional data.
We develop a spline interpolation method which is directly related to cubic
splines on a Riemannian manifold. Our strategy consists of introducing a
control variable on the Hamiltonian equations of the geodesics. Motivated by
statistical modeling of spatiotemporal data, we also design a stochastic model
to deal with random shape evolutions. This model is closely related to the
spline model since the control variable previously introduced is set as a
random force perturbing the evolution. Although we focus on the finite
dimensional case of landmarks, our models can be extended to infinite
dimensional shape spaces, and they provide a first step for a non parametric
growth model for shapes taking advantage of the widely developed framework of
large deformations by diffeomorphisms.
