We use numerical simulations to examine vortex states and dynamics in
periodic funnel geometries where a drive is applied in the easy flow direction.
We show that this system exhibits a number of different commensurability
effects when the vortex configurations match to both the periodicity of the
array and the geometry of the funnels. The vortex configurations in this system
are generally different from those observed for single isolated triangular
superconducting samples due to the coupling of vortices in adjacent funnels. At
certain matching fields, peaks in the critical current are absent due to the
particular vortex configurations that occur at these fields. We find that the
overall depinning force increases with increasing vortex density as a result of
the enhanced vortex-vortex interactions caused by a crowding effect at the
funnel tips. When a system becomes less mobile as a result of increased
particle interactions, it is said to exhibit a jamming behavior. Under an
applied drive we observe a series of elastic and plastic vortex flow phases
which produce pronounced features such as jumps or dips in the transport
curves. In all of the flow phases, only one vortex can pass through the funnel
tip at a time due to the vortex-vortex repulsion forces. As a consequence of
this constraint, we observe the remarkable result that the sum of the vortex
velocities at a fixed drive remains nearly constant with increasing magnetic
field B rather than increasing linearly. This result is similar to the behavior
of sand in an hourglass. We also show how noise fluctuations can be used to
distinguish the different flow phases. Our results should be readily
generalizable to other systems of particles flowing in periodic funnel
geometries, such as colloids or Wigner crystals.
