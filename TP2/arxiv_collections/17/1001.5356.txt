We perform an ab-initio calculation for the binding energy of ${}^6Li$ using
the CD-Bonn 2000 NN potential renormalized with the Lee-Suzuki method. The
many-body approach to the problem is the Hybrid Multideterminant method. The
results indicate a binding energy of about $31 MeV$, within a few hundreds KeV
uncertainty. The center of mass diagnostics are also discussed.
