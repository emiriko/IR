We present the results of the asteroseismological analysis of two rich DAVs,
G38-29 and R808, recent targets of the Whole Earth Telescope. 20 periods
between 413 s and 1089 s were found in G38-29's pulsation spectrum, while R808
is an even richer pulsator, with 24 periods between 404 s and 1144 s.
Traditionally, DAVs that have been analyzed asteroseismologically have had
fewer than half a dozen modes. Such a large number of modes presents a special
challenge to white dwarf asteroseismology, but at the same time has the
potential to yield a detailed picture of the interior chemical make-up of
DAVs.We explore this possibility by varying the core profiles as well as the
layer masses.We use an iterative grid search approach to find best fit models
for G38-29 and R808 and comment on some of the intricacies of fine grid
searches in white dwarf asteroseismology.
