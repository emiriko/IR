The successful fabrication of single layer graphene has greatly stimulated
the progress of the research on graphene. In this article, focusing on the
basic electronic and transport properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), we
review the recent progress of experimental fabrication of GNRs, and the
theoretical and experimental investigations of physical properties and device
applications of GNRs. We also briefly discuss the research efforts on the spin
polarization of GNRs in relation to the edge states.
