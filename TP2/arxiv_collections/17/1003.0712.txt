We consider explicit type II string constructions of backgrounds containing
warped and squashed anti de Sitter spaces. These are obtained via T duality
from brane intersections including dyonic black strings, plane waves and
monopoles. We also study the supersymmetry of these solutions and discuss
special values of the deformation parameters.
