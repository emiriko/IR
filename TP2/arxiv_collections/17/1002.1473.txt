We show that the local parity violation in the quark-gluon plasma supports
existence of free (meta)stable knots of deconfined hot quark matter stabilized
by superstrong magnetic fields. The magnetic field in the knots resembles the
spheromak plasma state of the magnetic confinement approach to nuclear fusion.
The size of the knot is quantized, being inversely proportional to the chiral
conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma. The parity symmetry is broken inside
the knot. Particles produced in the decays of the knots have unusual azimuthal
distribution and specific flavor content. We argue that these knots may be
created in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.
