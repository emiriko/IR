The quantum version of the Bochkov-Kuzovlev identity is derived on the basis
of the appropriate definition of work as the difference of the measured
internal energies of a quantum system at the beginning and at the end of an
external action on the system given by a prescribed protocol. According to the
spirit of the original Bochkov-Kuzovlev approach, we adopt the "exclusive"
viewpoint, meaning that the coupling to the external work-source is {\it not}
counted as part of the internal energy. The corresponding canonical and
microcanonical quantum fluctuation theorems are derived as well, and are
compared to the respective theorems obtained within the "inclusive" approach.
The relations between the quantum inclusive-work $w$, the exclusive-work $w_0$
and the dissipated-work $w_{dis}$, are discussed and clarified. We show by an
explicit example that $w_0$ and $w_{dis}$ are distinct stochastic quantities
obeying different statistics.
