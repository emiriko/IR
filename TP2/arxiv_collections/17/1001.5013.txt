The quark condensate is calculated in terms of the effective string tension
and the constituent quark mass. For 3 colors and 2 light flavors, the
constituent mass is bounded from below by the value of 460 MeV. This value is
only accessible when the string tension decreases linearly with the Schwinger
proper time. For this reason, the Hausdorff dimension of a light-quark
trajectory is equal to 4, indicating that these trajectories are similar to
branched polymers, which can describe a weak first-order deconfinement phase
transition in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. Using this indication, we develop a
gluon-chain model based on such trajectories.
