We experimentally study spatial fluctuations of the local density of states
(LDOS) inside three-dimensional random photonic media. The LDOS is probed at
many positions inside the random photonic media by measuring emission rates of
a large number of individual fluorescent nanospheres. The emission rates are
observed to fluctuate spatially. We analyze the variance of these fluctuations
for samples with different scattering strengths. The measured variance of the
emission rates agrees well with a model that takes into account the effect of
the nearest scatterer only.
