We introduce a new slave-boson mean-field theory which allows the
investigation of general multi-band Hubbard models. Unlike earlier attempts of
such a generalisation, in our approach the quantum-mechanical problem is
exactly reformulated in an extended Hilbert space of Fermions and Bosons before
a mean-field approximation is applied. Systems with superconducting order
parameters are naturally included in our formalism. Our ground-state energy
functional agrees with the corresponding quantity derived within the Gutzwiller
theory.
