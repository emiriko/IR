In local helioseismology numerical simulations of wave propagation are useful
to model the interaction of solar waves with perturbations to a background
solar model. However, the solution to the equations of motions include
convective modes that can swamp the waves we are interested in. For this
reason, we choose to first stabilise the background solar model against
convection by altering the vertical pressure gradient. Here we compare the
eigenmodes of our convectively stabilised model with a standard solar model
(Model S) and find a good agreement.
