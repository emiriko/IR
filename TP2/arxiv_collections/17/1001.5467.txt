Leading and subleading twist transverse momentum dependent parton
distribution functions (TMDs) are studied in a quark model framework provided
by the bag model. A complete set of relations among different TMDs is derived,
and the question is discussed how model-(in)dependent such relations are. A
connection of the pretzelosity distribution and quark orbital angular momentum
is derived. Numerical results are presented, and applications for phenomenology
discussed. In particular, it is shown that in the valence-x region the bag
model supports a Gaussian Ansatz for the transverse momentum dependence of
TMDs.
