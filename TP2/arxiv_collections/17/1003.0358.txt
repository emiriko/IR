Good old on-line back-propagation for plain multi-layer perceptrons yields a
very low 0.35% error rate on the famous MNIST handwritten digits benchmark. All
we need to achieve this best result so far are many hidden layers, many neurons
per layer, numerous deformed training images, and graphics cards to greatly
speed up learning.
