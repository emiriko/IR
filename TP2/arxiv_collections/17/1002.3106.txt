The new generation of ground-based, large-aperture solar telescopes promises
to significantly increase our capabilities to understand the many basic
phenomena taking place in the Sun at all atmospheric layers and how they relate
to each other. A (non-exaustive) summary of the main scientific arguments we
have to pursue these impressive technological goals is presented. We illustrate
how imaging, polarimetry, and spectroscopy can benefit from the new telescopes
and how several wavelength bands should be observed to study the atmospheric
coupling from the upper convection zone all the way to the corona. The
particular science case of sunspot penumbrae is barely discussed as a specific
example.
