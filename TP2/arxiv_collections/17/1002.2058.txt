Vortex shedding from an obstacle potential moving in a Bose-Einstein
condensate is investigated. Long-lived alternately aligned vortex pairs are
found to form in the wake, as for the von K\'arm\'an vortex street in classical
viscous fluids. Various patterns of vortex shedding are systematically studied
and the drag force on the obstacle is calculated. It is shown that the
phenomenon can be observed in a trapped system.
