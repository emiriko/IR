Spectacular breakthroughs in numerical relativity now make it possible to
compute spacetime dynamics in almost complete generality, allowing us to model
the coalescence and merger of binary black holes with essentially no
approximations. The primary limitation of these calculations is now
computational. In particular, it is difficult to model systems with large mass
ratio and large spins, since one must accurately resolve the multiple
lengthscales which play a role in such systems. Perturbation theory can play an
important role in extending the reach of computational modeling for binary
systems. In this paper, we present first results of a code which allows us to
model the gravitational waves generated by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown
of a binary system in which one member of the binary is much more massive than
the other. This allows us to accurately calibrate binary dynamics in the large
mass ratio regime. We focus in this analysis on the recoil imparted to the
merged remnant by these waves. We closely examine the "antikick", an anti-phase
cancellation of the recoil arising from the plunge and ringdown waves,
described in detail by Schnittman et al. We find that, for orbits aligned with
the black hole spin, the antikick grows as a function of spin. The total recoil
is smallest for prograde coalescence into a rapidly rotating black hole, and
largest for retrograde coalescence. Amusingly, this completely reverses the
predicted trend for kick versus spin from analyses that only include inspiral
information.
