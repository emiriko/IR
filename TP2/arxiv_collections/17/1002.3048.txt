We evaluate within the LO DGLAP approximation the dependence on energy of the
cross section of the photo(electro)production of vector meson V
($V=J/\psi,...$) in the hard elastic processes off a parton $\gamma^*+g\to
V=J/\psi+g$ as the function of momentum transfer $t=(q_{\gamma}-p_V)^2$. We
demonstrate that in the limit $-t \ge m_V^2 +Q^2$ the cross section does not
contain double logarithmic terms in any order of the DGLAP approximation
leading to the energy independent cross section. Thus the energy dependence of
cross section $\gamma^*+p\to J/\psi+{\rm rapidity ~gap} +X$ is governed at
large $t$ by the gluon distribution within a proton, i.e. it is unambiguously
predicted within the DGLAP approximation including the stronger $W_{\gamma N}$
dependence at larger $-t$ . This prediction explains recent HERA data. The
calculations which follow perturbative Pomeron logic predict opposite trend of
a weaker $W_{\gamma N}$ dependence at larger $t$. We explain that at the HERA
energies double logarithmic terms characteristic for DGLAP approximation
dominate in the hard processes as the consequence of constraints due to
energy-momentum conservation. We give predictions for ultraperipheral hard
diffractive processes at the LHC and show that these processes are well suited
for looking for the contribution of the single logarithmic terms due to the
gluon emission in the multiRegge kinematics. We also comment on the
interrelation between energy and $t$ dependence of the cross sections of the
hard exclusive processes.
