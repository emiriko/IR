In weakly inhomogeneous media, Maxwell equations assume a Dirac-like form
that is particularly apt for the study of paraxial propagation. Using this
form, and via the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation technique of the Dirac
equation, we study the spin transport of paraxial light beams in weakly
inhomogeneous media. We derive the Berry effect terms and establish the spin
Hall effect and the Rytov rotation law for polarized paraxial beam transport.
