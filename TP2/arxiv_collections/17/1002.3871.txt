The array factor of a both geometrically and electrically uniform array is
the simple formula for the complex geometric progression sum. This fact,
although results in the simplest of all possible analytical designs, obviously
does not in the least simplify the complicated practical problem of feeding the
array elements using multiple driving points. In order to begin the examination
of uniform linear arrays with a single driving point, this short paper presents
a compact study of the end-fed space arrays with application to geometrically
uniform, self-standing linear arrays of parallel dipoles. A number of test
array models were simulated, constructed and their radiation pattern was then
measured. The experimental and computational results were found to be in good
agreement. The developed software applications are available through the
Internet as FLOSS Free Libre Open Source Software.
