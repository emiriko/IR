First-principles calculations were used to compute the dielectric
permittivities of hypothetical [La,Sc]2O3 solid solutions in the cubic
(bixbyite) and hexagonal La2O3 phases. Dielectric enhancement is predicted at
small Sc concentrations due to the rattling ion effect. Similar calculations
for a model amorphous La2O3 structure show little change in permittivity when a
small amount of Sc is substituted for La. In this case, the local environment
around the Sc changes in a way that compensates for the rattling ion effect.
