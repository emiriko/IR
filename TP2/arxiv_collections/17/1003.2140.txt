At a superconductor (S)-normal metal (N) junction pairing correlations can
"leak-out" into the N region. This proximity effect [1, 2] modifies the system
transport properties and can lead to supercurrent flow in SNS junctions [3].
Recent experimental works showed the potential of semiconductor nanowires (NWs)
as building blocks for nanometre-scale devices [4-7], also in combination with
superconducting elements [8-12]. Here, we demonstrate an InAs NW Josephson
transistor where supercurrent is controlled by hot-quasiparticle injection from
normal-metal electrodes. Operational principle is based on the modification of
NW electron-energy distribution [13-20] that can yield reduced dissipation and
high-switching speed. We shall argue that exploitation of this principle with
heterostructured semiconductor NWs opens the way to a host of
out-of-equilibrium hybrid-nanodevice concepts [7, 21].
