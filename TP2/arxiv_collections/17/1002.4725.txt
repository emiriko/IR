A \emph{Mathematica} Notebook is presented which allows for the transfer or
any kind of polynomial expression to \emph{Matlab}. The output is formatted in
such a way that \emph{Matlab} routines such as "Root" can be readily
implemented. Once the Notebook has been executed, only one copy-paste operation
in necessary.
