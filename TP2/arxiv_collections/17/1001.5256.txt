The relativistic nuclear recoil, higher-order interelectronic-interaction,
and screened QED corrections to the transition energies in Li-like ions are
evaluated. The calculation of the relativistic recoil effect is performed to
all orders in 1/Z. The interelectronic-interaction correction to the transition
energies beyond the two-photon exchange level is evaluated to all orders in 1/Z
within the Breit approximation. The evaluation is carried out employing the
large-scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm method. The rigorous
calculation of the complete gauge invariant sets of the screened self-energy
and vacuum-polarization diagrams is performed utilizing a local screening
potential as the zeroth-order approximation. The theoretical predictions for
the 2p_j-2s transition energies are compiled and compared with available
experimental data in the range of the nuclear charge number Z=10-60.
