In this paper we describe the semi-spectral linear MHD (SLiM) code which we
have written to follow the interaction of linear waves through an inhomogeneous
three-dimensional solar atmosphere. The background model allows almost
arbitrary perturbations of density, temperature, sound speed as well as
magnetic and velocity fields. We give details of several of the tests we have
used to check the code. The code will be useful in understanding the
helioseismic signatures of various solar features, including sunspots.
