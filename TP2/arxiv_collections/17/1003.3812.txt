We have determined HC2(T) for FeSe1-xTex (x=0.52) single crystals using
resistivity measurements at high static and pulsed magnetic field, as well as
specific heat measurements up to 9T. We find that the significant anisotropy of
the initial slope of HC2(T) determined from resistivity measurements, is not
present when HC2 is determined from the specific heat results. This suggests
that the thermodynamic upper critical field is almost isotropic, and that
anisotropic vortex dynamics play a role. Further evidence of anisotropic vortex
dynamics is found in the behaviour in pulsed field. We also find that Pauli
limiting must be included in order to fit the temperature dependence of HC2,
indicating probably higher effective mass in FeSe1-xTex than in other Fe
superconductors.
