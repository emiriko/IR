The ground state of a bilayer quantum Hall system at $\nu_{\rm T}=1$ with
model pseudopotential is investigated by the DMRG method. Firstly,
pseudopotential parameters appropriate for the system with finite layer
thickness are derived, and it is found that the finite thickness makes the
excitonic phase more stable. Secondly, a model, where only a few
pseudopotentials with small relative angular momentum have finite values, is
studied, and it is clarified how the excitonic phase is destroyed as
intra-layer pseudopotential becomes larger. The importance of the intra-layer
repulsive interaction at distance twice of the magnetic length for the
destruction of the excitonic phase is found.
