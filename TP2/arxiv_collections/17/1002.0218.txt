The isotriplet Sigmac(2800) baryon with possible quantum numbers J(P) =
1/2(+), 1/2(-) or 3/2(+), 3/2(-) is considered as a hadronic molecule composed
of a nucleon and a D meson. We determine the strong two-body decay widths
Sigmac to Lambdac + pi which are shown to be consistent with current data for
the J(P) = 1/2(+) and J(P) = 3/2(-) assignments.
