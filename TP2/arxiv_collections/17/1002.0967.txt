By simulating the dissociation of O2 molecules on the Be(0001) surface using
the first-principles molecular dynamics approach, we propose a new atomistic
model for the surface oxidation of sp metals. In our model, only the
dissociation of the first oxygen molecule needs to overcome an energy barrier,
while the subsequent oxygen molecules dissociate barrierlessly around the
adsorption area. Consequently, oxide islands form on the metal surface, and
grow up in a lateral way. We also discover that the firstly dissociated oxygen
atoms are not so mobile on the Be(0001) surface, as on the Al(111) surface. Our
atomistic model enlarges the knowledge on metal surface oxidations by perfectly
explaining the initial stage during the surface oxidation of Be, and might be
applicable to some other sp metal surfaces.
