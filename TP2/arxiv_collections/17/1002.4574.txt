The present report is dedicated to show that ferromagnetic La0.67Ca0.33MnO3
(LCMN) particles can be better described in the framework of ferrimagnetic
model. To confirm the ferrimagnetic signature in ferromagnetic LCMN particles,
the temperature dependence of the inverse of magnetic susceptibility in the
paramagnetic state of the samples was taken as a tool of data analysis. The
observed ferrimagnetism is understood as an effect of of the core-shell spin
structure in LCMN particles.
