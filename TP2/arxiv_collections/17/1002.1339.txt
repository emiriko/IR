The shape of velocity and temperature profiles near the horizontal conducting
plates in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection are studied numerically and
experimentally over the Rayleigh number range $10^8\lesssim
Ra\lesssim3\times10^{11}$ and the Prandtl number range $0.7\lesssim
Pr\lesssim5.4$. The results show that both the temperature and velocity
profiles well agree with the classical Prandtl-Blasius laminar boundary-layer
profiles, if they are re-sampled in the respective dynamical reference frames
that fluctuate with the instantaneous thermal and velocity boundary-layer
thicknesses.
