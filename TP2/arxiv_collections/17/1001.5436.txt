The paper reports a technique of evaluation of Feynman diagrams in the mixed
coordinate-momentum representation. The technique is employed for a
recalculation of the two-loop self-energy correction for the ground state of
hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charge numbers Z=10-30. The numerical
accuracy is considerably improved as compared to the previous calculations. The
higher-order (in Z\alpha) remainder function is inferred from the numerical
results and extrapolated towards Z=0 and 1. The extrapolated value for hydrogen
is consistent (but still not in perfect agreement) with the analytical result
obtained within the perturbative approach.
