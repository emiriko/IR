Inspired by online ad allocation, we study online stochastic packing linear
programs from theoretical and practical standpoints. We first present a
near-optimal online algorithm for a general class of packing linear programs
which model various online resource allocation problems including online
variants of routing, ad allocations, generalized assignment, and combinatorial
auctions. As our main theoretical result, we prove that a simple primal-dual
training-based algorithm achieves a (1 - o(1))-approximation guarantee in the
random order stochastic model. This is a significant improvement over
logarithmic or constant-factor approximations for the adversarial variants of
the same problems (e.g. factor 1 - 1/e for online ad allocation, and \log m for
online routing). We then focus on the online display ad allocation problem and
study the efficiency and fairness of various training-based and online
allocation algorithms on data sets collected from real-life display ad
allocation system. Our experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of
training-based primal-dual algorithms on real data sets, and also indicate an
intrinsic trade-off between fairness and efficiency.
