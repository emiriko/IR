We calculate the electroweak corrections to the production of WWZ and ZZZ at
the linear collider in the Standard Model. These processes are important for
the extraction of the quartic couplings of the massive gauge bosons which can
be a window on the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that the
weak corrections to some kinematic distributions show new features and hence
cannot be explained by an overall scale factor.
