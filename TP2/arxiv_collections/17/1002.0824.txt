We summarize the recent results of our survey of the nearest nuclear star
clusters. The purpose of the survey is to understand nuclear star cluster
formation mechanisms and constrain the presence of black holes using adaptive
optics assisted integral field spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, and HST
imaging in 13 galaxies within 5 Mpc. We discuss the formation history of the
nuclear star cluster and possible detection of an intermediate mass BH in NGC
404, the nearest S0 galaxy.
