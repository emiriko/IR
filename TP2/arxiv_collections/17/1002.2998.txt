We have fabricated and characterized a single hole transistor in an undoped
AlGaAs-GaAs heterostructure. Our device consists of a p-type quantum dot,
populated using an electric field rather than modulation doping. Low
temperature transport measurements reveal periodic conductance oscillations due
to Coulomb blockade. We find that the low frequency charge noise is comparable
to that in modulation-doped GaAs single electron transistors (SETs), and almost
an order of magnitude better than in silicon SETs.
