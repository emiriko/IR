We characterize the jammed state structure of the random sequential
adsorption of segments of two different sizes on a line. To this end, we define
the size ratio as a dimensionless quantity measuring the length of the large
segments in terms of the smaller ones. We introduce a truncated exponential as
an {\it ansatz} for the probability distribution function of the interparticle
distance at the jammed state and use it to reckon the first four cumulants of
the probability distribution function. The sole free parameter present in the
various analytical expressions is tied to the mean interparticle distance from
Monte Carlo simulations, while the remaining three cumulants are computed
without any free parameter and compared to Monte Carlo results. We find that
the proposed {\it ansatz} provides results in good qualitative agreement with
Monte Carlo ones.
