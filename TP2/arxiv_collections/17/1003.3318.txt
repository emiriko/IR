e study the effect of a magnetic impurity with spin-half on a single
propagating electron in a one-dimensional model system via the tight-binding
approach. Due to the spin-dependent interaction, the scattering channel for the
flying qubit is split, and its transmission spectrum is obtained. It is found
that, the spin orientation of the impurity plays the role as a spin state
filter for a flying qubit.
