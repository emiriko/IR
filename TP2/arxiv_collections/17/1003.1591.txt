By means of numerical simulations we investigate the geometric properties of
loops on hypercubic lattice graphs in dimensions d=2 through 7, where edge
weights are drawn from a distribution that allows for positive and negative
weights. We are interested in the appearance of system-spanning loops of total
negative weight. The resulting negative-weight percolation (NWP) problem is
fundamentally different from conventional percolation, as we have seen in
previous studies of this model for the 2d case. Here, we characterize the
transition for hypercubic systems, where the aim of the present study is to get
a grip on the upper critical dimension d_u of the NWP problem. For the
numerical simulations we employ a mapping of the NWP model to a combinatorial
optimization problem that can be solved exactly by using sophisticated matching
algorithms. We characterize the loops via observables similar to those in
percolation theory and perform finite-size scaling analyses, e.g. 3d hypercubic
systems with side length up to L=56 sites, in order to estimate the critical
properties of the NWP phenomenon. We find our numerical results consistent with
an upper critical dimension d_u=6 for the NWP problem.
