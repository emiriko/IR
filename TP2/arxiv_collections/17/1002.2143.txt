We present the first simultaneous observations of chromospheric "anemone"
jets in solar active regions with Hinode SOT Ca II H broadband filetergram and
Ca II K spetroheliogram on the Domeless Solar Telescope (DST) at Hida
Observatory. During the coordinated observation, 9 chromospheric anemone jets
were simultaneously observed with the two instruments. These observations
revealed three important features, i.e.: (1) the jets are generated in the
lower chromosphere, (2) the length and lifetime of the jets are 0.4-5 Mm and
40-320 sec, (3) the apparent velocity of the jets with Hinode SOT are 3-24
km/s, while Ca II K3 component at the jets show blueshifts (in 5 events) in the
range of 2- 6 km/s. The chromospheric anemone jets are associated with mixed
polarity regions which are either small emerging flux regions or moving
magnetic features. It is found that the Ca II K line often show red or blue
asymmetry in K2/K1 component: the footpoint of the jets associated with
emerging flux regions often show redshift (2-16 km/s), while the one with
moving magnetic features show blueshift (around 5 km/s). Detailed analysis of
magnetic evolution of the jet foaming regions revealed that the reconnection
rate (or canceling rate) of the total magnetic flux at the footpoint of the
jets are of order of 10^{16} Mx/s, and the resulting magnetic energy release
rate (1.1-10) x 10^{24} erg/s, with the total energy release (1-13) x 10^{26}
erg for the duration of the magnetic cancellations, 130s. These are comparable
to the estimated total energy, 10^{26} erg, in a single chromospheric anemone
jet. An observation-based physical model of the jet is presented. The relation
between chromospheric anemone jets and Ellerman bombs is discussed.
