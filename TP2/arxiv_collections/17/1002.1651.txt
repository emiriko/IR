It is argued that selection criteria usually referred to as "anthropic
conditions" for the existence of intelligent (typical) observers widely adopted
in cosmology amount only to preconditions for primitive life. The existence of
life does not imply in the existence of intelligent life. On the contrary, the
transition from single-celled to complex, multi-cellular organisms is far from
trivial, requiring stringent additional conditions on planetary platforms. An
attempt is made to disentangle the necessary steps leading from a selection of
universes out of a hypothetical multiverse to the existence of life and of
complex life. It is suggested that what is currently called the "anthropic
principle" should instead be named the "prebiotic principle."
