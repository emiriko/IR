We here present a high sensitivity gravity-gradiometer based on atom
interferometry. In our apparatus, two clouds of laser-cooled rubidium atoms are
launched in fountain configuration and interrogated by a Raman interferometry
sequence to probe the gradient of gravity field. We recently implemented a
high-flux atomic source and a newly designed Raman lasers system in the
instrument set-up. We discuss the applications towards a precise determination
of the Newtonian gravitational constant G. The long-term stability of the
instrument and the signal-to-noise ratio demonstrated here open interesting
perspectives for pushing the measurement precision below the 100 ppm level.
