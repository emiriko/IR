Atmospheric turbulence is an important limit to high angular resolution in
astronomy. Interferometry resolved this issue by filtering the incoming light
with single-mode fibers. Thanks to this technique, we obtained with the IOTA
interferometer very precise measurements of the spatial frequencies of seven
evolved stars. From these measurements, we performed a blind deconvolution to
restore an image of the surface of the stars. Six of the them, Betelgeuse, Mu
Cep, R leo, Mira, Chi Cyg and CH Cyg, feature very asymmetrical brightness
distributions. On the other hand, the Arcturus data are extremely well fitted
with a simple limb-darkened photospheric disc. From the observations of $\chi$
Cyg, we show that the star is surrounded by a molecular shell undergoing a
ballistic motion. We propose to use the same technique of spatial filtering
with single-mode fibers to correct for the effect of turbulence in the pupil of
a telescope. Because the pupil is redundant, this technique does require a
remapping of the pupil. We developed a dedicated algorithm to show that it was
possible to reconstruct images at the diffraction limit of the telescope free
of any speckle noise. Our simulations show that a high dynamic range (over
10^6) could be obtained in the visible on an 8 meter telescope. A lab
experiment is under construction to validate the concept of this new
instrument.
