We report observation of magneto-electric photocurrent generated via direct
inter-band transitions in an InGaAs/InAlAs two-dimensional electron gas excited
by a linearly polarized incident light.The electric current is proportional to
the in-plane magnetic field which unbalances the velocities of the photoexcited
carriers with opposite spins and consequently generates electric current from a
spin photocurrent. The observed light polarization dependence of the electric
current is explained microscopically by taking into account of the anisotropy
of the photoexcited carrier density in wave vector space. The spin photocurrent
can be extracted from the measured current and the conversion coefficient of
spin photocurrent to electric current is estimated to be
$10^{-3}$$\sim$$10^{-2}$ per Tesla.
