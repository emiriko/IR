In several members of the ferro-pnictides, spin density wave (SDW) order
coexists with superconductivity over a range of dopings. In this letter we
study the anomalous magnetic Zeeman response of this coexistence state and show
that it can be used to confirm the extended s-wave gap structure as well as
structure of superconducting (SC) gap in coexisting phase. On increasing the
field, a strongly anisotropic reduction of SC gap is found. The anisotropy is
directly connected to the gap structure of superconducting phase. The signature
of this effect in quasiparticle interference measured by STM, as well as heat
transport in magnetic field is discussed. For the compounds with the nodal SC
gap we show that the nodes are removed upon formation of SDW. Interestingly the
size of the generated gap in the originally nodal areas is anisotropic in the
position of the nodes over the Fermi surface in direct connection with the form
of SC pairing.
