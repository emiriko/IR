From the recent work of the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity (ESTA,
Lebreton et al. 2006; Monteiro et al. 2008), whose Task 2 is devoted to compare
pulsational frequencies computed using most of the pulsational codes available
in the asteroseismic community, the dependence of the theoretical frequencies
with non-physical choices is now quite well fixed. To ensure that the accuracy
of the computed frequencies is of the same order of magnitude or better than
the observational errors, some requirements in the equilibrium models and the
numerical resolutions of the pulsational equations must be followed. In
particular, we have verified the numerical accuracy obtained with the Saclay
seismic model, which is used to study the solar g-mode region (60 to
140$\mu$Hz). We have compared the results coming from the Aarhus adiabatic
pulsation code (ADIPLS), with the frequencies computed with the Granada Code
(GraCo) taking into account several possible choices. We have concluded that
the present equilibrium models and the use of the Richardson extrapolation
ensure an accuracy of the order of $0.01 \mu Hz$ in the determination of the
frequencies, which is quite enough for our purposes.
