A system of two coupled cavities is studied in the context of bipartite,
continuous variable entanglement. One of the cavities is pumped by an external
classical source that is coupled quadratically, to the cavity field. Dynamics
of entanglement, quantified by covariance measure [Dodonov {\it et al}, Phys.
Lett A {\bf 296}, (2002) 73], in the presence of cavity-cavity coupling and
external pumping is investigated. The importance of tailoring the coupling
between the cavities is brought out by studying the effects of pump
fluctuations on the entanglement.
