We present a new efficient technique for measuring evolution of the galaxy
luminosity function. The method reconstructs the evolution over the
luminosity-redshift plane using any combination of three input dataset types:
1) number counts, 2) galaxy redshifts, 3) integrated background flux
measurements. The evolution is reconstructed in adaptively sized regions of the
plane according to the input data as determined by a Bayesian formalism. We
demonstrate the performance of the method using a range of different synthetic
input datasets. We also make predictions of the accuracy with which forthcoming
surveys conducted with SCUBA2 and the Herschel Space Satellite will be able to
measure evolution of the sub-millimetre luminosity function using the method.
