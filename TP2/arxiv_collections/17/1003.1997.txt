For a prime $p$ and an integer $a \in \Z$ we obtain nontrivial upper bounds
on the number of solutions to the congruence $x^x \equiv a \pmod p$, $1 \le x
\le p-1$. We use these estimates to estimate the number of solutions to the
congruence $x^x \equiv y^y \pmod p$, $1 \le x,y \le p-1$, which is of
cryptographic relevance.
