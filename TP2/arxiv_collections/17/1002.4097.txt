We discuss on very general grounds possible lineshapes of composite particles
with one unstable constituent. Expressions are derived in a coupled-channel
formalism for constituents interacting in an S-wave with no assumption made on
the width of one of them. We show how easy-to-use formulae, already existing in
the literature, emerge for narrow constituents and identify the parameter that
controls the regime of their applicability.
