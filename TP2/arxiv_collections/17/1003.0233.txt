We propose a kind of reverse Kochen-Specker theorem that amounts to
generating orthomodular lattices (OMLs) with exactly one state that do not
admit properties of the Hilbert space. We apply MMP algorithms to obtain
smallest OMLs with 35 atoms and 35 blocks (35-35) and all other ones up to
38-38. We find out that all but one of them admit exactly one state and
discover several other properties of theirs. Previously known such OMLs have 44
atoms and 44 blocks or more. We present some of them in our notation.
