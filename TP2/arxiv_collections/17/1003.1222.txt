Ultraviolet radiation is a double-edged sword to life. If it is too strong,
the terrestrial biological systems will be damaged. And if it is too weak, the
synthesis of many biochemical compounds can not go along. We try to obtain the
continuous ultraviolet habitable zones, and compare the ultraviolet habitable
zones with the habitable zones of host stars. Using the boundary ultraviolet
radiation of ultraviolet habitable zone, we calculate the ultraviolet habitable
zones of host stars with masses from 0.08 to 4.00 \mo. For the host stars with
effective temperatures lower than 4,600 K, the ultraviolet habitable zones are
closer than the habitable zones. For the host stars with effective temperatures
higher than 7,137 K, the ultraviolet habitable zones are farther than the
habitable zones. For hot subdwarf as a host star, the distance of the
ultraviolet habitable zone is about ten times more than that of the habitable
zone, which is not suitable for life existence.
