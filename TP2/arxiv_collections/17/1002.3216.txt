Experimental results are used to validate a 2D phenomenological model of the
near wake based on Van Der Pol wake oscillators, which is the first one which
describes the 2D motion of a cylinder in its transversal plan. In the case of a
single cylinder, experimental and numerical results are in relatively good
agreement. Those first results show that the proposed model can be used as a
simple computation tool in the prediction of 2D VIV effects.
