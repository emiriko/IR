A mechanical ventilation principle used in French residential buildings was
tested in the experimental house of the CSTB research centre. The experiments
dealt with pollutant removal efficiency of this ventilation principle, mainly
with air tightness and the influence of internal doors. Tracer gas constant
injection method was used to simulate the pollution source in the living room.
SF6 concentrations were measured in several rooms. The results showed that the
air flow routes were in agreement with the theory as long as internal doors
were closed. When doors were open, the air pattern was disturbed a lot; a great
quantity of the emitted pollutant was measured in the bedrooms. Besides, stack
effect promotes the pollutant moving towards the bedrooms under higher
indoor-outdoor air temperature differences. In addition, the results showed
that if the opening of the bedroom window increases the air change rate, it
does not guarantee a good indoor air quality.
