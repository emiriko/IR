The decays of narrow light vector mesons into pseudoscalar mesons and
dileptons are calculated to leading order in a recently proposed scheme which
treats pseudoscalar and vector mesons on equal footing. Since all required
parameters have been determined by other reactions the presented approach gains
predictive power for the considered processes. The decay of the $\omega$-meson
into pion and dimuon agrees reasonably well with the available experimental
data concerning form factor, single-differential decay width and partial decay
width. As well do the partial decay width of the $\omega$-meson into a pion and
a dielectron and of the $\phi$-meson into an $\eta$-meson and a dielectron. The
decay properties of the $\omega$-meson into $\eta$-meson and dimuon or
dielectron and of the $\phi$-meson into $\eta$-meson and dimuon are predicted.
