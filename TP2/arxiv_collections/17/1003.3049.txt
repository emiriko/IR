We present a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of
central AGN driven jets in a dynamic, cosmologically evolved galaxy cluster.
Extending previous work, we study jet powers ranging from L_jet = 10^44 erg/s
to L_jet = 10^46 erg/s and in duration from 30 Myr to 200 Myr. We find that
large-scale motions of cluster gas disrupt the AGN jets, causing energy to be
distributed throughout the centre of the cluster, rather than confined to a
narrow angle around the jet axis. Disruption of the jet also leads to the
appearance of multiple disconnected X-ray bubbles from a long-duration AGN with
a constant luminosity. This implies that observations of multiple bubbles in a
cluster are not necessarily an expression of the AGN duty cycle. We find that
the "sphere of influence" of the AGN, the radial scale within which the cluster
is strongly affected by the jet, scales as R ~ L_jet^(1/3). Increasing the
duration of AGN activity does not increase the radius affected by the AGN
significantly, but does change the magnitude of the AGN's effects. How an AGN
delivers energy to a cluster will determine where that energy is deposited: a
high luminosity is needed to heat material outside the core of the cluster,
while a low-luminosity, long-duration AGN is more efficient at heating the
inner few tens of kpc.
