High-performance graphene field-effect transistors have been fabricated on
epitaxial graphene synthesized on a two-inch SiC wafer, achieving a cutoff
frequency of 100 GHz for a gate length of 240 nm. The high-frequency
performance of these epitaxial graphene transistors not only shows the highest
speed for any graphene devices up to date, but it also exceeds that of Si
MOSFETs at the same gate length. The result confirms the high potential of
graphene for advanced electronics applications, marking an important milestone
for carbon electronics.
