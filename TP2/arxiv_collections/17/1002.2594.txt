An Artin-Schreier tower over the finite field F_p is a tower of field
extensions generated by polynomials of the form X^p - X - a. Following Cantor
and Couveignes, we give algorithms with quasi-linear time complexity for
arithmetic operations in such towers. As an application, we present an
implementation of Couveignes' algorithm for computing isogenies between
elliptic curves using the p-torsion.
