We introduce a one-dimensional version of the Kitaev model consisting of
spins on a two-legged ladder and characterized by Z_2 invariants on the
plaquettes of the ladder. We map the model to a fermionic system and identify
the topological sectors associated with different Z_2 patterns in terms of
fermion occupation numbers. Within these different sectors, we investigate the
effect of a linear quench across a quantum critical point. We study the
dominant behavior of the system by employing a Landau-Zener-type analysis of
the effective Hamiltonian in the low-energy subspace for which the effective
quenching can sometimes be non-linear. We show that the quenching leads to a
residual energy which scales as a power of the quenching rate, and that the
power depends on the topological sectors and their symmetry properties in a
non-trivial way. This behavior is consistent with the general theory of quantum
quenching, but with the correlation length exponent \nu being different in
different sectors.
