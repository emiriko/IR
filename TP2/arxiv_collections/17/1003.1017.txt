We compute the mixed phase of nuclear matter and 2SC matter for different
temperatures and proton fractions. After showing that the symmetry energy of
the 2SC phase is, to a good approximation, three times larger than the one of
the normal quark phase, we discuss and compare all the properties of the mixed
phase with a 2SC component or a normal quark matter component. In particular,
the local isospin densities of the nuclear and the quark component and the
stiffness of the mixed phase are significantly different whether the 2SC phase
or the normal quark phase are considered. If a strong diquark pairing is
adopted for the 2SC phase, there is a possibility to eventually enter in the
nuclear matter 2SC matter mixed phase in low energy heavy ions collisions
experiments. Possible observables able to discern between the formation of the
2SC phase or the normal quark phase are finally discussed.
