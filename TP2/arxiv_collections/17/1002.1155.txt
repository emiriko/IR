A simple, but fully-covariant model for describing neutral Vector Mesons, in
both light and heavy sectors, is briefly illustrated. The main ingredients of
our relativistic constituent model are i) an Ansatz for the Bethe-Salpeter
vertex for Vector Mesons, and ii) a Mandelstam-like formula for the
electromagnetic decay widths. The free parameters of our approach are fixed
through a comparison with the valence transverse-momentum distribution,
$n(k_\perp)$, obtained within phenomenological Light-Front Hamiltonian Dynamics
models reproducing the mass spectra. Preliminary results for the
transverse-momentum distributions, the parton distribution and the
electromagnetic decay constants are shown.
