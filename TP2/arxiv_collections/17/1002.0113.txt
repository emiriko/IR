The quantized flag manifold, which is a $q$-analogue of the ordinary flag
manifold, is realized as a non-commutative scheme, and we can define the
category of $D$-modules on it using the framework of non-commutative algebraic
geometry; however, when the parameter $q$ is a root of unity, Lusztig's
Frobenius morphism allows us to handle $D$-modules on the quantized flag
manifold through modules over a certain sheaf of rings on the ordinary flag
manifold. In this paper we will show that this sheaf of rings on the ordinary
flag manifold is an Azumaya algebra over its center. We also show that its
restriction to certain subsets are split Azumaya algebras. These are analogues
of some results of Bezrukavnikov-Mirkovi\'{c}-Rumynin on $D$-modules on flag
manifolds in positive characteristics.
