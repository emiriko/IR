DDR SDRAM is similar in function to the regular SDRAM but doubles the
bandwidth of the memory by transferring data on both edges of the clock cycles.
DDR SDRAM most commonly used in various embedded application like networking,
image or video processing, Laptops ete. Now a days many applications needs more
and more cheap and fast memory. Especially in the field of signal processing,
requires significant amount of memory. The most used type of dynamic memory for
that purpose is DDR SDRAM. For FPGA design the IC manufacturers are providing
commercial memory controller IP cores working only on their products. Main
disadvantage is the lack of memory access optimization for random memory access
patterns. The data path part of those controllers can be used free of charge.
This work propose an architecture of a DDR SDRAM controller, which takes
advantage of those available and well tested data paths and can be used for any
FPGA device or ASIC design.(5). In most of the SOC design, DDR SDRAM is
commonly used. ARM processor is widely used in SOCs; so that we focused to
implement AHB compatible DDR SDRAM controller suitable for ARM based SOC
design.
