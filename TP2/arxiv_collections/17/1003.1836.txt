We present a scheme to accurately calculate the persistence probabilities on
sequences of $n$ heights above a level $h$ from the measured $n+2$ points of
the height-height correlation function of a fluctuating interface. The
calculated persistence probabilities compare very well with the measured
persistence probabilities of a fluctuating phase-separated colloidal interface
for the whole experimental range.
