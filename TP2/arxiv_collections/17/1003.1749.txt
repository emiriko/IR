We provide an in-depth and thorough treatment of the validity of the
rotating-wave approximation (RWA) in an open quantum system. We find that when
it is introduced after tracing out the environment, all timescales of the open
system are correctly reproduced, but the details of the quantum state may not
be. The RWA made before the trace is more problematic: it results in incorrect
values for environmentally-induced shifts to system frequencies, and the
resulting theory has no Markovian limit. We point out that great care must be
taken when coupling two open systems together under the RWA. Though the RWA can
yield a master equation of Lindblad form similar to what one might get in the
Markovian limit with white noise, the master equation for the two coupled
systems is not a simple combination of the master equation for each system, as
is possible in the Markovian limit. Such a naive combination yields inaccurate
dynamics. To obtain the correct master equation for the composite system a
proper consideration of the non-Markovian dynamics is required.
