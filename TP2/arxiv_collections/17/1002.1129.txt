In this talk, we focus on the corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by
associating it with the entanglement between degrees of freedom inside and
outside the horizon. Using numerical techniques, we show that the corrections
proportional to fractional power of area result when the field is in a
superposition of ground and excited states. We explain this result by
identifying that the degrees of freedom contributing to such corrections are
different from those contributing to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
