Data Mining deals extracting hidden knowledge, unexpected pattern and new
rules from large database. Various customized data mining tools have been
developed for domain specific applications such as Biomedicine, DNA analysis
and telecommunication. Trends in data mining include further efforts towards
the exploration of new application areas and methods for handling complex data
types, algorithm scalability, constraint based data mining and visualization
methods. In this paper we will present domain specific Secure Multiparty
computation technique and applications. Data mining has matured as a field of
basic and applied research in computer science in general. In this paper, we
survey some of the recent approaches and architectures where data mining has
been applied in the fields of e-payment systems. In this paper we limit our
discussion to data mining in the context of e-payment systems. We also mention
a few directions for further work in this domain, based on the survey.
