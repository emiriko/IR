We investigate the structure and magnetic properties of thin films of the
LaCoO$_{3}$ compound. Thin films are deposited by pulsed laser deposition on
various substrates in order to tune the strain from compressive to tensile.
Single-phase (001) oriented LaCoO$_{3}$ layers were grown on all substrates
despite large misfits. The tetragonal distortion of the films covers a wide
range from -2% to 2.8%. Our LaCoO$_{3}$ films are ferromagnetic with Curie
temperature around 85 K, contrary to the bulk. The total magnetic moment is
below $1\mu_{B}$/Co$^{3+}$, a value relatively small for an exited spin-state
of the Co$^{3+}$ ions, but comparable to values reported in literature. A
correlation of strain states and magnetic moment of Co$^{3+}$ ions in
LaCoO$_{3}$ thin films is observed.
