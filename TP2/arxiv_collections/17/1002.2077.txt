EAGLE is the multi-object, spatially-resolved, near-IR spectrograph
instrument concept for the E-ELT, relying on a distributed Adaptive Optics,
so-called Multi Object Adaptive Optics. This paper presents the results of a
phase A study. Using 84x84 actuator deformable mirrors, the performed analysis
demonstrates that 6 laser guide stars and up to 5 natural guide stars of
magnitude R<17, picked-up in a 7.3' diameter patrol field of view, allow us to
obtain an overall performance in terms of Ensquared Energy of 35% in a 75x75
mas^2 spaxel at H band, whatever the target direction in the centred 5' science
field for median seeing conditions. The computed sky coverage at galactic
latitudes |b|~60 is close to 90%.
