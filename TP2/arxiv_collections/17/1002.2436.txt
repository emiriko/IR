The Leftover Hash Lemma states that the output of a two-universal hash
function applied to an input with sufficiently high entropy is almost uniformly
random. In its standard formulation, the lemma refers to a notion of randomness
that is (usually implicitly) defined with respect to classical side
information. Here, we prove a (strictly) more general version of the Leftover
Hash Lemma that is valid even if side information is represented by the state
of a quantum system. Furthermore, our result applies to arbitrary delta-almost
two-universal families of hash functions. The generalized Leftover Hash Lemma
has applications in cryptography, e.g., for key agreement in the presence of an
adversary who is not restricted to classical information processing.
