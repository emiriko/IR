Magnetic impurities in neutral graphene provide a realization of the
pseudogap Kondo model, which displays a quantum phase transition between phases
with screened and unscreened impurity moment. Here, we present a detailed study
of the pseudogap Kondo model with finite chemical potential mu. While carrier
doping restores conventional Kondo screening at lowest energies, properties of
the quantum critical fixed point turn out to influence the behavior over a
large parameter range. Most importantly, the Kondo temperature T_K shows an
extreme asymmetry between electron and hole doping. At criticality, depending
on the sign of mu, T_K follows either the scaling prediction T_K ~ |mu| with a
universal prefactor, or T_K ~ |mu|^x with x = 2.6. This asymmetry between
electron and hole doping extends well outside the quantum critical regime and
also implies a qualitative difference in the shape of the tunneling spectra for
both signs of mu.
