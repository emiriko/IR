The study of low-degree high-frequency waves in the Sun can provide new
insight into the dynamics of the deeper layers of the Sun. Here, we present the
analysis of the velocity observations of the Sun obtained from the Michelson
and Doppler Imager (MDI) and Global Oscillations at Low Frequency (GOLF)
instruments on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft for
the major flare event of 2003 October 28 during the solar cycle 23. We have
applied wavelet transform to the time series of disk-integrated velocity
signals from the solar surface using the full-disk Dopplergrams obtained from
MDI. The wavelet power spectrum computed from MDI velocity series clearly shows
that there is enhancement of high-frequency global waves in the Sun during the
flare. We do observe this signature of flare in the Fourier Power Spectrum of
these velocity oscillations. However, the analysis of disk-integrated velocity
observations obtained from GOLF shows only feeble effect of flare on
high-frequency oscillations.
