We report on the results of a numerical simulation concerning the low-lying
spectrum of four-dimensional N=1 SU(2) Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory
on the lattice with light dynamical gluinos. In the gauge sector the tree-level
Symanzik improved gauge action is used, while we use the Wilson formulation in
the fermion sector with stout smearing of the gauge links in the Wilson-Dirac
operator. The ensembles of gauge configurations were produced with the Two-Step
Polynomial Hybrid Monte Carlo (TS-PHMC) updating algorithm. We performed
simulations on large lattices up to a size of 24^3 x 48 at $\beta=1.6$. Using
QCD units with the Sommer scale being set to r_0 = 0.5 fm, the lattice spacing
is about a ~ 0.09 fm, and the spatial extent of the lattice corresponds to 2.1
fm. At the lightest simulated gluino mass the spin-1/2 gluino-glue bound state
appeared to be considerably heavier than its expected super-partner, the
pseudoscalar bound state. Whether supermultiplets are formed remains to be
studied in upcoming simulations.
