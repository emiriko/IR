We consider the problem of temperature chaos in mean-field spin-glass models
defined on random lattices with finite connectivity. By means of an expansion
in the order parameter we show that these models display a much stronger chaos
effect than the fully connected Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with the
exception of the Bethe lattice with bimodal distribution of the couplings.
