The application of graphene in electronic devices requires large scale
epitaxial growth. The presence of the substrate, however, usually reduces the
charge carrier mobility considerably. We show that it is possible to decouple
the partially sp3-hybridized first graphitic layer formed on the Si-terminated
face of silicon carbide from the substrate by gold intercalation, leading to a
completely sp2-hybridized graphene layer with improved electronic properties.
