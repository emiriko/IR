Halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were found to be significantly faster than
normal CMEs, which was a long-standing puzzle. In order to solve the puzzle, we
first investigate the observed properties of 31 limb CMEs that display clearly
loop-shaped frontal loops. The observational results show a strong tendency
that slower CMEs are weaker in the white-light intensity. Then, we perform a
Monte Carlo simulation of 20 000 artificial limb CMEs that have average
velocity of $\sim$523 km s$^{-1}$. The Thomson scattering of these events is
calculated when they are assumed to be observed as limb and halo events,
respectively. It is found that the white-light intensity of many slow CMEs
becomes remarkably reduced as they turn from being viewed as a limb event to as
a halo event. When the intensity is below the background solar wind
fluctuation, it is assumed that they would be missed by coronagraphs. The
average velocity of "detectable" halo CMEs is $\sim$922 km s$^{-1}$, very close
to the observed value. It also indicates that wider events are more likely to
be recorded. The results soundly suggest that the higher average velocity of
halo CMEs is due to that a majority of slow events and a part of narrow fast
events carrying less material are so faint that they are blended with the solar
wind fluctuations, and therefore are not observed.
