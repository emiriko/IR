Characteristic dimensions of carbon nanoscrolls - "buckyrolls" - are
calculated by analyzing the competition between elastic, van der Waals, and
electrostatic energies for representative models of suspended and
substrate-deposited graphene samples. The results are consistent with both
atomistic simulations and experimental observations of scrolled graphene edges.
Electrostatic control of the wrapping is shown to be practically feasible and
its possible device applications are indicated.
