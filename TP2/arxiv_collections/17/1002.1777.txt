E7 part: In this paper, we study McKay's E7 observation on the Baby Monster.
By investigating so called derived c=7/10 Virasoro vectors, we show that there
is a natural correspondence between dihedral subgroups of the Baby Monster and
certain subalgebras of the Baby Monster vertex operator algebra which are
constructed by the nodes of the affine E7 diagram. This allows us to
reinterpret McKay's E7 observation via the theory of vertex operator algebras.
For a class of vertex operator algebras including the Moonshine module, we will
show that the product of two Miyamoto involutions associated to derived c=7/10
Virasoro vectors in certain commutant vertex operator algebras is an element of
order at most 4. For the case of the Moonshine module, we obtain the Baby
monster vertex operator algebra as the commutant and we can identify the group
generated by these Miyamoto involutions with the Baby Monster and recover the
{3,4}-transposition property of the Baby Monster in terms of vertex operator
algebras.
  E6 part: In this paper, we study McKay's E6-observation on the largest
Fischer 3-transposition group Fi24. We investigate a vertex operator algebra VF
of central charge 23+1/5 on which the Fischer group Fi24 naturally acts. We
show that there is a natural correspondence between dihedral subgroups of Fi24
and certain vertex operator subalgebras constructed by the nodes of the affine
E6 diagram by investigating so called derived Virasoro vectors of central
charge 6/7. This allows us to reinterpret McKay's E6-observation via the theory
of vertex operator algebras. It is also shown that the product of two
non-commuting Miyamoto involutions of sigma-type associated to derived c=6/7
Virasoro vectors is an element of order 3, under certain general hypotheses on
the vertex operator algebra. For the case of VF, we identify these involutions
with the 3-transpositions of the Fischer group Fi24.
