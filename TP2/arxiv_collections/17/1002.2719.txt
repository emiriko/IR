Two of the most striking and yet unresolved manifestations of the hidden
order (HO) in URu2Si2, are associated on one hand with the double-step
metamagnetic transitions and on the other with the giant anomalous Nernst
signal. Both are observed when a magnetic field is applied along the c-axis.
Here we provide for the first time a unified understanding of these puzzling
phenomena and the related field-temperature (B-T) phase diagram. We demonstrate
that the HO phase at finite fields can be explained with a chiral dxy+idx2-y2
spin density wave, assuming that the zero field HO contains only the
time-reversal symmetry preserving idx2-y2 component. We argue that the presence
of the field-induced chiral HO can be reflected in a distinctive non-linear
B-dependence of the Kerr angle, when a Kerr experiment is conducted for finite
fields. This fingerprint can be conclusive for the possible emergence of
chirality in the HO.
