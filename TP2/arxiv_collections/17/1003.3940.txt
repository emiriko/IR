We show by unbiased numerical calculations that the ferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction stabilizes a vector spin chiral order
against the quantum fluctuation in a frustrated spin-1/2 chain relevant to
multiferroic cuprates, LiCu2O2 and LiCuVO4. Our realistic semi-classical
analyses for LiCu2O2 resolve controversies on the helical magnetic structure
and unveil the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone modes as the origin of experimentally
observed electromagnons.
