The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental quantity important for studying
the structure of systems as diverse as the atomic nucleus and the neutron star.
Considerable efforts are being made to experimentally extract the symmetry
energy and its dependence on nuclear density and temperature. In this article,
we review experimental studies carried out up-to-date and their current status.
