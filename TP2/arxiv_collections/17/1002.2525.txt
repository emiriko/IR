We propose a scenario of the right-handed neutrino dark matter in the context
of the minimal gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ model by introducing an additional parity
which ensures the stability of dark matter particle. The annihilation of this
right-handed neutrino takes place dominantly through the s-channel Higgs boson
exchange, so that this model can be called Higgs portal dark matter model. We
show that the thermal relic abundance of the right-handed neutrino dark matter
with help of Higgs resonance can match the observed dark matter abundance. In
addition we estimate the cross section with nucleon and show that the next
generation direct dark matter search experiments can explore this model.
