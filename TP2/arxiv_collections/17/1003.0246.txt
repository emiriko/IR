A density-matrix formalism which includes the effects of three-body ground-
state correlations is applied to the standard Lipkin model. The reason to
consider the complicated three-body correlations is that the truncation scheme
of reduced density matrices up to the two-body level does not give satisfactory
results to the standard Lipkin model. It is shown that inclusion of the
three-body correlations drastically improves the properties of the ground
states and excited states. It is pointed out that lack of mean-field effects in
the standard Lipkin model enhances the relative importance of the three-body
ground-state correlations. Formal aspects of the density-matrix formalism such
as a relation to the variational principle and the stability condition of the
ground state are also discussed. It is pointed out that the three-body
ground-state correlations are necessary to satisfy the stability condition.
