We present a new type of brane inflation motivated by multi-kink solitonic
solutions of a scalar field in five dimensions. In the thin brane limit, we
analyze a non-static configuration in which the distance between two parallel
domain walls decreases. We show that the ensuing spacetime is inflationary,
both on the branes, and, for certain potentials, in the bulk. We argue that
this inflationary regime is transitory and can end via a brane merger into a
single kink solution - a flat, thick brane RS2 universe. This scenario is quite
general; we show that any potential which supports a single flat kink solution
is also likely to support an inflationary multi-kink configuration.
