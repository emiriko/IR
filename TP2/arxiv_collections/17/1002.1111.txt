Bayesian inferences in high energy physics often use uniform prior
distributions for parameters about which little or no information is available
before data are collected. The resulting posterior distributions are therefore
sensitive to the choice of parametrization for the problem and may even be
improper if this choice is not carefully considered. Here we describe an
extensively tested methodology, known as reference analysis, which allows one
to construct parametrization-invariant priors that embody the notion of minimal
informativeness in a mathematically well-defined sense. We apply this
methodology to general cross section measurements and show that it yields
sensible results. A recent measurement of the single top quark cross section
illustrates the relevant techniques in a realistic situation.
