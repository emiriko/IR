We find the light-cone wavefunction representations of the Sivers and
Boer-Mulders distribution functions. A necessary condition for the existence of
these representations is that the light-cone wavefunctions have complex phases.
We induce the complex phases by incorporating the final-state interactions into
the light-cone wavefunctions. For the scalar and axial-vector diquark models
for nucleon, we calculate explicitly the Sivers and Boer-Mulders distribution
functions from the light-cone wavefunction representations. We obtain the
results that the Sivers distribution function has the opposite signs with the
factor 3 difference in magnitude for the two models, whereas the Boer-Mulders
distribution function has the same sign and magnitude. We can understand these
results from the properties of the light-cone wavefunction representations of
the Sivers and Boer-Mulders distribution functions.
