The concept of absence of opportunities for free lunches is one of the
pillars in the economic theory of financial markets. This natural assumption
has proved very fruitful and has lead to great mathematical, as well as
economical, insights in Quantitative Finance. Formulating rigorously the exact
definition of absence of opportunities for riskless profit turned out to be a
highly non-trivial fact that troubled mathematicians and economists for at
least two decades. The purpose of this note is to give a quick (and,
necessarily, incomplete) account of the recent work aimed at providing a simple
and intuitive no-free-lunch assumption that would suffice in formulating a
version of the celebrated Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing.
