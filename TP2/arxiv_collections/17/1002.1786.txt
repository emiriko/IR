An age-structured predator-prey system with diffusion and Holling-Tanner-type
nonlinearities is considered. Regarding the intensity of the fertility of the
predator as bifurcation parameter, we prove that a branch of positive
coexistence steady states bifurcates from the marginal steady state with no
prey. A similar result is obtained when the fertility of the prey varies.
