We have investigated the temperature dependence of the resistive upper
critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(T)$) for an
Fe$_{1.05}$Te$_{0.85}$Se$_{0.15}$ single crystal, which exhibit
superconductivity at $T_{\rm c} \sim 14 K, in magnetic fields of up to 55 T.
Two-dimensional feature and superconducting fluctuations of the samples are
found to be weak, because the resistive broadening effect on applied magnetic
fields of up to 14 T is small. The Pauli paramagnetic effect is obviously
evidenced by the strong suppression of the $\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(T)$ ($H
\parallel ab$) curve and nearly isotropic $\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) \approx 47 T is
seen for both $H \parallel ab$ and $H \parallel c$. This fact is almost
identical to the results of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ single crystals
reported previously. We have discussed that the small anisotropy of the upper
critical field at low temperatures in Fe$_{1+y}$(Te,Se) systems against the
variation of the Te/Se ratio.
