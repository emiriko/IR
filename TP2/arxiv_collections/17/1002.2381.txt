We report charge sensing measurements on a silicon quantum dot (QD) with a
nearby silicon single electron transistor (SET) acting as an electrometer. The
devices are electrostatically formed in bulk silicon using surface gates. We
show that as an additional electron is added onto the quantum dot, a charge is
induced on the SET of approximately 0.2e. These measurements are performed in
the many electron regime, where we can count in excess of 20 charge additions
onto the quantum dot.
