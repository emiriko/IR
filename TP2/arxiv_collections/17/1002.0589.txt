It is shown that a Hilbert space can be constructed for a quantum system
starting from a framework in which histories are fundamental. The Decoherence
Functional provides the inner product on this "History Hilbert space". It is
also shown that the History Hilbert space is the standard Hilbert space in the
case of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
