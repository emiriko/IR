The variance in the winding number of various random fractal curves,
including the self-avoiding walk, the loop-erased random walk, contours of FK
clusters, and stochastic Loewner evolution, have been studied by numerous
researchers. Usually the focus has been on the winding at the endpoints. We
measure the variance in winding number at typical points along the curve. More
generally, we study the winding at points where k strands come together, and
some adjacent strands may be conditioned not to hit each other. The measured
values are consistent with an interesting conjecture.
