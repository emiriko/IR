The stability of two quantum counter-streaming electron beams is investigated
within the quantum plasma fluid equations for arbitrarily oriented wave
vectors. The analysis reveals that the two quantum two-stream unstable branches
are indeed connected by a continuum of unstable modes with oblique wave
vectors. Using the longitudinal approximation, the stability domain for any k
is analytically explained, together with the growth rate.
