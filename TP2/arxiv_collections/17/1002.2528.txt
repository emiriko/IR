We describe the observation of the circular and linear photogalvanic effects
in HgTe/CdHgTe quantum wells. The interband absorption of mid-infrared
radiation as well as the intrasubband absorption of terahertz (THz) radiation
in the QWs structures is shown to cause a dc electric current due to these
effects. The photocurrent magnitude and direction varies with the radiation
polarization state and crystallographic orientation of the substrate in a
simple way that can be understood from a phenomenological theory. The observed
dependences of the photocurrent on the radiation wavelength and temperature are
discussed.
