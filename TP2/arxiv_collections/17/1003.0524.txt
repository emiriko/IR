We present an efficient implementation of the PBE0 hybrid functional within
the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The
Hartree-Fock exchange term, which is a central ingredient of hybrid
functionals, gives rise to a computationally expensive nonlocal potential in
the one-particle Schroedinger equation. The matrix elements of this exchange
potential are calculated with the help of an auxiliary basis that is
constructed from products of FLAPW basis functions. By representing the Coulomb
interaction in this basis the nonlocal exchange term becomes a Brillouin-zone
(BZ) sum over vector-matrix-vector products. We show that the Coulomb matrix
can be made sparse by a suitable unitary transformation of the auxiliary basis,
which accelerates the computation of the vector-matrix-vector products
considerably. Additionally, we exploit spatial and time-reversal symmetry to
identify the nonvanishing exchange matrix elements in advance and to restrict
the k summations for the nonlocal potential to an irreducible set of k points.
Favorable convergence of the self-consistent-field cycle is achieved by a
nested density-only and density-matrix iteration scheme. We discuss the
convergence with respect to the parameters of our numerical scheme and show
results for a variety of semiconductors and insulators, including oxide
materials, where the PBE0 hybrid functional improves the band gaps and the
description of localized states in comparison with the PBE functional.
Furthermore, we find that in contrast to conventional local
exchange-correlation functionals ferromagnetic EuO is correctly predicted to be
a semiconductor.
