We analyse a multilayer leaky cladding (MLC) fibre using the finite element
method and study the effect of the MLC on the bending loss and birefringence of
two types of structures: (i) a circular core large-mode-area structure and (ii)
an elliptical-small-core structure. In a large-mode-area structure, we verify
that the multilayer leaky cladding strongly discriminates against higher order
modes to achieve single-mode operation, the fibre shows negligible
birefringence, and the bending loss of the fibre is low for bending radii
larger than 10 cm. In the elliptical-small-core structure we show that the MLC
reduces the birefringence of the fibre. This prevents the structure from
becoming birefringent in case of any departures from circular geometry. The
study should be useful in the designs of MLC fibres for various applications
including high power amplifiers, gain flattening of fibre amplifiers and
dispersion compensation.
