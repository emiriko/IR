The evolution of the nuclear shapes along the triaxial landscape is studied
in the Pt isotopic chain using the selfconsistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
approximation based on the Gogny interaction. In addition to the
parametrization D1S, the new incarnations D1N and D1M of this force are also
included in our analysis to asses to which extent the predictions are
independent of details of the effective interaction. The considered range of
neutron numbers 88<N<26 includes prolate, triaxial, oblate and spherical ground
state shapes and serves for a detailed comparison of the predictions obtained
with the new sets D1N and D1M against the ones provided by the standard
parametrization Gogny-D1S in a region of the nuclear landscape for which
experimental and theoretical fingerprints of shape transitions have been found.
Structural evolution along the Pt chain is discussed in terms of the
deformation dependence of single particle energies.
