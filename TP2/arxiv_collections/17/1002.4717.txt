Epitaxial graphene, grown on SiC(0001) surface, has been widely studied both
experimentally and theoretically. It was found that first epitaxial graphene
layer in such structures is a buffer layer i.e. there are no characteristic
Dirac cones in the band structure associated with it. However, C. Riedl et al.
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 246804 (2009)) in their experimental work observed
recently that hydrogen intercalation of SiC-graphene samples can recover
electronic properties typical to selfstanding graphene. The possible scenarios
of hydrogen intercalation inducing graphene layer decoupling, including both
the hydrogen penetration paths and energetically stable positions of hydrogen
atoms, were modeled in ab initio DFT calculations. From the obtained results it
follows that, due to intercalation, the graphene layer moves away to achieve
about 3.9 A distance from the SiC surface. Electronic band structure,
calculated for such quasi free standing graphene, exhibits Dirac-cone behavior
which is in agreement with ARPES measurements.
