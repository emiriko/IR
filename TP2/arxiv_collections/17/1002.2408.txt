Teleophthalmology holds a great potential to improve the quality, access, and
affordability in health care. For patients, it can reduce the need for travel
and provide the access to a superspecialist. Ophthalmology lends itself easily
to telemedicine as it is a largely image based diagnosis. The main goal of the
proposed system is to diagnose the type of disease in the retina and to
automatically detect and segment retinal diseases without human supervision or
interaction. The proposed system will diagnose the disease present in the
retina using a neural network based classifier.The extent of the disease spread
in the retina can be identified by extracting the textural features of the
retina. This system will diagnose the following type of diseases: Diabetic
Retinopathy and Drusen.
