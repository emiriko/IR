We describe a general scheme of derivation of the Vlasov-type equations for
Markov evolutions of particle systems in continuum. This scheme is based on a
proper scaling of corresponding Markov generators and has an algorithmic
realization in terms of related hierarchical chains of correlation functions
equations. Several examples of the realization of the proposed approach in
particular models are presented.
