With the development of modern technologies such as IFUs, it is possible to
obtain data cubes in which one produces images with spectral resolution. To
extract information from them can be quite complex, and hence the development
of new methods of data analysis is desirable. We briefly describe a method of
analysis of data cubes (data from single field observations, containing two
spatial and one spectral dimension) that uses Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to express the data in the form of reduced dimensionality, facilitating
efficient information extraction from very large data sets. We applied the
method, for illustration purpose, to the central region of the low ionization
nuclear emission region (LINER) galaxy NGC 4736, and demonstrate that it has a
type 1 active nucleus, not known before. Furthermore, we show that it is
displaced from the centre of its stellar bulge.
