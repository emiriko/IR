We present a massive equilibrium simulation of the three-dimensional Ising
spin glass at low temperatures. The Janus special-purpose computer has allowed
us to equilibrate, using parallel tempering, L=32 lattices down to T=0.64 Tc.
We demonstrate the relevance of equilibrium finite-size simulations to
understand experimental non-equilibrium spin glasses in the thermodynamical
limit by establishing a time-length dictionary. We conclude that
non-equilibrium experiments performed on a time scale of one hour can be
matched with equilibrium results on L=110 lattices. A detailed investigation of
the probability distribution functions of the spin and link overlap, as well as
of their correlation functions, shows that Replica Symmetry Breaking is the
appropriate theoretical framework for the physically relevant length scales.
Besides, we improve over existing methodologies to ensure equilibration in
parallel tempering simulations.
