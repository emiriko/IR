Digital Watermarking is used for copyright protection and authentication. In
the proposed system, a Dual Watermarking Scheme based on DWT SVD with chaos
encryption algorithm, will be developed to improve the robustness and
protection along with security. DWT and SVD have been used as a mathematical
tool to embed watermark in the image. Two watermarks are embedded in the host
image. The secondary is embedded into primary watermark and the resultant
watermarked image is encrypted using chaos based logistic map. This provides an
efficient and secure way for image encryption and transmission. The watermarked
image is decrypted and a reliable watermark extraction scheme is developed for
the extraction of the primary as well as secondary watermark from the distorted
image.
