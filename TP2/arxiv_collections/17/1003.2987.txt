We report results of a 14.1 kgd measurement with 15 superheated droplet
detectors of total active mass 0.208 kg, comprising the first stage of a 30 kgd
Phase II experiment. In combination with the results of the neutron-spin
sensitive XENON10 experiment, these results yield a limit of |a_p| < 0.32 for
M_W = 50 GeV/c2 on the spin-dependent sector of weakly interacting massive
particle-nucleus interactions with a 50% reduction in the previously allowed
region of the phase space formerly defined by XENON, KIMS and PICASSO. In the
spin-independent sector, a limit of 2.3x10-5 pb at M_W = 45 GeV/c2 is obtained.
