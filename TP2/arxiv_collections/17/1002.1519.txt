A pair $(G,K)$ of a group and its subgroup is called a Gelfand pair if the
induced trivial representation of $K$ on $G$ is multiplicity free. Let $(a_j)$
be a sequence of positive integers of length $n$, and let $(b_i)$ be its
non-decreasing rearrangement. The sequence $(a_i)$ is called a parking function
of length $n$ if $b_i \leq i$ for all $i=1,\...,n$.
  In this paper we study certain Gelfand pairs in relation with parking
functions. In particular, we find explicit descriptions of the decomposition of
the associated induced trivial representations into irreducibles. We obtain and
study a new $q$ analogue of the Catalan numbers $\frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}$,
$n\geq 1$.
