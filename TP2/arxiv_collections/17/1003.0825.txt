The particle distribution function that describes two interpenetrating plasma
streams is re-investigated. It is shown how, based on the
Maxwell-Boltzmann-J\"uttner distribution function that has been derived almost
a century ago, a counterstreaming distribution function can be derived that
uses velocity space. Such is necessary for various analytical calculations and
numerical simulations that are reliant on velocity coordinates rather than
momentum space. The application to the electrostatic two-stream instability
illustrates the differences caused by the use of the relativistic distribution
function.
