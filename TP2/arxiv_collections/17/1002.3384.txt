We present theoretical calculations for polarization and ellipticity of
high-order harmonics from aligned N$_2$, CO$_2$, and O$_2$ molecules generated
by linearly polarized lasers. Within the rescattering model, the two
polarization amplitudes of the harmonics are determined by the
photo-recombination amplitudes for photons emitted parallel and perpendicular
to the direction of the {\em same} returning electron wave packet. Our results
show clear species-dependent polarization states, in excellent agreement with
experiments. We further note that the measured polarization ellipse of the
harmonic furnishes the needed parameters for a "complete" experiment in
molecules.
