This work reports an ESR study of low energy, low fluence phosphorus ion
implantation into silicon in order to observe the activation of phosphorus
donors placed in close proximity to the Si-SiO2 interface. Electrical
measurements, which were used to estimate donor activation levels, reported
high implant recoveries when using 14 keV phosphorus ions however, it was not
possible to correlate the intensity of the hyperfine resonance signal with the
electrical measurements in the presence of an SiO2 interface due to donor state
ionisation (i.e. compensation effects). Comparative measurements made on
silicon with an H-passivated surface reported higher donor hyperfine signal
levels consistent with lower surface defect densities at the interface.
