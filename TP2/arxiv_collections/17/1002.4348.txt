We exhibit some explicit co-adapted couplings for n-dimensional Brownian
motion and all its Levy stochastic areas. In the two-dimensional case we show
how to derive exact asymptotics for the coupling time under various mixed
coupling strategies, using Dufresne's formula for the distribution of
exponential functionals of Brownian motion. This yields quantitative
asymptotics for the distributions of random times required for certain
simultaneous couplings of stochastic area and Brownian motion. The approach
also applies to higher dimensions, but will then lead to upper and lower bounds
rather than exact asymptotics.
