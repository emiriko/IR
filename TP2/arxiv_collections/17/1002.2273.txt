We construct confluent KZ equations with Poincare rank 2 at infinity for the
case of sl_N and the integral representation for the solutions. Hamiltonians of
these confluent KZ equations are derived from suitable quantization of dlog tau
constructed in the theory of monodromy preserving deformation by Jimbo, Miwa
and Ueno. Our confluent KZ equations may be viewed as a quantization of
monodromy preserving deformation with Poincare rank 2 at infinity.
