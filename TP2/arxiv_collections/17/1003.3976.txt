We investigate current-driven domain wall (DW) propagation in magnetic
nanowires in the framework of the modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
with both adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin torque (NAST) terms. Contrary to the
common opinion that NAST is indispensable for DW motion[1,2], we point out that
adiabatic spin torque (AST) only is enough for current-driven DW motion in a
cylindrical (uniaxial) nanowire. Apart from a discussion of the rigid DW motion
from the energy and angular momentum viewpoint, we also propose an experimental
scheme to measure the spin current polarization by combining both field and
current driven DW motion in a flat (biaxial) wire.
