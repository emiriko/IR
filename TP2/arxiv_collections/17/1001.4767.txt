The magneto-conductance of an open carbon nanotube (CNT)-quantum wire was
measured in pulsed magnetic fields. At low temperatures we find a peculiar
split magneto-conductance peak close to the charge neutrality point. Our
analysis of the data reveals that this splitting is intimately connected to the
spin-orbit interaction and the tube chirality. Band structure calculations
suggest that the current in the peak regions is highly spin-polarized, which
calls for application in future CNT-based spintronic devices.
