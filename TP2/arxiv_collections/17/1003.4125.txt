Within the distance of 1 pc from the Galactic center (GC), more than 100
young massive stars have been found. The massive stars at 0.1-1 pc from the GC
are located in one or two disks, while those within 0.1 pc from the GC,
S-stars, have an isotropic distribution. How these stars are formed is not well
understood, especially for S-stars. Here we propose that a young star cluster
with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) can form both the disks and
S-stars. We performed a fully self-consistent $N$-body simulation of a star
cluster near the GC. Stars escaped from the tidally disrupted star cluster were
carried to the GC due to an 1:1 mean motion resonance with the IMBH formed in
the cluster. In the final phase of the evolution, the eccentricity of the IMBH
becomes very high. In this phase, stars carried by the 1:1 resonance with the
IMBH were dropped from the resonance and their orbits are randomized by a
chaotic Kozai mechanism. The mass function of these carried stars is extremely
top-heavy within 10". The surface density distributions of young massive stars
has a slope of -1.5 within 10" from the GC. The distribution of stars in the
most central region is isotropic. These characteristics agree well with those
of stars observed within 10" from the GC.
