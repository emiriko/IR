We combine data from the MGC, SDSS and UKIDSS LAS surveys to produce
ugrizYJHK luminosity functions and densities from within a common, low redshift
volume (z<0.1, ~71,000 h_1^-3 Mpc^3 for L* systems) with 100 per cent
spectroscopic completeness. In the optical the fitted Schechter functions are
comparable in shape to those previously reported values but with higher
normalisations (typically 0, 30, 20, 15, 5 per cent higher phi*-values in u, g,
r, i, z respectively over those reported by the SDSS team). We attribute these
to differences in the redshift ranges probed, incompleteness, and adopted
normalisation methods. In the NIR we find significantly different Schechter
function parameters (mainly in the M* values) to those previously reported and
attribute this to the improvement in the quality of the imaging data over
previous studies. This is the first homogeneous measurement of the
extragalactic luminosity density which fully samples both the optical and
near-IR regimes. Unlike previous compilations that have noted a discontinuity
between the optical and near-IR regimes our homogeneous dataset shows a smooth
cosmic spectral energy distribution (CSED). After correcting for dust
attenuation we compare our CSED to the expected values based on recent
constraints on the cosmic star-formation history and the initial mass function.
