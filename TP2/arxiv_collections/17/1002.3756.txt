Two integral relations derived from the Kohn Variational Principle (KVP) are
used for describing scattering states. In usual applications the KVP requires
the explicit form of the asymptotic behavior of the scattering wave function.
This is not the case when the integral relations are applied since, due to
their short range nature, the only condition for the scattering wave function
$\Psi$ is that it be the solution of $(H-E)\Psi=0$ in the internal region.
Several examples are analyzed for the computation of phase-shifts from bound
state type wave functions or, in the case of the scattering of charged
particles, it is possible to obtain phase-shifts using free asymptotic
conditions. As a final example we discuss the use of the integral relations in
the case of the Hyperspherical Adiabatic method.
