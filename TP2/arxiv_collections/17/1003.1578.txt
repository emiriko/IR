We propose a new process of mu(-) e(-) -> e(-) e(-) in a muonic atom for a
quest of charged lepton flavor violation. The Coulomb attraction from the
nucleus in a heavy muonic atom leads to significant enhancement in its rate,
compared to mu(+) e(-) -> e(+) e(-). The upper limit of the branching ratio is
estimated to be of the orders of O[10^(-17)-10^(-18)] for the photonic and the
four Fermi interactions from the present experimental constraints. The search
for this process could serve complementarily with the other relevant processes
to shed lights upon the nature of charged lepton flavor violation.
