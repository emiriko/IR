It is shown that in non-linear electrodynamics (in particular, Born-Infeld
one) in the framework of general relativity there exist "weakly singular"
configurations such that (i) the proper mass M is finite in spite of
divergences of the energy density, (ii) the electric charge q and Schwarzschild
mass m ~ q can be made as small as one likes, (iv) all field and energy
distributions are concentrated in the core region. This region has an almost
zero surface area but a finite longitudinal size L=2M. Such configurations can
be viewed as a new version of a classical analogue of an elementary particle.
