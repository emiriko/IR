We present a new way to tune the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in graphene
by changing the deformation potential with electron/hole doping. We show the
EPC for highest optical branch at the high symmetry point K, acquires a strong
dependency on the doping level due to electron-electron correlation not
accounted in mean-field approaches. Such a dependency influences the dispersion
(with respect to the laser energy) of the Raman D and 2D lines and the
splitting of the 2D peak in multi-layer graphene. Finally this doping
dependence opens the possibility to construct tunable electronic devices
through the external control of the EPC.
