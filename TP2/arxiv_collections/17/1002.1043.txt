In this work, a shell model for metal clusters up to 220 valence electrons is
used to obtain the fractional occupation probabilities of the electronic
orbitals. Then, the calculation of a statistical measure of complexity and the
Fisher-Shannon information is carried out. An increase of both magnitudes with
the number of valence electrons is observed. The shell structure is reflected
by the behavior of the statistical complexity. The magic numbers are indicated
by the Fisher-Shannon information. So, as in the case of atomic nuclei, the
study of statistical indicators also unveil the existence of magic numbers in
metal clusters.
