We present multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of
J16021+3326. These observations, along with variability data obtained from the
Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) candidate gamma-ray blazar monitoring
program, clearly indicate this source is a blazar. The peculiar characteristic
of this blazar, which daunted previous classification attempts, is that we
appear to be observing down a precessing jet, the mean orientation of which is
aligned with us almost exactly.
