An influence of a strong external magnetic field on the neutrino self-energy
operator is investigated. The width of the neutrino decay into the electron and
W boson, and the mean free path of an ultra-high energy neutrino in a strong
magnetic field are calculated. A kind of energy cutoff for neutrinos
propagating in a strong field is defined.
