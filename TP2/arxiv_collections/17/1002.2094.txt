We study the large-time behaviour of the solutions of the evolution equation
involving nonlinear diffusion and gradient absorption, $$ \partial_t u -
\Delta_p u + |\nabla u|^q=0 . $$ We consider the problem posed for $x\in
\real^N$ and t>0 with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data. We take
the exponent p>2 which corresponds to slow p-Laplacian diffusion. The main
feature of the paper is that the exponent q takes the critical value q=p-1
which leads to interesting asymptotics. This is due to the fact that in this
case both the Hamilton-Jacobi term $ |\nabla u|^q$ and the diffusive term
$\Delta_p u$ have a similar size for large times. The study performed in this
paper shows that a delicate asymptotic equilibrium happens, so that the
large-time behaviour of the solutions is described by a rescaled version of a
suitable self-similar solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation $|\nabla
W|^{p-1}=W$, with logarithmic time corrections. The asymptotic rescaled profile
is a kind of sandpile with a cusp on top, and it is independent of the space
dimension.
