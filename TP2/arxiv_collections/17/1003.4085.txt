With the rapid development of various multimedia technologies, more and more
multimedia data are generated and transmitted in the medical, also the internet
allows for wide distribution of digital media data. It becomes much easier to
edit, modify and duplicate digital information. Besides that, digital documents
are also easy to copy and distribute, therefore it will be faced by many
threats. It is a big security and privacy issue, it become necessary to find
appropriate protection because of the significance, accuracy and sensitivity of
the information, which may include some sensitive information which should not
be accessed by or can only be partially exposed to the general users.
Therefore, security and privacy has become an important. Another problem with
digital document and video is that undetectable modifications can be made with
very simple and widely available equipment, which put the digital material for
evidential purposes under question. Cryptography considers one of the
techniques which used to protect the important information. In this paper a
three algorithm of multimedia encryption schemes have been proposed in the
literature and description. The New Comparative Study between DES, 3DES and AES
within Nine Factors achieving an efficiency, flexibility and security, which is
a challenge of researchers.
