We elucidate the feature of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron
star merger collapsing to a black hole by general relativistic simulation. We
show that GW spectrum imprints the coalescence dynamics, formation process of
disk, equation of state for neutron stars, total masses, and mass ratio. A
formation mechanism of the central engine of short $\gamma$-ray bursts, which
are likely to be composed of a black hole and surrounding disk, therefore could
be constrained by GW observation.
