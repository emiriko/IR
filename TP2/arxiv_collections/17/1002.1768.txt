In this paper, we study the relationship between the McKay quivers of a
finite subgroups $G$ of special linear groups general linear groups, via some
natural extension and embedding. We show that the McKay quiver of certain
extension of a finite subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{SL}(m,\mathbb C)$ in
$\mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb C)$ is a regular covering of the McKay quiver of $G$,
and when embedding $G$ in a canonical way into $\mathrm{GL}(m-1,\mathbb C)$,
the new McKay quiver is obtained by adding an arrow from the Nakayama
translation of $i$ back to $i$ for each $i$. We also show that certain
interesting examples of McKay quivers are obtained in these two ways.
