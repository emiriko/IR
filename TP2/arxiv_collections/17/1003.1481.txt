Atom interferometry represents a quantum leap in the technology for the
ultra-precise monitoring of accelerations and rotations and, therefore, for all
the science that relies on the latter quantities. These sensors evolved from a
new kind of optics based on matter-waves rather than light-waves and might
result in an advancement of the fundamental detection limits by several orders
of magnitude. Matter-wave optics is still a young, but rapidly progressing
science. The Space Atom Interferometer project (SAI), funded by the European
Space Agency, in a multi-pronged approach aims to investigate both
experimentally and theoretically the various aspects of placing atom
interferometers in space: the equipment needs, the realistically expected
performance limits and potential scientific applications in a micro-gravity
environment considering all aspects of quantum, relativistic and metrological
sciences. A drop-tower compatible prototype of a single-axis atom
interferometry accelerometer is under construction. At the same time the team
is studying new schemes, e.g. based on degenerate quantum gases as source for
the interferometer. A drop-tower compatible atom interferometry acceleration
sensor prototype has been designed, and the manufacturing of its subsystems has
been started. A compact modular laser system for cooling and trapping rubidium
atoms has been assembled. A compact Raman laser module, featuring outstandingly
low phase noise, has been realized. Possible schemes to implement coherent
atomic sources in the atom interferometer have been experimentally
demonstrated.
