The representation theory of the Drinfeld doubles of dihedral groups is used
to solve the Yang-Baxter equation. Use of the 2-dimensional representations
recovers the six-vertex model solution. Solutions in arbitrary dimensions,
which are viewed as descendants of the six-vertex model case, are then obtained
using tensor product graph methods which were originally formulated for quantum
algebras. Connections with the Fateev-Zamolodchikov model are discussed.
