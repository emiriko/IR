We investigated the radiative emission of different types of solar features
in the spectral range of the Ca II K line.
  We analyzed full-disk 2k x 2k observations from the PSPT Precision Solar
Photometric Telescope. The data were obtained by using three narrow-band
interference filters that sample the Ca II K line with different pass bands.
Two filters are centered in the line core, the other in the red wing of the
line. We measured the intensity and contrast of various solar features,
specifically quiet Sun (inter-network), network, enhanced network, plage, and
bright plage (facula) regions. Moreover, we compared the results obtained with
those derived from the numerical synthesis performed for the three PSPT filters
with a widely used radiative code on a set of reference semi-empirical
atmosphere models.
