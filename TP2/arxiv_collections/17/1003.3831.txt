We present a novel method to significantly speed up cosmological parameter
sampling. The method relies on constructing an interpolation of the
CMB-log-likelihood based on sparse grids, which is used as a shortcut for the
likelihood-evaluation. We obtain excellent results over a large region in
parameter space, comprising about 25 log-likelihoods around the peak, and we
reproduce the one-dimensional projections of the likelihood almost perfectly.
In speed and accuracy, our technique is competitive to existing approaches to
accelerate parameter estimation based on polynomial interpolation or neural
networks, while having some advantages over them. In our method, there is no
danger of creating unphysical wiggles as it can be the case for polynomial fits
of a high degree. Furthermore, we do not require a long training time as for
neural networks, but the construction of the interpolation is determined by the
time it takes to evaluate the likelihood at the sampling points, which can be
parallelised to an arbitrary degree. Our approach is completely general, and it
can adaptively exploit the properties of the underlying function. We can thus
apply it to any problem where an accurate interpolation of a function is
needed.
