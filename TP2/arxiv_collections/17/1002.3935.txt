A numerical method close to the Strutinsky procedure (but better) is proposed
to calculate the deformation energy of nuclei. Quadrupole (triaxial)
deformations are considered. Theoretical as well as practical aspects of the
method are reviewed in this paper. A complete fortran program illustrates the
feasibility of the method.
