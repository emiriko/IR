We propose a detailed study of the geometric entanglement properties of pure
symmetric N-qubit states, focusing more particularly on the identification of
symmetric states with a high geometric entanglement and how their entanglement
behaves asymptotically for large N. We show that much higher geometric
entanglement with improved asymptotical behavior can be obtained in comparison
with the highly entangled balanced Dicke states studied previously. We also
derive an upper bound for the geometric measure of entanglement of symmetric
states. The connection with the quantumness of a state is discussed.
