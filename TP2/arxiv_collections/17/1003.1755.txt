We report a new method to introduce metal atoms into silicon wafers, using
negligible thermal budget. Molecular thin films are irradiated with
ultra-violet (UV) light releasing metal species into the semiconductor
substrate. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) show that Mn is incorporated into Si as an interstitial
dopant. We propose that our method can form the basis of a generic low-cost,
low-temperature technology that could lead to the creation of ordered dopant
arrays.
