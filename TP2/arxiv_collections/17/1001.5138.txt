The recently discovered eclipsing binary system TYC 2675-663-1 is a X-ray
source, and shows properties in the optical that are similar to the W UMa
systems, but are somewhat unusual compared to what is seen in other contact
binary systems. The goal of this work is to characterize its properties and
investigate its nature by means of detailed photometric and spectroscopic
observations. We have performed extensive V-band photometric measurements with
the INTEGRAL satellite along with ground-based multi-band photometric
observations, as well as high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring from which we
have measured the radial velocities of the components. These data have been
analysed to determine the stellar properties, including the absolute masses and
radii. Additional low-resolution spectroscopy was obtained to investigate
spectral features. From the measured eclipse timings we determine an orbital
period for the binary of P=0.4223576+-0.0000009 days. The light-curve and
spectroscopic analyses reveal the observations to be well represented by a
model of an overcontact system composed of main-sequence F5 and G7 stars
(temperature difference of nearly 1000 K), with the possible presence of a
third star. Low-resolution optical spectroscopy reveals a complex H alpha
emission, and other features that are not yet understood. The unusually large
mass ratio of q=0.81+-0.05 places it in the rare "H" (high mass ratio) subclass
of the W UMa systems, which are presumably on their way to coalescence.
