The generalized q-deformed valence-bond-solid groundstate of one-dimensional
higher integer spin model is studied. The Schwinger boson representation and
the matrix product representation of the exact groundstate is determined, which
recovers the former results for the spin-1 case or the isotropic limit. As an
application, several correlation functions are evaluated from the matrix
product representation.
