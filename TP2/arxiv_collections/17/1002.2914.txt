We study the optomechanical design introduced by M. Li et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 103}, 223901 (2009)], which is very effective for investigation of
the effects of reactive coupling. We show the normal mode splitting which is
due solely to reactive coupling rather than due to dispersive coupling. We
suggest feeding the waveguide with a pump field along with a probe field and
scanning the output probe for evidence of reactive-coupling-induced normal mode
splitting.
