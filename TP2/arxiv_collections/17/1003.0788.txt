This paper presents simulation-based relations for probabilistic game
structures. The first relation is called probabilistic alternating simulation,
and the second called probabilistic alternating forward simulation, following
the naming convention of Segala and Lynch. We study these relations with
respect to the preservation of properties specified in probabilistic
alternating-time temporal logic.
