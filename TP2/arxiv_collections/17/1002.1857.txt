The presence of a body in an orbit around a close eclipsing binary star
manifests itself through the light time effect influencing the observed times
of eclipses as the close binary and the circumbinary companion both move around
the common centre of mass. This fact combined with the periodicity with which
the eclipses occur can be used to detect the companion. Given a sufficient
precision of the times of eclipses, the eclipse timing can be employed to
detect substellar or even planetary mass companions.
  The main goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of the photometry
based eclipse timing of binary stars as a method of detecting circumbinary
planets. In the models we assume that the companion orbits a binary star in a
circular Keplerian orbit. We analyze both the space and ground based photometry
cases. In particular, we study the usefulness of the on-going COROT and Kepler
missions in detecting circumbinary planets. We also explore the relations
binding the planet discovery space with the physical parameters of the binaries
and the geometrical parameters of their light curves. We carry out detailed
numerical simulations of the eclipse timing by employing a relatively realistic
model of the light curves of eclipsing binary stars. We study the influence of
the white and red photometric noises on the timing precision. We determine the
sensitivity of the eclipse timing technique to circumbinary planets for the
ground and space based photometric observations. We provide suggestions for the
best targets, observing strategies and instruments for the eclipse timing
method. Finally, we compare the eclipse timing as a planet detection method
with the radial velocities and astrometry.
