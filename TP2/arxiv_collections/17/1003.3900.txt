Recent coronagraphic imaging of the AB Aurigae disk has revealed a region of
low polarized scattered light suggestive of perturbations from a planet at a
radius of ~100 AU. We model this darkened region using our fully
non-plane-parallel radiative-transfer code combined with a simple hydrostatic
equilibirum approximation to self-consistently solve for the structure of the
disk surface as seen in scattered light. By comparing the observations to our
models, we find that the observations are consistent with the absence of a
planet, with an upper limit of 1 Jupiter mass.
