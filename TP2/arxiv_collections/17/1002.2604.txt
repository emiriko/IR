The impact of a stress scenario of default events on the loss distribution of
a credit portfolio can be assessed by determining the loss distribution
conditional on these events. While it is conceptually easy to estimate loss
distributions conditional on default events by means of Monte Carlo simulation,
it becomes impractical for two or more simultaneous defaults as then the
conditioning event is extremely rare. We provide an analytical approach to the
calculation of the conditional loss distribution for the CreditRisk+ portfolio
model with independent random loss given default distributions. The analytical
solution for this case can be used to check the accuracy of an approximation to
the conditional loss distribution whereby the unconditional model is run with
stressed input probabilities of default (PDs). It turns out that this
approximation is unbiased. Numerical examples, however, suggest that the
approximation may be seriously inaccurate but that the inaccuracy leads to
overestimation of tail losses and hence the approach errs on the conservative
side.
