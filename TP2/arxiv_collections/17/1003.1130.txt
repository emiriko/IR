--Results-- We found that the (B-V) v.s. (V-S9W) color-color diagram is
useful to identify the stars with infrared excess emerged from circumstellar
envelopes/disks. Be stars with infrared excess are well separated from other
types of stars in this diagram. Whereas (J-L18W) v.s. (S9W-L18W) diagram is a
powerful tool to classify several object-types. Carbon-rich asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars and OH/IR stars form distinct sequences in this color-color
diagram. Young stellar objects (YSOs), pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, post-AGB
stars and planetary nebulae (PNe) have largest mid-infrared color-excess, and
can be identified in infrared catalog. Finally, we plot L18W v.s. (S9W-L18W)
color-magnitude diagram, using the AKARI data together with Hipparcos
parallaxes. This diagram can be used to identify low-mass YSOs, as well as AGB
stars. We found that this diagram is comparable to the [24] vs ([8.0]-[24])
diagram of Large Magellanic Cloud sources using the Spitzer Space Telescope
data. Our understanding of Galactic objects will be used to interpret
color-magnitude diagram of stellar populations in nearby galaxies which Spitzer
Space Telescope has observed. --Conclusions-- Our study of the AKARI
color-color and color-magnitude will be used to explore properties of unknown
objects in future. In addition, our analysis highlights a future key project to
understand stellar evolution with circumstellar envelope, once the forthcoming
astronometrical data with GAIA are available.
