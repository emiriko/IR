The mid-far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 83 active
galaxies, mostly Seyfert galaxies, selected from the extended 12 micron sample
are presented. The data were collected using all three instruments, IRAC, IRS,
and MIPS, aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS data were obtained in
spectral mapping mode, and the photometric data from IRAC and IRS were
extracted from matched, 20 arcsec diameter circular apertures. The MIPS data
were obtained in SED mode, providing very low resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 20)
between ~ 55 and 90 microns in a larger, 20 by 30 arcsec synthetic aperture. We
further present the data from a spectral decomposition of the SEDs, including
equivalent widths and fluxes of key emission lines; silicate 10 and 18 micron
emission and absorption strengths; IRAC magnitudes; and mid-far infrared
spectral indices. Finally, we examine the SEDs averaged within optical
classifications of activity. We find that the infrared SEDs of Seyfert 1s and
Seyfert 2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLR, as revealed by
spectropolarimetry or other technique) are qualitatively similar, except that
Seyfert 1s show silicate emission and HBLR Seyfert 2s show silicate absorption.
The infrared SEDs of other classes with the 12 micron sample, including Seyfert
1.8-1.9, non-HBLR Seyfert 2 (not yet shown to hide a type 1 nucleus), LINER and
HII galaxies, appear to be dominated by star-formation, as evidenced by blue
IRAC colors, strong PAH emission, and strong far-infrared continuum emission,
measured relative to mid-infrared continuum emission.
