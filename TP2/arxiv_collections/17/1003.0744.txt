Intersection with the debris of a large (50-100 km) short-period comet during
the Upper Palaeolithic provides a satisfactory explanation for the catastrophe
of celestial origin which has been postulated to have occurred around 12900 BP,
and which presaged a return to ice age conditions of duration ~1300 years. The
Taurid Complex appears to be the debris of this erstwhile comet; it includes at
least 19 of the brightest near-Earth objects. Sub-kilometre bodies in meteor
streams may present the greatest regional impact hazard on timescales of human
concern.
