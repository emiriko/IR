We review the application of non abelian discrete groups to the theory of
neutrino masses and mixing, which is strongly suggested by the agreement of the
Tri-Bimaximal mixing pattern with experiment. After summarizing the motivation
and the formalism, we discuss specific models, based on A4, S4 and other finite
groups, and their phenomenological implications, including lepton flavor
violating processes, leptogenesis and the extension to quarks. In alternative
to Tri-Bimaximal mixing the application of discrete flavor symmetries to
quark-lepton complementarity and Bimaximal Mixing is also considered.
