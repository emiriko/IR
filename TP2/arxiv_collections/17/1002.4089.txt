We investigate the properties of membranes under tension by Monte-Carlo
simulations of a generic coarse-grained model for lipid bilayers. We give a
comprising overview of the behavior of several membrane characteristics, such
as the area per lipid, the monolayer overlap, the nematic order, and pressure
profiles. Both the low-temperature regime, where the membranes are in a gel
phase, and the high-temperature regime, where they are in the fluid phase, are
considered. In the gel state, the membrane is hardly influenced by tension. In
the fluid state, high tensions lead to structural changes in the membrane,
which result in different compressibility regimes. The ripple state, which is
found at tension zero in the transition regime between the fluid and the gel
phase, disappears under tension and gives way to an interdigitated phase. We
also study the membrane fluctuations in the fluid phase. In the low tension
regime the data can be fitted nicely to a suitably extended elastic theory. At
higher tensions the elastic fit consistently underestimates the strength of
long-wavelength fluctuations. Finally, we investigate the influence of tension
on the effective interaction between simple transmembrane inclusions and show
that tension can be used to tune the hydrophobic mismatch interaction between
membrane proteins.
