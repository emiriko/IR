According to the theory of ether light propagates with constant speed c with
respect to the absolute reference frame and with respect to any other reference
frame the speed of light is covariant. According to the theory of special
relativity the speed of light is invariant with respect to any reference frame.
The new theory of reference frames gives a different answer to this question
with the consideration of two speeds of light: the physical speed and the
relativistic speed. After considering a few negative aspects of the two main
theories a few fundamentals of the new theory are expounded.
