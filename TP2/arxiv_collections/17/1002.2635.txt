To understand the nonlinear dynamics of the Parker scenario for coronal
heating, long-time high-resolution simulations of the dynamics of a coronal
loop in cartesian geometry are carried out. A loop is modeled as a box extended
along the direction of the strong magnetic field $B_0$ in which the system is
embedded. At the top and bottom plates, which represent the photosphere,
velocity fields mimicking photospheric motions are imposed.
  We show that the nonlinear dynamics is described by different regimes of MHD
anisotropic turbulence, with spectra characterized by intertial range power
laws whose indexes range from Kolmogorov-like values ($\sim 5/3$) up to $\sim
3$. We briefly describe the bearing for coronal heating rates.
