We introduce a new axiomatization of matroid theory that requires the
elimination property only among modular pairs of circuits, and we present a
cryptomorphic phrasing thereof in terms of Crapo's axioms for flats. This new
point of view leads to a corresponding strengthening of the circuit axioms for
oriented matroids.
