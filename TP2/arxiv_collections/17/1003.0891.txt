We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the nearest-neighbor
kagome antiferromagnet in the presence of Dzyaloshinksii-Moriya interaction. We
develop a theory for the transition between Z2 spin liquids with bosonic
spinons and a phase with antiferromagnetic long-range order. Connections to
recent numerical studies and experiments are discussed.
