We propose an algorithm that test membership for regular expressions and show
that the algorithm is correct. This algorithm is written in the style of a
sequent proof system. The advantage of this algorithm over traditional ones is
that the complex conversion process from regular expressions to finite automata
is not needed. As a consequence, our algorithm is simple and extends easily to
various extensions to regular expressions such as timed regular expressions or
regular languages with the intersection.
