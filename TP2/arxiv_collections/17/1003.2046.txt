We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the
gluon-fusion production of a Higgs boson in models with massive color-octet
scalars in the ${\bf (8,1)_0}$ representation using an effective-theory
approach. We derive a compact analytic expression for the relevant Wilson
coefficient, and explain an interesting technical aspect of the calculation
that requires inclusion of the quartic-scalar interactions at
next-to-next-to-leading order. We perform a renormalization-group analysis of
the scalar couplings to derive the allowed regions of parameter space, and
present phenomenological results for both the Tevatron and the LHC. The
modifications of the Higgs production cross section are large at both
colliders, and can increase the Standard Model rate by more than a factor of
two in allowed regions of parameter space. We estimate that stringent
constraints on the color-octet scalar parameters can be obtained using the
Tevatron exclusion limit on Higgs production.
