We investigate optimal consumption problems for a Black-Scholes market under
uniform restrictions on Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall for logarithmic
utility functions. We find the solutions in terms of a dynamic strategy in
explicit form, which can be compared and interpreted. This paper continues our
previous work, where we solved similar problems for power utility functions.
