In this paper, we consider continuous-variable quantum key distribution with
a discrete modulation, either binary or quaternary. We establish the security
of these protocols against the class of collective attacks that induce a linear
quantum channel. In particular, all Gaussian attacks are taken into account, as
well as linear attacks which add a non-Gaussian noise. We give lower bounds for
the secret key rate using extremality properties of Gaussian states.
