We perform a three-dimensional nested-grid radiation magneto-hydrodynamics
(RMHD) simulation with self-gravity to study the early phase of the low-mass
star formation process from a rotating molecular cloud core to a first
adiabatic core just before the second collapse begins. Radiation transfer is
handled with the flux-limited diffusion approximation, operator-splitting and
implicit time-integrator. In the RMHD simulation, the outer region of the first
core attains a higher entropy and the size of first core is larger than that in
the magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the barotropic approximation. Bipolar
molecular outflow consisting of two components is driven by magnetic Lorentz
force via different mechanisms, and shock heating by the outflow is observed.
Using the RMHD simulation we can predict and interpret the observed properties
of star-forming clouds, first cores and outflows with millimeter/submillimeter
radio interferometers, especially the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA).
