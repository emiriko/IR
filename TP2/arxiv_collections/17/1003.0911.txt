In the last decade or so, there have been numerous searches for hot subdwarfs
in close binaries. There has been little to no attention paid to wide binaries
however. The advantages of understanding these systems can be many. The stars
can be assumed to be coeval, which means they have common properties. The
distance and metallicity, for example, are both unknown for the subdwarf
component, but may be determinable for the secondary, allowing other properties
of the subdwarf to be estimated. With this in mind, we have started a search
for common proper motion pairs containing a hot subdwarf component. We have
uncovered several promising candidate systems, which are presented here.
