Intentional islanding is used to limit cascading power failures by isolating
highly connected "islands" with local generating capacity. To efficiently
isolate an island, one should break as few power lines as possible. This is a
graph partitioning problem, and here we give preliminary results on islanding
of the Italian and Floridian high-voltage grids by spectral matrix methods.
