We present a simultaneous analysis of 18 galaxy lenses with time delay
measurements. For each lens we derive mass maps using pixelated simultaneous
modeling with shared Hubble constant. We estimate the Hubble constant to be
66_{-4}^{+6} km/s/Mpc (for a flat Universe with \Omega_m=0.3,
\Omega_\Lambda=0.7).
  We have also selected a subsample of five relatively isolated early type
galaxies and by simultaneous modeling with an additional constraint on
isothermality of their mass profiles we get H_0=76 +/-3 km/s/Mpc.
