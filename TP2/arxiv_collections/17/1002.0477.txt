We have measured systematic repetitions of avoided crossings in low
temperature three-terminal transport through a carbon nanotube with
encapsulated C60 molecules. We show that this is a general effect of the
hybridization of a host quantum dot with an impurity. The well-defined nanotube
allows identification of the properties of the impurity, which we suggest to be
a chain of C60 molecules inside the nanotube. This electronic coupling between
the two subsystems opens the interesting and potentially useful possibility of
contacting the encapsulated molecules via the tube.
