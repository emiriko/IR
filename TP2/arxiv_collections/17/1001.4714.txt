CP violation in the spin-spin correlations in chargino production and
subsequent two-body decay into a tau and a tau-sneutrino is studied at the ILC.
  From the normal polarisation of the tau, an asymmetry is defined to test the
CP-violating phase of the higgsino mass parameter \mu. Asymmetries of more than
\pm70% are obtained, also in scenarios with heavy first and second generation
sfermions. Bounds on the statistical significances of the CP asymmetries are
estimated. As a result, the normal tau polarisation in the chargino decay is
one of the most sensitive probes to constrain or measure the phase \phi_\mu at
the ILC, motivating further detailed experimental studies.
