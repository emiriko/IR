The standard theory of nuclear fusion rates in a strongly interacting plasma
can be (correctly) derived only when the energy release, Q, is large compared
to other energies in the problem. We exhibit a result for rates that provides a
basis for calculating the finite Q corrections. Crude estimates indicate a
significant defect in the conventional results for some regions of high density
and strong plasma coupling. We also lay some groundwork for a path integral
calculation of the new effects.
