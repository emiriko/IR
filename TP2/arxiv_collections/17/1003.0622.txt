We discuss the propagation of hydrogen atoms in static electric and magnetic
fields in a longitudinal atomic beam spin echo (lABSE) apparatus. Depending on
the choice of the external fields the atoms may acquire both dynamical and
geometrical quantum mechanical phases. As an example of the former, we show
first in-beam spin rotation measurements on atomic hydrogen, which are in
excellent agreement with theory. Additional calculations of the behaviour of
the metastable 2S states of hydrogen reveal that the geometrical phases may
exhibit the signature of parity-(P-)violation. This invites for possible future
lABSE experiments, focusing on P-violating geometrical phases in the lightest
of all atoms.
