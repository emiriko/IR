Polycrystalline NdFeAsO0.88F0.12 superconductors prepared by high pressure
(HP) and ambient pressure (AP) method were comparatively studied by
magnetization and transport measurements. Upper critical field (Hc2),
irreversibility field (Hirr) and the anisotropy parameter were estimated from
resistance transition curves. The broadening of transition width was observed,
and ascribed to both Hc2 anisotropy and superconductivity inhomogeneity of
samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops (MHLs) in low fields were measured to detect
the trace of weak-link behavior. The reclosed hysteresis loops in low fields
manifest that there are weak-links in both samples. Magnetization critical
current density Jcm were derived from MHLs. High-pressure synthesized sample
shows higher Jcm. However, by means of direct transport I-V measurements,
transport critical current density Jct was very low. The Jct values for two
samples are comparable. Large discrepancies between Jcm and Jct also indicate
that there are weak-links in both samples. The relative mechanism is discussed
in detail.
