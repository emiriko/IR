We analyze a pair of diffusion equations which are derived in the infinite
system--size limit from a microscopic, individual--based, stochastic model.
Deviations from the conventional Fickian picture are found which ultimately
relate to the depletion of resources on which the particles rely. The
macroscopic equations are studied both analytically and numerically, and are
shown to yield anomalous diffusion which does not follow a power law with time,
as is frequently assumed when fitting data for such phenomena. These anomalies
are here understood within a consistent dynamical picture which applies to a
wide range of physical and biological systems, underlining the need for clearly
defined mechanisms which are systematically analyzed to give definite
predictions.
