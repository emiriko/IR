Despite the recent interest in "organic spintronics", the dominant spin
relaxation mechanism of electrons or holes in an organic compound semiconductor
has not been conclusively identified. There have been sporadic suggestions that
it might be hyperfine interaction caused by background nuclear spins, but no
confirmatory evidence to support this has ever been presented. Here, we report
the electric-field dependence of the spin diffusion length in an organic
spin-valve structure consisting of an Alq3 spacer layer, and argue that this
data, as well as available data on the temperature dependence of this length,
contradict the notion that hyperfine interactions relax spin. Instead, they
suggest that the Elliott-Yafet mechanism, arising from spin-orbit interaction,
is more likely the dominant spin relaxing mechanism.
