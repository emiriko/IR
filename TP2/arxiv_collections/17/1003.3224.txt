The correlated electronic structure of the submonolayer surface systems
Sn/Si(111) and Sn/Ge(111) is investigated by density-functional theory (DFT)
and its combination with explicit many-body methods. Namely, the dynamical
mean-field theory and the slave-boson mean-field theory are utilized for the
study of the intriguing interplay between structure, bonding and electronic
correlation. In this respect, explicit low-energy one- and
four($sp^2$-like)-band models are derived using maximally-localized
Wannier(-like) functions. In view of the possible low-dimensional magnetism in
the Sn submonolayers we compare different types of magnetic orders and indeed
find a 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic ordering to be stable in the ground state.
With single-site methods and cellular-cluster extensions the influence of a
finite Hubbard $U$ on the surface states in a planar and a reconstructed
structural geometry is furthermore elaborated.
