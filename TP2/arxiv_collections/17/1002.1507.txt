In this paper we calculate the pressure of pure lattice Yang-Mills theories
and lattice QCD with heavy quarks by means of strong coupling expansions.
Dynamical fermions are introduced with a hopping parameter expansion, which
also allows for the incorporation of finite quark chemical potential. We show
that in leading orders the results are in full agreement with expectations from
the hadron resonance gas model, thus validating it with a first principles
calculation. For pure Yang-Mills theories we obtain the corresponding ideal
glueball gas, in QCD with heavy quarks our result equals that of an ideal gas
of mesons and baryons. Another finding is that the Yang-Mills pressure in the
large N limit is of order $\sim N^0$ to the calculated orders, when the inverse
't Hooft coupling is used as expansion parameter. This property is expected in
the confined phase, where our calculations take place.
