We construct integrals of motion for multidimensional classical systems from
ladder operators of one-dimensional systems. This method can be used to obtain
new systems with higher order integrals. We show how these integrals generate a
polynomial Poisson algebra. We consider a one-dimensional system with third
order ladders operators and found a family of superintegrable systems with
higher order integrals of motion. We obtain also the polynomial algebra
generated by these integrals. We calculate numerically the trajectories and
show that all bounded trajectories are closed.
