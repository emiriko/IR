We present a new spectral method for the Direct Numerical Simulation of
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at low Magnetic Reynolds number. The originality
of our approach is that instead of using traditional bases of functions, it
relies on the basis of eigenmodes of the dissipation operator, which represents
viscous and Joule dissipation. We apply this idea to the simple case of a
periodic domain in the three directions of space, with an homogeneous magnetic
field in the $\mathbf e_z$ direction. The basis is then still as subset of the
Fourier space, but ordered by growing linear decay rate $|\lambda|$ (\emph{i.e}
according to the \emph{least dissipative modes}). We show that because the
lines of constant energy tend to follow those of constant $|\lambda|$ in the
Fourier space, the scaling for the the smallest scales $|\lambda^{\rm max}|$ in
a forced flow can be expressed using this single parameter, as a function of
the Reynolds number as $\sqrt{|\lambda^{\rm max}|}/(2\pi k_f)\simeq
0.5\Rey^{1/2}$, where $k_f$ is the forcing wavelength, or as a function of the
Grashof number $\Gr_f$, which gives a non-dimensional measure of the forcing,
as $|\lambda^{\rm max}|^{1/2}/(2\pi k_f)\simeq 0.47\Gr_f^{0.20}$. This scaling
is also found consistent with heuristic scalings, and which we are able to
numerically quantify as $k_\perp^{\rm max}/k_f\simeq 0.5 \Rey^{1/2}$ and
$k_z^{\rm max}/k_f\simeq 0.8k_f \Rey/Ha$. Finally, we show that the set of
least dissipative modes gives a relevant prediction for the scale of the first
three-dimensional structure to appear in a forced, initially two-dimensional
turbulent flow. This completes our numerical demonstration that the least
dissipative modes can be used to simulate both two- and three-dimensional
low-Rm MHD flows.
