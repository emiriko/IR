We use in-situ high pressure angle dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements
to determine the equation of state of cubic tin nitride Sn3N4 under pressure up
to about 26 GPa. While we find no evidence for any structural phase transition,
our estimate of the bulk modulus (B) is 145 GPa, much lower than the earlier
theoretical estimates and that of other group IV-nitrides. We corroborate and
understand these results with complementary first-principles analysis of
structural, elastic and vibrational properties of group IV-nitrides, and
predict a structural transition of Sn3N4 at a higher pressure of 88 GPa
compared to earlier predictions of 40 GPa. Our comparative analysis of cubic
nitrides shows that bulk modulus of cubic C3N4 is the highest (379 GPa) while
it is structurally unstable and should not exist at ambient conditions.
