We study the random walk problem on a deterministic scale-free network, in
the presence of a set of static, identical targets; due to the strong
inhomogeneity of the underlying structure the mean first-passage time (MFPT),
meant as a measure of transport efficiency, is expected to depend sensitively
on the position of targets. We consider several spatial arrangements for
targets and we calculate, mainly rigorously, the related MFPT, where the
average is taken over all possible starting points and over all possible paths.
For all the cases studied, the MFPT asymptotically scales like N^{theta}, being
N the volume of the substrate and theta ranging from (1 - log 2/log3), for
central target(s), to 1, for a single peripheral target.
