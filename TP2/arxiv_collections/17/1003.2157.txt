Baryons of the type Qqqqq-bar (where Q = c,b and q = u,d,s quarks) forming
anti-decapenta (15)-plets with spin-parity one half-plus are predicted on
simple theoretical considerations. The lightest members of these multiplets are
explicitly exotic doublets cuuds-bar, cudds-bar with mass about 2420 MeV, and
buuds-bar, budds-bar with mass about 5750 MeV, only 130 MeV heavier than
Lambda_c and Lambda_b, respectively, and thus stable against strong decays.
Although the production rate is probably very low, these remarkable pentaquarks
can be looked for at LHC, Fermilab, B-factories, RHIC and elsewhere: their
signatures are briefly discussed.
