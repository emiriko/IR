We compare the substructure evolution in pure dark matter (DM) halos with
those in the presence of baryons (PDM and BDM). The prime halos have been
analyzed by Romano-Diaz et al (2009). Models have been evolved from identical
initial conditions using Constrained Realizations, including star formation and
feedback. A comprehensive catalog of subhalos has been compiled and properties
of subhalos analyzed in the mass range of 10^8 Mo - 10^11 Mo. We find that
subhalo mass functions are consistent with a single power law, M_sbh^{alpha},
but detect a nonnegligible shift between these functions, alpha -0.86 for the
PDM, and -0.98 for the BDM. Overall, alpha const. in time with variations of
+-15%. Second, we find that the radial mass distribution of subhalos can be
approximated by a power law, R^{gamma} with a steepening around the radius of a
maximal circular velocity, Rvmax, in the prime halos. Gamma ~-1.5 for the PDM
and -1 for the BDM, inside Rvmax, and is steeper outside. We detect little
spatial bias between the subhalo populations and the DM of the main halos. The
subhalo population exhibits much less triaxiality with baryons, in tandem with
the prime halo. Finally, we find that, counter-intuitively, the BDM population
is depleted at a faster rate than the PDM one within the central 30kpc of the
prime. Although the baryons provide a substantial glue to the subhalos, the
main halos exhibit the same trend. This assures a more efficient tidal
disruption of the BDM subhalos. This effect can be reversed for a more
efficient feedback from stellar evolution and supermassive black holes, which
will expel baryons from the center and decrease the concentration of the prime
halo. We compare our results with via Lactea and Aquarius simulations and other
published results.
