We study the influence of the chiral phase transition on the chiral magnetic
effect. The chiral electric current density along the magnetic field, the
electric charge difference between on each side of the reaction plane, and the
azimuthal charged-particle correlations as functions of the temperature during
the QCD phase transitions are calculated. It is found that with the decrease of
the temperature, the chiral electric current density, the electric charge
difference, and the azimuthal charged-particle correlations all get a sudden
suppression at the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition, because
the large quark constituent mass in the chiral symmetry broken phase quite
suppresses the axial anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect. We suggest that
the azimuthal charged-particle correlations (including the correlators divided
by the total multiplicity of produced charged particles which are used in
current experiments and another kind of correlators not divided by the total
multiplicity) can be employed to identify the occurrence of the QCD phase
transitions in RHIC energy scan experiments.
