A systematic study has been carried out on the previously reported
"magnetic-field-induced superconductivity" of Zn nanowires. By varying
parameters such as magnetic field orientation and wire length, the results
provide evidence that the phenomenon is a nonequilibrium effect associated with
the boundary electrodes. They also suggest there are two length scales
involved, the superconducting coherence length and quasiparticle relaxation
length. As wire lengths approach either of these length scales, the effect
weakens. We demonstrate that it is appropriate to consider the effect to be a
stabilization of superconductivity, that has been suppressed by an applied
current.
