This is a review of applications of the Color Glass Condensate to the
phenomenology of relativistic heavy ion collisions. The initial stages of the
collision can be understood in terms of the nonperturbatively strong nonlinear
glasma color fields. We discuss how the CGC framework can and has been used to
compute properties of the initial conditions of AA collisions. In particular
this has led to recent progress in understanding multiparticle correlations,
which can provide a directly observable signal of the properties of the initial
stage of the collision process.
