A nonlinear two dimensional fluid model of whistler turbulence is developed
that nonlinearly couples wave magnetic field with electron density
perturbations. This coupling leads essentially to finite compressibility
effects in whistler turbulence model. Interestingly it is found from our
simulations that despite strong compressibility effects, the density
fluctuations couple only weakly to the wave magnetic field fluctuations. In a
characteristic regime where large scale whistlers are predominant, the weakly
coupled density fluctuations do not modify inertial range energy cascade
processes. Consequently, the turbulent energy is dominated by the large scale
(compared to electron inertial length) eddies and it follows a Kolmogorov-like
$k^{-7/3}$ spectrum, where $k$ is a characteristic wavenumber. The weak
coupling of the density fluctuations is explained on the basis of a whistler
wave parameter that quantifies the contribution of density perturbations in the
wave magnetic field.
