We study the influence of the chiral phase transition on the chiral magnetic
effect. The azimuthal charge-particle correlations as functions of the
temperature are calculated. It is found that there is a pronounced cusp in the
correlations as the temperature reaches its critical value for the QCD phase
transition. It is predicted that there will be a drastic suppression of the
charge-particle correlations as the collision energy in RHIC decreases to below
a critical value. We show then the azimuthal charge-particle correlations can
be the signal to identify the occurrence of the QCD phase transitions in RHIC
energy scan experiments.
