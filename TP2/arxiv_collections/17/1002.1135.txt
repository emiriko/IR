We present a quantum interference approach to preserve coherence in the
external states of an atom trapped in an optical lattice. We show that this is
possible by suitably choosing the initial state of the atom. We demonstrate
this in context of decoherence due to spontaneous emission in an
one-dimensional optical double-well lattice.
