In microscopic mechanical systems interactions between elastic structures are
often mediated by the hydrodynamics of a solvent fluid. At microscopic scales
the elastic structures are also subject to thermal fluctuations. Stochastic
numerical methods are developed based on multigrid which allow for the
efficient computation of both the hydrodynamic interactions in the presence of
walls and the thermal fluctuations. The presented stochastic multigrid approach
provides efficient real-space numerical methods for generating the required
stochastic driving fields with long-range correlations consistent with
statistical mechanics. The presented approach also allows for the use of
spatially adaptive meshes in resolving the hydrodynamic interactions. Numerical
results are presented which show the methods perform in practice with a
computational complexity of O(N log(N)).
