In contrast to natural atoms, the potential energies for superconducting flux
qubit (SFQ) circuits can be artificially controlled. When the inversion
symmetry of the potential energy is broken, we find that the multi-photon
processes can coexist in the multi-level SFQ circuits. Moreover, there are not
only transverse but also longitudinal couplings between the external magnetic
fields and the SFQs when the inversion symmetry of potential energy is broken.
The longitudinal coupling would induce some new phenomena in the SFQs. Here we
will show how the longitudinal coupling can result in the coexistence of
multi-photon processes in a two-level system formed by a SFQ circuit. We also
show that the SFQs can become transparent to the transverse coupling fields
when the longitudinal coupling fields satisfy the certain conditions. We
further show that the quantum Zeno effect can also be induced by the
longitudinal coupling in the SFQs. Finally we clarify why the longitudinal
coupling can induce coexistence and disappearance of single- and two-photon
processes for a driven SFQ, which is coupled to a single-mode quantized field.
