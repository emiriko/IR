We consider a dense n-user Gaussian interference network formed by paired
transmitters and receivers placed independently at random in Euclidean space.
Under natural conditions on the node position distributions and signal
attenuation, we prove convergence in probability of the average per-user
capacity C_Sigma/n to 1/2 E log(1 + 2SNR).
  The achievability result follows directly from results based on an
interference alignment scheme presented in recent work of Nazer et al. Our main
contribution comes through the converse result, motivated by ideas of
`bottleneck links' developed in recent work of Jafar. An information theoretic
argument gives a capacity bound on such bottleneck links, and probabilistic
counting arguments show there are sufficiently many such links to tightly bound
the sum-capacity of the whole network.
