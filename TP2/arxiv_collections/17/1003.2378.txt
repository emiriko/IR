We derive a necessary and sufficient condition of linear dynamical stability
for inhomogeneous Vlasov stationary states of the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF)
model. The condition is expressed by an explicit disequality that has to be
satisfied by the stationary state, and it generalizes the known disequality for
homogeneous stationary states. In addition, we derive analogous disequalities
that express necessary and sufficient conditions of formal stability for the
stationary states. Their usefulness, from the point of view of linear dynamical
stability, is that they are simpler, although they provide only sufficient
criteria of linear stability. We show that for homogeneous stationary states
the relations become equal, and therefore linear dynamical stability and formal
stability become equivalent.
