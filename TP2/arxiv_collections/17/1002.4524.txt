The high-redshift (z=4.72) blazar J1430+4204 produced an exceptional radio
outburst in 2006. We analyzed 15-GHz radio interferometric images obtained with
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) before and after the outburst, to search
for possible structural changes on milli-arcsecond angular scales and to
determine physical parameters of the source.
