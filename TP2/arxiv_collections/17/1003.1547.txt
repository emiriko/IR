We extend the idea of quantum phase transitions of light in the photonic
Bose-Hubbard model with interactions to two atomic species by a self-consistent
mean field theory. The excitation of two-level atoms interacting with coherent
photon fields is analyzed with a finite temperature dependence of the order
parameters. Four ground states of the system are found, including an isolated
Mott-insulator phase and three different superfluid phases. Like two weakly
coupled superconductors, our proposed dual-species lattice system shows a
photonic analogue of Josephson effect. The dynamics of the proposed two species
model provides a promising quantum simulator for possible quantum information
processes.
