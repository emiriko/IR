We give new proofs for certain bilateral basic hypergeometric summation
formulas using the symmetries of the corresponding series. In particular, we
present a proof for Bailey's $_3\psi_3$ summation formula as an application. We
also prove a multiple series analogue of this identity by considering
hyperoctahedral group symmetries of higher ranks.
