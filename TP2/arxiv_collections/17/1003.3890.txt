We report on the study of the intensities of several gamma lines emitted
after the inelastic scattering of neutrons in $^{56}$Fe. Neutrons were produced
by cosmic muons passing the 20t massive iron cube placed at the Earth's surface
and used as a passive shield for the HPGe detector. Relative intensities of
detected gamma lines are compared with the results collected in the same iron
shield by the use of $^{252}$Cf neutrons. Assessment against the published data
from neutron scattering experiments at energies up to 14 MeV is also provided.
