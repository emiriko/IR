In this work we discuss how to correctly obtain the number of degrees of
freedom of a system constituted by n particles with fixed relative distances
and which are immerse in a three-dimensional space. As a result of our
analysis, we develop expressions which yield the number of degrees of freedom
of an analogous system, not only in three, but in any arbitrary number D of
dimensions.
