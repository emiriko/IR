We present here observations of the transit of WASP-10b on 14 October 2009 UT
taken from the University of Arizona's 1.55 meter Kuiper telescope on Mt.
Bigelow. Conditions were photometric and accuracies of 2.0 mmag RMS were
obtained throughout the transit. We have found that the ratio of the planet to
host star radii is in agreement with the measurements of Christian et al.
(2008) instead of the refinements of Johnson et al. (2009), suggesting that
WASP-10b is indeed inflated beyond what is expected from theoretical modeling.
We find no evidence for large (> 20 s) transit timing variations in WASP-10b's
orbit from the ephemeris of Christian et al. (2008) and Johnson et al. (2009).
