In the present paper we give a reformulation of the Noether Fundamental
Theorem for the special case where the three curves involved have the same
degree. In this reformulation, the local Noether's Conditions are weakened. To
do so we introduce the concept of Abstract Curve Combinatorics (ACC) which will
be, in the context of plane curves, the analogue of matroids for hyperplane
arrangements.
