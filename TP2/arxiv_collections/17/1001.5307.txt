This paper considers distributed computing on an anonymous quantum network, a
network in which no party has a unique identifier and quantum communication and
computation are available. It is proved that the leader election problem can
exactly (i.e., without error in bounded time) be solved with at most the same
complexity up to a constant factor as that of exactly computing symmetric
functions (without intermediate measurements for a distributed and superposed
input), if the number of parties is given to every party. A corollary of this
result is a more efficient quantum leader election algorithm than existing
ones: the new quantum algorithm runs in O(n) rounds with bit complexity
O(mn^2), on an anonymous quantum network with n parties and m communication
links. Another corollary is the first quantum algorithm that exactly computes
any computable Boolean function with round complexity O(n) and with smaller bit
complexity than that of existing classical algorithms in the worst case over
all (computable) Boolean functions and network topologies. More generally, any
n-qubit state can be shared with that complexity on an anonymous quantum
network with n parties.
