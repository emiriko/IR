We study the dynamical behavior of two initially entangled qubits, each
locally coupled to an environment embodied by an interacting spin chain. We
consider energy-exchange qubit-environment couplings resulting in a rich and
highly non trivial entanglement dynamics. We obtain exact results for the
time-evolution of the concurrence between the two qubits and find that, by
tuning the interaction parameters, one can freeze the dynamics of entanglement,
therefore inhibiting its relaxation into the spin environments, as well as
activate a sudden-death phenomenon. We also discuss the effects of an
environmental quantum phase transition on the features of the two-qubit
entanglement dynamics.
