We examine the completeness of bi-orthogonal sets of eigenfunctions for
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possessing a spectral singularity. The correct
resolutions of identity are constructed for delta like and smooth potentials.
Their form and the contribution of a spectral singularity depend on the class
of functions employed for physical states. With this specification there is no
obstruction to completeness originating from a spectral singularity.
