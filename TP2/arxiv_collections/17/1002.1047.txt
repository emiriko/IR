We report on the observation of photon helicity driven currents in graphene.
The directed net electric current is generated in single layer graphene by
circularly polarized terahertz laser radiation at normal as well as at oblique
incidence and changes its sign upon reversing the radiation helicity. The
phenomenological and microscopic theories of the observed photocurrents are
developed. We demonstrate that under oblique incidence the current is caused by
the circular photon drag effect in the interior of graphene sheet. By contrast,
the effect at normal incidence stems from the sample edges, which reduce the
symmetry and result in an asymmetric scattering of carriers driven by the
radiation field. Besides a photon helicity dependent current we also observe
photocurrents in response to linearly polarized radiation. The microscopic
mechanisms governing this effect are discussed.
