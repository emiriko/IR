Some S0 and early-type spiral galaxies possess "composite bulges"; in these
galaxies, the photometric bulge -- the central stellar light in excess of the
disk light -- is composed of both a "(disky) pseudobulge", with a flattened,
disklike morphology and relatively cool stellar kinematics, and a rounder,
kinematically hot "classical bulge" embedded within. I speculate that
supermassive black holes (SMBH) in such galaxies may correlate with the
classical-bulge component only, and not with the pseudobulge component;
preliminary comparisons with SMBH masses appear to support this hypothesis.
