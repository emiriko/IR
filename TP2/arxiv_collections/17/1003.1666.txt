In the orbitally ordered, quasi-one dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet
KCuF3 the low-energy Eg and B1g phonon modes show an anomalous softening (25%
and 13%) between room temperature and the characteristic temperature T_S = 50
K. In this temperature range a freezing-in of F ion dynamic displacements is
proposed to occur. In addition, the Eg mode at about 260 cm-1 clearly splits
below T_S. The width of the phonon lines above T_S follows an activated
behavior with an activation energy of about 50 K. Our observations clearly
evidence a reduction of the structural symmetry below T_S and indicate a strong
coupling of lattice and spin fluctuations for T>T_S.
