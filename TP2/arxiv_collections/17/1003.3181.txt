In this paper, we mainly study the robust stability of linear continuous
systems with parameter uncertainties, a more general kind of uncertainties for
system matrices is considered, i.e., entries of system matrices are rational
functions of uncertain parameters which are varying in intervals. we present a
method which can check the robust Hurwitz stability of such uncertain systems
in finite steps. Examples show the efficiency of our approach.
