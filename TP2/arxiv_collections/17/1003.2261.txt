The R-matrix method has been used for theoretical calculation of electron
collision with atoms and molecules for long years. The method was also
formulated to treat photoionization process, however, its application has been
mostly limited to photoionization of atoms. In this work, we implement the
R-matrix method to treat molecular photoionization problem based on the UK
R-matrix codes. This method can be used for diatomic as well as polyatomic
molecules, with multi-configurational description for electronic states of both
target neutral molecule and product molecular ion. Test calculations were
performed for valence electron photoionization of nitrogen (N2) as well as
nitric oxide (NO) molecules. Calculated photoionization cross sections and
asymmetry parameters agree reasonably well with the available experimental
results, suggesting usefulness of the method for molecular photoionization.
