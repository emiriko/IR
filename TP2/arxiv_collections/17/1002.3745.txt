We performed density functional studies of electronic properties and
mechanisms of hydrogen transport in Rb3H(SeO4)2 crystal which represents
technologically promising class M3H(XO4)2 of proton conductors (M=Rb,Cs, NH4;
X=S,Se). The electronic structure calculations show a decisive role of lattice
dynamics in the process of proton migration. In the obtained revised mechanism
of proton transport, the strong displacements of the vertex oxygens play a key
role in the establishing the continuous hydrogen transport and in the achieving
low activation energies of proton conduction which is in contrast to the
standard two-stage Grotthuss mechanism of proton transport. Consequently, any
realistic model description of proton transport should inevitably involve the
interactions with the sublattice of the XO4 groups.
