We examine the contributions of various couplings in general ZZH and gammaZH
interactions arising from new physics to the Higgs production process e+e- -->
HZ, followed by the decay of the Z into a charged-lepton pair. We take into
account possible longitudinal or transverse beam polarization likely to be
available at a linear collider. We show how expectation values of certain
simple observables in suitable combinations with appropriate longitudinal beam
polarizations can be used to disentangle various couplings from one another.
Longitudinal polarization can also improve the sensitivity for measurement of
several couplings. A striking result is that using transverse polarization, one
of the gammaZH couplings, not otherwise accessible, can be determined
independently of all other couplings.
