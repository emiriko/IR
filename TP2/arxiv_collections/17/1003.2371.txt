The phase field crystal (PFC) model captures the elastic and topological
properties of crystals with a single scalar field at small undercooling. At
large undercooling, new foam-like behavior emerges. We characterize this foam
phase of the PFC equation and propose a modified PFC equation that may be used
for the simulation of foam dynamics. This minimal model reproduces von
Neumann's rule for two-dimensional dry foams, and Lifshitz-Slyozov coarsening
for wet foams. We also measure the coordination number distribution and find
that its second moment is larger than previously-reported experimental and
theoretical studies of soap froths, a finding that we attribute to the wetness
of the foam increasing with time.
