We present an up-to-date catalog of pulsating binaries, i.e. the binary and
multiple stellar systems containing pulsating components, along with a
statistics on them. Compared to the earlier compilation by Soydugan et
al.(2006a) of 25 delta Scuti-type `oscillating Algol-type eclipsing binaries'
(oEA), the recent collection of 74 oEA by Liakos et al.(2012), and the
collection of Cepheids in binaries by Szabados (2003a), the numbers and types
of pulsating variables in binaries are now extended. The total numbers of
pulsating binary/multiple stellar systems have increased to be 515 as of 2014
October 26, among which 262+ are oscillating eclipsing binaries and the oEA
containing delta Scuti components are updated to be 96. The catalog is intended
to be a collection of various pulsating binary stars across the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We reviewed the open questions, advances and
prospects connecting pulsation/oscillation and binarity. The observational
implication of binary systems with pulsating components, to stellar evolution
theories is also addressed. In addition, we have searched the Simbad database
for candidate pulsating binaries. As a result, 322 candidates were extracted.
Furthermore, a brief statistics on Algol-type eclipsing binaries (EA) based on
the existing catalogs is given. We got 5315 EA, of which there are 904 EA with
spectral types A and F. The present catalog has a sortable web version allowing
easy updating and maintenance at http://www.chjaa.org/COB/ .
