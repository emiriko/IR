At low Reynolds numbers, the hydrodynamic interaction between dumbbells
driven by an external rotating field can be attractive or repulsive. Dumbbells
of dissimilar asymmetric shape or different coupling to the external field
undergo conformational rearrangements that break the time reversal symmetry.
The parameter ranges leading to attraction or repulsion are explored
numerically. The results of our simulations suggest that rotating fields may be
a useful avenue for the assembly, disassembly, and sorting of particles of
different shape as well as for the study of collective micro-swimmers.
