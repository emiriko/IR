It is shown that the liquid-gas phase transition exists in one-component
system with potential Yukawa interaction. The value of the critical exponent
$\beta$ of the order parameter is found. The relation between the potential
parameters of Yukawa interaction and critical values of density, temperature
and pressure is obtained. PACS: 51.30.+i: 64.10.+h; 05.70.Ce: 05.70.Fh;
