In this article we introduce the notion of projective isomonodromy, which is
a special type of monodromy evolving deformation of linear differential
equations, based on the example of the Darboux-Halphen equation. We give an
algebraic condition for a paramaterized linear differential equation to be
projectively isomonodromic, in terms of the derived group of its parameterized
Picard-Vessiot group.
