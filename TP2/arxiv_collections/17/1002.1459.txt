Cooper pair sizes are evaluated in a simple harmonic oscillator model
reproducing the values of sophisticated HFB calculations. Underlying reasons
for the very small sizes of 2.0-2.5 fm of Cooper pairs in the surface of nuclei
are analysed. It is shown that the confining properties of the nuclear volume
is the dominating effect. It is argued that for Cooper pair sizes LDA is
particularly inadapted.
