The anisotropy of turbulence in the fast solar wind, between the ion and
electron gyroscales, is directly observed using a multispacecraft analysis
technique. Second order structure functions are calculated at different angles
to the local magnetic field, for magnetic fluctuations both perpendicular and
parallel to the mean field. In both components, the structure function value at
large angles to the field S_perp is greater than at small angles S_par: in the
perpendicular component S_perp/S_par = 5 +- 1 and in the parallel component
S_perp/S_par > 3, implying spatially anisotropic fluctuations, k_perp > k_par.
The spectral index of the perpendicular component is -2.6 at large angles and
-3 at small angles, in broad agreement with critically balanced whistler and
kinetic Alfven wave predictions. For the parallel component, however, it is
shallower than -1.9, which is considerably less steep than predicted for a
kinetic Alfven wave cascade.
