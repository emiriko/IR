We study the string tension as a function of temperature, fitting the SU(3)
lattice QCD finite temperature free energy potentials computed by the Bielefeld
group. We compare the string tension points with order parameter curves of
ferromagnets, superconductors or string models, all related to confinement. We
also compare the SU(3) string tension with the one of SU(2) Lattice QCD. With
the curve providing the best fit to the finite temperature string tensions, the
spontaneous magnetization curve, we then show how to include finite
temperature, in the state of the art confining and chiral invariant quark
models.
