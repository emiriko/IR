The rate of gravitational wave bursts from the mergers of massive primordial
black holes in clusters is calculated. Such clusters of black holes can be
formed through phase transitions in the early Universe. The central black holes
in clusters can serve as the seeds of supermassive black holes in galactic
nuclei. The expected burst detection rate by the LISA gravitational wave
detector is estimated.
