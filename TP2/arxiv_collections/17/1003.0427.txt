Surveys for exoplanetary transits are usually limited not by photon noise but
rather by the amount of red noise in their data. In particular, although the
CoRoT spacebased survey data are being carefully scrutinized, significant new
sources of systematic noises are still being discovered. Recently, a
magnitude-dependant systematic effect was discovered in the CoRoT data by Mazeh
& Guterman et al. and a phenomenological correction was proposed. Here we tie
the observed effect a particular type of effect, and in the process generalize
the popular Sysrem algorithm to include external parameters in a simultaneous
solution with the unknown effects. We show that a post-processing scheme based
on this algorithm performs well and indeed allows for the detection of new
transit-like signals that were not previously detected.
