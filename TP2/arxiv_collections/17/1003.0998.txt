We address the microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation in
Lindblad form for the dynamics of a massive test particle with internal degrees
of freedom interacting through collisions with a background ideal gas. When
either internal or centre of mass degrees of freedom can be treated
classically, previously established equations are obtained as special cases. If
in an interferometric setup the internal degrees of freedom are not detected at
the output, the equation can be recast in the form of a generalized Lindblad
structure, which describes non-Markovian effects. The effect of internal
degrees of freedom on centre of mass decoherence is considered in this
framework.
