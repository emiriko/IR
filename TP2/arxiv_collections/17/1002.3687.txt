In this reply, we point out that the claim by De Zela[2] is unjustified
because the setup he discusses is \emph{not} equivalent to the setup analysed
in our paper[1]. Hence his subsequent argument claiming the reproducibility of
our demonstrated quantum effect of path-spin contextuality by the
Kochen-Specker realist model is \emph{not} relevant.
