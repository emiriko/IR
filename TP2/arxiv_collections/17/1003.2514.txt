By calculating all terms of the high-density expansion of the euclidean
random matrix theory (up to second-order in the inverse density) for the
vibrational spectrum of a topologically disordered system we show that the
low-frequency behavior of the self energy is given by $\Sigma(k,z)\propto
k^2z^{d/2}$ and not $\Sigma(k,z)\propto k^2z^{(d-2)/2}$, as claimed previously.
This implies the presence of Rayleigh scattering and long-time tails of the
velocity autocorrelation function of the analogous diffusion problem of the
form $Z(t)\propto t^{(d+2)/2}$.
