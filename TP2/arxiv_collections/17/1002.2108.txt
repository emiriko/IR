We investigate chain teleportation of a qutrit-state via the non-maximally
two-qutrit entangled channels. For the case of four parties, the efficiencies
of two chain teleportation protocols, the separate chain teleportation protocol
(SCTP) and the global chain teleportation protocol (GCTP), are calculated. In
SCTP the errors are corrected between every step while in GCTP the errors are
corrected only at the end. Furthermore, we present a piecewise global chain
teleportation protocol (PGCTP) for keeping away from the inconvenience of
error-correction of GCTP. We show that PGCTP is more efficient than SCTP.
