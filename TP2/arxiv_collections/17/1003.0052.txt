We have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations in
the F5 star Procyon. The data consist of high-precision velocities that we
obtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. A new method for
adjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the power
spectrum. Stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram reveals
two clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angular
degree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). We interpret a strong, narrow
peak at 446 muHz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixed
character. We show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and their
separations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. In particular,
variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in the
sound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. We list frequencies
for 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a range
comparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints for
theoretical models. A preliminary comparison with published models shows that
the offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes is
very different for Procyon than for the Sun and other cool stars. We find the
mean lifetime of the modes in Procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which is
significantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the Sun.
