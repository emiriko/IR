Graphene is a promising contender to succeed the throne of silicon in
electronics. To this goal, large-scale epitaxial growth of graphene on
substrates should be developed. Among various methods along this line,
epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC substrates by thermal decomposition of
surface layers has proved itself quite satisfactory both in quality and in
process reliability. Even modulation of structural and hence electronic
properties of graphene is possible by tuning the graphene/SiC interface
structure. The challenges for this graphene-on-SiC technology, however, are the
abdication of the well-established Si technologies and the high production cost
of the SiC bulk crystals. Here, we demonstrate that formation of epitaxial
graphene on silicon substrate is possible, by graphitizing epitaxial SiC thin
films formed on silicon substrates. This graphene-on-silicon (GOS) method
enables us to form a large-area film of well-ordered sp2 carbon networks on Si
substrates and to fabricate electronic devices based on the structure.
