Traditional interpretations of quantum theory in terms of wave function
collapse are particularly unappealing when considering the universe as a whole,
where there is no clean separation between classical observer and quantum
system and where the description is inherently relativistic. As an alternative,
the consistent histories approach provides an attractive "no collapse"
interpretation of quantum physics. Consistent histories can also be linked to
path-integral formulations that may be readily generalized to the relativistic
case. A previous paper described how, in such a relativistic spacetime path
formalism, the quantum history of the universe could be considered to be an
eignestate of the measurements made within it. However, two important topics
were not addressed in detail there: a model of measurement processes in the
context of quantum histories in spacetime and a justification for why the
probabilities for each possible cosmological eigenstate should follow Born's
rule. The present paper addresses these topics by showing how Zurek's concepts
of einselection and envariance can be applied in the context of relativistic
spacetime and quantum histories. The result is a model of systems and
subsystems within the universe and their interaction with each other and their
environment.
