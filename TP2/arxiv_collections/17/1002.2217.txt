Using a fully general relativistic implementation of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics with no assumed symmetries in three spatial dimensions,
the dynamics of magnetized, rigidly rotating neutron stars are studied.
Beginning with fully consistent initial data constructed with Magstar, part of
the Lorene project, we study the dynamics and stability of rotating, magnetized
polytropic stars as models of neutron stars. Evolutions suggest that some of
these rotating, magnetized stars may be minimally unstable occurring at the
threshold of black hole formation.
