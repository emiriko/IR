The h-index -- the value for which an individual has published at least h
papers with at least h citations -- has become a popular metric to assess the
citation impact of scientists. As already noted in the original work of Hirsch
and as evidenced from data of a representative sample of physicists, sqrt{c}
scales as h, where c is the total number citations to an individual. Thus
sqrt{c} appears to be equivalent to the h index. As a further check of this
equivalence, the distribution of the ratio s=sqrt{c}/2h for this sample is
sharply peaked about 1. The outliers in this distribution reveal fundamentally
different types of individual publication records.
