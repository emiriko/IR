We show that extended theories of gravity with Lagrangian
f(R,R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}) in the Palatini formulation possess a phenomenology
much richer than the simpler f(R) or f(R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}) theories. In fact,
we find that the scalars R and Q=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} can be written as
algebraic functions of the energy density and pressure of the energy momentum
tensor. In the simpler cases of f(R) or f(R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}) theories, R and
Q are just functions of the trace T of the energy-momentum tensor. As a result,
in radiation dominated universes f(R) and f(R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}) theories
exhibit the same dynamics as general relativity with an effective cosmological
constant. This is not the case of f(R,R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}) models, in which
R=R(\rho,P) and Q=Q(\rho,P) and, therefore, modified dynamics exists even for
traceless sources.
