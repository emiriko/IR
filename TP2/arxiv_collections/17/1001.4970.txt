In the simple vs composite hypothesis test with a proper prior, the Bayes
Factor (BF) is shown to be the posterior mean of the Likelihood Ratio (LR).
Therefore, the posterior standard deviation of the LR or rather its posterior
cumulative density function can be used to indicate the significativity of a
detection by the BF and this detection procedure can be computed from a single
Markov Chain. It is applied and compared for exoplanet detection.
  The previous statistics can be expressed from the Fractional BF (FBF)
\cite{ohagan95} and the Probability distribution of the LR (PLR)
\cite{aitkin97}. Two properties of the PLR related to the GLRT are noted and a
procedure to optimize the PLR and the FBF two-parameters detectors according to
their ROC curves is proposed. The performances of all tests are compared.
