In this note, we address formally the issue of symmetry for probabilities of
different dynamical pathways in the forward and reverse directions of a
conformational transition. Our discussion is based on a decomposition of
equilibrium into opposing steady states, and makes clear the conditions
necessary for symmetry to apply. From a practical point of view, we also
discuss when approximate symmetry is to be expected.
