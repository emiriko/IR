Particular strain geometry in graphene could leads to a uniform
pseudo-magnetic field of order 10T and might open up interesting applications
in graphene nano-electronics. Through quantum transport calculations of
realistic strained graphene flakes of sizes of 100nm, we examine possible means
of exploiting this effect for practical electronics and valleytronics devices.
First, we found that elastic backscattering at rough edges leads to the
formation of well defined transport gaps of order 100meV under moderate maximum
strain of 10%. Second, the application of a real magnetic field induced a
separation, in space and energy, of the states arising from different valleys,
leading to a way of inducing bulk valley polarization which is insensitive to
short range scattering.
