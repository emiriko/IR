Particle sedimentation in the vicinity of a fixed horizontal vortex with
time-dependent intensity can be chaotic, provided gravity is sufficient to
displace the particle cloud while the vortex is off or weak. This "stretch,
sediment and fold" mechanism is close to the so-called blinking vortex effect,
which is responsible for chaotic transport of perfect tracers, except that in
the present case the vortex motion is replaced by gravitational settling. In
the present work this phenomenon is analyzed for heavy Stokes particles moving
under the sole effect of gravity and of a linear drag. The vortex is taken to
be a fixed isolated point vortex the intensity of which varies under the effect
of either boundary conditions or volume force. When the unsteadiness of the
vortex is weak and the free-fall velocity is of the order of the fluid
velocity, and the particle response time is small, the particle motion equation
can be written asymptotically as a perturbed hamiltonian system the phase
portrait of which displays a homoclinic trajectory. A homoclinic bifurcation is
therefore likely to occur, and the contribution of particle inertia to the
occurrence of this bifurcation is analyzed asymptotically by using Melnikov's
method.
