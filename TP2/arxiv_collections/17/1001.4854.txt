The electromagnetic form factors are the most fundamental quantities to
describe the internal structure of the nucleon and the shape of a spatially
extended particle is determined by its intrinsic quadrupole moment which can be
related to the charge radii. We have calculated the electromagnetic form
factors, nucleon charge radii and the intrinsic quadrupole moment of the
nucleon in the framework of chiral constituent quark model. The results
obtained are comparable to the latest experimental studies and also show
improvement over some theoretical interpretations.
