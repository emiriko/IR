This paper presents a bisimulation-based method for establishing the
soundness of equations between terms constructed using operations whose
semantics is specified by rules in the GSOS format of Bloom, Istrail and Meyer.
The method is inspired by de Simone's FH-bisimilarity and uses transition rules
as schematic transitions in a bisimulation-like relation between open terms.
The soundness of the method is proven and examples showing its applicability
are provided. The proposed bisimulation-based proof method is incomplete, but
the article offers some completeness results for restricted classes of GSOS
specifications.
