The paper introduces particle swarm optimization as a viable strategy to find
numerical solution of Diophantine equation, for which there exists no general
method of finding solutions. The proposed methodology uses a population of
integer particles. The candidate solutions in the feasible space are optimized
to have better positions through particle best and global best positions. The
methodology, which follows fully connected neighborhood topology, can offer
many solutions of such equations.
