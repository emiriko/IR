Several multi-pass algorithms have been proposed for Association Rule Mining
from static repositories. However, such algorithms are incapable of online
processing of transaction streams. In this paper we introduce an efficient
single-pass algorithm for mining association rules, given a hierarchical
classification amongest items. Processing efficiency is achieved by utilizing
two optimizations, hierarchy aware counting and transaction reduction, which
become possible in the context of hierarchical classification. This paper
considers the problem of integrating constraints that are Boolean expression
over the presence or absence of items into the association discovery algorithm.
This paper present three integrated algorithms for mining association rules
with item constraints and discuss their tradeoffs. It is concluded that the
variation of complexity depends on the measure of DIT (Depth of Inheritance
Tree) and NOC (Number of Children) in the context of Hierarchical
Classification.
