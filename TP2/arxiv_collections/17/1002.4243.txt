In this paper we discuss some special generalizations of equationally
Noetherian property which naturally arise in the universal algebraic geometry.
We introduce weakly equationally Noetherian, qw-compact, uw-compact, and weakly
uw-compact algebras and then examine properties of such algebras. Also we
consider the connections between five classes: the class of equationally
Noetherian algebras, the class of weakly equationally Noetherian algebras, the
class of uw-compact algebras, the class of weakly uw-compact algebras, and the
class of qw-compact algebras.
