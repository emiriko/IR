If $G$ is the symmetry group of an uncolored pattern then a coloring of the
pattern is semiperfect if the associated color group $H$ is a subgroup of $G$
of index 2. We give results on how to identify and enumerate all inequivalent
semiperfect colorings of certain patterns. This is achieved by treating a
coloring as a partition $\{hJ_iY_i:i\in I,h\in H\}$ of $G$, where $H$ is a
subgroup of index 2 in $G$, $J_i\leq H$ for $i\in I$, and $Y=\cup_{i\in
I}{Y_i}$ is a complete set of right coset representatives of $H$ in $G$. We
also give a one-to-one correspondence between inequivalent semiperfect
colorings whose associated color groups are conjugate subgroups with respect to
the normalizer of $G$ in the group of isometries of $\mathbf{R}^n$.
