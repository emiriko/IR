In this paper, we discuss the energy-momentum problem in the realm of
teleparallel gravity. The energy-momentum distribution for a class of regular
black holes coupled with a non-linear electrodynamics source is investigated by
using Hamiltonian approach of teleparallel theory. The generalized regular
black hole contains two specific parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (a sort of
dipole and quadrupole of non-linear source) on which the energy distribution
depends. It is interesting to mention here that our results exactly coincide
with different energy-momentum prescriptions in General Relativity.
