In this paper we theoretically discuss how quantum simulators based on
trapped cold bosons in optical lattices can explore the grand-canonical phase
diagram of homogeneous lattice boson models, via control of the trapping
potential independently of all other experimental parameters (trap squeezing).
Based on quantum Monte Carlo, we establish the general scaling relation linking
the global chemical potential to the Hamiltonian parameters of the Bose-Hubbard
model in a parabolic trap, describing cold bosons in optical lattices; we find
that this scaling relation is well captured by a modified Thomas-Fermi scaling
behavior - corrected for quantum fluctuations - in the case of high enough
density and/or weak enough interactions, and by a mean-field Gutzwiller Ansatz
over a much larger parameter range. The above scaling relation allows to
control experimentally the chemical potential, independently of all other
Hamiltonian parameters, via trap squeezing; given that the global chemical
potential coincides with the local chemical potential in the trap center,
measurements of the central density as a function of the chemical potential
gives access to the information on the bulk compressibility of the Bose-Hubbard
model. Supplemented with time-of-flight measurements of the coherence
properties, the measurement of compressibility enables one to discern among the
various possible phases realized by bosons in an optical lattice with or
without external (periodic or random) potentials -- e.g. superfluid, Mott
insulator, band insulator, and Bose glass. We theoretically demonstrate the
trap-squeezing investigation of the above phases in the case of bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, and in a one-dimensional incommensurate
superlattice.
