We present a theoretical and experimental study of the Fiske resonances in
the current-voltage characteristics of "small" Josephson junctions with
randomly distributed misaligned Abrikosov vortices. We obtained that in the
presence of Abrikosov vortices the resonant interaction of electromagnetic
waves, excited inside a junction, with the ac Josephson current manifests
itself by Fiske steps in a current-voltage characteristics even in the absence
of external magnetic field. We found that the voltage positions of the Fiske
steps are determined by a junction size, but the Fiske step magnitudes depend
both on the density of trapped Abrikosov vortices and on their misalignment
parameter. We measured the magnetic field dependence of both the amplitude of
the first Fiske step and the Josephson critical current of low-dissipative
small $Nb$ based Josephson tunnel junctions with artificially introduced
Abrikosov vortices. A strong decay of the Josephson critical current and a weak
non-monotonic decrease of the first Fiske step amplitude on the Abrikosov
vortex density were observed. The experimentally observed dependencies are well
described by the developed theory.
