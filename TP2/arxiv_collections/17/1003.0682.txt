Motivated by recent data from CoGeNT and the DAMA annual modulation signal,
we discuss collider constraints on MSSM neutralino dark matter with mass in the
5-15 GeV range. Such an LSP would be a Bino with a small Higgsino admixture.
Maximization of the DM-nucleon scattering cross section for such a WIMP
requires a light Higgs boson with tan beta enhanced couplings. Limits on the
invisible width of the Z boson, when combined with Tevatron constraints on
Higgs bosons at large tan beta, and the rare decay $B^{\pm} \to \tau \nu$
constrain cross sections to be below $\sigma_n \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-41}
{cm}^2$. This indicates a slight local Dark Matter over-density would be
necessary to explain the CoGeNT excess. This scenario also requires a light
charged Higgs boson, which can give substantial contributions to rare decays
such as $b \to s \gamma$ and $t \to b H^+$.
