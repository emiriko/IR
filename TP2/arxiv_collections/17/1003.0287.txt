We consider two-component integrable generalizations of the dispersionless
2DTL hierarchy connected with non-Hamiltonian vector fields, similar to the
Manakov-Santini hierarchy generalizing the dKP hierarchy. They form a
one-parametric family connected by hodograph type transformations. Generating
equations and Lax-Sato equations are introduced, a dressing scheme based on the
vector nonlinear Riemann problem is formulated. The simplest two-component
generalization of the dispersionless 2DTL equation is derived, its differential
reduction analogous to the Dunajski interpolating system is presented. A
symmetric two-component generalization of the dispersionless elliptic 2DTL
equation is also constructed.
