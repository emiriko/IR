We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed quasar identified
serendipitously in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The object, SDSS
J094604.90+183541.8, was initially targeted for spectroscopy as a luminous red
galaxy, but the SDSS spectrum has the features of both a z=0.388 galaxy and a
z=4.8 quasar. We have obtained additional imaging that resolves the system into
two quasar images separated by 3.06 arcsec and a bright galaxy that is strongly
blended with one of the quasar images. We confirm spectroscopically that the
two quasar images represent a single lensed source at z=4.8 with a total
magnification of 3.2, and we derive a model for the lensing galaxy. This is the
highest redshift lensed quasar currently known. We examine the issues
surrounding the selection of such an unusual object from existing data and
briefly discuss implications for lensed quasar surveys.
