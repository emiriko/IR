A new category of "intrinsic" effects is proposed to be added to the two
already known kinematic and dynamical categories. An example of intrinsic
effect is predicted, its origin source is established, and a scheme of its
experimental detection is proposed. This effect lowers to non-relativistic
values the propagation velocity of a plane electromagnetic wave in a vacuum,
when a time-independent homogeneous magnetic field is superposed over it. This
result, pertaining to the classical Maxwell theory, follows from exact
calculations. A critical remark on gravitational waves' detection is given.
