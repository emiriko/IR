In their Comment [1] Giraud and Combescot point out that the contribution to
the impurity-boson distribution function $\rho_{bi}(x-y)$ of a term we dropped
is not negligible, rather than being negligible in the thermodynamic limit as
we had conjectured. We now agree with them, but nevertheless our results for
$\rho_{bi}$ are highly accurate for large impurity-boson mass ratio $m_i/m$ and
remain qualitatively correct for all values of $m_i/m$ and all values of the
boson-impurity coupling constant.
