We study resonant two-color two-photon ionization of Helium via the 1s3p 1P1
state. The first color is the 15th harmonic of a tunable titanium sapphire
laser, while the second color is the fundamental laser radiation. Our method
uses phase-locked high-order harmonics to determine the {\it phase} of the
two-photon process by interferometry. The measurement of the two-photon
ionization phase variation as a function of detuning from the resonance and
intensity of the dressing field allows us to determine the intensity dependence
of the transition energy.
