The recently proposed dark left-right gauge model, with Z' and W_R bosons at
the TeV scale, is shown to have a simple supersymmetric extension which is
unifiable. Its one-loop gauge-coupling renormalization-group equations are
shown to have identical solutions to those of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model. It also has a rich dark sector, with at least three stable
particles.
