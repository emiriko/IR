We propose a Zernike phase contrast electron microscope that uses an intense
laser focus to convert a phase image into a visible image. We present the
relativistic quantum theory of the phase shift caused by the
laser-electron-interaction, study resonant cavities for enhancing the laser
intensity, and discuss applications in biology, soft materials science, and
atomic and molecular physics.
