In this work, we investigate the characteristics of the spin-singlet state
$\eta_b$ of the bottomonia family via the radiative decays of $\Upsilon(nS)\to
\eta_b+\gamma$. The theoretical estimation of the decay widths is carried out
in terms of the light-front quark model (LFQM). Recently CLEO and BaBar
collaborations have measured $\mathcal{B}(\Upsilon(3S)\to\gamma\eta_b)$ and the
mass of ${\eta_b}$. In terms of the data we fix the concerned input parameters
in our calculations of $\Upsilon(nS)\to \eta_b+\gamma$. A special attention is
paid on the transition of $\Upsilon(5S)\to \eta_b+\gamma$. The BELLE data
showed that the width of $\Upsilon(5S)\to \Upsilon(2S,1S)+\pi\pi$ is two orders
larger than that of $\Upsilon(4S)\to \Upsilon(2S,1S)+\pi\pi$, thus some
theoretical explanations have been proposed. Among them, it is suggested the
inelastic final state interaction (IFSI) $\Upsilon(5S)\to B\bar B\to
\Upsilon(1S)+\pi\pi$ may be a natural one. If so, a similar mechanism also
applies to $\Upsilon(5S)\to B^{(*)}\bar B^{(*)}\to \eta_b+\gamma$, the precise
measurement would serve as a good test whether $\Upsilon(5S)$ possess exotic
components. Our calculation in the LFQM indicates that the rate of the direct
process $\Upsilon(5S)\to\eta_b+\gamma$ is not anomalous compared to
$\Upsilon(mS)\to\eta_b+\gamma (m=1,2,3,4)$, thus if the IFSI does apply, the
rate of $\Upsilon(5S)\to\eta_b+\gamma$ should be larger than the others by
orders.
