A rigorous QED theory of the multiphoton decay of excited states in hydrogen
atom is presented. The "two-photon" approximation is formulated which is
limited by the one-photon and two-photon transitions including cascades
transitions with two-photon links. This may be helpful for the strict
description of the recombination process in hydrogen atom and, in principle,
for the history of the hydrogen recombination in the early Universe.
