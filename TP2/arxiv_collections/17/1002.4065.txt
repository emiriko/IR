Molecular interactions are wired in a fascinating way resulting in complex
behavior of biological systems. Theoretical modeling provides a useful
framework for understanding the dynamics and the function of such networks. The
complexity of the biological networks calls for conceptual tools that manage
the combinatorial explosion of the set of possible interactions. A suitable
conceptual tool to attack complexity is compositionality, already successfully
used in the process algebra field to model computer systems. We rely on the
BlenX programming language, originated by the beta-binders process calculus, to
specify and simulate high-level descriptions of biological circuits. The
Gillespie's stochastic framework of BlenX requires the decomposition of
phenomenological functions into basic elementary reactions. Systematic
unpacking of complex reaction mechanisms into BlenX templates is shown in this
study. The estimation/derivation of missing parameters and the challenges
emerging from compositional model building in stochastic process algebras are
discussed. A biological example on circadian clock is presented as a case study
of BlenX compositionality.
