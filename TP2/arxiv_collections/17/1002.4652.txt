We show how Fermi liquid theory can be applied to ultra-cold Fermi gases,
thereby expanding their "simulation" capabilities to a class of problems of
interest to multiple physics sub-disciplines. We introduce procedures for
measuring and calculating position dependent Landau parameters. This lays the
ground work for addressing important controversial issues: (i) the suggestion
that thermodynamically, the normal state of a unitary gas is indistinguishable
from a Fermi liquid (ii) that a fermionic system with strong repulsive contact
interactions is associated with either ferromagnetism or localization; this
relates as well to $^3$He and its p-wave superfluidity.
