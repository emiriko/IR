In this article our main result is a more complete version of the statements
obtained in {\rm [6]}. One of the important technical point of our proof is an
$\displaystyle L^{2\over m}$ extension theorem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi type, which
is derived from the original result by a simple fixed point method. Moreover,
we show that these techniques combined with an appropriate form of
the"invariance of plurigenera" can be used in order to obtain a new proof of
the celebrated Y. Kawamata subadjunction theorem.
