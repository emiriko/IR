Shot noise encodes additional information not directly inferable from simple
electronic transport measurements. Previous measurements in atomic-scale metal
junctions at cryogenic temperatures have shown suppression of the shot noise at
particular conductance values. This suppression demonstrates that transport in
these structures proceeds via discrete quantum channels. Using a high frequency
technique, we simultaneously acquire noise data and conductance histograms in
Au junctions at room temperature and ambient conditions. We observe noise
suppression at up to three conductance quanta, with possible indications of
current-induced local heating and $1/f$ noise in the contact region at high
biases. These measurements demonstrate the quantum character of transport at
room temperature at the atomic scale. This technique provides an additional
tool for studying dissipation and correlations in nanodevices.
