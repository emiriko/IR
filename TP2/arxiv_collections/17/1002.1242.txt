In this letter we discuss a relevance of the 3D Perfect Bose gas (PBG)
condensation in extremely elongated vessels for the study of anisotropic
condensate coherence and the "quasi-condensate". To this end we analyze the
case of exponentially anisotropic (van den Berg) boxes, when there are two
critical densities $\rho_c < \rho_m$ for a generalised Bose-Einstein
Condensation (BEC). Here $\rho_c$ is the standard critical density for the PBG.
We consider three examples of anisotropic geometry: slabs, squared beams and
"cigars" to demonstrate that the "quasi-condensate" which exists in domain
$\rho_c < \rho < \rho_m$ is in fact the van den Berg-Lewis-Pul\'e generalised
condensation (vdBLP-GC) of the type III with no macroscopic occupation of any
mode. We show that for the slab geometry the second critical density $\rho_m$
is a threshold between quasi- two-dimensional (quasi-2D) condensate and the
three dimensional (3D) regime when there is a coexistence of the
"quasi-condensate" with the standard one-mode BEC. On the other hand, in the
case of squared beams and "cigars" geometries critical density $\rho_m$
separates quasi-1D and 3D regimes. We calculate the value of difference between
$\rho_c, \rho_m$ (and between corresponding critical temperatures $T_m, T_c$)
to show that observed space anisotropy of the condensate coherence can be
described by a critical exponent $\gamma(T)$ related to the anisotropic ODLRO.
We compare our calculations with physical results for extremely elongated traps
that manifest "quasi-condensate".
