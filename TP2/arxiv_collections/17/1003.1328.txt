We analytically calculate weighted azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive
lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan processes, using
transverse-momentum-dependent partonic densities obtained in a diquark
spectator model. We compare the asymmetries with available preliminary
experimental data, in particular for the Collins and the Sivers effect. We make
predictions for other cases of interest in running and planned experiments.
