A deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) study of defects created by
low-fluence, low-energy ion implantation for development of ion-implanted
silicon field-effect transistors for spin-dependent transport experiments is
presented. Standard annealing strategies are considered to activate the
implanted dopants and repair the implantation damage in test
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors. Fixed oxide charge, interface
trapped charge and the role of minority carriers in DLTS are investigated. A
furnace anneal at 950 $\rm ^{o}$C was found to activate the dopants but did not
repair the implantation damage as efficiently as a 1000 $\rm ^{o}$C rapid
thermal anneal. No evidence of bulk traps was observed after either of these
anneals. The ion- implanted spin-dependent transport device is shown to have
expected characteristics using the processing strategy determined in this
study.
