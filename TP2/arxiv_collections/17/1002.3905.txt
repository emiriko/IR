In this philosophical paper, we explore computational and biological
analogies to address the fine-tuning problem in cosmology. We first clarify
what it means for physical constants or initial conditions to be fine-tuned. We
review important distinctions such as the dimensionless and dimensional
physical constants, and the classification of constants proposed by
Levy-Leblond. Then we explore how two great analogies, computational and
biological, can give new insights into our problem. This paper includes a
preliminary study to examine the two analogies. Importantly, analogies are both
useful and fundamental cognitive tools, but can also be misused or
misinterpreted. The idea that our universe might be modelled as a computational
entity is analysed, and we discuss the distinction between physical laws and
initial conditions using algorithmic information theory. Smolin introduced the
theory of "Cosmological Natural Selection" with a biological analogy in mind.
We examine an extension of this analogy involving intelligent life. We discuss
if and how this extension could be legitimated.
