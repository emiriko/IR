To evaluate site quality and to develop multi-conjugative adaptive optics
systems for future large solar telescopes, characterization of contributions to
seeing from heights up to at least 12 km above the telescope is needed. We
describe a method for evaluating contributions to seeing from different layers
along the line-of-sight to the Sun. The method is based on Shack Hartmann
wavefront sensor data recorded over a large field-of-view with solar
granulation and uses only measurements of differential image displacements from
individual exposures, such that the measurements are not degraded by residual
tip-tilt errors. We conclude that the proposed method allows good measurements
when Fried's parameter r_0 is larger than about 7.5 cm for the ground layer and
that these measurements should provide valuable information for site selection
and multi-conjugate development for the future European Solar Telescope. A
major limitation is the large field of view presently used for wavefront
sensing, leading to uncomfortably large uncertainties in r_0 at 30 km distance.
