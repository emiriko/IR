The B2Vn star HR 7355 is found to be a He-rich magnetic star.
Spectropolarimetric data were obtained with FORS1 at UT2 on Paranal observatory
to measure the disk-averaged longitudinal magnetic field at various phases of
the presumed 0.52 d cycle. A variable magnetic field with strengths between B_z
= -2200 and +3200G was found, with confidence limits of 100 to 130G. The field
topology is that of an oblique dipole, while the star itself is seen about
equator-on. In the intensity spectra the HeI-lines show the typical equivalent
width variability of He-strong stars, usually attributed to surface abundance
spots. The amplitudes of the equivalent width variability of the HeI lines are
extraordinarily strong compared to other cases. These results not only put HR
7355 unambiguously among the early-type magnetic stars, but confirm its
outstanding nature: With v sin i = 320 km/s the parameter space in which
He-strong stars are known to exist has doubled in terms of rotational velocity.
