We expose an analysis of the magnetic field distribution in the Abrikosov
lattice of high-kappa superconductors with d-wave pairing in the case where the
critical field is mainly determined by the Pauli limit and the superfluid
currents mainly come from the paramagnetic interaction of electron spins with
the local magnetic field. The result found in frame of the generalized Clem
variational approach is compatible with the recent observation that the form
factor in CeCoIn_5 increases with increasing field and then decreases at the
approach of H_c2. (A. D. Bianchi et al., Science vol. 319, 177 (2008)).
