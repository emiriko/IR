La-doped and Y-doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi2212) compounds
Bi2Sr2-xLax(Ca,Y)Cu2O8+d, which range from the insulator to the deeply
underdoped superconductor, have been studied by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. We have observed that the lower Hubbard band (LHB) of the parent
insulator is gradually shifted upward with doping without significantly
changing the band dispersions, which implies a downward shift of the chemical
potential with hole doping. This behaviour is analogous to Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+d
(Bi2201) and Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 (Na-CCOC) but is different from La2-xSrxCuO4
(LSCO), where the LHB stays well below the chemical potential and does not move
while its intensity quickly diminishes in the underdoped region.
