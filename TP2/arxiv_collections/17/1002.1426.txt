The mechanism behind ferromagnetic exchange interaction in GdN is not well
understood. It has been argued that it can be due to fourth order cross process
of \textit{d-f} mixing and \textit{d-f} exchange. An alternative explanation
suggests an anti- ferromagnetic interaction between Gd \textit{d} and N
\textit{p} induced moments on the rock salt structure which aligns the nearest
neighbor Gd \textit{f} moments ferromagnetically through the \textit{d-f}
exchange. In this paper we present results of Curie temperature in GdN as a
function of carrier density calculated within our multiband modified RKKY- like
exchange interaction. It includes realistic bandstructure of the 5\textit{d}
conduction band as an input for single particle energies. We analyze the
possibility of carrier- mediated ferromagnetism in GdN and also demonstrate a
simple phenomenological model which justifies the role of charge carriers.
