We present introductory considerations and analysis toward computing
applications based on the recently introduced deterministic logic scheme with
random spike (pulse) trains [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 2338-2342]. Also, in
considering the questions, "Why random?" and "Why pulses?", we show that the
random pulse based scheme provides the advantages of realizing multivalued
deterministic logic. Pulse trains are realized by an element called
orthogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel
(intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last
one can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We
propose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Physics Letters A 373
(2009) 1928-1934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian
electrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace
are non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this
idea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as
sources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of
different hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show
that it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases
elements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2
neuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a
logic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power
processing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer
circuitry. It also enables the realization of multi-valued logic, significantly
increasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits
to be transmitted on a single wire.
