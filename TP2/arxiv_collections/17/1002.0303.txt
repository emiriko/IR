We study CP violation and final state interactions between pions and kaons in
B+, B-, B0 and bar B0 decays into K pi pi. The weak transition amplitudes
consist of two terms: the first part is derived in QCD factorization approach
and the second one is a phenomenological long-distance charming penguin
contribution. The final state K pi interactions in S- and P-waves are described
by strange scalar and vector form factors, respectively. These are determined
using a unitary coupled channel model together with chiral symmetry and
asymptotic QCD constraints. The final state interactions are dominated by
presence of the scalar K*0(1430) and the vector K*(892) resonances. We show
that additional charming penguin amplitudes are needed to reproduce the latest
experimental K pi effective mass and helicity angle distributions, branching
fractions and asymmetries obtained by Belle and BaBar collaborations.
