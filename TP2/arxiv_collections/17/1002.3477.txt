A novel operational method for estimating the efficiency of quantum state
tomography protocols is suggested. It is based on a-priori estimation of the
quality of an arbitrary protocol by means of universal asymptotic fidelity
distribution and condition number, which takes minimal value for better
protocol. We prove the adequacy of the method both with numerical modeling and
through the experimental realization of several practically important protocols
of quantum state tomography.
