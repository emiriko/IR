The Sylow graph $\Gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ originated from recent
investigations on the so--called $\mathbf{N}$--closed classes of groups. The
connectivity of $\Gamma(G)$ was proved only few years ago, involving the
classification of finite simple groups, and the structure of $G$ may be
strongly restricted, once information on $\Gamma(G)$ are given. The first
result of the present paper deals with a condition on $\mathbf{N}$--closed
classes of groups. The second result deals with a computational criterion,
related to the connectivity of $\Gamma(G)$.
