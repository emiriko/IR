As compared to load demand, frequent wind energy intermittencies produce
large short-term (sub 1-hr to 3-hr) deficits (and surpluses) in the energy
supply. These intermittent deficits pose systemic and structural risks that
will likely lead to energy deficits that have significant reliability
implications for energy system operators and consumers. This work provides a
toolset to help policy makers quantify these first-order risks. The thinking
methodology / framework shows that increasing wind energy penetration
significantly increases the risk of loss in California. In addition, the work
presents holistic risk tables as a general innovation to help decision makers
quickly grasp the full impact of risk.
