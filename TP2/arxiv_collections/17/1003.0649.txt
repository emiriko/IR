The concepts of separability, entanglement, spin-squeezing and Heisenberg
limit are central in the theory of quantum enhanced metrology. In the current
literature, these are well established only in the case of linear
interferometers operating with input quantum states of a known fixed number of
particles. This manuscript generalizes these concepts and extends the quantum
phase estimation theory by taking into account classical and quantum
fluctuations of the particle number. Our analysis concerns most of the current
experiments on precision measurements where the number of particles is known
only in average.
