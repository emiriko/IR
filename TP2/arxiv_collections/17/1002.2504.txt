The dynamical evolution of squeezing correlations in an ultracold
Bose-Einstein distributed across two modes is investigated theoretically in the
framework of the Bose-Hubbard model. It is shown that the eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian do not exploit the full region allowed by Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation for number and phase fluctuations. The development of non-classical
correlations and relative number squeezing is studied in the transition from
the Josephson to the Fock regime. Comparing the full quantum evolution with
classical statistical simulations allows to identify quantum aspects of the
squeezing formation. In the quantum regime, the measurement of squeezing allows
to distinguish even and odd total particle numbers.
