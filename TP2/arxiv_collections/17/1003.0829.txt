We use two independent methods to reduce the data of the surveys made with
RATAN-600 radio telescope at 7.6 cm in 1988-1999 at the declination of the
SS433 source. We also reprocess the data of the "Cold" survey (1980-1981). The
resulting RCR (RATAN COLD REFINED) catalog contains the right ascensions and
fluxes of objects identified with those of the NVSS catalog in the
right-ascension interval 7h < R.A. < 17h. We obtain the spectra of the radio
sources and determine their spectral indices at 3.94 and 0.5 GHz. The spectra
are based on the data from all known catalogs available from the CATS, Vizier,
and NED databases, and the flux estimates inferred from the maps of the VLSS
and GB6 surveys. For 245 of the 550 objects of the RCR catalog the fluxes are
known at two frequencies only: 3.94 GHz (RCR) and 1.4 GHz (NVSS). These are
mostly sources with fluxes smaller than 30 mJy. About 65% of these sources have
flat or inverse spectra (alpha > -0.5). We analyze the reliability of the
results obtained for the entire list of objects and construct the histograms of
the spectral indices and fluxes of the sources. Our main conclusion is that all
10-15 mJy objects found in the considered right-ascension interval were already
included in the decimeter-wave catalogs.
