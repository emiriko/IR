We present the proposition of an experiment in which the multiphoton quantum
superposition consisting of N= 10^5 particles generated by a quantum-injected
optical parametric amplifier (QI-OPA), seeded by a single-photon belonging to
an EPR entangled pair, is made to interact with a Mirror-BEC shaped as a Bragg
interference structure. The overall process will realize a Macroscopic Quantum
Superposition (MQS) involving a microscopic single-photon state of polarization
entangled with the coherent macroscopic transfer of momentum to the BEC
structure, acting in space-like separated distant places.
