Observational evidence is presented for the merging of a downward-propagating
plasmoid with a looptop kernel during an occulted limb event on 2007 January
25. RHESSI lightcurves in the 9-18 keV energy range, as well as that of the 245
MHz channel of the Learmonth Solar Observatory, show enhanced nonthermal
emission in the corona at the time of the merging suggesting that additional
particle acceleration took place. This was attributed to a secondary episode of
reconnection in the current sheet that formed between the two merging sources.
RHESSI images were used to establish a mean downward velocity of the plasmoid
of 12 km/s. Complementary observations from the SECCHI suite of instruments
onboard STEREO-Behind showed that this process occurred during the acceleration
phase of the associated CME. From wavelet-enhanced EUVI, images evidence of
inflowing magnetic field lines prior to the CME eruption is also presented. The
derived inflow velocity was found to be 1.5 km/s. This combination of
observations supports a recent numerical simulation of plasmoid formation,
propagation and subsequent particle acceleration due to the tearing mode
instability during current sheet formation.
