Kalb-Ramond equations for massive and massless particles are considered in
the framework of the Petiau-Duffin-Kemmer formalism. We obtain $10\times10$
matrices of the relativistic wave equation of the first-order and solutions in
the form of density matrix. The canonical and Belinfante energy-momentum
tensors are found. We investigate the scale invariance and obtain the conserved
dilatation current. It was demonstrated that the conformal symmetry is broken
even for massless fields.
