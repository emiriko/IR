The quantum information approach to many body physics has been very
successful in giving new insight and novel numerical methods. In these lecture
notes we take a vertical view of the subject, starting from general concepts
and at each step delving into applications or consequences of a particular
topic. We first review some general quantum information concepts like
entanglement and entanglement measures, which leads us to entanglement area
laws. We then continue with one of the most famous examples of area-law abiding
states: matrix product states, and tensor product states in general. Of these,
we choose one example (classical superposition states) to introduce recent
developments on a novel quantum many body approach: quantum kinetic Ising
models. We conclude with a brief outlook of the field.
