We study the MSSM in F-theory. Its group is the commutant to a structure
group SU(5) x U(1)_Y of a gauge bundle in E_8. The spectrum contains three
generations of quarks and leptons plus vectorlike electroweak and colored
Higgses. The minimal MSSM Yukawa couplings with matter parity is obtained at
the renormalizable level.
