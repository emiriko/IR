We investigate interference effects of the backscattering current through a
double-barrier structure in an interacting quantum wire attached to
noninteracting leads. Depending on the interaction strength and the location of
the barriers, the backscattering current exhibits different oscillation and
scaling characteristics with the applied voltage in the strong and weak
interaction cases. However, in both cases, the oscillation behaviors of the
backscattering current are mainly determined by the quantum mechanical
interference due to the existence of the double barriers.
