Most developed countries have started the implementation of biometric
electronic identification cards, especially passports. The European Union and
the United States of America struggle to introduce and standardize these
electronic documents. Due to the personal nature of the biometric elements used
for the generation of these cards, privacy issues were raised on both sides of
the Atlantic Ocean, leading to civilian protests and concerns. The lack of
transparency from the public authorities responsible with the implementation of
such identification systems, and the poor technological approaches chosen by
these authorities, are the main reasons for the negative popularity of the new
identification methods. The following article shows an approach that provides
all the benefits of modern technological advances in the fields of biometrics
and cryptography, without sacrificing the privacy of those that will be the
beneficiaries of the new system.
