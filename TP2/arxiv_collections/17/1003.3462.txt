We report measurements of inelastic neutron scattering, magnetic
susceptibility, magnetization, and the magnetic field dependence of the
specific heat for the heavy Fermion compounds Ce$_3$In and Ce$_3$Sn. The
neutron scattering results show that the excited crystal field levels have
energies $E_1$ = 13.2 meV, $E_2$ = 44.8 meV for Ce$_3$In and $E_1$ = 18.5 meV,
$E_2$ = 36.1 meV for Ce$_3$Sn. The Kondo temperature deduced from the
quasielastic linewidth is 17 K for Ce$_3$In and 40 K for Ce$_3$Sn. The low
temperature behavior of the specific heat, magnetization, and susceptibility
can not be well-described by J=1/2 Kondo physics alone, but require
calculations that include contributions from the Kondo effect, broadened
crystal fields, and ferromagnetic correlations, all of which are known to be
important in these compounds. We find that in Ce$_3$In the ferromagnetic
fluctuation makes a 10-15 % contribution to the ground state doublet entropy
and magnetization. The large specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ in this heavy
fermion system thus arises more from the ferromagnetic correlations than from
the Kondo behavior.
