A field known as Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently emerged to help
address the growing challenges of capturing and processing high-dimensional
signals and data sets. CS exploits the surprising fact that the information
contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive
(or random) linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees
have been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals
can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address
similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of
sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise
in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent
results concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement
space, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal
bounds in $\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation
from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for
sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the
probabilistic setting. Our work supports the growing empirical evidence that
manifold-based models can be used with high accuracy in compressive signal
processing.
