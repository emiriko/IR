We argue that the vacuum polarization by the virtual electron-positron pairs
can be measured by studying a Josephson junction in a strong magnetic field.
The vacuum polarization results in a weak dependence of the Josephson constant
on the magnetic field strength which is within the reach of the existing
experimental techniques.
