The Faddeev-Popov determinant of Landau gauge in d dimensions and Coulomb
gauge in d+1 dimensions is calculated in the heat-kernel expansion up to
next-to-leading order. The UV-divergent parts in d=3,4 are isolated and the
counterterms required for a non-perturbative treatment of the Faddeev-Popov
determinant are determined.
