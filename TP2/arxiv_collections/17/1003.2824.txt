We use the antenna subtraction method to isolate the double real radiation
infrared singularities present in gluonic scattering amplitudes at
next-to-next-to-leading order. The antenna subtraction framework has been
successfully applied to the calculation of NNLO corrections to the 3-jet cross
section and related event shape distributions in electron-positron
annihilation. Here we consider processes with two coloured particles in the
initial state, and in particular two-jet production at hadron colliders such as
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We construct a subtraction term that describes
the single and double unresolved contributions from the six-gluon tree-level
process using antenna functions with initial state partons and show numerically
that the subtraction term correctly approximates the matrix elements in the
various single and double unresolved configurations.
