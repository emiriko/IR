This paper contains details of calculation of the surface wave excitation by
a fast moving charged particle in a thin uniform metal film surrounded by a
dielectic medium. Early on the effect was described in the paper
arXiv:0911.0565 03 November 2009. It is shown that the Vavilov-Cherenkov like
effect for the surface waves could arise for particles whose velocities are
ten- and even hundred-times lower than the corresponding velocities in a
uniform medium.
