We show, using detailed numerical analysis and theoretical arguments, that
the normalized participation number of the stationary solutions of disordered
nonlinear lattices obeys a one-parameter scaling law. Our approach opens a new
way to investigate the interplay of Anderson localization and nonlinearity
based on the powerful ideas of scaling theory.
