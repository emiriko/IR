We review the experimental searches on those interactions where the
fundamental particles could exhibit a non point-like behavior. In particular we
focus on the QED reaction measuring the differential cross sections for the
process $ \EEGG $ at energies from sqrt{s} =55 GeV to 207 GeV using the data
collected with the VENUS, TOPAZ, ALEPH, DELPHI L3 and OPAL from 1989 to 2003.
The global fit to the data is 5 standard deviations away from the standard
model expectation for the hypothesis of an excited state of the electron,
corresponding to the cut-off scale Lambda =12.5 TeV. Assuming that this cut-off
scale restricts the characteristic size of QED interaction to 15.7x10^{-18} cm,
we perform an effort to assign in a semi-mechanical way all available
properties of fundamental particles to a hypothetical classical object. Such
object can be modeled as a classical gyroscope consisted of a non rotating
inner massive kernel surrounded by an outer rotating massive layer equipped
with charged sorted in a way to match the charge contents for different
interactions. The model size of an electron agrees with 1.86x10^{-17} cm with
the experiment. The introduction of a particle like structure related to
gravity allows to estimate the inner mass kernel of an electron to 1.7x10^{-19}
cm and the mass of a scaler to 154 GeV. The extension of the model to
electrical charged particle-like structure in nonlinear electrodynamics coupled
to General Relativity confirms the model in the global geometrical structure of
mass and field distribution.
