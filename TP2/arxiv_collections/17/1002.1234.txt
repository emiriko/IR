It is not always possible to diagonalize the optical $ABCD$ matrix, but it
can be brought into one of the four Wigner matrices by a similarity
transformation. It is shown that the four Wigner matrices can be combined into
one matrix with four branches. This result is illustrated in terms of optical
activities, laser cavities, and multilayer optics.
