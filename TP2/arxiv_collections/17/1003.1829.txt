After briefly introducing the framework of QCD factorization for B-> M1 M2 in
the language of the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we firstly address the
recent efforts on higher-order radiative corrections in QCD factorization. Then
we discuss some phenomenologies in B-> V V within the framework of QCD
factorization.
