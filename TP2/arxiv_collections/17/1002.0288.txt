We present H- and Ks-band imaging of three fields at the centre of 30 Doradus
in the Large Magellanic Cloud, obtained as part of the Science Demonstration
programme with the Multi-conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator (MAD) at the
Very Large Telescope. Strehl ratios of 15-30% were achieved in the Ks-band,
yielding near-infrared images of this dense and complex region at unprecedented
angular resolution at these wavelengths. The MAD data are used to construct a
near-infrared luminosity profile for R136, the cluster at the core of 30 Dor.
Using cluster profiles of the form used by Elson et al., we find the surface
brightness can be fit by a relatively shallow power-law function
(gamma~1.5-1.7) over the full extent of the MAD data, which extends to a radius
of ~40" (~10pc). We do not see compelling evidence for a break in the
luminosity profile as seen in optical data in the literature, arguing that
cluster asymmetries are the dominant source, although extinction effects and
stars from nearby triggered star-formation likely also contribute. These
results highlight the need to consider cluster asymmetries and multiple spatial
components in interpretation of the luminosity profiles of distant unresolved
clusters. We also investigate seven candidate young stellar objects reported by
Gruendl & Chu from Spitzer observations, six of which have apparent
counterparts in the MAD images. The most interesting of these (GC09:
053839.24-690552.3) appears related to a striking bow-shock--like feature,
orientated away from both R136 and the Wolf-Rayet star Brey 75, at distances of
19.5" and 8" (4.7 and 1.9pc in projection), respectively.
