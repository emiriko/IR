Masses and decay constants of the scalar quarkonia, $\chi_{Q0} (Q=b,c)$ with
quantum numbers $I^G(J^{PC})=0^{+}(0^{++})$ are calculated in the framework of
the QCD sum rules approach both in vacuum and finite temperature. The masses
and decay constants remain unchanged up to $T\simeq100~MeV$ but they start to
diminish with increasing the temperature after this point. At near the critic
or deconfinement temperature, the decay constants reach approximately to 25% of
their values in vacuum, while the masses are decreased about 6% and 23% for
bottom and charm cases, respectively. The results at zero temperature are in a
good consistency with the existing experimental values and predictions of the
other nonperturbative approaches. Our predictions on the decay constants in
vacuum as well as the behavior of the masses and decay constants with respect
to the temperature can be checked in the future experiments.
