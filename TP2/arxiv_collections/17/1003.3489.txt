We study two coupling constants reported as predictions of the sigma model.
We obtain an spectral distribution, in terms of the \sigma meson regularized
self- energy in one loop order, which is consistently with the Breit-Wigner
distribution, converging to values of mass and width of this scalar resonance
given in the experimental results reported by the E791 Collaboration at
Fermilab and BES Collaboration at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. We
conclude that the sigma meson mass is restricted to be on the range 453MeV <
m\sigma < 490MeV and its width 238MeV-354MeV or 354MeV < m\sigma < 415MeV and
its width 167.5 < \Gamma\sigma < 347MeV MeV.
