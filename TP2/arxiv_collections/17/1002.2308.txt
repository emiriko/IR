As an extension of our previous work concerning the large N reduction on
group manifolds, we study the large N reduction on coset spaces. We show that
large N field theories on coset spaces are described by certain corresponding
matrix models. We also construct Chern-Simons-like theories on group manifolds
and coset spaces, and give their reduced models.
