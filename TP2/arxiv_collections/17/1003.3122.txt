Given any possibly unbounded, locally finite link, we show that there exists
a smooth diffeomorphism transforming this link into a set of stream (or vortex)
lines of a vector field that solves the steady incompressible Euler equation in
$\mathbb{R}^3$. Furthermore, the diffeomorphism can be chosen arbitrarily close
to the identity in any $C^r$ norm.
