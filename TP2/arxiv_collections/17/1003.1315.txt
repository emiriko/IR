For many expensive deterministic computer simulators, the outputs do not have
replication error and the desired metamodel (or statistical emulator) is an
interpolator of the observed data. Realizations of Gaussian spatial processes
(GP) are commonly used to model such simulator outputs. Fitting a GP model to
$n$ data points requires the computation of the inverse and determinant of $n
\times n$ correlation matrices, $R$, that are sometimes computationally
unstable due to near-singularity of $R$. This happens if any pair of design
points are very close together in the input space. The popular approach to
overcome near-singularity is to introduce a small nugget (or jitter) parameter
in the model that is estimated along with other model parameters. The inclusion
of a nugget in the model often causes unnecessary over-smoothing of the data.
In this paper, we propose a lower bound on the nugget that minimizes the
over-smoothing and an iterative regularization approach to construct a
predictor that further improves the interpolation accuracy. We also show that
the proposed predictor converges to the GP interpolator.
