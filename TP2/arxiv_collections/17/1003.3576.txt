We use Sidon sets to present an elementary method to study some combinatorial
problems in finite fields, such as sum product estimates, solubility of some
equations and distribution of sequences in small intervals. We obtain classic
and more recent results avoiding the use of exponential sums, the usual tool to
deal with these problems.
