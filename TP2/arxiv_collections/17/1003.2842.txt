In 1971 the memristor was originally postulated as a new non-linear circuit
element relating the time integrals of current and voltage. More recently
researchers at HPLabs have linked the theoretical memristor concept to
resistance switching behavior of TiO(2-x) thin films. However, a variety of
other thin film materials exhibiting memory resistance effects have also been
found to exhibit a memory capacitance effect. This paper proposes a
memadmittance (memory admittance) systems model which attempts to consolidate
the memory capacitance effects with the memristor model. The model produces
equations relating the cross-sectional area of conductive bridges in resistive
switching films to shifts in capacitance.
