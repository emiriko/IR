In the design of quantum computing devices of the future the basic element is
the qubit. It is a two-level quantum system which may describe population
transfer from one steady-state to another controlled by a coherent laser field.
A four-dimensional real-variable differential equation model is constructed
from the complex-valued two-level model describing the wave function of the
system. The state transition matrix of the model is constructed via the
Wei-Norman technique and Lie algebraic methodology. The idea of parametrization
using flatness-based control, is applied to construct feasible input--output
pairs of the model. This input drives the state of the system from the given
initial state to the given final state in a finite time producing the
corresponding output of the pair. The population transfer is obtained by
nullifying part of the state vector via careful selection of the parameter
functions. A preliminary simulation study completes the paper.
