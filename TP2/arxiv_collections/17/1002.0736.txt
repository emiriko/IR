We report the first observation of axisymmetric solitary waves on the surface
of a cylindrical magnetic fluid layer surrounding a current-carrying metallic
tube. According to the ratio between the magnetic and capillary forces, both
elevation and depression solitary waves are observed with profiles in good
agreement with theoretical predictions based on the magnetic analogue of the
Korteweg-deVries equation. We also report the first measurements of the
velocity and the dispersion relation of axisymmetric linear waves propagating
on the cylindrical ferrofluid layer that are found in good agreement with
theoretical predictions.
