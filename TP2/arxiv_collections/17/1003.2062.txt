Models of covariant linear electromagnetic constitutive relations are
formulated that have wide applicability to the computation of susceptibility
tensors for dispersive and inhomogeneous media. A perturbative framework is
used to derive a linear constitutive relation for a globally neutral plasma
enabling one to describe in this context a generalized Landau damping mechanism
for non-stationary inhomogeneous plasma states.
