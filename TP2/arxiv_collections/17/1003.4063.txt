Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a dedicated short range
communication technology. The term RFID is used to describe various
technologies that use radio waves to automatically identify people or objects.
RFID is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using RFID tag. Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been attracting considerable
attention with the expectation of improved supply chain visibility for consumer
goods, apparel, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as retailers and
government procurement agencies. RFID technology is used today in many
applications, including security and access control, transportation and supply
chain tracking. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is now at the centre stage of
Manufacturing and service organizations. According to the strategies in
markets, supply chains and logistics are naturally being modelled as
distributed systems. The economic importance has motivated both private
companies and academic researchers to pursue the use of operations research and
management service tools to improve the efficiency of Transportation. Referring
to such scenario, in this work RFID Technique adopted with hybrid algorithm to
optimize supply chain distribution network.
