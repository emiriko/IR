This talk presents conclusions for KM3NeT which may be drawn from latest
IceCube results and from optimization studies of the IceCube configuration. It
discusses possible coordinated efforts between IceCube and KM3NeT (or, for the
time being, IceCube and ANTARES). Finally, it lists ideas for formal relations
between neutrino telescopes on the cubic kilometer scale.
