We consider the long-time behaviour of spherically symmetric solutions in the
Einstein-Skyrme model. Using nonlinear perturbation analysis we obtain the
leading order estimation of the tail in the topologically trivial sector (B =
0) of the model. We show that solutions starting from small compactly supported
initial data decay as 1/t^4 at future timelike infinity and as 1/u^2 at future
null infinity. We also verified that long-time behaviour for the tail in
Einstein-Skyrme model is exactly the same as it was obtained for wave maps.
