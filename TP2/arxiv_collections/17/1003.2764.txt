The dynamics of charge qubits coupled to a nanomechanical resonator under
influence of both a phonon bath in contact with the resonator and irreversible
decay of the qubits is considered. The focus of our analysis is devoted to
multi partite entanglement and the effects arising from the coupling to the
reservoir. It is shown that despite losses, entanglement formation may still
persist for relatively long times and it is especially robust against
temperature dependence of the reservoir. Together with control of system
parameters, the system may therefore be especially suited for quantum
information processing. Furthermore, our results shed light on the evolution of
open quantum many-body systems. For instance, due to intrinsic qubit-qubit
couplings our model is related to a driven XY spin model.
