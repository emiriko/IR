In this work we illustrate the POWHEG BOX, a general computer code framework
for implementing NLO calculations in shower Monte Carlo programs according to
the POWHEG method. Aim of this work is to provide an illustration of the needed
theoretical ingredients, a view of how the code is organized and a description
of what a user should provide in order to use it.
