Relativistic electrons in a structured medium generate radiative losses such
as Cherenkov and transition radiation that act as a virtual light source,
coupling to the photonic densities of states. The effect is most pronounced
when the imaginary part of the dielectric function is zero, a regime where in a
non-retarded treatment no loss or coupling can occur. Maps of the resultant
energy losses as a sub-5nm electron probe scans across finite waveguide
structures reveal spatial distributions of optical modes in a spectral domain
ranging from near-infrared to far ultraviolet.
