We exploit the non-dissipative dynamics of a pair of electrons in a large
square quantum dot to perform singlet-triplet spin measurement through a single
charge detection and show how this may be used for entanglement swapping and
teleportation. The method is also used to generate the AKLT ground state, a
further resource for quantum computation. We justify, and derive analytic
results for, an effective charge-spin Hamiltonian which is valid over a wide
range of parameters and agrees well with exact numerical results of a realistic
effective-mass model. Our analysis also indicates that the method is robust to
choice of dot-size and initialization errors, as well as decoherence introduced
by the hyperfine interaction.
