Coloration of a Ti target under its ablation with picosecond laser pulses in
liquids is ascribed to the formation of self-organized nanostructures. The
density of nanostructures increases in an avalanche-like way with the number of
laser pulses. The Raman peaks observed in the laser-exposed areas may be due to
the auto-SERS effect.
