We present a large scale survey of life-times for spontaneous fission in the
regime of super-heavy elements (SHE), i.e. nuclei with Z=104-122. This is done
on the basis of the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model. The axially symmetric fission
path is computed using a quadrupole constraint. Self-consistent cranking is
used for the collective masses and associated quantum corrections. The actual
tunneling probability is estimated by the WKB approximation. Three typical
Skyrme forces are used to explore the sensitivity of the results. Benchmarks in
the regime Z=104-108 show an acceptable agreement. The general systematics
reflects nicely the islands of shell stabilization and the crossover from
$\alpha$-decay to fission for the decay chains from the region of Z/N=118/176.
