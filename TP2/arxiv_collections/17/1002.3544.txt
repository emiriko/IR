The standard Pirogov -- Sinai theory is generalized to the class of models
with two modes of interaction: longitudinal and transversal. Under rather
general assumptions about the longitudinal interaction and for one specific
form of the transversal interaction it is proved that such system has a variety
of phase transitions at any temperature: the parameter which plays the role of
inverse temperature is the strength of the transversal interaction. The
concrete examples of such systems are $(1+1)$-dimensional models.
