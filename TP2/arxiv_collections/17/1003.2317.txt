A short overview is presented of current issues concerning the production and
evolution of Li, Be and B in the Milky Way. In particular, the observed
"primary-like" evolution of Be is re-assessed in the light of a novel idea: it
is argued that Galactic Cosmic Rays are accelerated from the wind material of
rotating massive stars, hit by the forward shock of the subsequent supernova
explosions. The pre-galactic levels of both Li isotopes remain controversial at
present, making it difficult to predict their Galactic evolution. A
quantitative estimate is provided of the contributions of various candidate
sources to the solar abundance of Li.
