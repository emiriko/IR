Recently, a new probabilistic "data fusion" framework based on Bayesian
principles has been developed on JET and W7-AS. The Bayesian analysis framework
folds in uncertainties and inter-dependencies in the diagnostic data and signal
forward-models, together with prior knowledge of the state of the plasma, to
yield predictions of internal magnetic structure. A feature of the framework,
known as MINERVA (J. Svensson, A. Werner, Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion
50, 085022, 2008), is the inference of magnetic flux surfaces without the use
of a force balance model. We discuss results from a new project to develop
Bayesian inversion tools that aim to (1) distinguish between competing
equilibrium theories, which capture different physics, using the MAST spherical
tokamak; and (2) test the predictions of MHD theory, particularly mode
structure, using the H-1 Heliac.
