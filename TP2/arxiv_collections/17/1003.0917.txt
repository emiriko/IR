Generalizing a result of Yoshinaga in dimension 3, we show that a central
hyperplane arrangement in 4-space is free exactly if its restriction with
multiplicities to a fixed hyperplane of the arrangement is free and its reduced
characteristic polynomial equals the characteristic polynomial of this
restriction. We show that the same statement holds true in any dimension when
imposing certain tameness hypotheses.
