R-function theory of Thomas used in study of inelastic scattering of neutrons
to a definite state. Onset of fluctuations, effects of randomness of phases of
interfering amplitudes, and variations in statistical distributions of neutron
widths considered in detail. Fluctuations exhibit well-defined maxima and sharp
minima. For certain adjacent resonances, strong interference effects are
predicted.
