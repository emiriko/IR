We construct a multimetric gravity theory containing N >= 3 copies of
standard model matter and a corresponding number of metrics. In the Newtonian
limit, this theory generates attractive gravitational forces within each matter
sector, and repulsive forces of the same strength between matter from different
sectors. This result demonstrates that the recently proven no-go theorem that
forbids gravity theories of this type in N = 2 cannot be extended beyond the
bimetric case. We apply our theory to cosmology and show that the repulsion
between different types of matter may induce the observed accelerating
expansion of the universe. In this way dark energy can be explained simply by
dark copies of the well-understood standard model.
