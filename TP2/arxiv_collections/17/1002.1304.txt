The three-dimensional Fermi surface morphology of superconducting
BaFe_2(As_0.37}P_0.63)_2 with T_c=9K, is determined using the de Haas-van
Alphen effect (dHvA). The inner electron pocket has a similar area and k_z
interplane warping to the observed hole pocket, revealing that the Fermi
surfaces are geometrically well nested in the (\pi,\pi) direction. These
results are in stark contrast to the Fermiology of the non-superconducting
phosphides (x=1), and therefore suggests an important role for nesting in
pnictide superconductivity.
