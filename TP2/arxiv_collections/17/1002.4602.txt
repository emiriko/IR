We describe the dynamics of a thin spherically symmetric gravitating shell in
the Reissner-Nordstrom metric of the electrically charged black hole. The
energy-momentum tensor of electrically neutral shell is modelled by the perfect
fluid with a polytropic equation of state. The motion of a shell is described
fully analytically in the particular case of the dust equation of state. We
construct the Carter-Penrose diagrams for the global geometry of the eternal
black hole, which illustrate all possible types of solutions for moving shell.
It is shown that for some specific range of initial parameters there are
possible the stable oscillating motion of the shell transferring it
consecutively in infinite series of internal universes. We demonstrate also
that this oscillating type of motion is possible for an arbitrary polytropic
equation of state on the shell.
