We investigate the thermal Casimir interaction between two magnetodielectric
plates made of real materials. On the basis of the Lifshitz theory, it is shown
that for diamagnets and for paramagnets in the broad sense (with exception of
ferromagnets) the magnetic properties do not influence the magnitude of the
Casimir force. For ferromagnets, taking into account the realistic dependence
of magnetic permeability on frequency, we conclude that the impact of magnetic
properties on the Casimir interaction arises entirely from the contribution of
the zero-frequency term in the Lifshitz formula. The computations of the
Casimir free energy and pressure are performed for the configurations of two
plates made of ferromagnetic metals (Co and Fe), for one plate made of
ferromagnetic metal and the other of nonmagnetic metal (Au), for two
ferromagnetic dielectric plates (on the basis of polystyrene), and for a
ferromagnetic dielectric plate near a nonmagnetic metal plate. The dielectric
permittivity of metals is described using both the Drude and the plasma model
approaches. It is shown that the Casimir repulsion through the vacuum gap can
be realized in the configuration of a ferromagnetic dielectric plate near a
nonmagnetic metal plate described by the plasma model. In all cases considered,
the respective analytical results in the asymptotic limit of large separations
between the plates are obtained. The impact of the magnetic phase transition
through the Curie temperature on the Casimir interaction is considered. In
conclusion, we propose several experiments allowing to determine whether the
magnetic properties really influence the Casimir interaction and to
independently verify the Drude and plasma model approaches to the thermal
Casimir force.
