Quasiparticle interference (QPI) in spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling
microscopy provides a powerful method to detect orbital band structures and
orbital ordering patterns in transition metal oxides. We use the $T$-matrix
formalism to calculate the QPI spectra for the unconventional metamagnetic
system of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with a $t_{2g}$-orbital band structure. A detailed
tight-binding model is constructed accounting for features such as spin-orbit
coupling, bilayer splitting, and the staggered rotation of the RuO octahedra.
The band parameters are chosen by fitting the calculated Fermi surfaces with
those measured in the angular-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy experiment.
The calculated quasiparticle interference at zero magnetic field exhibits a
hollow square-like feature arising from the nesting of the quasi-1d $d_{xz}$
and $d_{yz}$ orbital bands, in agreement with recent measurements by J. Lee
{\it et al.} (Nature Physics {\bf 5}, 800 (2009)). Rotational symmetry breaking
in the nematic metamagnetic state also manifests in the quasi-particle
interference spectra.
