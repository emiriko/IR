We present a magneto-transport study of graphene samples into which a mild
disorder was introduced by exposure to ozone. Unlike the conductivity of
pristine graphene, the conductivity of graphene samples exposed to ozone
becomes very sensitive to temperature: it decreases by more than 3 orders of
magnitude between 100K and 1K. By varying either an external gate voltage or
temperature, we continuously tune the transport properties from the weak to the
strong localization regime. We show that the transition occurs as the phase
coherence length becomes comparable to the localization length. We also
highlight the important role of disorder-enhanced electron-electron interaction
on the resistivity.
