In this paper, we present an experiment to measure the spatial distribution
of cold atoms in a ceramic integrating sphere. An quadrupole field is applied
after the atoms are cooled by diffuse light produced in the ceramic integrating
sphere, thus the shift of atomic magnetic sub-levels are position-dependent. We
move the anti-Helmholtz coil horizontally while keeping the probe laser beam
resonant with the cold atoms at the zero magnetic field. The absorption of the
probe beam gives the number of cold atoms at different position. The results
show that at the center of the integrating sphere, less atoms exist due to the
leakage of diffuse light into the hole connecting to the vacuum pump. The
method we developed in this paper is useful to detect cold atoms in a region
where imaging is not possible.
