We investigate theoretically the dynamics of magnetization coupled to the
surface Dirac fermions of a three dimensional topological insulator, by
deriving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in the presence of charge
current. Both the inverse spin-Galvanic effect and the Gilbert damping
coefficient $\alpha$ are related to the two-dimensional diagonal conductivity
$\sigma_{xx}$ of the Dirac fermion, while the Berry phase of the ferromagnetic
moment to the Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$. The spin transfer torque and the
so-called $\beta$-terms are shown to be negligibly small. Anomalous behaviors
in various phenomena including the ferromagnetic resonance are predicted in
terms of this LLG equation.
