We study the Mott insulator-superfluid transition of ultracold bosonic atoms
in a two-dimensional square optical lattice in the presence of a synthetic
magnetic field with p/q (p and q being co-prime integers) flux quanta passing
through each lattice plaquette. We show that on approach to the transition from
the Mott side, the momentum distribution of the bosons exhibits q precursor
peaks within the first magnetic Brillouin zone. We also provide an effective
theory for the transition and show that it involves q interacting boson fields.
We construct, from a mean-field analysis of this effective theory, the
superfluid ground states near the transition and compute, for q=2,3, both the
gapped and the gapless collective modes of these states. We suggest experiments
to test our theory.
