The purpose of this paper is to come up with a Pilot Wave model of quantum
field theory that incorporates particle creation and annihilation without
sacrificing causality. In some sense, this work echoes the work of Nikoli\'c (I
call "visibility" what he calls "effectiveness"), but in my work I choose
position and visibility as beables, as opposed to field beables that are used
in his.
