We demonstrate how one can choose the smoothing parameter in image denoising
by a statistical multiresolution criterion, both globally and locally. Using
inhomogeneous diffusion and total variation regularization as examples for
localized regularization schemes, we present an efficient method for locally
adaptive image denoising. As expected, the smoothing parameter serves as an
edge detector in this framework. Numerical examples illustrate the usefulness
of our approach. We also present an application in confocal microscopy.
