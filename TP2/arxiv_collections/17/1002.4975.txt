Quantum physics is considered as one of the most remarkable discoveries of
contemporary physics grown during previous century and gradually manifested to
the scientific world such as inventions of laser, the transistor, the electron
microscope, and semiconductor. Teaching of physical science has been stressed
in the National Science Education Standards (NSES) from level K-12 as well as
many state science standards (Gossard, 2000). The objectives of the current
study are to investigate prospective elucidation of the most common learning
difficulties, insufficient teaching strategies and other significant
instructional or conceptual problems encountered by science and engineering
college students at the senior and/or junior level during the instruction of
Quantum Physics. Although conceptual issues about learning and teaching of
Quantum Physics were addressed in the current study, I mainly focused on the
ways the teachers approach teaching it, as well as considerations of how the
classroom environments should function. Keywords: Quantum Physics, Science
Education, Teaching and Learning Science.
