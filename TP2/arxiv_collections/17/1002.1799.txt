We analyze the diffusive transport of Brownian particles in narrow channels
with periodically varying cross-section. The geometrical confinements lead to
entropic barriers, the particle has to overcome in order to proceed in
transport direction. The transport characteristics exhibit peculiar behaviors
which are in contrast to what is observed for the transport in potentials with
purely energetic barriers. By adjusting the geometric parameters of the channel
one can effectively tune the transport and diffusion properties. A prominent
example is the maximized enhancement of diffusion for particular channel
parameters. The understanding of the role of channel-shape provides the
possibility for a design of stylized channels wherein the quality of the
transport can be efficiently optimized.
