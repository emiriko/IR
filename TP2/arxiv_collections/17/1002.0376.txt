We describe the first-principles design and subsequent synthesis of a new
material with the specific functionalities required for a solid-state-based
search for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron. We show
computationally that perovskite-structure europium barium titanate should
exhibit the required large and pressure-dependent ferroelectric polarization,
local magnetic moments, and absence of magnetic ordering even at liquid helium
temperature. Subsequent synthesis and characterization of
Eu$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ ceramics confirm the predicted desirable
properties.
