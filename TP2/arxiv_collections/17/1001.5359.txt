One of the important evidence in a crime scene that is normally overlooked
but very important evidence is shoe print as the criminal is normally unaware
of the mask for this. In this paper we use image processing technique to
process reference shoe images to make it index-able for a search from the
database the shoe print impressions available in the commercial market. This is
achieved first by converting the commercially available image through the
process of converting them to gray scale then apply image enhancement and
restoration techniques and finally do image segmentation to store the segmented
parameter as index in the database storage. We use histogram method for image
enhancement, inverse filtering for image restoration and threshold method for
indexing. We use global threshold as index of the shoe print. The paper
describes this method and simulation results are included to validate the
method.
