Effects of disorder on superconducting properties of noncentrosymmetric
compounds are discussed. Elastic impurity scattering, even for scalar
impurities, leads to a strongly anisotropic mixing of the electron states in
the bands split by the spin-orbit coupling. We focus on the calculation of the
critical temperature, the upper critical field, and the spin susceptibility. It
is shown that the impurity effects on the critical temperature are similar to
those in multi-band centrosymmetric superconductors, in particular, Anderson's
theorem holds for isotropic singlet pairing. In contrast, scalar impurities
affect the spin susceptibility in the same way as spin-orbit impurities do in
centrosymmetric superconductors. Another peculiar feature is that in the
absence of inversion symmetry scalar disorder can mix singlet and triplet
pairing channels. This leads to significant deviations of the upper critical
field from the predictions of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory in the
conventional centrosymmetric case.
