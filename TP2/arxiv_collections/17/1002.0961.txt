The electrochemical processes in energy storage materials are generally
linked with changes of molar volume of the host compound. Here, the frequency
dependent strain response of 1D electrochemically active systems to periodic
electric bias is analyzed. The sensitivity and resolution of these
electrochemical strain measurements are compared to the current-based
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The resolution and detection limits of
interferometric and atomic force microscopy based systems for probing
electrochemical reactions on the nanoscale are analyzed.
