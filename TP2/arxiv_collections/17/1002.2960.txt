Experiments on layered materials call for a study of the influence of
short-range spin correlations on the Mott transition. To this end, we solve the
cluster dynamical mean-field equations for the Hubbard model on a plaquette
with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. The normal state phase diagram as a
function of temperature $T$, interaction strength $U$ and filling $n$ reveals
that upon increasing $n$ towards the insulator, there is a surface of
first-order transition between two metals at non-zero doping. For $T$ above the
critical end line there is a maximum in scattering rate.
