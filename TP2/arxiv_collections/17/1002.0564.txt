The Standard Model of particle interactions is extended to include fermion
doublets (n,e)_R transforming under the gauge group SU(2)_R such that n is a
scotino (dark-matter fermion), with odd R parity. This dark left-right model
(DLRM) treats neutrinos and scotinos in parallel, and has interesting
phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
