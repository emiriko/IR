We present a new signature by which to one could potentially discriminate
between a spectrum of gravitational radiation generated by a self-ordering
scalar field vs that of inflation, specifically a comparison of the magnitude
of a flat spectrum at frequencies probed by future direct detection experiments
to the magnitude of a possible polarization signal in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) radiation. In the process we clarify several issues related to
the proper calculation of such modes, focusing on the effect of
post-horizon-crossing evolution.
