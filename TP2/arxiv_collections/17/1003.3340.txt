HR\,8799 is a $\lambda$ Bootis, $\gamma$ Doradus star hosting a planetary
system and a debris disk with two rings. This makes this system a very
interesting target for asteroseismic studies. This work is devoted to the
determination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked with its
$\lambda$ Bootis nature (i.e., solar surface abundances of light elements, and
subsolar surface abundances of heavy elements), taking advantage of its
$\gamma$ Doradus pulsations. This is the most accurate way to obtain this
information, and this is the first time such a study is performed for a
planetary-system-host star. We have used the equilibrium code CESAM and the
non-adiabatic pulsational code GraCo. We have applied the Frequency Ratio
Method (FRM) and the Time Dependent Convection theory (TDC) to estimate the
mode identification, the Brunt-Va\"is\"al\"a frequency integral and the mode
instability, making the selection of the possible models. When the
non-seismological constraints (i.e its position in the HR diagram) are used,
the solar abundance models are discarded. This result contradicts one of the
main hypothesis for explaining the $\lambda$ Bootis nature, namely the
accretion/diffusion of gas by a star with solar abundance. Therefore, according
to these results, a revision of this hypothesis is needed. The inclusion of
accurate internal chemical mixing processes seems to be necessary to explain
the peculiar abundances observed in the surface of stars with internal subsolar
metallicities. The use of the asteroseismological constraints, like those
provided by the FRM or the instability analysis, provides a very accurate
determination of the physical characteristics of HR 8799. However, a dependence
of the results on the inclination angle $i$ still remains. The determination of
this angle, more accurate multicolour photometric observations, and high
resolution spectroscopy can definitively fix the mass and metallicity of this
star.
