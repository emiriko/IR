Investigation of the oxygen-deficient 112-type ordered oxides of the type
LnBaCoMnO5+\delta (Ln = Nd, Eu) evidences certain unusual magnetic behavior at
low temperatures, compared to the LnBaCo2O5+\delta cobaltites. One observes
that the substitution of manganese for cobalt suppresses the ferromagnetic
state and induces strong antiferromagnetic interactions. Importantly,
NdBaCoMnO5.9 depicts a clear paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic type transition
around 220 K, whereas for EuBaCoMnO5.7 one observes an unusual magnetic
behavior below 177 K which consists of ferromagnetic regions embedded in an
antiferromagnetic matrix. The existence of two sorts of crystallographic sites
for Co/Mn and their mixed valence states favor the ferromagnetic interaction
whereas antiferromagnetism originates from the Co3+-O-Co3+ and Mn4+-O-Mn4+
interactions. Unlike the parent compounds, the present Mn-substituted phases do
not exhibit prominent magnetoresistance effects in the temperature range
75-400K.
