We study the geometry of compact Lorentzian manifolds that admit a somewhere
timelike Killing vector field, and whose isometry group has infinitely many
connected components. Up to a finite cover, such manifolds are products (or
amalgamated products) of a flat Lorentzian torus and a compact Riemannian
(resp., lightlike) manifold.
