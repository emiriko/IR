The region of low neutralino masses as low as (5-10) GeV has attracted
attention recently due to the possibility of excess events above background in
dark matter detectors. An analysis of spin independent neutralino-proton cross
sections $\SI$ which includes this low mass region is given. The analysis is
done in MSSM with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking (REWSB). It is found
that cross sections as large as $10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ can be accommodated in MSSM
within the REWSB framework. However, inclusion of sparticle mass limits from
current experiments, as well as lower limits on the Higgs searches from the
Tevatron, and the current experimental upper limit on $B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$
significantly limit the allowed parameter space reducing $\SI$ to lie below
$\sim 10^{-41}$cm$^2$ or even lower for neutralino masses around 10 GeV. These
cross sections are an order of magnitude lower than the cross sections needed
to explain the reported data in the recent dark matter experiments in the low
neutralino mass region.
