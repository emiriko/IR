We study the additivity property of three multipartite entanglement measures,
i.e. the geometric measure of entanglement (GM), the relative entropy of
entanglement and the logarithmic global robustness. First, we show the
additivity of GM of multipartite states with real and non-negative entries in
the computational basis. Many states of experimental and theoretical interests
have this property, e.g. Bell diagonal states, maximally correlated generalized
Bell diagonal states, generalized Dicke states, the Smolin state, and the
generalization of D\"{u}r's multipartite bound entangled states. We also prove
the additivity of other two measures for some of these examples. Second, we
show the non-additivity of GM of all antisymmetric states of three or more
parties, and provide a unified explanation of the non-additivity of the three
measures of the antisymmetric projector states. In particular, we derive
analytical formulae of the three measures of one copy and two copies of the
antisymmetric projector states respectively. Third, we show, with a statistical
approach, that almost all multipartite pure states with sufficiently large
number of parties are nearly maximally entangled with respect to GM and
relative entropy of entanglement. However, their GM is not strong additive;
what's more surprising, for generic pure states with real entries in the
computational basis, GM of one copy and two copies, respectively, are almost
equal. Hence, more states may be suitable for universal quantum computation, if
measurements can be performed on two copies of the resource states. We also
show that almost all multipartite pure states cannot be produced reversibly
with the combination multipartite GHZ states under asymptotic LOCC, unless
relative entropy of entanglement is non-additive for generic multipartite pure
states.
