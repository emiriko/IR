We present a unified theory of charge and spin transport using quaternionic
formalism. It is shown that both charge current and spin currents can be
combined together to form a quaternionic current. The scalar and vector part of
quaternionic currents correspond to charge and spin current respectively. We
formulate a unitarity condition on the scattering matrix for quaternionic
current conservation. It is shown that in presence of spin flip interactions a
weaker quaternionic unitarity condition implying charge flux conservation but
spin flux non conservation is valid. Using this unified theory we find that
spin currents are intrinsically non linear. Its implication for recent
experimental observation of spin generation far away from the boundaries are
discussed.
