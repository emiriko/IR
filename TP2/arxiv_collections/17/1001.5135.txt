We consider the detection of correlated information sources in the ubiquitous
Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) scheme. We propose a message-passing based
scheme for detecting correlated sources directly, with no need for source
coding. The detection is done simultaneously over a block of transmitted binary
symbols (word). Simulation results are provided demonstrating a substantial
improvement in bit-error-rate in comparison with the unmodified detector and
the alternative of source compression. The robustness of the error-performance
improvement is shown under practical model settings, including wrong estimation
of the generating Markov transition matrix and finite-length spreading codes.
