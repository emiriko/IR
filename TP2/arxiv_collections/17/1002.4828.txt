We investigate the low-temperature electron, lattice, and spin dynamics of
LaMnO_3 (LMO) and La_0.7Ca_0.3MnO_3 (LCMO) by resonant pump-probe reflectance
spectroscopy. Probing the high-spin d-d transition as a function of time delay
and probe energy, we compare the responses of the Mott insulator and the
double-exchange metal to the photoexcitation. Attempts have previously been
made to describe the sub-picosecond dynamics of CMR manganites in terms of a
phenomenological three temperature model describing the energy transfer between
the electron, lattice and spin subsystems followed by a comparatively slow
exponential decay back to the ground state. However, conflicting results have
been reported. Here we first show clear evidence of an additional component in
the long term relaxation due to film-to-substrate heat diffusion and then
develop a modified three temperature model that gives a consistent account for
this feature. We confirm our interpretation by using it to deduce the bandgap
in LMO. In addition we also model the non-thermal sub-picosecond dynamics,
giving a full account of all observed transient features both in the insulating
LMO and the metallic LCMO.
