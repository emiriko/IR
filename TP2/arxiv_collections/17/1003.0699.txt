We compute the spectral densities of $T^{\mu\nu}$ and $J^{\mu}$ in high
temperature QCD plasmas at small frequency and momentum,\, $\omega,k \sim g^4
T$. The leading log Boltzmann equation is reformulated as a Fokker Planck
equation with non-trivial boundary conditions, and the resulting partial
differential equation is solved numerically in momentum space. The spectral
densities of the current, shear, sound, and bulk channels exhibit a smooth
transition from free streaming quasi-particles to ideal hydrodynamics. This
transition is analyzed with conformal and non-conformal second order
hydrodynamics, and a second order diffusion equation. We determine all of the
second order transport coefficients which characterize the linear response in
the hydrodynamic regime.
