We consider a hyperbolic conservation law posed on an (N+1)-dimensional
spacetime, whose flux is a field of differential forms of degree N.
Generalizing the classical Kuznetsov's method, we derive an L1 error estimate
which applies to a large class of approximate solutions. In particular, we
apply our main theorem and deal with two entropy solutions associated with
distinct flux fields, as well as with an entropy solution and an approximate
solution. Our framework encompasses, for instance, equations posed on a
globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold.
