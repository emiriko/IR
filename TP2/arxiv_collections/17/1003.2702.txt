Entanglement witnesses are nonpositive Hermitian operators which can detect
the presence of entanglement. In this paper, we provide a general
parametrization for orthonormal basis of ${\mathbb C}^n$ and use it to
construct projector-based witness operators for entanglement detection in the
vicinity of pure bipartite states. Our method to parameterize entanglement
witnesses is operationally simple and could be used for doing symbolic and
numerical calculations. As an example we use the method for detecting
entanglement between an atom and the single mode of quantized field, described
by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We also compare the detection of witnesses with
the negativity of the state, and show that in the vicinity of pure stats such
constructed witnesses able to detect entanglement of the state.
