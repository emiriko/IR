The paper presents our design of a next generation information retrieval
system based on tag co-occurrences and subsequent clustering. We help users
getting access to digital data through information visualization in the form of
tag clusters. Current problems like the absence of interactivity and semantics
between tags or the difficulty of adding additional search arguments are
solved. In the evaluation, based upon SERVQUAL and IT systems quality
indicators, we found out that tag clusters are perceived as more useful than
tag clouds, are much more trustworthy, and are more enjoyable to use.
