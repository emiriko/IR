According to thermodynamics, the specific heat of Boltzmannian short-range
interacting systems is a positive quantity. Less intuitive properties are
instead displayed by systems characterized by long-range interactions. In that
case, the sign of specific heat depends on the considered statistical ensemble:
negative specific heat can be found in isolated systems, which are studied in
the framework of the microcanonical ensemble; on the other hand, it is
generally recognized that a positive specific heat should always be measured in
systems in contact with a thermal bath, for which the canonical ensemble is the
appropriate one. We demonstrate that the latter assumption is not generally
true: one can in principle measure negative specific heat also in the canonical
ensemble if the system under scrutiny is non-Boltzmannian and/or
out-of-equilibrium.
