We report results on the effect of a non-sharp and disordered potential in
Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIP). Scanning electronic transmission
microscopy is used to measure the alloy profile of the structure which is shown
to present a gradient of composition along the growth axis. Those measurements
are used as inputs to quantify the effect on the detector performance (peak
wavelength, spectral broadening and dark current). The influence of the random
positioning of the doping is also studied. Finally we demonstrate that QWIP
properties are quite robust with regard to the non ideality of the energy band
profile.
