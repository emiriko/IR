A new unifying theory was recently proposed by the author in the publication
"Arrangement field theory - beyond strings and loop gravity -". Such theory
describes all fields (gravitational, gauge and matter fields) as entries in a
matricial superfield which transforms in the adjoint representation of
Sp(12,C). In this paper we show how this superfield is built and we introduce a
new mechanism of symmetry breaking which doesn't need Higgs bosons.
