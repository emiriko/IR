It is shown that one of the causes for tornado is Tornado Lift. At increasing
vortex diameter its kinetic energy decreases to keep the moment of momentum
constant. A kinetic energy gradient of such vortex is Tornado Lift. Evaluation
shows that contribution of Tornado Lift in air lifting in a tornado is
comparable to buoyancy according to the order of magnitude.
