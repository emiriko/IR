CONTEXT: In July 2010 the ESA spacecraft Rosetta will fly-by the main belt
asteroid 21 Lutetia. Several observations of this asteroid have been so far
performed, but its surface composition and nature are still a matter of debate.
For long time Lutetia was supposed to have a metallic nature due to its high
IRAS albedo. Later on it has been suggested to have a surface composition
similar to primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, while further
observations proposed a possible genetic link with more evolved enstatite
chondrite meteorites. AIMS: In order to give an important contribution in
solving the conundrum of the nature of Lutetia, in November 2008 we performed
visible spectroscopic observations of this asteroid at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). METHODS: Thirteen visible spectra have been
acquired at different rotational phases. RESULTS: We confirm the presence of a
narrow spectral feature at about 0.47-0.48 micron already found by Lazzarin et
al. (2009) on the spectra of Lutetia. We also find a spectral feature at about
0.6 micron, detected by Lazzarin et al. (2004) on one of their Lutetia's
spectra. More importantly, our spectra exhibit different spectral slopes
between 0.6 and 0.75 micron and, in particular, we found that up to 20% of the
Lutetia surface could have flatter spectra. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a
variation of the spectral slopes at different rotational phases that could be
interpreted as possibly due to differences in the chemical/mineralogical
composition, as well as to inhomogeneities of the structure of the Lutetia's
surface (e.g., the presence of craters or albedo spots) in the southern
hemisphere.
