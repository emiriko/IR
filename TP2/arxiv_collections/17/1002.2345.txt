We explore spin dependent transport through a magnetic quantum wire which is
attached to two non-magnetic metallic electrodes. We adopt a simple
tight-binding Hamiltonian to describe the model where the quantum wire is
attached to two semi-infinite one-dimensional non-magnetic electrodes. Based on
single particle Green's function formalism all the calculations are performed
numerically which describe two-terminal conductance and current-voltage
characteristics through the wire. Quite interestingly we see that, beyond a
critical system size probability of spin flipping enhances significantly that
can be used to design a spin flip device. Our numerical study may be helpful in
fabricating mesoscopic or nano-scale spin devices.
