We have considered a supersymmetric scenario in which the minimal
supersymmetric standard model is augmented with a right-chiral neutrino
superfield for each generation. Such a scenario can have a lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) dominated by the right-chiral sneutrino state and
the lighter stau as the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). This
can easily be motivated by assuming a high scale framework of supersymmetry
breaking like minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). Due to the extremely small
neutrino Yukawa coupling, the decay of the NLSP to the LSP is suppressed and
consequently the NLSP, here the lighter stau mass eigenstate, becomes stable at
the length scale of the detector. The collider signal in this case consists of
charged tracks of massive stable particles in the muon chamber. Following up on
our earlier studies on neutralino and chargino reconstruction in such a
scenario, we have shown the kinematical information obtained from these charged
tracks allows us to reconstruct the left-chiral tau-sneutrino as well over a
significant region of the mSUGRA parameter space. Two methods for
reconstruction are suggested and their relative merits are discussed.
