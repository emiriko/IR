We show that high quality laser guide star (LGS) adaptive optics (AO)
observations of nearby early-type galaxies are possible when the tip-tilt
correction is done by guiding on nuclei while the focus compensation due to the
changing distance to the sodium layer is made 'open loop'. We achieve
corrections such that 40% of flux comes from R<0.2 arcsec. To measure a black
hole mass (Mbh) one needs integral field observations of both high spatial
resolution and large field of view. With these data it is possible to determine
the lower limit to Mbh even if the spatial resolution of the observations are
up to a few times larger than the sphere of influence of the black hole.
