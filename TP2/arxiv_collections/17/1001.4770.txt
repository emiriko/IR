Even thought a large amount of long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) present
quiescent periods, their origin remains unclear. In this talk, it is shown how
different angular momentum distributions, as a function of the stellar radius),
can lead to neutrino luminosity variability and the possibility of quiescent
epochs in LGRBs.
