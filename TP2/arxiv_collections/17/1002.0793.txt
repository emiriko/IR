Chemical adsorption of atomic hydrogen on a negatively charged single layer
graphene sheet has been analyzed with ab-initio Density Functional Theory
calculations. We have simulated both finite clusters and infinite periodic
systems to investigate the effect of different ingredients of the theory, e.g.
exchange and correlation potentials, basis sets, etc. Hydrogen's electron
affinity dominates the energetic balance in the charged systems and the extra
electron is predominantly attracted to a region nearby the chemisorbed atom.
The main consequences are: (i) the cancellation of the unpaired spin resulting
in a singlet ground-state, and (ii) a stronger interaction between hydrogen and
the graphene sheet.
