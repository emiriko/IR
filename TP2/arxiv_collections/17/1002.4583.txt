We apply the approach of the Google matrix, used in computer science and
World Wide Web, to description of properties of neuronal networks. The Google
matrix ${\bf G}$ is constructed on the basis of neuronal network of a brain
model discussed in PNAS {\bf 105}, 3593 (2008). We show that the spectrum of
eigenvalues of ${\bf G}$ has a gapless structure with long living relaxation
modes. The PageRank of the network becomes delocalized for certain values of
the Google damping factor $\alpha$. The properties of other eigenstates are
also analyzed. We discuss further parallels and similarities between the World
Wide Web and neuronal networks.
