A complete classification is presented of quantum and classical
superintegrable systems in $E_2$ that allow the separation of variables in
polar coordinates and admit an additional integral of motion of order three in
the momentum. New quantum superintegrable systems are discovered for which the
potential is expressed in terms of the sixth Painlev\'e transcendent or in
terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function.
