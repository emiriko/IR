A new potential energy surface for the electronic ground state of the
simplest triatomic anion H3- is determined for a large number of geometries.
Its accuracy is improved at short and large distances compared to previous
studies. The permanent dipole moment surface of the state is also computed for
the first time. Nine vibrational levels of H3- and fourteen levels of D3- are
obtained, bound by at most ~70 cm^{-1} and ~ 126 cm^{-1} respectively. These
results should guide the spectroscopic search of the H3- ion in cold gases
(below 100K) of molecular hydrogen in the presence of H3- ions.
