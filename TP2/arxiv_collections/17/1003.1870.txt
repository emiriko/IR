The dynamics of a tachyon field plus a barotropic fluid is investigated in
spatially curved FRW universe. We perform a phase-plane analysis and obtain
scaling solutions accompanying with a discussion on their stability.
Furthermore, we construct the form of scalar potential which may give rise to
stable solutions for spatially open and closed universe separately.
