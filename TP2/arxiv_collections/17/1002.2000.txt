In detailed microcanonical analyses of densities of states obtained by
extensive multicanonical Monte Carlo computer simulations, we investigate the
caloric properties of conformational transitions adsorbing polymers experience
near attractive substrates. For short chains and strong surface attraction, the
microcanonical entropy turns out to be a convex function of energy in the
transition regime, indicating that surface-entropic effects are relevant.
Albeit known to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit of
infinitely long chains, the adsorption transition of nongrafted finite-length
polymers thus exhibits a clear signature of a first-order-like transition, with
coexisting phases of adsorbed and desorbed conformations. Another remarkable
consequence of the convexity of the microcanonical entropy is that the
transition is accompanied by a decrease of the microcanonical temperature with
increasing energy. Since this is a characteristic physical effect it might not
be ignored in analyses of cooperative macrostate transitions in finite systems.
