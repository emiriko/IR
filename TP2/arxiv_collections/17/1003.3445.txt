We report precise Doppler measurements of seven subgiants from Keck
Observatory. All seven stars show variability in their radial velocities
consistent with planet-mass companions in Keplerian orbits. The host stars have
masses ranging from 1.1 < Mstar/Msun < 1.9, radii 3.4 < Rstar/Rsun < 6.1, and
metallicities -0.21 < [Fe/H] < +0.26. The planets are all more massive than
Jupiter (Msini > 1 Mjup) and have semimajor axes > 1 AU. We present
millimagnitude photometry from the T3 0.4m APT at Fairborn observatory for five
of the targets. Our monitoring shows these stars to be photometrically stable,
further strengthening the interpretation of the observed radial velocity
variability. The orbital characteristics of the planets thus far discovered
around former A-type stars are very different from the properties of planets
around dwarf stars of spectral type F, G and K, and suggests that the formation
and migration of planets is a sensitive function of stellar mass. Three of the
planetary systems show evidence of long-term, linear trends indicative of
additional distant companions. These trends, together with the high planet
masses and increased occurrence rate, indicate that A-type stars are very
promising targets for direct imaging surveys.
