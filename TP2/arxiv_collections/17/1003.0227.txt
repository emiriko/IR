Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD or SSPD) are highly
promising devices in the growing field of quantum information and
communications technology. We have developed a practical SSPD system with our
superconducting thin films and devices fabrication, optical coupling packaging,
and cryogenic technology. The SSPD system consists of six-channel SSPD devices
and a compact Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler, and can operate continuously on
100 V ac power without the need for any cryogens. The SSPD devices were
fabricated from high-quality niobium nitride (NbN) ultra-thin films that were
epitaxially grown on single-crystal MgO substrates. The packaged SSPD devices
were temperature stabilized to 2.96 K +/- 10 mK. The system detection
efficiency for an SSPD device with an area of 20x20 $\mu m^2$ was found to be
2.6% and 4.5% at wavelengths of 1550 and 1310 nm, respectively, at a dark count
rate of 100 c/s, and a jitter of 100 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM). We
also performed ultra-fast BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) field testing and
entanglement-based QKD experiments using these SSPD devices.
