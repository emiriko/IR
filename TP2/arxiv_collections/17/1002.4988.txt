We study the large-scale structure formation in the Universe in the frame of
scalar-tensor theories as an alternative to general relativity. We review
briefly the Newtonian limit of non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor theories and
the evolution equations of the $N$-body system that is appropriate to study
large-scale structure formation in the Universe. We compute the power-spectrum
of the universe at present epoch and show how the large-scale structure depends
on the scalar field contribution.
