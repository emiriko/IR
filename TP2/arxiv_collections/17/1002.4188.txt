We present a theoretical framework for a quantitative understanding of the
full doping dependence of the optical spectra of the cuprates. In accord with
experimental observations, the computed spectra show how the high-energy Mott
features continue to persist in the overdoped regime even after the
mid-infrared (MIR) peak originating from the pseudogap has collapsed in a
quantum critical point. In this way, we reconcile the opposing tendencies of
the MIR and Mott peaks to shift in opposite directions in the optical spectra
with increasing doping. The competition between the pseudogap and the Mott gap
also results in rapid loss of spectral weight in the high energy region with
doping.
