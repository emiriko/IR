A quasi-Keplerian parameterisation for the solutions of second post-Newtonian
(PN) accurate equations of motion for spinning compact binaries is obtained
including leading order spin-spin and next-to-leading order spin-orbit
interactions. Rotational deformation of the compact objects is incorporated.
For arbitrary mass ratios the spin orientations are taken to be parallel or
anti-parallel to the orbital angular momentum vector. The emitted gravitational
wave forms are given in analytic form up to 2PN point particle, 1.5PN spin
orbit and 1PN spin-spin contributions, where the spins are counted of 0PN
order.
