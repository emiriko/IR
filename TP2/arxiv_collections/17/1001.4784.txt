The Chow polytope of an algebraic cycle in a torus depends only on its
tropicalisation. Generalising this, we associate a Chow polytope to any
abstract tropical variety in a tropicalised toric variety. Several significant
polyhedra associated to tropical varieties are special cases of our Chow
polytope. The Chow polytope of a tropical variety $X$ is given by a simple
combinatorial construction: its normal subdivision is the Minkowski sum of $X$
and a reflected skeleton of the fan of the ambient toric variety.
