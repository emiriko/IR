We examine optical V-band light curves in luminous eclipsing black hole X-ray
binaries, using a supercritical accretion/outflow model that is more realistic
than the formerly used ones. In order to compute the theoretical light curve in
the binary system, we do not only apply the global analytic solution of the
disk, but also include the effect of the optically thick outflow. We found that
the depth of eclipse of the companion star by the disk changes dramatically
when including the effect of the outflow. Due to the effect of outflow, we can
reproduce the optical light curve for typical binary parameters in SS433. Our
model with outflow velocity v~3000 km/s can fit whole shape of the averaged
V-band light curve in SS433, but we found a possible parameter range consistent
with observations, such as \dot{M}~5000-10000 L_E/c^2 (with L_E being the
Eddington luminosity and $c$ being the speed of light) and T_C~10000K-14000 K
for the accretion rate and donor star temperature, respectively. Furthermore,
we briefly discuss observational implications for ultraluminous X-ray sources.
