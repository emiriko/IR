Shock modelling predicts an electron density enhancement within the magnetic
precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations of SiO, H13CO+, HN13C and H13CN
toward the young L1448-mm outflow showed an over-excitation of the ion fluid
that was attributed to an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We
re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider
different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed
molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron
density enhancement around L1448-mm.
  We estimate the opacities of H13CO+ and HN13C by observing the J=3\to2 lines
of rarer isotopologues to confirm that the emission is optically thin. To model
the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG)
approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the
observations toward the positions where the over-excitation of H13CO+ has
previously been observed [i.e. toward L1448- mm at offsets (0,0) and (0,-10)],
and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required
for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of
up to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN13C and H13CO+ toward new
positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the
over-excitation of the ions in L1448-mm. From the isotopologue observations, we
find that the emission of H13CO+ and HN13C from the precursor is optically thin
if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an
electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of
H13CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of\le 400 K toward
L1448-mm (0,-10), and possibly also toward L1448-mm (0,0). For compact emission
the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the over-excitation
of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L1448-mm.
  The observed line emission of SiO, H13CO+ and HN13C toward L1448-mm (0,0) and
(0,-10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor
component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the
case of high gas temperatures (\le400 K) toward the (0,-10) offset. The
electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted
lobe of the L1448-mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of
these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the over-excitation
of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic
precursor of L1448-mm.
