We have measured the sub-milli-arcsecond structure of 274 extragalactic
sources at 24 and 43 GHz in order to assess their astrometric suitability for
use in a high frequency celestial reference frame (CRF). Ten sessions of
observations with the Very Long Baseline Array have been conducted over the
course of $\sim$5 years, with a total of 1339 images produced for the 274
sources. There are several quantities that can be used to characterize the
impact of intrinsic source structure on astrometric observations including the
source flux density, the flux density variability, the source structure index,
the source compactness, and the compactness variability. A detailed analysis of
these imaging quantities shows that (1) our selection of compact sources from
8.4 GHz catalogs yielded sources with flux densities, averaged over the
sessions in which each source was observed, of about 1 Jy at both 24 and 43
GHz, (2) on average the source flux densities at 24 GHz varied by 20%-25%
relative to their mean values, with variations in the session-to-session flux
density scale being less than 10%, (3) sources were found to be more compact
with less intrinsic structure at higher frequencies, and (4) variations of the
core radio emission relative to the total flux density of the source are less
than 8% on average at 24 GHz. We conclude that the reduction in the effects due
to source structure gained by observing at higher frequencies will result in an
improved CRF and a pool of high-quality fiducial reference points for use in
spacecraft navigation over the next decade.
