We investigate two recently proposed multivariate time series analysis
techniques that aim at detecting phase synchronization clusters in spatially
extended, nonstationary systems with regard to field applications. The starting
point of both techniques is a matrix whose entries are the mean phase coherence
values measured between pairs of time series. The first method is a mean field
approach which allows to define the strength of participation of a subsystem in
a single synchronization cluster. The second method is based on an eigenvalue
decomposition from which a participation index is derived that characterizes
the degree of involvement of a subsystem within multiple synchronization
clusters. Simulating multiple clusters within a lattice of coupled Lorenz
oscillators we explore the limitations and pitfalls of both methods and
demonstrate (a) that the mean field approach is relatively robust even in
configurations where the single cluster assumption is not entirely fulfilled,
and (b) that the eigenvalue decomposition approach correctly identifies the
simulated clusters even for low coupling strengths. Using the eigenvalue
decomposition approach we studied spatiotemporal synchronization clusters in
long-lasting multichannel EEG recordings from epilepsy patients and obtained
results that fully confirm findings from well established neurophysiological
examination techniques. Multivariate time series analysis methods such as
synchronization cluster analysis that account for nonlinearities in the data
are expected to provide complementary information which allows to gain deeper
insights into the collective dynamics of spatially extended complex systems.
