We explore how the extraordinary properties of Rydberg atoms can be employed
to impact the motion of ultracold ground state atoms. Specifically, we use an
off-resonant two-photon laser dressing to map features of the Rydberg states on
ground state atoms. It is demonstrated that the interplay between the spatially
varying quantization axis of the considered Ioffe-Pritchard field and the fixed
polarizations of the laser transitions provides the possibility of
substantially manipulating the ground state trapping potential.
