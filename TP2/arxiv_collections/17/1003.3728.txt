A Brownian pump in nonlinear diffusive media is investigated in the presence
of an unbiased external force. The pumping system is embedded in a finite
region and bounded by two particle reservoirs. In the adiabatic limit, we
obtain the analytical expressions of the current and the pumping capacity as a
function of temperature for normal diffusion, subdiffusion and superdiffusion.
It is found that important anomalies are detected in comparison to the normal
diffusion case. The superdiffusive regime, compared with the normal one,
exhibits an opposite current for low temperatures. In subdiffusive regime, the
current may become forbidden for low temperatures and negative for high
temperatures.
