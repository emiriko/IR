Recently, spatially inhomogeneous cosmological models have been proposed as
an alternative to the LCDM model, with the aim of reproducing the late time
dynamics of the Universe without introducing a cosmological constant or dark
energy. This paper investigates the possibility of distinguishing such models
from the standard LCDM using background or large scale structure data. It also
illustrates and emphasizes the necessity of testing the Copernican principle in
order to confront the tests of general relativity with the large scale
structure.
