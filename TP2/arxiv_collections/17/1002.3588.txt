In the previous analyses in the literature about the generalized second law
(GSL) in an accelerated expanding universe the usual area relation for the
entropy, i.e. $S={A\over 4G}$, was used for the cosmological horizon entropy.
But this entropy relation may be modified due to thermal and quantum
fluctuations or corrections motivated by loop quantum gravity giving rise to
S={A\over 4}+\pi\alpha \ln({A\over 4})+\gamma, where $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are
some constants whose the values are still in debate in the literature. Our aim
is to study the constraints that GSL puts on these parameters. Besides, we
investigate the conditions that the presence of such modified terms in the
entropy puts on other physical parameters the system such as the temperature of
dark energy via requiring the validity of GSL. In our study we consider a
spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker and assume that the universe is
composed of several interacting components (including dark energy). The model
is investigated in the context of thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium
situations. We show that in a (super) accelerated universe GSL is valid
whenever $\alpha (<)>0$ leading to a (negative) positive contribution from
logarithmic correction to the entropy. In the case of super acceleration the
temperature of the dark energy is obtained to be less or equal to the Hawking
temperature.
