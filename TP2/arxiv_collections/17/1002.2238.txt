We investigate the exact behavior of the energy density of a real massless
scalar field inside a cavity with a single moving mirror executing a resonant
oscillatory law of motion, satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite
temperature. Our results are compared with those found in literature through
analytical approximative methods.
