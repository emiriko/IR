We prove that an Artin-Tits group of type $\tilde C$ is the group of
fractions of a Garside monoid, analogous to the known dual monoids associated
with Artin-Tits groups of spherical type and obtained by the "generated group"
method. This answers, in this particular case, a general question on Artin-Tits
groups, gives a new presentation of an Artin-Tits group of type $\tilde C$, and
has consequences for the word problem, the computation of some centralizers or
the triviality of the center. A key point of the proof is to show that this
group is a group of fixed points in an Artin-Tits group of type $\tilde A$
under an involution. Another important point is the study of the Hurwitz action
of the usual braid group on the decomposition of a Coxeter element into a
product of reflections.
