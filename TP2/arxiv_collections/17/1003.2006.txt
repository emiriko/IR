Superconducting qubits connected in an array can form quantum many-body
systems such as the quantum Ising model. By coupling the qubits to a
superconducting resonator, the combined system forms a circuit QED system.
Here, we study the nonlinear behavior in the many-body state of the qubit array
using a semiclassical approach. We show that sudden switchings as well as a
bistable regime between the ferromagnetic phase and the paramagnetic phase can
be observed in the qubit array. A superconducting circuit to implement this
system is presented with realistic parameters .
