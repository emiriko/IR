In this paper, realistic CPT-symmetric united at substance quark and neutrino
mixing matrices are studied by the idea that they are shifted from respectively
unit and bimaximal benchmark matrices by one new small universal empirical
e-parameter. At leading finite e-approximation quark-lepton complementarity
(QLC) is an exact regularity. Equal solar and atmospheric deviations from exact
QLC constitute one of the main inferences at next to leading approximation.
That universal violation of exact QLC advances the status of the QLC idea; and
the more so, as that deviation from QLC is quantitatively estimated and used
for accurate calculations of lepton mixing angles. Quark and neutrino Dirac
CP-violating phases are determined by the considered quadratic hierarchy
paradigm in flavor phenomenology. Inferences are partly supported by quark
heavy flavor unitarity triangle angles and testable at B-factory and LHC b
experiments. Estimated magnitude of the unitarity triangle gamma-angle concurs
with the quark CP-violating phase to within ~5x10-4. The final quark CKM mixing
matrix in terms of the e-parameter is in excellent quantitative agreement with
world data and suggests a fitting form of neutrino PMNS mixing matrix. The
e-constant implications in flavor phenomenology are considered.
