A Previously traditional methods were sufficient to protect the information,
since it is simplicity in the past does not need complicated methods but with
the progress of information technology, it become easy to attack systems, and
detection of encryption methods became necessary to find ways parallel with the
differing methods used by hackers, so the embedding methods could be under
surveillance from system managers in an organization that requires the high
level of security. This fact requires researches on new hiding methods and
cover objects which hidden information is embedded in. It is the result from
the researches to embed information in executable files, but when will use the
executable file for cover they have many challenges must be taken into
consideration which is any changes made to the file will be firstly detected by
untie viruses, secondly the functionality of the file is not still functioning.
In this paper, a new information hiding system is presented. The aim of the
proposed system is to hide information (data file) within image page of
execution file (EXEfile) to make sure changes made to the file will not be
detected by universe and the functionality of the exe.file is still functioning
after hiding process. Meanwhile, since the cover file might be used to identify
hiding information, the proposed system considers overcoming this dilemma by
using the execution file as a cover file.
