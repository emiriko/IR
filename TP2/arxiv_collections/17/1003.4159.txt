Careful analysis of cluster separability opens a way to a completely new
understanding of preparation and registration procedures for microsystems: they
are changes of separation status. An important observation is that quantum
mechanics does not specify what happens to systems when they change their
separation status. New rules that close this gap can therefore be added without
disturbing the logic of quantum mechanics. Another important observation is
that registration apparatuses for microsystems must contain detectors and that
their readings are signals from detectors. This leads to further restrictions
on measurability of observables, especially for macroscopic quantum systems.
Beltrametti-Cassinelli-Lahti model is used to show how this approach leads to
solution of the measurement problem.
