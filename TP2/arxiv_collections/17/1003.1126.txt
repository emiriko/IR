We report experiments in which the vibrations of a micromechanical oscillator
are coupled to the motion of Bose-condensed atoms in a trap. The interaction
relies on surface forces experienced by the atoms at about one micrometer
distance from the mechanical structure. We observe resonant coupling to several
well-resolved mechanical modes of the condensate. Coupling via surface forces
does not require magnets, electrodes, or mirrors on the oscillator and could
thus be employed to couple atoms to molecular-scale oscillators such as carbon
nanotubes.
