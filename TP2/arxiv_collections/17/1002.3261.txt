We compare the different convergence criteria available for cluster
expansions of polymer gases subjected to hard-core exclusions, with emphasis on
polymers defined as finite subsets of a countable set (e.g. contour expansions
and more generally high- and low-temperature expansions). In order of
increasing strength, these criteria are: (i) Dobrushin criterion, obtained by a
simple inductive argument; (ii) Gruber-Kunz criterion obtained through the use
of Kirkwood-Salzburg equations, and (iii) a criterion obtained by two of us via
a direct combinatorial handling of the terms of the expansion. We show that for
subset polymers our sharper criterion can be proven both by a suitable
adaptation of Dobrushin inductive argument and by an alternative --in fact,
more elementary-- handling of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations. In addition we
show that for general abstract polymers this alternative treatment leads to the
same convergence region as the inductive Dobrushin argument and, furthermore,
to a systematic way to improve bounds on correlations.
