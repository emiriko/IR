We study single-site stochastic and deterministic transforma- tions of
one-dimensional Gibbs measures in the uniqueness regime with infinite-range
interactions. We prove conservation of Gibbsianness and give quantitative
estimates on the decay of the transformed potential. As examples, we consider
exponentially decaying potentials, and potentials decaying as a power-law.
