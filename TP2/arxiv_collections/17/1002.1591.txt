We study heteroclinic standing waves (dark solitons) in discrete nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equations with defocussing nonlinearity. Our main result is a
quite elementary existence proof for waves with monotone and odd profile, and
relies on minimizing an appropriately defined energy functional. We also study
the continuum limit and the numerical approximation of standing waves.
