The log-normal shape of the mass function for metal-poor halo globular
clusters is proposed to result from an initial M^{-2} power law modified
rapidly by evaporation, collisions with clouds, and mutual cluster interactions
in the dense environment of a redshift z~5-15 disk galaxy. Galaxy interactions
subsequently spray these clusters into the galaxy group environment, where they
fall into other growing galaxies and populate their halos. Clusters forming
later in z~2-5 galaxies, and those formed during major mergers, produce
metal-rich globulars. Monte Carlo models of evolving cluster populations
demonstrate the early formation of a log-normal mass function for typical
conditions in high-redshift galaxies.
