We have investigated the interactions of 1 A GeV 56Fe in nuclear emulsion. We
measured the charge and the angular distributions of single and multiple
charged relativistic particles emitted from peripheral interactions. We
investigate a possible new method of separating interactions of electromagnetic
origin. We provide the values of several parameters evaluated in a sample
selected using the classical method, and the method proposed in this paper.
