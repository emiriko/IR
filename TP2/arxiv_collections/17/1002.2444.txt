We investigate three-component (colors) repulsive fermionic atoms in optical
lattices using the dynamical mean field theory. Depending on the anisotropy of
the repulsive interactions, either a color density-wave state or a color
selective staggered state appears at half filling. In the former state, pairs
of atoms with two of the three colors and atoms with the third color occupy
different sites alternately. In the latter state, atoms with two of the three
colors occupy different sites alternately and atoms with the third color are
itinerant throughout the system. When the interactions are isotropic, both
states are degenerate. We discuss the results using an effective model.
