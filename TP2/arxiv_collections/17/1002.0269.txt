Longitudinal sound attenuation measurements in superfluid 3He in 98% aerogel
were conducted at pressures between 14 and 33 bar and in magnetic fields up to
4.44 kG. The temperature dependence of the ultrasound attenuation in the A-like
phase was determined for the entire superfluid region exploiting the field
induced meta-stable A-like phase at the highest field. In the lower field, the
A-B transition in aerogel was identified by a smooth jump in attenuation on
both cooling and warming. Based on the transitions observed on warming, a phase
diagram as a function of pressure (P), temperature (T) and magnetic field (B)
is constructed. We find that the A-B phase boundary in aerogel recedes in a
drastically different manner than in bulk in response to an increasing magnetic
field. The implications of the observed phase diagram are discussed.
