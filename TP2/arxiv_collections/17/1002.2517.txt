The Airy transform is an ideally suited tool to treat problem in classical
and quantum optics. Even though the relevant mathematical aspects have been
thoroughly investigated, the possibility it offers are wide and some aspects,
as the link with special functions and polynomials, still contains unexplored
aspects. In this note we will show that the so called Airy polynomials are
essentially the third order Hermite polynomials. We will also prove that this
identification opens the possibility of developing new conjectures on the
properties of this family of polynomials.
