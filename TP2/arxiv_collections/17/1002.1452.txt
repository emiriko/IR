The cosmic microwave background and the cosmic expansion can be interpreted
as evidence that the Universe underwent an extremely hot and dense phase about
14 Gyr ago. The nucleosynthesis computations tell us that the Universe emerged
from this state with a very simple chemical composition: H, 2H, 3He, 4He, and
traces of 7Li. All other nuclei where synthesised at later times. Our stellar
evolution models tell us that, if a low-mass star with this composition had
been created (a "zero-metal" star) at that time, it would still be shining on
the Main Sequence today. Over the last 40 years there have been many efforts to
detect such primordial stars but none has so-far been found. The lowest
metallicity stars known have a metal content, Z, which is of the order of
10e-4Z_Sun. These are also the lowest metallicity objects known in the
Universe. This seems to support the theories of star formation which predict
that only high mass stars could form with a primordial composition and require
a minimum metallicity to allow the formation of low-mass stars. Yet, since
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, we cannot exclude the existence
of such low-mass zero-metal stars, at present. If we have not found the first
Galactic stars, as a by product of our searches we have found their direct
descendants, stars of extremely low metallicity (Z<=10e-3Z_Sun). The chemical
composition of such stars contains indirect information on the nature of the
stars responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the metals. Such a fossil record
allows us a glimpse of the Galaxy at a look-back time equivalent to redshift
z=10, or larger. The last ten years have been full of exciting discoveries in
this field, which I will try to review in this contribution.
