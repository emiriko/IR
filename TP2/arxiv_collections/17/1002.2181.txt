Collimated ejections of plasma called "coronal hole jets" are commonly
observed in polar coronal holes. However, such coronal jets are not only a
specific features of polar coronal holes but they can also be found in coronal
holes appearing at lower heliographic latitudes. In this paper we present some
observations of "equatorial coronal hole jets" made up with data provided by
the STEREO/SECCHI instruments during a period comprising March 2007 and
December 2007. The jet events are selected by requiring at least some
visibility in both COR1 and EUVI instruments. We report 15 jet events, and we
discuss their main features. For one event, the uplift velocity has been
determined as about 200 km/s, while the deceleration rate appears to be about
0.11 km/s2, less than solar gravity. The average jet visibility time is about
30 minutes, consistent with jet observed in polar regions. On the basis of the
present dataset, we provisionally conclude that there are not substantial
physical differences between polar and equatorial coronal hole jets.
