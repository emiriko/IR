It is conjectured that Hadamard matrices exist for all orders $4t$ ($t>0$).
However, despite a sustained effort over more than five decades, the strongest
overall existence results are asymptotic results of the form: for all odd
natural numbers $k$, there is a Hadamard matrix of order $k2^{[a+b\log_2k]}$,
where $a$ and $b$ are fixed non-negative constants. To prove the Hadamard
Conjecture, it is sufficient to show that we may take $a=2$ and $b=0$. Since
Seberry's ground-breaking result, which showed that we may take $a=0$ and
$b=2$, there have been several improvements where $b$ has been by stages
reduced to 3/8. In this paper, we show that for all $\epsilon>0$, the set of
odd numbers $k$ for which there is a Hadamard matrix of order
$k2^{2+[\epsilon\log_2k]}$ has positive density in the set of natural numbers.
The proof adapts a number-theoretic argument of Erdos and Odlyzko to show that
there are enough Paley Hadamard matrices to give the result.
