We obtain explicit formulas for the number of non-isomorphic elliptic curves
with a given group structure (considered as an abstract abelian group).
Moreover, we give explicit formulas for the number of distinct group structures
of all elliptic curves over a finite field. We use these formulas to derive
some asymptotic estimates and tight upper and lower bounds for various counting
functions related to classification of elliptic curves accordingly to their
group structure. Finally, we present results of some numerical tests which
exhibit several interesting phenomena in the distribution of group structures.
We pose getting an explanation to these as an open problem.
