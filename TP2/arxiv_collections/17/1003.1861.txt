We theoretically study the single electron transfer through two-terminal
quantum ring capacitively coupled to charged dot placed in its center. For this
purpose we solve time-dependent Schrodinger equation for fully correlated
two-particle system constituted by the transferred electron and the second
particle confined in the dot. Analysis of transmission probability dependence
on magnetic field in Ahronov-Bohm effect indicates that the maxima of
transmission probability may be enhanced as well as reduced for attractive or
repulsive Coulomb interaction respectively. The existence of Coulomb
correlation in the system may also lead to inelastic scattering of the
transferred electron. In such case, transmission of electron thorugh the ring
is not completely blocked for (n+1/2) magnetic flux quanta.
