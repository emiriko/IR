Dipole gravitational disturbances from gravitationally unbound mass
quadrupoles propagate to the radiation zone with signal strength at least of
quadrupole order if the quadrupoles are nonrelativistic, and of dipole order if
relativistic. Angular distributions of parallel-polarized and
transverse-polarized dipole power in the radiation zone are calculated for
simple unbound quadrupoles, like a linear-oscillator/stress-wave pair and a
particle storage ring. Laboratory tests of general relativity through
measurements of dipole gravity waves in the source region are proposed. A NASA
G2 flywheel module with a modified rotor can produce a post-Newtonian dc bias
signal at a gradiometer up to 1 mE. At peak luminosity, the repulsive dipole
impulses of proton bunches at the LHC can produce an rms velocity of a high-Q
detector surface up to 4 micron/s. Far outside the source region, Newtonian
lunar dipole gravity waves can produce a 1-cm displacement signal at LISA.
Dipole signal strengths of astrophysical events involving unbound quadrupoles,
like near collisions and neutron star kicks in core-collapse supernovae, are
estimated.
