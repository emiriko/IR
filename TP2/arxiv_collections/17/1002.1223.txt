This paper is devoted to the analysis of an abstract formula describing
quantum adiabatic charge pumping in a general context. We consider closed
systems characterized by a slowly varying time-dependent Hamiltonian depending
on an external parameter $\alpha$. The current operator, defined as the
derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to $\alpha$, once integrated over
some time interval, gives rise to a charge pumped through the system over that
time span. We determine the first two leading terms in the adiabatic parameter
of this pumped charge under the usual gap hypothesis. In particular, in case
the Hamiltonian is time periodic and has discrete non-degenerate spectrum, the
charge pumped over a period is given to leading order by the derivative with
respect to $\alpha$ of the corresponding dynamical and geometric phases.
