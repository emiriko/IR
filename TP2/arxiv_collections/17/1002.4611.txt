We use ACS data from the HST Treasury survey of the Coma cluster (z~0.02) to
study the properties of barred galaxies in the Coma core, the densest
environment in the nearby Universe. This study provides a complementary data
point for studies of barred galaxies as a function of redshift and environment.
  From ~470 cluster members brighter than M_I = -11 mag, we select a sample of
46 disk galaxies (S0--Im) based on visual classification. The sample is
dominated by S0s for which we find an optical bar fraction of 47+/-11% through
ellipse fitting and visual inspection. Among the bars in the core of the Coma
cluster, we do not find any very large (a_bar > 2 kpc) bars. Comparison to
other studies reveals that while the optical bar fraction for S0s shows only a
modest variation across low-to-intermediate density environments (field to
intermediate-density clusters), it can be higher by up to a factor of ~2 in the
very high-density environment of the rich Coma cluster core.
