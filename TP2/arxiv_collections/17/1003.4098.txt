We present the new agegraphic dark energy model by introducing the quantum
corrections to the entropy-area relation in the setup of loop quantum gravity.
Employing this new form of dark energy, we investigate the model of interacting
dark energy and derive its equation of state. We study the correspondence
between the tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar field models with the
interacting entropy-corrected new agegraphic dark energy model in the non-flat
FRW universe. Moreover, we reconstruct the corresponding scalar potentials
which describe the dynamics of the scalar field models.
