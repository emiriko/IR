We study how to protect quantum information in quantum systems subjected to
local dissipation. We show that combining the use of three-level systems,
environment monitoring, and local feedback can fully and deterministically
protect any available quantum information, including entanglement initially
shared by different parties. These results can represent a gain in resources
and/or distances in quantum communication protocols such as quantum repeaters
and teleportation as well as time for quantum memories. Finally, we show that
monitoring local environments physically implements the optimum singlet
conversion protocol, essential for classical entanglement percolation.
