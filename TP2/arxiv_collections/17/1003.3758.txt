Photoabsorption of nuclear gamma-rays in thin metallic convertors was
examined with the aim to produce monoenergetic photoelectrons of kinetic energy
around 18.6 keV and natural width of about 1 eV. Calculations were carried out
for commercial photon sources of 241Am (1.1 GBq) and 119mSn (0.5 GBq)
irradiating Co and Ti convertors. Photoelectrons ejected by 241Am gamma- and
X-rays from Co convertors of various thickness were measured with two
electrostatic spectrometers.
