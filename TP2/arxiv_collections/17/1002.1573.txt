We describe a robust and reliable fluorescence detector for single atoms that
is fully integrated into an atom chip. The detector allows spectrally and
spatially selective detection of atoms, reaching a single atom detection
efficiency of 66%. It consists of a tapered lensed single-mode fiber for
precise delivery of excitation light and a multi-mode fiber to collect the
fluorescence. The fibers are mounted in lithographically defined holding
structures on the atom chip. Neutral 87Rb atoms propagating freely in a
magnetic guide are detected and the noise of their fluorescence emission is
analyzed. The variance of the photon distribution allows to determine the
number of detected photons / atom and from there the atom detection efficiency.
The second order intensity correlation function of the fluorescence shows
near-perfect photon anti-bunching and signs of damped Rabi-oscillations. With
simple improvements one can boost the detection efficiency to > 95%.
