CePt$_2$In$_7$ is a new heavy fermion system with a structure similar to the
CeMIn$_5$ system but with greater two-dimensional character. We report the
synthesis and characterization of phase pure polycrystalline material, which
reveals an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N = 5.2$ K. Nuclear Quadrupolar
Resonance (NQR) studies indicate that the antiferromagnetism is commensurate
and exhibits strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic state.
