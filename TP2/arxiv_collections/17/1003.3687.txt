We have developed a linearly-polarized Ytterbium-doped fiber ring laser with
single longitudinal-mode output at 1064nm for LISA and other space
applications. Single longitudinal-mode selection was achieved by using a fiber
Bragg grating (FBG) and a fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP). The FFP also serves as a
frequency-reference within our ring laser. Our laser exhibits comparable low
frequency and intensity noise to Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO). By using a
fiber-coupled phase modulator as a frequency actuator, the laser frequency can
be electro-optically tuned at a rate of 100kHz. It appears that our fiber ring
laser is promising for space applications where robustness of fiber optics is
desirable.
