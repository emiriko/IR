Recent experiments with high-speed ions have investigated potential
deviations from the time-dilation predicted by special relativity (SR). The
main contribution of this article is to show that the SR predictions are
matched by the experimental results only when the transverse Doppler effect in
the observed emissions from the ions are neglected in the analysis. However,
the Doppler effect in the emission cannot be neglected because it is similar to
the time dilation effect. Thus, the article highlights the need to consider
Doppler emission effects when validating SR time dilation using high-speed ion
experiments.
