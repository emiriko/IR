We shall prove new contraction properties of general transportation costs
along nonnegative measure-valued solutions to Fokker-Planck equations in $R^d$,
when the drift is a monotone (or $\lambda$-monotone) operator. A new duality
approach to contraction estimates has been developed: it relies on the
Kantorovich dual formulation of optimal transportation problems and on a
variable-doubling technique. The latter is used to derive a new comparison
property of solutions of the backward Kolmogorov (or dual) equation. The
advantage of this technique is twofold: it directly applies to distributional
solutions without requiring stronger regularity and it extends the Wasserstein
theory of Fokker-Planck equations with gradient drift terms started by
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (1998) to more general costs and monotone drifts,
without requiring the drift to be a gradient and without assuming any growth
conditions.
