We investigate the ability of frame-invariant amplitude equations [G. H.
Gunaratne, Q. Ouyang, and H. Swinney, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 50}, 2802 (1994)] to
describe quantitatively the evolution of polycrystalline microstructures and we
extend this approach to include the interaction between composition and stress.
Validations for elemental materials include studies of the
Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld morphological instability of a stressed crystal surface,
polycrystalline growth from the melt, grain boundary energies over a wide range
of misorientation, and grain boundary motion coupled to shear deformation.
Amplitude equations with accelerated strain relaxation in the solid are shown
to model accurately the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability. Polycrystalline
growth is also well described. However, the survey of grain boundary energies
shows that the approach is only valid for a restricted range of misorientations
as a direct consequence of an amplitude expansion. This range covers
approximately half the complete range allowed by crystal symmetry for some
fixed reference set of density waves used in the expansion. Over this range,
coupled motion to shear is well described by known geometrical rules and a
transition from coupling to sliding motion is also reproduced. Amplitude
equations for alloys are derived phenomenologically in a Ginzburg-Landau
spirit. Vegard's law is shown to be naturally described by seeking a gauge
invariant form of those equations under a transformation that corresponds to a
lattice expansion and deviations from Vegard's law can be easily incorporated.
Those equations realistically describe the dilute alloy limit and have the same
flexibility as conventional phase-field models for incorporating arbitrary
free-energy/composition curves...
