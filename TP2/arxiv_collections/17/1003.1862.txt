We build a quantum algorithm which uses the Grover quantum search procedure
in order to sample the exact equilibrium distribution of a wide range of
classical statistical mechanics systems. The algorithm is based on recently
developed exact Monte Carlo sampling methods, and yields a polynomial gain
compared to classical procedures.
