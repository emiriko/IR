The fields in multiple-pass interferometers, such as the Fabry--P\'erot
cavity, exhibit great sensitivity not only to the presence but also to the
motion of any scattering object within the optical path. We consider the
general case of an interferometer comprising an arbitrary configuration of
generic `beam splitters' and calculate the velocity-dependent radiation field
and the light force exerted on a moving scatterer. We find that a simple
configuration, in which the scatterer interacts with an optical resonator from
which it is spatially separated, can also significantly enhance the
optomechanical friction.
