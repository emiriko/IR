Many quantum control tasks aim at manipulating the state of a quantum
mechanical system within a finite subspace of states. However, couplings to the
outside are often inevitable. Here we discuss strategies which keep the system
in the controlled subspace by applying strong interactions onto the outside.
This is done by drawing analogies to simple toy models and to the quantum Zeno
effect. Special attention is paid to the constructive use of dissipation in the
protection of subspaces.
