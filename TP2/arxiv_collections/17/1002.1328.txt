A 52MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) linear accelerator (linac) is
designed to serve as an initial structure for the SSC-linac system (injector
into Separated Sector Cyclotron). The designed injection and output energy are
3.5 keV/u and 143 keV/u, respectively. Beam dynamics study in RFQ was done
using 3-dimensional particle-in-cell code BEAMPATH [1]. Simulation results show
that this RFQ structure is characterized by stable value of beam transmission
efficiency (at least 95%) for both zero-current mode and for space charge
dominated regime. The beam accelerated in RFQ has good quality in both
transversal and longitudinal directions, and could be easily accepted by Drift
Tube Linac (DTL). Effects of vane errors and of the space charge on beam
parameters are studied as well to define the engineering tolerance for RFQ vane
machining and alignment.
