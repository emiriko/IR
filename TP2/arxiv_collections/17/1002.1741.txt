We prove a robust extension of the quantum adiabatic theorem. The theorem
applies to systems that have resonances instead of bound states, and to systems
for which just an approximation to a bound state is known. To demonstrate the
theorem's usefulness in a concrete situation, we apply it to shape resonances.
