Unconstrained local Lagrangians for higher-spin gauge theories are bound to
involve auxiliary fields, whose integration in the partition function generates
geometric, effective actions expressed in terms of curvatures. When applied to
the triplets, emerging from the tensionless limit of open string field theory,
the same procedure yields interesting alternative forms of geometric
Lagrangians, expressible for both bosons and fermions as squares of
field-strengths. This shows that higher-spin curvatures might play a role in
the dynamics, regardless of whether the Fronsdal-Labastida constraints are
assumed or forgone.
