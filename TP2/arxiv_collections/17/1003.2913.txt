The present paper is concerned with differential forms on log canonical
varieties. It is shown that any p-form defined on the smooth locus of a variety
with canonical or klt singularities extends regularly to any resolution of
singularities. In fact, a much more general theorem for log canonical pairs is
established. The proof relies on vanishing theorems for log canonical varieties
and on methods of the minimal model program. In addition, a theory of
differential forms on dlt pairs is developed. It is shown that many of the
fundamental theorems and techniques known for sheaves of logarithmic
differentials on smooth varieties also hold in the dlt setting.
  Immediate applications include the existence of a pull-back map for reflexive
differentials, generalisations of Bogomolov-Sommese type vanishing results, and
a positive answer to the Lipman-Zariski conjecture for klt spaces.
