In this paper, the fractional-order Burgers-Poisson equation is introduced by
replacing the first-order time derivative by fractional derivative of order
$\alpha$. Both exact and approximate explicit solutions are obtained by
employing homotopy perturbation method. The numerical results reveal that the
proposed method is very effective and simple for handling fractional-order
differential equations.
