We study the escape of cosmic-ray protons accelerated at a supernova remnant
(SNR). We are interested in their propagation in interstellar medium (ISM)
after they leave the shock neighborhood where they are accelerated, but when
they are still near the SNR with their energy density higher than that in the
average ISM. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we found that the cosmic-rays with
energies of <~TeV excite Alfven waves around the SNR on a scale of the SNR
itself if the ISM is highly ionized. Thus, even if the cosmic-rays can leave
the shock, scattering by the waves prevents them from moving further away from
the SNR. The cosmic-rays form a slowly expanding cosmic-ray bubble, and they
spend a long time around the SNR. This means that the cosmic-rays cannot
actually escape from the SNR until a fairly late stage of the SNR evolution.
This is consistent with some results of Fermi and H.E.S.S. observations.
