Writing requirements is a two-way process. In this paper we use to classify
Functional Requirements (FR) and Non Functional Requirements (NFR) statements
from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents. This is
systematically transformed into state charts considering all relevant
information. The current paper outlines how test cases can be automatically
generated from these state charts. The application of the states yields the
different test cases as solutions to a planning problem. The test cases can be
used for automated or manual software testing on system level. And also the
paper presents a method for reduction of test suite by using mining methods
thereby facilitating the mining and knowledge extraction from test cases.
