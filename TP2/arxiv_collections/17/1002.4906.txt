An orbit following code is developed to calculate ion beam trajectories in
magnetized plasmas. The equation of motion (the Newton's equation) is solved
including the Lorentz force term and Coulomb collisional relaxation term.
Furthermore, a new algorithm is introduced by applying perturbation method
regarding the collision term as a small term. The reduction of computation time
is suggested.
