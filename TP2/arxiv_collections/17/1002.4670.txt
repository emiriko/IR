Scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not
variational symmetries of the action and do not lead to conservation laws.
Nevertheless, by an extension of Noether's theorem, scaling symmetries lead to
useful {\em nonconservation} laws, which still reduce the Euler-Lagrange
equations to first order in terms of scale invariants. We illustrate scaling
symmetry dynamically and statically. Applied dynamically to systems of bodies
interacting via central forces, the nonconservation law is Lagrange's identity,
leading to generalized virial laws. Applied to self-gravitating spheres in
hydrostatic equilibrium, the nonconservation law leads to well-known properties
of polytropes describing degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous
nondegenerate stellar cores.
