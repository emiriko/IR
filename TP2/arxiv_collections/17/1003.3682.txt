Adaptive behavior, cognition and emotion are the result of a bewildering
variety of brain spatiotemporal activity patterns. An important problem in
neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain's 100
billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large
repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is
recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be
arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse
cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must
still perform as a collective, i.e., they are functionally integrated. Here, we
investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character
of the spatiotemporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical
systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the
correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in
space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function
extracted from resting-state fMRI data exhibits self-similarity in space and
time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive
spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency
behavior of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies
that the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time)
intermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration
and the other of complete segregation. This dynamical property may be seen as
an important marker of brain well-being both in health and disease.
