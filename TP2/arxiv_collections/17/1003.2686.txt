Hawking effect from the Kinnersley spacetime is investigated using the
improved Damour-Ruffini method with a new coordinate transformation. Hawking
temperature of the horizons can be obtained point by point. It is found that
Hawking temperatures of different points on the horizons are different.
Especially, Hawking temperature of Rindler horizon is investigated. The touch
between a Kinnersley black hole and its Rindler horizon is considered, and it
shows that the phenomenon is related to the third law of thermodynamics.
