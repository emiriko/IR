Interference phenomena of neutrinos are studied. High energy neutrino in T2K
near detector and low energy neutrino in KamLAND are possible experiments that
could show macroscopic interferences of neutrino waves. In both experiments
interference patterns may give new insights on the absolute value of the
neutrino mass.
