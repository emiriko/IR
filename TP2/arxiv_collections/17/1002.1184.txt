The Application of Bio Inspired Algorithms to complicated Power System
Stability Problems has recently attracted the researchers in the field of
Artificial Intelligence. Low frequency oscillations after a disturbance in a
Power system, if not sufficiently damped, can drive the system unstable. This
paper provides a systematic procedure to damp the low frequency oscillations
based on Bio Inspired Genetic (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithms. The proposed controller design is based on formulating a System
Damping ratio enhancement based Optimization criterion to compute the optimal
controller parameters for better stability. The Novel and contrasting feature
of this work is the mathematical modeling and simulation of the Synchronous
generator model including the Steam Governor Turbine (GT) dynamics. To show the
robustness of the proposed controller, Non linear Time domain simulations have
been carried out under various system operating conditions. Also, a detailed
Comparative study has been done to show the superiority of the Bio inspired
algorithm based controllers over the Conventional Lead lag controller.
