Results of model calculations using exact diagonalization reveal the orbital
character of states associated with different Raman loss peaks in Cu $K$-edge
resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) from La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$. The model
includes electronic orbitals necessary to highlight non-local Zhang-Rice
singlet, charge transfer and $d$-$d$ excitations, as well as states with apical
oxygen 2$p_z$ character. The dispersion of these excitations is discussed with
prospects for resonant final state wave-function mapping. A good agreement with
experiments emphasizes the substantial multi-orbital character of RIXS profiles
in the energy transfer range 1-6 eV.
