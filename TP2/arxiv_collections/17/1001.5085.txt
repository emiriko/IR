We investigate the meaning of the wave function by analyzing the mass and
charge density distributions of a quantum system. According to protective
measurement, a charged quantum system has mass and charge density distributing
in space, proportional to the modulus square of its wave function. In a
realistic interpretation, the wave function of a quantum system can be taken as
a description of either a physical field or the ergodic motion of a particle.
If the wave function is a physical field, then the mass and charge density will
be distributed throughout space at a given time for a charged quantum system,
and thus there will exist gravitational and electrostatic self-interactions of
its wave function. This not only violates the superposition principle of
quantum mechanics but also contradicts experimental observations. Thus the wave
function cannot be a description of a physical field but a description of the
ergodic motion of a particle. For the later there is only a localized particle
with mass and charge at every instant, and thus there will not exist any
self-interaction for the wave function. It is further argued that the classical
ergodic models, which assume continuous motion of particles, cannot be
consistent with quantum mechanics. Based on the negative result, we suggest
that the wave function is a description of the quantum motion of particles,
which is random and discontinuous in nature. On this interpretation, the
modulus square of the wave function not only gives the density of probability
of the particle being found in certain locations, but also gives the density of
objective probability of the particle being there. We show that this new
interpretation of the wave function provides a natural realistic alternative to
the orthodox interpretation, and its implications for other realistic
interpretations of quantum mechanics are also briefly discussed.
