The criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional S=1 transverse-field Ising model is
investigated with the numerical diagonalization method. The scaling behavior is
improved by tuning the coupling-constant parameters; the S=1 spin model allows
us to incorporate a variety of interactions such as the single-ion anisotropy
and the biquadratic interactions. Simulating the clusters with N=6,8,...,20
spins, we estimate the critical indices as 1/\nu=1.586(6) and \eta=0.034(4).
