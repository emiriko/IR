The Fermi energies of electrons and holes and their densities in different
graphene layers (GLs) in the n- and p-regions of the electrically induced n-i-p
junctions formed in multiple-GL structures are calculated both numerically and
using a simplified analytical model. The reverse current associated with the
injection of minority carriers through the n- and p-regions in the
electrically-induced n-i-p junctions under the reverse bias is calculated as
well. It is shown that in the electrically-induced n-i-p junctions with
moderate numbers of GLs the reverse current can be substantially suppressed.
Hence, multiple-GL structures with such n-i-p junctions can be used in
different electron and optoelectron devices.
