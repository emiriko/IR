A polysquaraine low band gap polymer was synthesized by Yamamoto coupling of
a monomeric dibromo indolenine squaraine dye. The resulting polymer has a
weight average molar mass in the order of Mw ~30.000-50.000 and a
polydispersity of ca. 1.7 as determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC).
The electronic properties of monomer and polymer were investigated by cyclic
voltammetry, absorption and emission spectroscopy. Owing to exciton coupling
the absorption bands of the polymer are red-shifted and strongly broadened
compared to the monomer squaraine dye. Bulk heterojunction solar cells were
prepared from blends of the polysquaraine with the fullerene derivative
[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in different weight ratios
(1:3 to 1:1). The power conversion efficiencies under simulated AM 1.5
conditions yielded 0.45 % for these non-optimized systems. The external quantum
efficiency (EQE) shows that the photoresponse spans the range from 300 to 850
nm, which illustrates the promising properties of this novel organic
semiconductor as a low band gap donor material in organic photovoltaics.
