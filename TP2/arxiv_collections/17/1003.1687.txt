Inelastic neutron scattering from superconducting (SC)
Ba(Fe$_{0.926}$Co$_{0.074}$)$_2$As$_2$ reveals anisotropic and
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) magnetic excitations close to
\textbf{Q}$_{\texttt{AFM}}=({1}{2}/{1}{2})$ - the 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM)
wave-vector of the parent BaFe$_2$As$_2$ compound. The correlation length
anisotropy of these low energy fluctuations is consistent with spin nematic
correlations in the $J_1$-$J_2$ model with $J_1/J_2 \sim$ 1. The spin resonance
at $\sim$8.3 meV in the SC state displays the same anisotropy. The anisotropic
fluctuations experimentally evolve into two distinct maxima only along the
direction transverse to \textbf{Q}$_{\texttt{AFM}}$ above $\sim$80 meV
indicating unusual quasi-propagating excitations.
