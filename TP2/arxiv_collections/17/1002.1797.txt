We calculate the contribution of semi-hadronic states with pseudoscalar
$P=\pi^0, \eta$ and scalar ($\sigma$(550))meson accompanied with real photon as
an intermediate state of a heavy photon to the anomalous magnetic moment of
muon. We consider the intermediate states with $\pi_0$ and $\sigma$ as a
hadrons in frames of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The contribution of
$\pi_0\gamma$ state is in agreement with results obtained in previous
theoretical considerations as well as with experimental data
$a_\mu^{\pi_0\gamma}\approx 4.5 \times 10^{-10}$, besides we estimate
$a_{\mu}^{\eta\gamma}=0.7 \times 10^{-10}, a_{\mu}^{\sigma\gamma} \sim 1.5
\times 10^{-11}, a_{\mu}^{\pi^+\pi^-\gamma} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-10}.$ We
discass as well the LbL mechanism with $a_{\mu}^{lbl}=10.5 \cdot 10^{-10}.$
