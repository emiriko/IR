We study the Hubbard model on a geometrically-frustrated hyperkagome lattice
by a cluster extension of the dynamical mean field theory. We calculate the
temperature ($T$) dependences of the specific heat ($C$) and the spin-lattice
relaxation time ($T_1$) in correlated metallic region. $C/T$ shows a peak at
$T=T_{p1}$ and rapidly decreases as $T->0$. On the other hand, $1/T_1T$ has a
peak at a higher temperature $T_{p2}$ than $T_{p1}$, and largely decreases
below $T_{p2}$, followed by the Korringa law $1/T_1 propto T$ as $T->0$. Both
peak temperatures are suppressed and the peaks become sharper as electron
correlation is increased. These behaviors originate from strong renormalization
of the energy scales in the peculiar electronic structure in this frustrated
system; a pseudo-gap like feature, the van-Hove singularity, and the flat band.
The results are discussed in comparison with the experimental data in the
hyperkagome material, Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$.
