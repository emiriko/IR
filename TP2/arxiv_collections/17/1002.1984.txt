We consider the semigroup S of highest weights appearing in tensor powers V^k
of a finite dimensional representation V of a connected reductive group. We
describe the cone generated by S as the cone over the weight polytope of V
intersected with the positive Weyl chamber. From this we get a description for
the asymptotic of the number of highest weights appearing in V^k in terms of
the volume of this polytope.
