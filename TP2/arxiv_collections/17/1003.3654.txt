Text binarisation process classifies individual pixels as text or background
in the textual images. Binarization is necessary to bridge the gap between
localization and recognition by OCR. This paper presents Sliding window method
to binarise text from textual images with textured background. Suitable
preprocessing techniques are applied first to increase the contrast of the
image and blur the background noises due to textured background. Then Edges are
detected by iterative thresholding. Subsequently formed edge boxes are analyzed
to remove unwanted edges due to complex background and binarised by sliding
window approach based character size uniformity check algorithm. The proposed
method has been applied on localized region from heterogeneous textual images
and compared with Otsu, Niblack methods and shown encouraging performance of
the proposed method.
