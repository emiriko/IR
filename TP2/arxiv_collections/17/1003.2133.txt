It is shown how to resolve the apparent contradiction between the macroscopic
approach of phase space and the validity of the uncertainty relations. The main
notions of statistical mechanics are re-interpreted in a quantum-mechanical
way, the ergodic theorem and the H-theorem are formulated and proven (without
"assumptions of disorder"), followed by a discussion of the physical meaning of
the mathematical conditions characterizing their domain of validity.
