I present the next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) resummation of soft
and collinear gluon corrections to single top quark production in the s
channel. Attaining NNLL accuracy involves the calculation of the two-loop soft
anomalous dimension for the partonic subprocesses. Finite-order expansions of
the resummed cross section are calculated through next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO). Numerical results are presented for s-channel single top quark
production at the Tevatron and the LHC, including the dependence of the cross
sections on the top quark mass and the uncertainties in the theoretical
prediction. The higher-order corrections are significant for energies at both
colliders and they decrease the theoretical uncertainty.
