We have carried out torsional oscillator experiments on solid $^4$He at
temperatures between 1.3K and 1.9K. We discovered phenomena similar to those
observed at temperatures below 0.2K, which currently are under debate regarding
their interpretation in terms of supersolidity. These phenomena include a
partial decoupling of the solid helium mass from the oscillator, a change of
the dissipation, and a velocity dependence of the decoupled mass. These were
all observed both in the bcc and hcp phases of solid $^4$He. The onset of this
behavior is coincidental with the creation of crystalline disorder but does not
depend strongly on the crystalline symmetry or on the temperature.
