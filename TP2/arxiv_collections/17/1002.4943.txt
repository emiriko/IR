The quantum N-dimensional orthogonal vector Cayley-Klein spaces with
different combinations of quantum structure and Cayley-Klein scheme of
contractions and analytical continuations are described for multipliers, which
include the first and the second powers of contraction parameters in the
transformation of deformation parameter. The noncommutative analogs of constant
curvature spaces are introduced. The low dimensional spaces with N=3,4 are
discussed in detail and all quantum analogs of the fibered spaces corresponding
to nilpotent values of contraction parameters are given. As a result the wide
variety of the quantum deformations are obtained.
