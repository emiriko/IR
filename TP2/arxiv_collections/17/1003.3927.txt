We show that electron correlations control the photophysics of defects in SiC
through both renormalization of the quasiparticle bandstructure and exciton
effects. We consider the carbon vacancy, which is a well-identified defect with
two possible excitation channels that involve conduction and valence band
states. Corrections to the Kohn-Sham ionization levels are found to strongly
depend on the occupation of the defect state. Excitonic effects introduce a red
shift of 0.23 eV. The analysis unambigiously re-assigns excitation mechanism at
the thresholds in photo-induced paramagnetic resonance measurements [J.
