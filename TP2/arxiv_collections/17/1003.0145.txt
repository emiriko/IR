Deep Very Large Array imaging of the binary X-ray source SS 433, sometimes
classified as a microquasar, has been used to study the intrinsic brightness
distribution and evolution of its radio jets. The intrinsic brightness of the
jets as a function of age at emission of the jet material tau is recovered by
removal of the Doppler boosting and projection effects. We find that
intrinsically the two jets are remarkably similar when compared for equal tau,
and that they are best described by Doppler boosting of the form D^{2+alpha},
as expected for continuous jets. The intrinsic brightnesses of the jets as
functions of age behave in complex ways. In the age range 60 < tau < 150 days,
the jet decays are best represented by exponential functions of tau, but linear
or power law functions are not statistically excluded. This is followed by a
region out to tau ~ 250 days during which the intrinsic brightness is
essentially constant. At later times the jet decay can be fit roughly as
exponential or power law functions of tau.
