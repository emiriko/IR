Theoretical approaches of electronic transport in correlated molecules
usually consider an extended molecule, which includes, in addition to the
molecule itself, parts of electrodes. In the case where electron correlations
remain confined within the molecule, and the extended molecule is sufficiently
large, the current can be expressed by means of Laudauer-type formulae.
Electron correlations are embodied into the retarded Green function of a
sufficiently large but isolated extended molecule, which represents the key
quantity that can be accurately determined by means of ab initio quantum
chemical calculations. To exemplify these ideas, we present and analyze
numerical results obtained within full CI calculations for an extended molecule
described by the interacting resonant level model. Based on them, we argue that
for organic electrodes the transport properties can be reliably computed,
because the extended molecule can be chosen sufficiently small to be tackled
within accurate ab initio methods. For metallic electrodes, larger extended
molecules have to be considered in general, but a (semi-)quantitative
description of the transport should still be possible particularly in the
typical cases where electron transport proceeds by off-resonant tunneling. Our
numerical results also demonstrate that, contrary to the usual claim, the ratio
between the characteristic Coulomb strength and the level width due to
molecule-electrode coupling is not the only quantity needed to assess whether
electron correlation effects are strong or weak.
