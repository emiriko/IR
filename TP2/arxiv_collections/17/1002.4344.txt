These notes represent an extended version of a talk I gave for the
participants of the IMO 2009 and other interested people. We introduce
diophantine equations and show evidence that it can be hard to solve them. Then
we demonstrate how one can solve a specific equation related to numbers
occurring several times in Pascal's Triangle with state-of-the-art methods.
