It is shown that, the wavelet regression detrended fluctuations of the
monthly global temperature data (land and ocean combined) for the period
1880-2009yy, are completely dominated by one-third subharmonic resonance to
annual forcing (both natural and anthropogenically induced). Role of the
oceanic Rossby waves and the resonance contribution to the El Nino phenomenon
have been discussed in detail.
