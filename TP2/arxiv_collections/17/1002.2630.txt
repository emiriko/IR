The improved resolution of laser-based angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) allows reliable access to fine structures in the spectrum.
We present a systematic, doping-dependent study of a recently discovered
low-energy kink in the nodal dispersion of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi-2212), which
demonstrates the ubiquity and robustness of this kink in underdoped Bi-2212.
The renormalization of the nodal velocity due to this kink becomes stronger
with underdoping, revealing that the nodal Fermi velocity is non-universal, in
contrast to assumed phenomenology. This is used together with laser-ARPES
measurements of the gap velocity, v2, to resolve discrepancies with thermal
conductivity measurements.
