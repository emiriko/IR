This short note presents the Lambert W(x) function and its possible
application in the framework of physics related to the Pierre Auger
Observatory. The actual numerical implementation in C++ consists of Halley's
and Fritsch's iteration with branch-point expansion, asymptotic series and
rational fits as initial approximations.
