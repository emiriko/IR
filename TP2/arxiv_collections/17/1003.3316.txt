Our derivation of the distribution function for future returns is based on
the risk neutral approach which gives a functional dependence for the European
call (put) option price, C(K), given the strike price, K, and the distribution
function of the returns. We derive this distribution function using for C(K) a
Black-Scholes (BS) expression with volatility in the form of a volatility
smile. We show that this approach based on a volatility smile leads to relative
minima for the distribution function ("bad" probabilities) never observed in
real data and, in the worst cases, negative probabilities. We show that these
undesirable effects can be eliminated by requiring "adiabatic" conditions on
the volatility smile.
