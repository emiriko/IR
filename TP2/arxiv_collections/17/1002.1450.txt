Normal dynamics in a quasi-one-dimensional channel of length L (\to\infty) of
N hard spheres are analyzed. The spheres are heterogeneous: each has a
diffusion coefficient D that is drawn from a probability density function
(PDF), W D^(-{\gamma}), for small D, where 0\leq{\gamma}<1. The initial
spheres' density {\rho} is non-uniform and scales with the distance (from the
origin) l as, {\rho} l^(-a), 0\leqa\leq1. An approximation for the N-particle
PDF for this problem is derived. From this solution, scaling law analysis and
numerical simulations, we show here that the mean square displacement for a
particle in such a system obeys, <r^2>~t^(1-{\gamma})/(2c-{\gamma}), where
c=1/(1+a). The PDF of the tagged particle is Gaussian in position.
Generalizations of these results are considered.
