This paper describes the on-telescope performance of the Wide Field
Spectrograph (WiFeS). The design characteristics of this instrument, at the
Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) of the Australian National
University (ANU) and mounted on the ANU 2.3m telescope at the Siding Spring
Observatory has been already described in an earlier paper (Dopita et al.
2007). Here we describe the throughput, resolution and stability of the
instrument, and describe some minor issues which have been encountered. We also
give a description of the data reduction pipeline, and show some preliminary
results.
