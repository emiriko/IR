Burkholder obtained a sharp estimate of $\E|W|^p$ via $\E|Z|^p$, where $W$ is
a martingale transform of $Z$, or, in other words, for martingales $W$
differentially subordinated to martingales $Z$. His result is that $\E|W|^p\le
(p^*-1)^p\E|Z|^p$, where $p^* =\max (p, \frac{p}{p-1})$. What happens if the
martingales have an extra property of being orthogonal martingales? This
property is an analog (for martingales) of the Cauchy-Riemann equation for
functions, and it naturally appears from a problem on singular integrals (see
the references at the end of Section~1). We establish here that in this case
the constant is quite different. Actually, $\E|W|^p\le
(\frac{1+z_p}{1-z_p})^p\E|Z|^p$, $p\ge 2$, where $z_p$ is a specific zero of a
certain solution of a Legendre ODE. We also prove the sharpness of this
estimate. Asymptotically, $(1+z_p)/(1-z_p)=(4j^{-2}_0+o(1))p$, $p\to\infty$,
where $j_0$ is the first positive zero of the Bessel function of zero order.
This connection with zeros of special functions (and orthogonal polynomials for
$p=n(n+1)$) is rather unexpected.
