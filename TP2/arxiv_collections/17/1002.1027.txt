The widely accepted description of the present cosmic acceleration and the
neutrino oscillations in terms of a cosmological constant and neutrino masses,
respectively, seems conceptually not very satisfactory. From a phenomenological
perspective, the possibility that those phenomena are instead the first windows
to new physics at very low energies is explored.
