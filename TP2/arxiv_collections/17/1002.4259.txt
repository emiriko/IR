We discuss the modulus stabilization by the Casimir energy and various
effects of IR-brane kinetic terms for the gauge fields in a gauge-Higgs
unification model in the warped spacetime, where the Wilson line phase
$\theta_H$ is determined as $\theta_H=\pi/2$. We find that the brane kinetic
terms with O(1) coefficients are necessary for the modulus stabilization. On
the other hand, large brane kinetic terms can deviate 4D gauge couplings from
the standard model values and also cause too light Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. In
the parameter region that ensures the modulus stabilization, the KK gluon
appears below 1 TeV, which marginally satisfies the experimental bound. The
allowed parameter region will be enlarged in a model where a smaller value of
$\theta_H$ is realized.
