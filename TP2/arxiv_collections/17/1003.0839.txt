I consider a Josephson junction crossing the middle of a thin rectangular
superconducting strip of length L and width W subjected to a perpendicular
magnetic induction B. I calculate the spatial dependence of the gauge-invariant
phase difference across the junction and the resulting B dependence of the
critical current Ic(B).
