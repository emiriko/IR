The symmetrization postulates of quantum mechanics (symmetry for bosons,
antisymmetry for fermions) are usually taken to entail that \emph{quantum
particles} of the same kind (e.g., electrons) are all in exactly the same state
and therefore indistinguishable in the strongest possible sense. These
symmetrization postulates possess a general validity that survives the
classical limit, and the conclusion seems therefore unavoidable that even
classical particles of the same kind must all be in the same state--in clear
conflict with what we know about classical particles. In this article we
analyze the origin of this paradox. We shall argue that in the classical limit
classical particles \emph{emerge}, as new entities that do not correspond to
the "particle indices" defined in quantum mechanics. Put differently, we show
that the quantum mechanical symmetrization postulates do not pertain to
\emph{particles}, as we know them from classical physics, but rather to indices
that have a merely formal significance. This conclusion raises the question of
whether the discussions about the status of identical quantum particles have
not been misguided from the very start.
