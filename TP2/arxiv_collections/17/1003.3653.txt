A fundamental two-fluid model for describing dynamics of a plasma is the
Euler-Poisson system, in which compressible ion and electron fluids interact
with their self-consistent electrostatic force. Global smooth electron dynamics
were constructed in Guo due to dispersive effect of the electric field. In this
paper, we construct global smooth irrotational solutions with small amplitude
for ion dynamics in the Euler-Poisson system.
