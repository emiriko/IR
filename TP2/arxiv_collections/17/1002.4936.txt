In this paper we revisit and extend the work done by Chaturvedu et al, as
well as Dabrowski and Parashar. The basic premise is to take a deformed
coordinate system and give is a concrete realization. This realization is given
by a parameter of q = exp (it). Expanding in powers of 't' and applying a
deformed quantum Hamiltonian to a Free Particle yields a magnetic field. To
first order we recover a constant magnetic field. To second order we recover an
anisotropic magnetic field with an additional term. A brief mention is made
about the quantum symmetries present within the quantum Weyl algebra.
