This paper describes a new method for the synthesis of planar antenna arrays
using fuzzy genetic algorithms (FGAs) by optimizing phase excitation
coefficients to best meet a desired radiation pattern. We present the
application of a rigorous optimization technique based on fuzzy genetic
algorithms (FGAs), the optimizing algorithm is obtained by adjusting control
parameters of a standard version of genetic algorithm (SGAs) using a fuzzy
controller (FLC) depending on the best individual fitness and the population
diversity measurements (PDM). The presented optimization algorithms were
previously checked on specific mathematical test function and show their
superior capabilities with respect to the standard version (SGAs). A planar
array with rectangular cells using a probe feed is considered. Included example
using FGA demonstrates the good agreement between the desired and calculated
radiation patterns than those obtained by a SGA.
