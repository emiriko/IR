We transform the quartic Hubbard terms in the extended Hubbard model to a
quadratic form by making the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation for the
electron operators. This transformation allows us to derive exact results for
mass operator and charge-charge and spin-spin correlation functions for s-wave
superconductivity. We discuss the application of the method to the d-wave
superconductivity.
