We report on the electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power and electronic
phase diagram of rhodium-doped NdFeAsO. Rhodium doping suppresses the
structural phase transition and spin density wave observed in the undoped
material, and superconductivity emerges at x close to 0.05, despite the
distortion of FeAs4 tetrahedra induced by the large size difference between Rh
and Fe elements. The Tc(x) curve is dome-like, and the highest Tc is reached at
x = 0.1, with Tconset = 18K. An upturn of the electrical resistivity above Tc
has been observed, with a Kondo like behaviour above Tc and a Fermi-liquid
behaviour close to room temperature.
