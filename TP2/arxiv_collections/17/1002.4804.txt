We investigate theoretically the nonlinear dynamics induced by an intense
pump field in a disordered planar microcavity. Through a self-consistent
theory, we show how the generation of quantum optical noise squeezing is
affected by the breaking of the in-plane translational invariance and the
occurrence of photon localization. We find that the generation of single-mode
Kerr squeezing for the ideal planar case can be prevented by disorder as a
result of multimode nonlinear coupling, even when the other modes are in the
vacuum state. However, the excess noise is a non-monotonous function of the
disorder amplitude. In the strong localization limit, we show that the system
becomes protected with respect to this fundamental coupling mechanism and that
the ideal quadrature squeezing generation can be obtained.
