Several methods to improve the parton-shower description of hard processes by
an injection of matrix-element-based information have been presented over the
years. In this article we study (re)weighting schemes for the first/hardest
emission. One objective is to provide a consistent matching of the POWHEG
next-to-leading order generator to the Pythia shower algorithms. Another is to
correct the default behaviour of these showers at large transverse momenta,
based on a comparison with real-emission matrix elements.
