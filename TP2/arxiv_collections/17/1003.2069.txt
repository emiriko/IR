Fe and N self-diffusion in non-magnetic FeN has been studied using neutron
reflectivity. The isotope labelled multilayers, FeN/57Fe:N and Fe:N/Fe:15N were
prepared using magnetron sputtering. It was remarkable to observe that N
diffusion was slower compared to Fe while the atomic size of Fe is larger
compared to N. An attempt has been made to understand the diffusion of Fe and N
in non-magnetic Fe:N.
