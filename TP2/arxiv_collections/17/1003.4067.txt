Data generated in the fields of science, technology, business and in many
other fields of research are increasing in an exponential rate. The way to
extract knowledge from a huge set of data is a challenging task. This paper
aims to propose a hybrid and viable method to deal with an information system
in data mining, using topological techniques and the significance of the
attributes measured using rough set theory, to compute the reduct, This will
reduce the randomness in the process of elimination of redundant attributes,
which, in turn, will reduce the complexity of the computation of reducts of an
information system where a large amount of data have to be processed.
