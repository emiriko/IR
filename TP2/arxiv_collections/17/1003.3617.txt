Variations in the equivalent width of the neutral potassium line at 7699A are
reported, during ingress and into totality of the current eclipse of the
enigmatic eclipsing binary epsilon Aurigae. The increase and plateaus of line
strength are correlated with new system parameters and interferometric imaging
constraints, plus ancillary data being reported contemporaneously. Together,
these data reveal structural details of the transiting disc, never before
measured. Measured ring and gap placements do not immediately fit any proposed
model using simple tidal estimation. However, we predict egress times of
interest and urge continued monitoring of this star during the balance of its
eclipse, and encourage theoretical treatment of the disc substructure to be
pursued.
