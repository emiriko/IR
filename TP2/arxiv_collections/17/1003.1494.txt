In this paper we describe a mechanism to improve Information Retrieval (IR)
on the web. The method is based on Formal Concepts Analysis (FCA) that it is
makes semantical relations during the queries, and allows a reorganizing, in
the shape of a lattice of concepts, the answers provided by a search engine. We
proposed for the IR an incremental algorithm based on Galois lattice. This
algorithm allows a formal clustering of the data sources, and the results which
it turns over are classified by order of relevance. The control of relevance is
exploited in clustering, we improved the result by using ontology in field of
image processing, and reformulating the user queries which make it possible to
give more relevant documents.
