We tropicalize the rational map that takes triples of points in the
projective plane to the plane of quadrics passing through these points. The
image of its tropicalization is contained in the tropicalization of its image.
We identify these objects inside the tropical Grassmannian of planes in
projective 5-space, and we explore a small tropical Hilbert scheme.
