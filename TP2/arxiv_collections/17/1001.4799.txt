Soft-wall models in AdS/QCD generally have dilaton and scalar fields that
vary with the fifth-dimension coordinate. These fields can be parameterized to
yield hadron mass spectra with linear radial trajectories and to incorporate
spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. We show how to construct scalar
potentials which lead to such solutions.
