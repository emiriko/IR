Over the last few years electronic learning has been in use mostly by
corporate institutes in the form of computer aided instructions and computer
based training. The scope of such use has not only been limited to introductory
courses for beginners and working people but also to impart knowledge in higher
education sector. Due to increasing market demands and current prevailing law
and order situation of this area (during which the University remain closed for
uncertain period of time on many occasions) Gomal University D.I.Khan, Pakistan
is planning to introduce e-learning at undergraduate and post graduate level in
computer and management sciences for smooth and uninterrupted delivery of
quality education to local and distant students. Obvious result of elearning
will be two fold. First it will meet market demands along with smooth
uninterrupted delivery of quality education and secondly will solve the growing
problem of shortage of experts raised by the current law and order situation.
This paper investigates the main issues involved in designing and implementing
an effective electronic courseware for students with diverse backgrounds
belonging to this remote area. Some effective strategies for electronic
delivery of courses to local and distant students are also presented along with
some examples of implementation.
