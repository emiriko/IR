Experimental results are presented for study of collective and fractal
properties of soft pion jets in the space of relative four-dimensional
velocities. Significant decreasing is obtained for mean square of second
particle distances from jet axis for pion-proton interactions at initial
energies $\sim 3$ GeV in comparison with hadron-nuclear collisions at close
energies. The decreasing results in power dependence of distance variable on
collision energy for range $\sim 2 - 4$ GeV. The observation allows us to
estimate the low boundary of manifestation of color degree of freedom in pion
jet production. Cluster dimension values were deduced for pion jets in various
reactions. Fractional values of this dimension indicate on the manifestation of
fractal-like properties by pion jets. Changing of mean kinetic energy of jet
particles and fractal dimension with initial energy increasing is consistent
with suggestion for presence of color degrees of freedom in pion jet production
at intermediate energies.
