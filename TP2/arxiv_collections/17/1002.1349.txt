We use the Kerr/CFT correspondence to calculate the entropy for all known
extremal stationary and axisymmetric black holes. This is done with the help of
two ansatzs that are general enough to cover all such known solutions.
Considering only the contribution from the Einstein-Hilbert action to the
central charge(s), we find that the entropy obtained by using Cardy's formula
exactly matches with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
