In an informal way some kind of Ising Lattice QCD is introduced which allows
to interprete and discuss the well-known theory of quantum chromodynamics
(confinement, quarks and gluons, etc.) from simple phenomena of magnetism and
polymer physics. Also the viewpoint of duality is stressed. Moreover, the
non-abelian character of the Lie group SU(3) is important. The essential
arguments for confinement and asymptotic freedom are given at the very end of
the manuscript, after an appendix.
