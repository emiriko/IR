We present a computational scheme to study spin excitations in magnetic
materials from first principles. The central quantity is the transverse spin
susceptibility, from which the complete excitation spectrum, including
single-particle spin-flip Stoner excitations and collective spin-wave modes,
can be obtained. The susceptibility is derived from many-body perturbation
theory and includes dynamic correlation through a summation over ladder
diagrams that describe the coupling of electrons and holes with opposite spins.
In contrast to earlier studies, we do not use a model potential with adjustable
parameters for the electron-hole interaction but employ the random-phase
approximation. To reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the
four-point scattering matrix we perform a projection onto maximally localized
Wannier functions, which allows us to truncate the matrix efficiently by
exploiting the short spatial range of electronic correlation in the partially
filled d or f orbitals. Our implementation is based on the FLAPW method.
Starting from a ground-state calculation within the LSDA, we first analyze the
matrix elements of the screened Coulomb potential in the Wannier basis for the
3d transition-metal series. In particular, we discuss the differences between a
constrained nonmagnetic and a proper spin-polarized treatment for the
ferromagnets Fe, Co, and Ni. The spectrum of single-particle and collective
spin excitations in fcc Ni is then studied in detail. The calculated spin-wave
dispersion is in good overall agreement with experimental data and contains
both an acoustic and an optical branch for intermediate wave vectors along the
[100] direction. In addition, we find evidence for a similar double-peak
structure in the spectral function along the [111] direction.
