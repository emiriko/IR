In the framework of the time dependent local density approximation, applied
to valence electrons, coupled non-adiabatically to molecular dynamics of ions,
the irradiations of ethylene by laser and fast charged projectiles are studied.
We find that the Coulomb fragmentation sensitively depends on the laser
frequency and on the charge of the projectile.
