Context: Analysis of ages and metallicities of star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds provide information for studies on the chemical evolution of
the Clouds and other dwarf irregular galaxies. Aims: The aim is to derive ages
and metallicities from integrated spectra of 14 star clusters in the Small
Magellanic Cloud, including a few intermediate/old age star clusters. Methods:
Making use of a full-spectrum fitting technique, we compared the integrated
spectra of the sample clusters to three different sets of single stellar
population models, using two fitting codes available in the literature.
Results: We derive the ages and metallicities of 9 intermediate/old age
clusters, some of them previously unstudied, and 5 young clusters. Conclusions:
We point out the interest of the newly identified as intermediate/old age
clusters HW1, NGC 152, Lindsay 3, Lindsay 11, and Lindsay 113. We also confirm
the old ages of NGC 361, NGC 419, Kron 3, and of the very well-known oldest SMC
cluster, NGC 121.
