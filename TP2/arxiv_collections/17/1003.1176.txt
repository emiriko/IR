The lasing behavior of one dimensional GaAs nanobeam cavities with embedded
InAs quantum dots is studied at room temperature. Lasing is observed throughout
the quantum dot PL spectrum, and the wavelength dependence of the threshold is
calculated. We study the cavity lasers under both 780 nm and 980 nm pump,
finding thresholds as low as 0.3 uW and 19 uW for the two pump wavelengths,
respectively. Finally, the nanobeam cavity laser wavelengths are tuned by up to
7 nm by employing a fiber taper in near proximity to the cavities. The fiber
taper is used both to efficiently pump the cavity and collect the cavity
emission.
