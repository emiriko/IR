We present a functional renormalization group (fRG) treatment of trigonal
graphene nanodiscs and composites thereof, modeled by finite-size Hubbard-like
Hamiltonians with honeycomb lattice structure. At half filling, the
noninteracting spectrum of these structures contains a certain number of
half-filled states at the Fermi level. For the case of trigonal nanodiscs,
including interactions between these degenerate states was argued to lead to a
large ground state spin with potential spintronics applications. Here we
perform a systematic fRG flow where the excited single-particle states are
integrated out with a decreasing energy cutoff, yielding a renormalized
low-energy Hamiltonian for the zero-energy states that includes effects of the
excited levels. The numerical implementation corroborates the results obtained
with a simpler Hartree-Fock treatment of the interaction effects within the
zero-energy states only. In particular, for trigonal nanodiscs the degeneracy
of the one-particle-states with zero-energy turns out to be very robust against
influences of the higher levels. As an explanation, we give a general argument
that within this fRG scheme the zero-energy degeneracy remains unsplit under
quite general conditions and for any size of the trigonal nanodisc. We
furthermore discuss the differences in the effective Hamiltonian and their
ground states of single nanodiscs and composite bow-tie-shaped systems.
