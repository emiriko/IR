[ABRIDGED] We present the results of a 3 year monitoring program of a sample
of very low mass (VLM) field binaries using both astrometric and spectroscopic
data obtained in conjunction with the laser guide star adaptive optics system
on the W.M. Keck II 10 m telescope. Fifteen systems have undergone sufficient
orbital motion, allowing us to derive their relative orbital parameters and
hence their total system mass. These measurements triple the number of masses
for VLM objects. Among the 11 systems with both astrometric and spectroscopic
measurements, six have sufficient radial velocity variations to allow us to
obtain individual component masses. This is the first derivation of the
component masses for five of these systems. Altogether, the orbital solutions
of these low mass systems show a correlation between eccentricity and orbital
period, consistent with their higher mass counterparts. In our primary
analysis, we find that there are systematic discrepancies between our dynamical
mass measurements and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models
(TUCSON and LYON) with both models either underpredicting or overpredicting the
most precisely determined dynamical masses. These discrepancies are a function
of spectral type, with late M through mid L systems tending to have their
masses underpredicted, while one T type system has its mass overpredicted.
These discrepancies imply that either the temperatures predicted by
evolutionary and atmosphere models are inconsistent for an object of a given
mass, or the mass-radius relationship or cooling timescales predicted by the
evolutionary models are incorrect. If these spectral type trends hold into the
planetary mass regime, the implication is that the masses of directly imaged
extrasolar planets are overpredicted by the evolutionary models.
