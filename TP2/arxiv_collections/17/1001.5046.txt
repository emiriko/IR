Discovered over forty years ago, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) remain a forefront
topic in modern astrophysics. Perhaps the most fundamental question associated
with GRBs is the nature of the astrophysical agent (or agents) that ultimately
powers them: the central engine. In this review, I focus on the possible
central engines of long-duration GRBs, and the constraints that present
observations place on these models. Long GRBs are definitively associated with
the deaths of massive stars, but whether the central engine is an accreting
black hole or a rapidly-spinning, highly-magnetized neutron star (a
"proto-magnetar") remains unsettled. This distinction has been brought into
particular focus by recent MHD simulations of the core-collapse of massive,
rotating "collapsar progenitors," which suggest that powerful
magneto-centrifugal outflows from the proto-neutron star may stave off black
hole formation entirely. Although both black hole and magnetar GRB models
remain viable, I argue that the magnetar model is more mature in the sense that
it provides quantitative explanations for the durations, energies, Lorentz
factors, and collimation of long GRB outflows. Given these virtues, one
promising strategy to break the present stalemate is to further develop the
magnetar model until inescapable (and falsifiable) predictions emerge. This
course of action signals a renewed challenge to translate time-dependent jet
properties (power, magnetization, and Lorentz factor) into observables
(gamma-ray light curves and spectra).
