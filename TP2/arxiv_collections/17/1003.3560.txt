We consider the impact of anisotropic nonlocality on the arrest of the
collapse and stabilization of dipole-mode (DM) solitons in two-dimensional (2D)
models of optical media with the diffusive nonlinearity. The nonlocal
nonlinearity is made anisotropic through elliptic diffusivity. The medium
becomes semi-local in the limit case of 1D diffusivity. Families of fundamental
and DM solitons are found by means of the variational approximation (VA) and in
a numerical form. We demonstrate that the collapse of 2D beams is arrested even
in the semi-local system. The anisotropic nonlocality readily stabilizes the DM
solitons, which are completely unstable in the isotropic medium.
