One of the most interesting explanations for the non-Gaussian Cold Spot (CS)
detected in the WMAP data by Vielva et al. 2004, is that it arises from the
interaction of the CMB radiation with a cosmic texture (Cruz et al. 2007b). In
this case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, as
compared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a GIRF. In
addition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of the
gravitational field could lead to a similar scenario. However, some of these
alternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) have
been shown to be very unlikely. In this work we characterise the polarization
properties of the Cold Spot under both hypotheses: a large Gaussian spot and an
anomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture. We propose a
methodology to distinguish between them, and we discuss its discrimination
power as a function of the instrumental noise level. In particular, we address
the cases of current experiments, like WMAP and Planck, and others in
development as QUIJOTE. We find that for an ideal experiment the Gaussian
hypothesis could be rejected at a significance level better than 0.8%. While
WMAP is far from providing useful information in this respect, we find that
Planck will be able to reach a significance of around 7%; in addition, we show
that the ground-based experiment QUIJOTE could provide a significance of around
1%. If these results are combined with the significance level found for the CS
in temperature, the capability of QUIJOTE and Planck to reject the alternative
hypothesis becomes 0.025% and 0.124%, respectively.
