The density of orbital space debris constitutes an increasing environmental
challenge. There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation,
debris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision
avoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite
increase in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential
correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog
of space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit
to state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted
orbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision
ephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for
several satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital
region. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical
rate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's
propagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding
improvements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial
conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable
collision avoidance system.
  We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for
applying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and
near future. Finally, we outline a scheme for debris-debris collision avoidance
that may become practicable given these developments.
