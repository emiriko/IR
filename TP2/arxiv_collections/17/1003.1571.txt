A detailed elastic neutron scattering study of the structural and magnetic
phase transitions in single-crystal SrFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals that the
orthorhombic (O)-tetragonal (T) and the antiferromagnetic transitions coincide
at $T_\texttt{O}$ = $T_\texttt{N}$ = (201.5 $\pm$ 0.25) K. The observation of
coexisting O-T phases over a finite temperature range at the transition and the
sudden onset of the O distortion provide strong evidences that the structural
transition is first order. The simultaneous appearance and disappearance within
0.5 K upon cooling and within 0.25 K upon warming, respectively, indicate that
the magnetic and structural transitions are intimately coupled. We find that
the hysteresis in the transition temperature extends over a 1-2 K range. Based
on the observation of a remnant orthorhombic phase at temperatures higher than
\emph{T}$_\texttt{O}$, we suggest that the T-O transition may be an
order-disorder transition.
