Rendering techniques based on a random grid can be improved by adapting
brushstrokes to the shape of different areas of the original picture. In this
paper, the concept of Coherence Length Diagram is applied to determine the
adaptive brushstrokes, in order to simulate an impressionist painting. Some
examples are provided to instance the proposed algorithm.
