The holographic principle, considered in a semiclassical setting, is shown to
have direct consequences on physics at a fundamental level. In particular, a
certain relation is pointed out to be the expression of holography in basic
thermodynamics. It is argued moreover that through this relation holography can
be recognized to induce gravity, and an expression for the gravitational
lensing is obtained in terms of entropy over wavelength of black-body
radiation, or, at a deeper level, in terms of maximum entropy over associated
space to the elementary bit of information.
