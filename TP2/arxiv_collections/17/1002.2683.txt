We discuss that the deviation of the Kugo-Ojima color confinement parameter
$u(0)$ from -1 in the case of quenched lattice simulation and the consistency
with -1 in the case of full QCD simulation could be attributed to the boundary
condition defined by fermions inside the region of $r<1$fm. By using the domain
wall fermion propagator in lattice simulation, we show that the chiral symmetry
breaking in the infrared can become manifest when one assumes that the
left-handed fermion on the left wall and the right-handed fermion on the right
wall are correlated by a self-dual gauge field. The relation between the
infrared fixed point of the running coupling measured in lattice simulations,
the prediction of the BLM renormalization theory, the conformal field theory
with use of the t'Hooft anomaly matching condition in non-SUSY supersymmetric
theory and the quaternion real condition are discussed.
