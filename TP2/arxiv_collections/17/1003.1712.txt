We derive a generalized time-dependent Galilean-invariant density-functional
(DF) equation appropriate to study the stationary and non-stationary properties
of a trapped Fermi super-fluid in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BCS) crossover. This equation is equivalent to a
quantum hydrodynamical equation for a Fermi super-fluid. The bulk chemical
potential of this equation has the proper (model-independent) dependence on the
Fermi-Fermi scattering length in the BCS and BEC limits. We apply this DF
equation to the study of stationary density profile and size of a cigar-shaped
Fermi super-fluid of $^6$Li atoms and the results are in good agreement with
the experiment of Bartenstein {\it et al.} in the BCS-BEC crossover. We also
apply the DF equation to the study of axial and radial breathing oscillation
and our results for these frequencies are in good agreement with experiments in
the BCS-BEC crossover.
