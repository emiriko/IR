Denial of service attacks (DoS) can cause significant financial damages.
Flooding and Malicious packets are two kinds of DoS attacks. This paper
presents a new security approach which stops malicious packets and prevents
flooding in the critical systems. New concepts of packet stamp a
dynamic-multi-communication-point mechanism has been identified for this
proposed approach to make the prevention of flooding attacks easier and the
performing of malicious packet attacks harder. In addition, dynamic key
encryption technique has been adapted as a part of the proposed approach to
enhance its functionality.
