We predict an enormous order-dependent quantum enhancement of thermoelectric
effects in the vicinity of a higher-order `supernode' in the transmission
spectrum of a nanoscale junction. Single-molecule junctions based on
3,3'-biphenyl and polyphenyl ether (PPE) are investigated in detail. The
nonequilibrium thermodynamic efficiency and power output of a thermoelectric
heat engine based on a 1,3-benzene junction are calculated using many-body
theory, and compared to the predictions of the figure-of-merit ZT.
