We explore the potential of the Large Hadron Collider to observe the h1 -> a1
a1 -> 4 muons signal from the lightest scalar Higgs boson (h1) decaying into
the two lightest pseudoscalar Higgs bosons (a1), followed by their decays into
four muons in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). The
signature under study applies to the region of the NMSSM parameter space in
which m_a1 < 2 m_tau, which has not been studied previously. In such a
scenario, the suggested strategy of searching for a four-muon signal with the
appropriate background suppression would provide a powerful method to discover
the lightest CP-even and CP-odd NMSSM Higgs bosons h1 and a1.
