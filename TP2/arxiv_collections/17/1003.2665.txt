Experiments have revealed multiple quantum oscillation frequencies in
underdoped high temperature superconductor
$\mathrm{YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}}$, corresponding to approximately 10%
doping, which contain $\mathrm{CuO}$ bilayers in the unit cell. These unit
cells are further coupled along the c-axis by a tunneling matrix element. A
model of the energy dispersion that has its roots in the previously determined
electronic structure, combined with two-fold commensurate density waves,
reveals multiple electron and hole pockets. To the extent that quasiparticles
of the reconstructed Fermi surface have finite residues, however small, the
formation of Landau levels are the cause of these oscillations and the bilayer
splitting and warping of the electronic dispersion along the direction
perpendicular to the CuO-planes are firm consequences. We explore this
possibility in detail and find overall consistency with experiments. An
important conclusion is that bilayer splitting is severely renormalized from
the value obtained from band structure calculations. It would be extremely
interesting to perform these experiments for higher values of doping. We
roughly expect the splitting of the frequencies to increase with doping, but
the full picture may be more complex because the density wave order parameter
is also expected to decrease with doping, vanishing around the middle of the
superconducting dome.
