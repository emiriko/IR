We discuss experimental evidence for a nuclear phase transition driven by the
different concentration of neutrons to protons. Different ratios of the neutron
to proton concentrations lead to different critical points for the phase
transition. This is analogous to the phase transitions occurring in 4He-3He
liquid mixtures. We present experimental results which reveal the N/A (or Z/A)
dependence of the phase transition and discuss possible implications of these
observations in terms of the Landau Free Energy description of critical
phenomena.
