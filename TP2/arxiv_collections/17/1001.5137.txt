Driven non-equilibrium structural phase transformation has been probed using
time varying resistance fluctuations or noise. We demonstrate that the
non-Gaussian component (NGC) of noise obtained by evaluating the higher order
statistics of fluctuations, serves as a simple kinetic detector of these phase
transitions. Using the martensite transformation in free-standing wires of
nickel-titanium binary alloys as a prototype, we observe clear deviations from
the Gaussian background in the transformation zone, indicative of the long
range correlations in the system as the phase transforms. The viability of non-
Gaussian statistics as a robust probe to structural phase transition was also
confirmed by comparing the results from differential scanning calorimetry
measurements. We further studied the response of the NGC to the modifications
in the microstructure on repeated thermal cycling, as well as the variations in
the temperature drive rate, and explained the results using established
simplistic models based on the different competing time scales. Our experiments
(i) suggest an alternative method to estimate the transformation temperature
scales with high accuracy, and (ii) establish a connection between the
material-specific evolution of microstructure to the statistics of its linear
response. Since the method depends on an in-built long-range correlation during
transformation, it could be portable to other structural transitions, as well
as to materials of different physical origin and size.
