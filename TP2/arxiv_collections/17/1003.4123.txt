Recent advancement on the knowledge of multifragmentation and phase
transition for hot nuclei is reported. It concerns i) the influence of radial
collective energy on fragment partitions and the derivation of general
properties of partitions in presence of such a collective energy, ii) a better
knowledge of freeze-out properties obtained by means of a simulation based on
all the available experimental information and iii) the quantitative study of
the bimodal behaviour of the heaviest fragment charge distribution for
fragmenting hot heavy quasi-projectiles which allows, for the first time, to
estimate the latent heat of the phase transition.
