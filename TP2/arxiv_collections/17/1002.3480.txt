We report radiation hardness tests performed at the Frascati Neutron
Generator on silicon Photo-Multipliers, semiconductor photon detectors built
from a square matrix of avalanche photo-diodes on a silicon substrate. Several
samples from different manufacturers have been irradiated integrating up to
7x10^10 1-MeV-equivalent neutrons per cm^2. Detector performances have been
recorded during the neutron irradiation and a gradual deterioration of their
properties was found to happen already after an integrated fluence of the order
of 10^8 1-MeV-equivalent neutrons per cm^2.
