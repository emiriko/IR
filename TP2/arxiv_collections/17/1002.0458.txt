Flux analysis is a class of constraint-based approaches to the study of
biochemical reaction networks: they are based on determining the reaction flux
configurations compatible with given stoichiometric and thermodynamic
constraints. One of its main areas of application is the study of cellular
metabolic networks. We briefly and selectively review the main approaches to
this problem and then, building on recent work, we provide a characterization
of the productive capabilities of the metabolic network of the bacterium E.coli
in a specified growth medium in terms of the producible biochemical species.
While a robust and physiologically meaningful production profile clearly
emerges (including biomass components, biomass products, waste etc.), the
underlying constraints still allow for significant fluctuations even in key
metabolites like ATP and, as a consequence, apparently lay the ground for very
different growth scenarios.
