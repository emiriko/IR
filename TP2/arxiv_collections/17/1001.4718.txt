There are only a few sources that are definitely known to be gamma-ray
binaries. Two of these are listed as associations in the Fermi LAT Bright
Source List. We are developing novel techniques to extract high signal-to-noise
light curves of all cataloged Fermi sources and to search for periodic
variability using appropriately weighted power spectra. The detection of
periodic variability would be strong evidence for the detection of a new
gamma-ray binary. The LAT's sensitivity provides the opportunity to open up
completely new discovery space for additional binary systems, potentially
involving novel astrophysics. We present here demonstrations of the sensitivity
gains obtained through the use of these techniques.
