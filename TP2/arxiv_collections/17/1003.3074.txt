By considering mirror oscillation in a "tripod-scheme" laser-atom system, we
advocate explorative studies of driven Dirac-like equations. Both analytical
and numerical studies show that mirror oscillation can be used to drive an
effective spin-orbit interaction and hence control the amplitude, the
frequency, and the damping of the cold-atom Zitterbewegung oscillation. Our
results demonstrate an interesting coupling between the mirror mechanical
motion and a fundamental quantum coherent oscillation, opening up new means of
matter wave manipulation.
