We present narrow band AAO/UKST HAlpha images and medium and low resolution
optical spectra of a nebula shell putatively associated with the Wolf-Rayet
star WR 60. We also present the first identification of this shell in the radio
regime at 843 MHz and at 4850 MHz from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky
Survey (SUMSS), and from the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) survey respectively. This
radio emission closely follows the optical emission. The optical spectra from
the shell exhibits the typical shock excitation signatures sometimes seen in
Wolf-Rayet stellar ejecta but also common to supernova remnants. A key finding
however, is that the WR 60 star, is not, in fact, anywhere near the geometrical
centre of the putative arcuate nebula ejecta as had been previously stated.
This was due to an erroneous positional identification for the star in the
literature which we now correct. This new identification calls into serious
question any association of the nebula with WR 60 as such nebula are usually
quite well centred on the WR stars themselves. We now propose that this fact
combined with our new optical spectra, deeper HAlpha imaging and newly
identified radio structures actually imply that the WR 60 nebula should be
reclassified as an unassociated new supernova remnant which we designate
G310.5+0.8.
