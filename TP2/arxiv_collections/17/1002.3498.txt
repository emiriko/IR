We construct the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) on the homogeneous space
(Cartan domain) D_4=SO(4,2)/(SO(4)\times SO(2)) of the conformal group SO(4,2)
(locally isomorphic to SU(2,2)) in 1+3 dimensions. The manifold D_4 can be
mapped one-to-one onto the future tube domain C^4_+ of the complex Minkowski
space through a Cayley transformation, where other kind of (electromagnetic)
wavelets have already been proposed in the literature. We study the unitary
irreducible representations of the conformal group on the Hilbert spaces
L^2_h(D_4,d\nu_\lambda) and L^2_h(C^4_+,d\tilde\nu_\lambda) of square
integrable holomorphic functions with scale dimension \lambda and continuous
mass spectrum, prove the isomorphism (equivariance) between both Hilbert
spaces, admissibility and tight-frame conditions, provide reconstruction
formulas and orthonormal basis of homogeneous polynomials and discuss symmetry
properties and the Euclidean limit of the proposed conformal wavelets. For that
purpose, we firstly state and prove a \lambda-extension of Schwinger's Master
Theorem (SMT), which turns out to be a useful mathematical tool for us,
particularly as a generating function for the unitary-representation functions
of the conformal group and for the derivation of the reproducing (Bergman)
kernel of L^2_h(D_4,d\nu_\lambda). SMT is related to MacMahon's Master Theorem
(MMT) and an extension of both in terms of Louck's SU(N) solid harmonics is
also provided for completeness. Convergence conditions are also studied.
