The holographic dark energy (HDE) is considered to be the most promising
candidate of dark energy. Its definition is originally motivated from the
entropy-area relation which depends on the theory of gravity under
consideration. Recently a new definition of HDE is proposed with the help of
quantum corrections to the entropy-area relation in the setup of loop quantum
cosmology. Using this new definition, we investigate the model of interacting
dark energy and derive its effective equation of state. Finally we establish a
correspondence between generalized Chaplygin gas and entropy-corrected
holographic dark energy.
