Here we study the structural and magnetic properties of the CoFeSr2YCu2O7
compound with x = 0.0 to 1.0. X-ray diffraction patterns and simulated data
obtained from Rietveld refinement of the same indicate that the iron ion
replacement in CoFeSr2YCu2O7 induces a change in crystal structure. The
orthorhombic Ima2 space group structure of Co-1212 changes to tetragonal P4/mmm
with increasing Fe ion. The XPS studies reveal that both Co and Fe ions are in
mixed states for the former and in case of later.Although none of the studied
as synthesized samples in CoFeSr2YCu2O7 are superconducting, the interesting
structural changes in terms of their crystallisation space groups and the weak
magnetism highlights the rich solid state chemistry of this class of materials.
