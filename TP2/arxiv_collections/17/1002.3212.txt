A theory of the anomalous and spin Hall effects, based on the space
distribution of the current densities, is presented. Spin-orbit coupling gives
rise to a space separation of the mass centers, as well as a current density
separation of the quasiparticle states having opposite group velocities. It is
shown that this microscopic property is essential for existence of both Hall
effects.
