We show that a class of Wess--Zumino models lead to inflation in
supersymmetry and supergravity. This is due to the existence of a classically
flat direction generic to these models. The pseudomodulus that parametrizes
this flat direction is the inflaton and obtains a small mass due to either
one--loop or supergravity corrections giving rise to slow--roll inflation. At
the end of inflation, the fields roll to a supersymmetric vacuum that arises
from explicit R symmetry breaking.
