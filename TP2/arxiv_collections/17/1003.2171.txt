We propose a physical model for generating multipartite entangled states of
spin-$s$ particles that have important applications in distributed quantum
information processing. Our protocol is based on a process where mobile spins
induce the interaction among remote scattering centers. As such, a major
advantage lies on the management of stationary and well separated spins. Among
the generable states, there is a class of $N$-qubit singlets allowing for
optimal quantum telecloning in a scalable and controllable way. We also show
how to prepare Aharonov, W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states.
