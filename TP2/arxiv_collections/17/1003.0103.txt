We describe a general methods to localize any sort of k-separability and
therefore also the corresponding partial entanglement in genuinely multipartite
mixed quantum states. Our methods are based exclusively on the known twopartite
methods and some systematic procedures of combinatorial nature. Our methods are
formalized in an algorithmic-like fashion and therefore they are easily
implementable in a computer environments and might be effectively used for
studying numerically these questions for sufficiently small systems
