Molecular electronic devices currently serve as a platform for studying a
variety of physical phenomena only accessible at the nanometer scale. One such
phenomenon is the highly correlated electronic state responsible for the Kondo
effect, manifested here as a "Kondo resonance" in the conductance. Because the
Kondo effect results from strong electron-electron interactions, it is not
captured by the usual quantum chemistry approaches traditionally applied to
understand chemical electron transfer. In this review we will discuss the
origins and phenomenology of Kondo resonances observed in single molecule
devices, focusing primarily on the spin-1/2 Kondo state arising from a single
unpaired electron. We explore the rich physical system of a single-molecule
device, which offers a unique spectroscopic tool for investigating the
interplay of emergent Kondo behavior and such properties as molecular orbital
transitions and vibrational modes. We will additionally address more exotic
systems, such as higher spin states in the Kondo regime, and we will review
recent experimental advances in the ability to manipulate and exert control
over these nanoscale devices.
