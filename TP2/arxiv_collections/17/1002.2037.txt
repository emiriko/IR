We review the state of the art in modelling lithium production, through the
Cameron-Fowler mechanism, in two stellar sites: during nova explosions and in
the envelopes of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We also show
preliminary results concerning the computation of lithium yields from
super-AGBs, and suggest that super-AGBs of metallicity close to solar may be
the most important galactic lithium producers. Finally, we discuss how lithium
abundances may help to understand the modalities of formation of the "second
generation" stars in globular clusters.
