Surface acceleration of fast electrons in intense laser-plasma interaction is
improved by using sub-wavelength grating targets. The fast electron beam
emitted along the target surface was enhanced by more than three times relative
to that by using planar target. The total number of the fast electrons ejected
from the front side of target was also increased by about one time. The method
to enhance the surface acceleration of fast electron is effective for various
targets with sub-wavelength structured surface, and can be applied widely in
the cone-guided fast ignition, energetic ion acceleration, plasma device, and
other high energy density physics experiments.
