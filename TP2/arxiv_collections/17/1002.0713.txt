We present some observations on a restricted variant of unitary Cayley graphs
modulo n, and the implications for a decomposition of elements of symplectic
operators over the integers modulo n. We define quadratic unitary Cayley graphs
G_n, whose vertex set is the ring Z_n, and where residues a, b modulo n are
adjacent if and only if their difference is a quadratic residue. By bounding
the diameter of such graphs, we show an upper bound on the number of elementary
operations (symplectic scalar multiplications, symplectic row swaps, and row
additions or subtractions) required to decompose a symplectic matrix over Z_n.
We also characterize the conditions on n for G_n to be a perfect graph.
