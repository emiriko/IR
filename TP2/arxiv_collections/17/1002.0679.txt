Photon drag current in monolayer graphene with degenerate electron gas is
studied under interband excitation near the threshold of fundamental
transitions. Two main mechanisms generate an emergence of electron current.
Non-resonant drag effect (NDE) results from direct transfer of in-plane photon
momentum ${\bf q}$ to electron and dependence of matrix elements of transitions
on ${\bf q}$. Resonant drag effect (RDE) originates from ${\bf q}$-dependent
selection of transitions due to a sharp form of the Fermi distribution in
energy. The drag current essentially depends on the polarization of radiation
and, in general, is not parallel to ${\bf q}$. The perpendicular current
component appears if the in-plain electric field is tilted towards
  ${\bf q}$. The RDE has no smallness connected with $q$ and exists in a narrow
region of photon frequency $\omega$:
  $|\hbar\omega-2\epsilon_F|< \hbar sq$, where $s$ is the electron velocity.
