We present a multi-epoch and multi-frequency VLBI study of the compact radio
source J0650+6001. In VLBI images the source is resolved into three components.
The central component shows a flat spectrum, suggesting the presence of the
core, while the two outer regions, with a steeper spectral index, display a
highly asymmetric flux density. The time baseline of the observations
considered to derive the source expansion covers about 15 years. During this
time interval, the distance between the two outer components has increased by
0.28+/-0.13 mas, that corresponds to an apparent separation velocity of
0.39c+/-0.18c and a kinematic age of 360+/-170 years. On the other hand, a
multi-epoch monitoring of the separation between the central and the southern
components points out an apparent contraction of about 0.29+/-0.02 mas,
corresponding to an apparent contraction velocity of 0.37c+/-0.02c. Assuming
that the radio structure is intrinsically symmetric, the high flux density
ratio between the outer components can be explained in terms of Doppler beaming
effects where the mildly relativistic jets are separating with an intrinsic
velocity of 0.43c+/-0.04c at an angle between 12 and 28 degrees to the line of
sight. In this context, the apparent contraction may be interpreted as a knot
in the jet that is moving towards the southern component with an intrinsic
velocity of 0.66c+/-0.03c, and its flux density is boosted by a Doppler factor
of 2.0.
