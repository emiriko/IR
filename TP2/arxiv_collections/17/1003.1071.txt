Examples of the change of neutron shell-structure in both weakly-bound and
resonant neutron one-particle levels in nuclei towards the neutron drip line
are exhibited. It is shown that the shell-structure change due to the weak
binding may lead to the deformation of those nuclei with the neutron numbers $N
\approx$ 8, 20, 28 and 40, which are known to be magic numbers in stable
nuclei. Nuclei in the "island of inversion" are most easily and in a simple
manner understood in terms of deformation. As an example of spectroscopic
properties other than single-particle energies, magnetic moments of some
weakly-bound possibly deformed odd-N nuclei with neutron numbers close to those
traditional magic numbers are given, which are calculated using the wave
function of the last odd particle in deformed Woods-Saxon potentials.
