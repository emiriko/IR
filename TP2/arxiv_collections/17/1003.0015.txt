The thermal emission detected from the millisecond pulsar J0437-4715 is not
explained by standard cooling models of neutron stars without a heating
mechanism. We investigated three heating mechanisms controlled by the
rotational braking of the pulsar: breaking of the solid crust, superfluid
vortex creep, and non-equilibrium reactions ('rotochemical heating'). We find
that the crust cracking mechanism does not produce detectable heating. Given
the dependence of the heating mechanisms on spin-down parameters, which leads
to different temperatures for different pulsars, we study the thermal evolution
for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating 'classical' pulsars and old,
fast rotating millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We find that the rotochemical heating
and vortex creep mechanism can be important both for classical pulsars and
MSPs.
