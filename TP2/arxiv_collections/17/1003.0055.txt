It is well known that many real world networks have the power-law degree
distribution (scale-free property). However there are no rigorous results for
continuous-time quantum walks on such realistic graphs. In this paper, we
analyze space-time behaviors of continuous-time quantum walks and random walks
on the threshold network model which is a reasonable candidate model having
scale-free property. We show that the quantum walker exhibits localization at
the starting point, although the random walker tends to spread uniformly.
