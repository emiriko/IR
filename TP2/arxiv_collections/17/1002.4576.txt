We investigate the p-state mean-field model of the
  Potts glass ($2\le p \le 4$) below the continuous phase transition to a
glassy phase. We find that apart from a solution with a first hierarchical
level of replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB), locally stable close to the
transition point, there is a continuous full replica-symmetry breaking (FRSB)
solution. The latter is marginally stable and has a higher free energy than the
former. We argue that the true equilibrium is reached only by FRSB, being
globally thermodynamically homogeneous, whereas 1RSB is only locally
homogeneous.
