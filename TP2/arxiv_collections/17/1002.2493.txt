During plasma spray process hot droplet of melted metal or ceramic inpinge
cold target. In some processes this target should be destroyed by the thermal
flux. It is why in this report the freezing and layering of the droplet on the
cold substrate is studied with a special interest on the thermal penetration in
the sustrate.
