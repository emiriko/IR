Beta-NMR has been used to study vortex lattice disorder near the surface of
the high-Tc superconductor YBCO. The magnetic field distribution from the
vortex lattice was detected by implanting a low energy beam of highly polarized
8Li into a thin overlayer of silver on optimally doped, twinned and detwinned
YBCO samples. The resonance in Ag broadens significantly below the transition
temperature Tc as expected from the emerging field lines of the vortex lattice
in YBCO. However, the lineshape is more symmetric and the dependence on the
applied magnetic field is much weaker than expected from an ideal vortex
lattice, indicating that the vortex density varies across the face of the
sample, likely due to pinning at twin boundaries. At low temperatures the
broadening from such disorder does not scale with the superfluid density.
