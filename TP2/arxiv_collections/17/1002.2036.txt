Let $\{S_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$ be an iterated function system (IFS) on $\R^d$ with
attractor $K$. Let $(\Sigma,\sigma)$ denote the one-sided full shift over the
alphabet $\{1,..., \ell\}$. We define the projection entropy function $h_\pi$
on the space of invariant measures on $\Sigma$ associated with the coding map
$\pi: \Sigma\to K$, and develop some basic ergodic properties about it. This
concept turns out to be crucial in the study of dimensional properties of
invariant measures on $K$. We show that for any conformal IFS (resp., the
direct product of finitely many conformal IFS), without any separation
condition, the projection of an ergodic measure under $\pi$ is always exactly
dimensional and, its Hausdorff dimension can be represented as the ratio of its
projection entropy to its Lyapunov exponent (resp., the linear combination of
projection entropies associated with several coding maps). Furthermore, for any
conformal IFS and certain affine IFS, we prove a variational principle between
the Hausdorff dimension of the attractors and that of projections of ergodic
measures.
