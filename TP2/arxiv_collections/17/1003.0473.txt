We propose an experimental setup allowing for the characterization of laser
droplet generation in terms of the underlying dynamics, primarily showing that
the latter is deterministically chaotic by means of nonlinear time series
analysis methods. In particular, we use a laser pulse to melt the end of a
properly fed vertically placed metal wire. Due to the interplay of surface
tension, gravity force and light-metal interaction, undulating pendant droplets
are formed at the molten end, which eventually completely detach from the wire
as a consequence of their increasing mass. We capture the dynamics of this
process by employing a high-speed infrared camera, thereby indirectly measuring
the temperature of the wire end and the pendant droplets. The time series is
subsequently generated as the mean value over the pixel intensity of every
infrared snapshot. Finally, we employ methods of nonlinear time series analysis
to reconstruct the phase space from the observed variable and test it against
determinism and stationarity. After establishing that the observed laser
droplet generation is a deterministic and dynamically stationary process, we
calculate the spectra of Lyapunov exponents. We obtain a positive largest
Lyapunov exponent and a negative divergence, i.e., sum of all the exponents,
thus indicating that the observed dynamics is deterministically chaotic with an
attractor as solution in the phase space. In addition to characterizing the
dynamics of laser droplet generation, we outline industrial applications of the
process and point out the significance of our findings for future attempts at
mathematical modeling.
