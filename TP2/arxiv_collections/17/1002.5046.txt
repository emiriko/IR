A simple kinematic model for the trajectories of Listeria monocytogenes is
generalized to a dynamical system rich enough to exhibit the resonant Hopf
bifurcation structure of excitable media and simple enough to be studied
geometrically. It is shown how L. monocytogenes trajectories and meandering
spiral waves are organized by the same type of attracting set.
