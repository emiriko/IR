The outcome of competition among species is influenced by the spatial
distribution of species and effects such as demographic stochasticity,
immigration fluxes, and the existence of preferred habitats. We introduce an
individual-based model describing the competition of two species and
incorporating all the above ingredients. We find that the presence of habitat
preference --- generating spatial niches --- strongly stabilizes the
coexistence of the two species. Eliminating habitat preference --- neutral
dynamics --- the model generates patterns, such as distribution of population
sizes, practically identical to those obtained in the presence of habitat
preference, provided an higher immigration rate is considered. Notwithstanding
the similarity in the population distribution, we show that invasibility
properties depend on habitat preference in a non-trivial way. In particular,
the neutral model results results more invasible or less invasible depending on
whether the comparison is made at equal immigration rate or at equal
distribution of population size, respectively. We discuss the relevance of
these results for the interpretation of invasibility experiments and the
species occupancy of preferred habitats.
