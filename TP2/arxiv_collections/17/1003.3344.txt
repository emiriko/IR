The Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations can be
generalized from a neo-institutional model of networks to a neo-evolutionary
model of how three selection environments operate upon one another. The
neo-evolutionary model enables us to appreciate both organizational integration
in university-industry-government relations and differentiation among functions
like the generation of intellectual capital, creation of wealth, and their
attending legislation. The specification of innovation systems in terms of
nations, sectors, cities, and regions can then be formulated as empirical
questions: is synergy generated among functions in networks of relations? This
Triple Helix model enables us to study the knowledge base of an urban economy
in terms of a trade-off between locally stabilized and (potentially locked-in)
trajectories versus the techno-economic and cultural development regimes which
work with one more degree of freedom at the global level. The meta-stabilizing
potentials of urban technologies between these two levels can be used
reflexively as the intelligence of a creative reconstruction making cities
smart(er).
