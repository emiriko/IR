We construct coherent states of a nonrelativistic electron in the
magnetic-solenoid field, which is a superposition of the Aharonov-Bohm field
and a collinear uniform magnetic field. In the problem under consideration
there are two kind of coherent states, the first kind corresponds to classical
trajectories which embrace the solenoid and the second one to trajectories
which do not. Mean coordinates in the constructed coherent states are moving
along classical trajectories, the coherent states maintain their form under the
time evolution, and represent a complete set of functions, which can be useful
in semi classical calculations. In the absence of the Aharonov-Bohm filed these
states are reduced to the well-known in the case of uniform magnetic field
Malkin-Man'ko coherent states.
