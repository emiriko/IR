We study the conformational behavior of a polymer adsorbed at an attractive
nanostring and construct the complete structural phase diagram in dependence of
the binding strength and effective thickness of the string. For this purpose,
Monte Carlo optimization techniques are employed to identify lowest-energy
structures for a coarse-grained hybrid polymer-wire model. Among the
representative conformations in the different phases are, for example, compact
droplets attached to the string and also nanotube-like monolayer films wrapping
the string in a very ordered way. We here systematically analyze low-energy
shapes and structural order parameters to elucidate the transitions between the
structural phases.
