An unrepresentable cohomological functor of finite type of the bounded
derived category of coherent sheaves of a compact complex manifold of dimension
greater than one with no proper closed subvariety is given explicitly in
categorical terms. This is a partial generalization of an impressive result due
to Bondal and Van den Bergh.
