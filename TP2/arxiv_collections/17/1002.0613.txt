One can imagine a number of mechanisms that could be the cause of
brighter/fainter segments of jets. In a sense, jets might be easier to
understand if they were featureless. However we observe a wide variety of
structures which we call "knots". By considering the ramifications of the
various scenarios for the creation of knots, we determine which ones or which
classes are favored by the currently available multiwavelength data.
