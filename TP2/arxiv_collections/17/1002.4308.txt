Wave mechanics of a particle in an impenetrable spherical cavity with and
without a hard core scattering potential of size $\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$ $\to$
0) at its center is critically analyzed. It makes marginal but important
modifications in our present understanding of the energy eigenvalues of such
particles.
