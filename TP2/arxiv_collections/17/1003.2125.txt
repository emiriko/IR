We present the experimental quantum tomography of 7- and 8-dimensional
quantum systems based on projective measurements in the mutually unbiased basis
(MUB-QT). One of the advantages of MUB-QT is that it requires projections from
a minimal number of bases to be performed. In our scheme, the higher
dimensional quantum systems are encoded using the propagation modes of single
photons, and we take advantage of the capabilities of amplitude- and
phase-modulation of programmable spatial light modulators to implement the
MUB-QT.
