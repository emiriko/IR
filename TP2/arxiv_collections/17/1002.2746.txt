This paper explores the use of negative (i.e., repulsive) interaction the
abstract Tile Assembly Model defined by Winfree. Winfree postulated negative
interactions to be physically plausible in his Ph.D. thesis, and Reif, Sahu,
and Yin explored their power in the context of reversible attachment
operations. We explore the power of negative interactions with irreversible
attachments, and we achieve two main results. Our first result is an
impossibility theorem: after t steps of assembly, Omega(t) tiles will be
forever bound to an assembly, unable to detach. Thus negative glue strengths do
not afford unlimited power to reuse tiles. Our second result is a positive one:
we construct a set of tiles that can simulate a Turing machine with space bound
s and time bound t, while ensuring that no intermediate assembly grows larger
than O(s), rather than O(s * t) as required by the standard Turing machine
simulation with tiles.
