A challenge for programming language research is to design and implement
multi-threaded low-level languages providing static guarantees for memory
safety and freedom from data races. Towards this goal, we present a concurrent
language employing safe region-based memory management and hierarchical locking
of regions. Both regions and locks are treated uniformly, and the language
supports ownership transfer, early deallocation of regions and early release of
locks in a safe manner.
