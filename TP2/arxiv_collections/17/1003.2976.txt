We study strategy improvement algorithms for mean-payoff and parity games. We
describe a structural property of these games, and we show that these
structures can affect the behaviour of strategy improvement. We show how
awareness of these structures can be used to accelerate strategy improvement
algorithms. We call our algorithms non-oblivious because they remember
properties of the game that they have discovered in previous iterations. We
show that non-oblivious strategy improvement algorithms perform well on
examples that are known to be hard for oblivious strategy improvement. Hence,
we argue that previous strategy improvement algorithms fail because they ignore
the structural properties of the game that they are solving.
