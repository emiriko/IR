In this paper, we consider band-structure calculations governed by the
Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials.
Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since
they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in
complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which
are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically
replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic
Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to
resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem by means of a
new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function
alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell
itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few
neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid.
This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids
spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image
structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily
and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration,
generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of
divergent lattice sums.
