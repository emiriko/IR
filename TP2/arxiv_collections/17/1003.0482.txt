We study the universality issue of the transverse momentum dependent parton
distributions at small-x, by comparing the initial/final state interaction
effects in dijet-correlation in pA collisions with those in deep inelastic
lepton nucleus scattering. We demonstrate the non-universality by performing an
explicit calculation in a particular model where the multiple gauge boson
exchange contributions are summed up to all orders. We comment on the
implications of our results on the theoretical interpretation of di-hadron
correlation in dA collisions in terms of the saturation phenomena in deep
inelastic lepton nucleus scattering.
