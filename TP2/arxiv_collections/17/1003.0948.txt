We show that a large class of helium-containing cold polar molecules form
readily in a cryogenic buffer gas, achieving densities as high as 10^12 cm^-3.
We explore the spin relaxation of these molecules in buffer gas loaded magnetic
traps, and identify a loss mechanism based on Landau-Zener transitions arising
from the anisotropic hyperfine interaction. Our results show that the recently
observed strong T^6 thermal dependence of spin change in buffer gas trapped
silver (Ag) is accounted for by the formation and spin change of AgHe, thus
providing evidence for molecular formation in a buffer gas trap.
