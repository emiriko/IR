Using the first principles calculations, we show that mechanically tunable
electronic energy gap is realizable in bilayer graphene if different
homogeneous strains are applied to the two layers. It is shown that the size of
energy gap can be simply controlled by adjusting the strength and direction of
these strains. We also show that the effect originates from the occurrence of
strain-induced pseudo-scalar potentials in graphene. When homogeneous strains
with different strengths are applied to each layer of bilayer graphene,
transverse electric fields across the two layers can be generated without any
external electronic sources, thereby opening an energy gap. The results
demonstrate a simple mechanical method of realizing pseudo-electromagnetism in
graphene and suggest a maneuverable approach to fabrication of
electromechanical devices based on bilayer graphene.
