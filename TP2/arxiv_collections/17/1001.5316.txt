This paper is devoted to study the gravitational charged perfect fluid
collapse in the Friedmann universe models with cosmological constant. For this
purpose, we assume that the electromagnetic field is so weak that it does not
introduce any distortion into the geometry of the spacetime. The results
obtained from the junction conditions between the Friedmann and the
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m de-Sitter spacetimes are used to solve the field
equations. Further, the singularity structure and mass effects of the
collapsing system on time difference between the formation of apparent horizons
and singularity have been studied. This analysis provides the validity of
Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis. It is found that the electric field affects the
area of apparent horizons and their time of formation.
