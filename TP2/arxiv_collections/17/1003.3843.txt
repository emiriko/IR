Previous results from the authors concerning the arising a tiny photon
anomalous paramagnetic moment are also interpreted as a red-shift in analogy to
the gravitational known effect. It is due to the photon interaction with the
magnetized virtual electron-positron background which withdraw transverse
momentum from photons and is polarization-dependent. If the photon frequency
red-shift implies a change in time, a clock would go faster for increasing
magnetic field intensity.
