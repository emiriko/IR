The C Object System (Cos) is a small C library which implements high-level
concepts available in Clos, Objc and other object-oriented programming
languages: uniform object model (class, meta-class and property-metaclass),
generic functions, multi-methods, delegation, properties, exceptions, contracts
and closures. Cos relies on the programmable capabilities of the C programming
language to extend its syntax and to implement the aforementioned concepts as
first-class objects. Cos aims at satisfying several general principles like
simplicity, extensibility, reusability, efficiency and portability which are
rarely met in a single programming language. Its design is tuned to provide
efficient and portable implementation of message multi-dispatch and message
multi-forwarding which are the heart of code extensibility and reusability.
With COS features in hand, software should become as flexible and extensible as
with scripting languages and as efficient and portable as expected with C
programming. Likewise, Cos concepts should significantly simplify adaptive and
aspect-oriented programming as well as distributed and service-oriented
computing
