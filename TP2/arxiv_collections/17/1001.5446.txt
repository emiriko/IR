The two-pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions has been studied by
exclusive and kinematically complete experiments from threshold up to $T_p$ =
1.36 GeV at CELSIUS-WASA. At near-threshold energies the total and differential
distributions for the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^0\pi^0$ channels are dominated by
Roper excitation and its decay into $N\sigma$ and $\Delta\pi$ channels. At beam
energies $T_p >$ 1.1 GeV the $\Delta\Delta$ excitation governs the two-pion
production process. In the $\pi^+\pi^+$ channel evidence is found for the
excitation of a higher-lying I=3/2 resonance, favorably the $\Delta(1600)$. The
isovector fusion processes leading to the deuteron and to quasi-stable $^2$He,
respectively, %with the production of an isovector pion-pair exhibit no or only
a modest ABC-effect, {\it i.e.} low-mass enhancement in the $\pi\pi$-invariant
mass spectrum, and can be described by conventional $t$-channel $\Delta\Delta$
excitation. On the other hand, the isoscalar fusion process to the deuteron
%with the production of an isoscalar pion-pair exhibits a dramatic ABC-effect
correlated with a narrow resonance-like energy dependence in the total cross
section with a width of only 50 MeV and situated at a mass 90 MeV below the
$\Delta\Delta$ mass.
