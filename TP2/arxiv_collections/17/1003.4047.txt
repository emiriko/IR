We present results from an on-going survey for the HI 21 cm line and the OH
18 cm lines in IR galaxies with the Arecibo 305 m Radio Telescope. The
observations of 85 galaxies extracted from the 2 Jy IRAS-NVSS sample in the
R.A. (B1950) range 20 h-00 h are reported in this paper. We detected the HI 21
cm line in 82 of these galaxies, with 18 being new detections, and the OH 18 cm
lines in 7 galaxies, with 4 being new detections. In some cases, the HI spectra
show the classic double-horned or single-peaked emission profiles. However, the
majority exhibit distorted HI spectral features indicating that the galaxies
are in interacting and/or merging systems. From these HI and OH observations,
various properties of the sample are derived and reported.
