Compensational gravity, which is regarded as a fundamental theory, is an
advanced version of semiclassical gravity. It is a construction which extends
the Einstein equation. Along with the energy-momentum tensor, the extended
Einstein equation includes the compensation tensor, or compenson. The latter
compensates for the energy-momentum tensor insufficiency, which consists in the
discontinuity in time (due to quantum state reduction) and in space (due to
sharp cutoff), as well as in an anomaly (nonrealistic state equation and
nonzero divergence). The compenson is a primary object, for which equations are
formulated. Specifically, purely dark objects may or may not exist. The
dynamics of compensational gravity gives rise naturally to the cosmological
constant, or dark energy and to dark matter: The compenson versus particle dark
matter. On the basis of the dynamics, a cycling model of the closed universe is
constructed.
