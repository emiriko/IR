It is established that if a time series satisfies the Berman condition, and
another related (summability) condition, the result of filtering that series
through a certain type of filter also satisfies the two conditions. In
particular it follows that if $X_t$ satisfies the two conditions and if $X_t$
and $a_t$ are related by an invertible ARMA model, then the $a_t$ satisfy the
two conditions.
