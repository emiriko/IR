I study the dynamics of the violation of the CHSH inequality for two qubits
interacting with a common zero-temperature non-Markovian environment. I
demonstrate sudden violation of the inequality for two qubits initially
prepared in a factorized state. Due to the strong coupling between the qubits
and the reservoir, the dynamics is characterized by numerous sharp revivals.
Furthermore I focus on a more realistic physical system in which the
spontaneous emission for the qubits is taken into account. When including
spontaneous emission even for small decay parameters, revivals in the violation
are heavily damped out. If the decay rates exceed a certain threshold, the
inequality turns out to be always satisfied.
