This paper reviews our growing understanding of the physics behind coronal
heating (in open-field regions) and the acceleration of the solar wind. Many
new insights have come from the last solar cycle's worth of observations and
theoretical work. Measurements of the plasma properties in the extended corona,
where the primary solar wind acceleration occurs, have been key to
discriminating between competing theories. We describe how UVCS/SOHO
measurements of coronal holes and streamers over the last 14 years have
provided clues about the detailed kinetic processes that energize both fast and
slow wind regions. We also present a brief survey of current ideas involving
the coronal source regions of fast and slow wind streams, and how these change
over the solar cycle. These source regions are discussed in the context of
recent theoretical models (based on Alfven waves and MHD turbulence) that have
begun to successfully predict both the heating and acceleration in fast and
slow wind regions with essentially no free parameters. Some new results
regarding these models - including a quantitative prediction of the lower
density and temperature at 1 AU seen during the present solar minimum in
comparison to the prior minimum - are also shown.
