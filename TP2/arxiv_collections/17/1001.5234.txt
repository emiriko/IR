An asymmetric preparation of the quantum states sent through a noisy channel
can enable a new way to monitor and actively compensate the channel noise. The
paradigm of such an asymmetric treatment of quantum information is the Bennett
1992 protocol, in which the ratio between conclusive and inconclusive counts is
in direct connection with the channel noise. Using this protocol as a guiding
example, we show how to correct the phase drift of a communication channel
without using reference pulses, interruptions of the quantum transmission or
public data exchanges.
