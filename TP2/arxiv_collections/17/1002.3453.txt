Our primary motivation is the comparison of two different traditions used in
ICC to characterize the class FPTIME of the polynomial time computable
functions. On one side, FPTIME can be captured by Intuitionistic Light Affine
Logic (ILAL), a logic derived from Linear Logic, characterized by the
structural invariant Stratification. On the other side, FPTIME can be captured
by Safe Recursion on Notation (SRN), an algebra of functions based on
Predicative Recursion, a restriction of the standard recursion schema used to
defiine primitive recursive functions. Stratifiication and Predicative
Recursion seem to share common underlying principles, whose study is the main
subject of this work.
