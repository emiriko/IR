We address very briefly five critical points in the context of the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) scheme: 1) the impossibility to consider it as an
interaction, 2) a possible inconsistency of correlation corrections as, e.g.,
the center-of-mass correction, 3) problems to describe the giant dipole
resonance (GDR) simultaneously in light and heavy nuclei, 4) deficiencies in
the extrapolation of binding energies to super-heavy elements (SHE), and 5) a
yet inappropriate trend in fission life-times when going to the heaviest SHE.
While the first two points have more a formal bias, the other three points have
practical implications and wait for solution.
