We present, for both minkowskian and euclidean signatures, short derivations
of the diagonal Einstein metrics for Bianchi type II, III and V. For the first
two cases we show the integrability of the geodesic flow while for the third
case a somewhat unusual bifurcation phenomenon takes place: for minkowskian
signature elliptic functions are essential in the metric while for euclidean
signature only elementary functions appear.
