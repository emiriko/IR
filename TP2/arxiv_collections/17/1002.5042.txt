Wave packets provide a well established and versatile tool for studying
time-dependent effects in molecular physics. Here, we demonstrate the
application of wave packets to mesoscopic nanodevices at low temperatures. The
electronic transport in the devices is expressed in terms of scattering and
transmission coefficients, which are efficiently obtained by solving an initial
value problem (IVP) using the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The
formulation as an IVP makes non-trivial device topologies accessible and by
tuning the wave packet parameters one can extract the scattering properties for
a large range of energies.
