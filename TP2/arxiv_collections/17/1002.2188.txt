Proton recoil polarization was measured in the quasielastic 4He(e,e'p)3H
reaction at Q^2 = 0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 with unprecedented precision.
The polarization-transfer coefficients are found to differ from those of the
1H(e,e' p) reaction, contradicting a relativistic distorted-wave approximation,
and favoring either the inclusion of medium-modified proton form factors
predicted by the quark-meson coupling model or a spin-dependent charge-exchange
final-state interaction. For the first time, the polarization-transfer ratio is
studied as a function of the virtuality of the proton.
