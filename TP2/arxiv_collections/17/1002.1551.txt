We report on a time-dependent Lippmann-Schwinger scattering theory that
allows us to study the transport spectroscopy in a time-modulated double
quantum point contact system in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field.
Magnetotransport properties involving inter-subband and inter-sideband
transitions are tunable by adjusting the time-modulated split-gates and the
applied magnetic field. The observed magnetic field induced Fano resonance
feature may be useful for the application of quantum switching.
