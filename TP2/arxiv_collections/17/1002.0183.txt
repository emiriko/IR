A multilateral Bailey Lemma is proved, and multiple analogues of the
Rogers--Ramanujan identities and Euler's Pentagonal Theorem are constructed as
applications. The extreme cases of the Andrews--Gordon identities are also
generalized using the multilateral Bailey Lemma where their final form is
written in terms of determinants of theta functions.
