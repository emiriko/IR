We extend the recently developed converse NMR approach [T. Thonhauser, D.
Ceresoli, A. Mostofi, N. Marzari, R. Resta, and D. Vanderbilt, J. Chem. Phys.
\textbf{131}, 101101 (2009)] such that it can be used in conjunction with
norm-conserving, non-local pseudopotentials. This extension permits the
efficient ab-initio calculation of NMR chemical shifts for elements other than
hydrogen within the convenience of a plane-wave pseudopotential approach. We
have tested our approach on several finite and periodic systems, finding very
good agreement with established methods and experimental results.
