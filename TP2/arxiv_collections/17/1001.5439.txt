We present in this talk a recent investigation on a unified approach within
the framework of a hard-wall model of AdS/QCD. We first study a theoretical
inconsistency in existing models. In order to remove this inconsistency, we
propose a unified approach in which the mesons and the nucleons are treated on
the same footing, the same infrared (IR) cutoff being employed in both
fermionic and bosonic sectors. We also suggest a possible way of improving the
model by introducing a five-dimensional anomalous dimension.
