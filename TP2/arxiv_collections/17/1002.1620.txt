We find a general solution to the unique 7th order ODE admitting ten
dimensional group of contact symmetries. The integral curves of this ODE are
rational contact curves in $\PP^3$ which give rise to rational plane curves of
degree six. The moduli space of these curves is a real form of the homogeneous
space $Sp(4)/SL(2)$.
