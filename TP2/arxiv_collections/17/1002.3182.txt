This study experimentally investigates the temperature dependence of
superheating field, Hsh, of niobium. Accurately determining this field is
important both to test theory and to understand gradient limits in
superconducting cavities for particle accelerators. This paper discusses
theories that have been proposed in modeling the field and discriminates
between them. The experimental procedure for measuring the temperature
dependence of Hsh utilizes high power pulses to drive a niobium cavity
resonator, ramping up surface magnetic fields extremely quickly. The moment any
part of the cavity transitions between the superconducting and normal
conducting state can be determined by measuring the quality factor of the
cavity as a function of time. Oscillating superleak transducers are used to
demonstrate that the transition to the normal conducting state is global in
nature, showing that a fundamental limit is encountered. Finally, we see that
110-120 C heat treatment of the cavity--a method commonly used to increase the
quality factor at high accelerating gradients--may have the deleterious effect
of reducing the superheating field of the material, which is the fundamental
limiting factor in pursuing the maximal achievable accelerating gradient in
superconducting niobium cavities.
