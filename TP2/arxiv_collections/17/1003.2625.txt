We present a class of realistic unified models based on supersymmetric SO(10)
wherein issues related to natural doublet-triplet (DT) splitting are fully
resolved. Using a minimal set of low dimensional Higgs fields which includes a
single adjoint, we show that the Dimopoulos--Wilzcek mechanism for DT splitting
can be made stable in the presence of all higher order operators without having
pseudo-Goldstone bosons and flat directions. The \mu term of order TeV is found
to be naturally induced. A Z_2-assisted anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry plays a
crucial role in achieving these results. The threshold corrections to
alpha_3(M_Z), somewhat surprisingly, are found to be controlled by only a few
effective parameters. This leads to a very predictive scenario for proton
decay. As a novel feature, we find an interesting correlation between the d=6
(p\to e^+\pi^0) and d=5 (p\to \nu-bar K+) decay amplitudes which allows us to
derive a constrained upper limit on the inverse rate of the e^+\pi^0 mode. Our
results show that both modes should be observed with an improvement in the
current sensitivity by about a factor of five to ten.
