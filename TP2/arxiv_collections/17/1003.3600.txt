We review recent results on the properties of materials with correlated
electrons obtained within the LDA+DMFT approach, a combination of a
conventional band structure approach based on the local density approximation
(LDA) and the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The application to four
outstanding problems in this field is discussed: (i) we compute the full
valence band structure of the charge-transfer insulator NiO by explicitly
including the p-d hybridization, (ii) we explain the origin for the
simultaneously occuring metal-insulator transition and collapse of the magnetic
moment in MnO and Fe2O3, (iii) we describe a novel GGA+DMFT scheme in terms of
plane-wave pseudopotentials which allows us to compute the orbital order and
cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion in KCuF3 and LaMnO3, and (iv) we provide a
general explanation for the appearance of kinks in the effective dispersion of
correlated electrons in systems with a pronounced three-peak spectral function
without having to resort to the coupling of electrons to bosonic excitations.
These results provide a considerable progress in the fully microscopic
investigations of correlated electron materials.
