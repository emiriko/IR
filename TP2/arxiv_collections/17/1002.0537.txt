We consider a hypothetical topological quantum computer where the qubits are
comprised of either Ising or Fibonacci anyons. For each case, we calculate the
time and number of qubits (space) necessary to execute the most computationally
expensive step of Shor's algorithm, modular exponentiation. For Ising anyons,
we apply Bravyi's distillation method [S. Bravyi, Phys. Rev. A 73, 042313
(2006)] which combines topological and non-topological operations to allow for
universal quantum computation. With reasonable restrictions on the physical
parameters we find that factoring a 128 bit number requires approximately 10^3
Fibonacci anyons versus at least 3 x 10^9 Ising anyons. Other distillation
algorithms could reduce the resources for Ising anyons substantially.
