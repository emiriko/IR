Thermal control of exchange coupling between two strongly ferromagnetic
layers through a weakly ferromagnetic Ni-Cu spacer and the associated
magnetoresistance is investigated. The spacer, having a Curie point slightly
above room temperature, can be cycled between its paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic states by varying the temperature externally or using joule
heating. It is shown that the giant magnetoresistance vanishes due to a strong
reduction of the mean free path in the spacer at above ~30 % Ni concentration
-- before the onset of ferromagnetism. Finally, a device is proposed and
demonstrated which combines thermally controlled exchange coupling and large
magnetoresistance by separating the switching and the read out elements.
