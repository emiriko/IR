We construct a two-parameter family of B\"acklund transformations for the
trigonometric classical Gaudin magnet. The approach follows closely the one
introduced by E.Sklyanin and V.Kuznetsov (1998,1999) in a number of seminal
papers, and takes advantage of the intimate relation between the trigonometric
and the rational case. As in the paper by A.Hone, V.Kuznetsov and one of the
authors (O.R.) (2001) the B\"acklund transformations are presented as explicit
symplectic maps, starting from their Lax representation. The (expected)
connection with the XXZ Heisenberg chain is established and the rational case
is recovered in a suitable limit. It is shown how to obtain a "physical"
transformation mapping real variables into real variables. The interpolating
Hamiltonian flow is derived and some numerical iterations of the map are
presented.
