An unusual but effective way to determine at threshold the dpi -> NN
transition strength is to exploit the hadronic ground-state broadening in
pionic deuterium, accessible by x-ray spectroscopy. The broadening is dominated
by the true absorption channel dpi- -> nn, which is related to s-wave pion
production pp -> dpi+ by charge symmetry and detailed balance. Using the exotic
atom circumvents the problem of Coulomb corrections to the cross section as
necessary in the production experiments. Our dedicated measurement finds
(1171+23/-49) meV for the broadening yielding (252+5/-11) \mub.
