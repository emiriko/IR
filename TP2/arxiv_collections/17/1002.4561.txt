We describe an algorithm for Byzantine agreement that is scalable in the
sense that each processor sends only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits, where $n$ is
the total number of processors. Our algorithm succeeds with high probability
against an \emph{adaptive adversary}, which can take over processors at any
time during the protocol, up to the point of taking over arbitrarily close to a
1/3 fraction. We assume synchronous communication but a \emph{rushing}
adversary. Moreover, our algorithm works in the presence of flooding:
processors controlled by the adversary can send out any number of messages. We
assume the existence of private channels between all pairs of processors but
make no other cryptographic assumptions. Finally, our algorithm has latency
that is polylogarithmic in $n$. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement against an adaptive adversary, while
requiring $o(n^{2})$ total bits of communication.
