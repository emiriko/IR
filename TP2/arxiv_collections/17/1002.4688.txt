The extended Toda hierarchy of Carlet, Dubrovin and Zhang is reconsidered in
the light of a 2+1D extension of the 1D Toda hierarchy constructed by Ogawa.
These two extensions of the 1D Toda hierarchy turn out to have a very similar
structure, and the former may be thought of as a kind of dimensional reduction
of the latter. In particular, this explains an origin of the mysterious
structure of the bilinear formalism proposed by Milanov.
