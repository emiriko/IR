Two representations of a reductive group G are spectrally equivalent if the
same irreducible representations appear in both of them. The semigroup of
finite dimensional representations of G with tensor product and up to spectral
equivalence is a rather complicated object. We show that the Grothendieck group
of this semigroup is more tractable and give a description of it in terms of
moment polytopes of representations. As a corollary, we give a proof of the
Kazarnovskii theorem on the number of solutions in G of a system f_1(x) = ... =
f_m(x) = 0, where m=dim(G) and each f_i is a generic function in the space of
matrix elements of a representation pi_i of G.
