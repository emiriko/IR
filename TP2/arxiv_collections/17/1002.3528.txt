The lack of structure greater than 10 Gpc/h in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) favours
compact Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models of the Universe. The
present best candidates based on observations are the Poincare dodecahedral
space S^3/I^* and the 3-torus T^3. The residual gravity effect favours the
Poincare space, while a measure space argument where the density parameter is a
derived parameter favours flat spaces almost surely.
