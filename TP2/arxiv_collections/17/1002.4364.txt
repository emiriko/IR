Higher order Delaunay triangulations are a generalization of the Delaunay
triangulation which provides a class of well-shaped triangulations, over which
extra criteria can be optimized. A triangulation is order-$k$ Delaunay if the
circumcircle of each triangle of the triangulation contains at most $k$ points.
In this paper we study lower and upper bounds on the number of higher order
Delaunay triangulations, as well as their expected number for randomly
distributed points. We show that arbitrarily large point sets can have a single
higher order Delaunay triangulation, even for large orders, whereas for first
order Delaunay triangulations, the maximum number is $2^{n-3}$. Next we show
that uniformly distributed points have an expected number of at least
$2^{\rho_1 n(1+o(1))}$ first order Delaunay triangulations, where $\rho_1$ is
an analytically defined constant ($\rho_1 \approx 0.525785$), and for $k > 1$,
the expected number of order-$k$ Delaunay triangulations (which are not
order-$i$ for any $i < k$) is at least $2^{\rho_k n(1+o(1))}$, where $\rho_k$
can be calculated numerically.
