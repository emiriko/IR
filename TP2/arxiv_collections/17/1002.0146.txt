We review a variety of theoretical and experimental investigations aimed at
improving our knowledge of the nuclear matter equation of state. Of particular
interest are nuclear matter extreme states in terms of density and/or isospin
asymmetry. The equation of state of matter with unequal concentrations of
protons and neutrons has numerous applications. These include heavy-ion
collisions, the physics of rare, short-lived nuclei and, on a dramatically
different scale, the physics of neutron stars. The "common denominator" among
these (seemingly) very different systems is the symmetry energy, which plays a
crucial role in both the formation of the neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei
and the radius of a neutron star (a system 18 orders of magnitude larger and 55
orders of magnitude heavier). The details of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy are not yet sufficiently constrained. Throughout this article,
our emphasis will be on the importance of adopting a microscopic approach to
the many-body problem, which we believe to be the one with true predictive
power.
