In this paper we propose scalable proxy servers cluster architecture of
interconnected proxy servers for high quality and high availability services.
We also propose an optimal regional popularity based video prefix replication
strategy and a scene change based replica caching algorithm that utilizes the
zipf-like video popularity distribution to maximize the availability of videos
closer to the client and request-servicing rate thereby reducing the client
rejection ratio and the response time for the client. The simulation results of
our proposed architecture and algorithm show the greater achievement in
maximizing the availability of videos, client request-servicing rate and in
reduction of initial start-up latency and client rejection ratio.
