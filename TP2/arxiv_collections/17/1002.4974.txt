A modified formulation of the Electroweak Model with 3-dimensional spherical
geometry in the target space is suggested. The {\it free} Lagrangian in the
spherical field space along with the standard gauge field Lagrangian form the
full Higgsless Lagrangian of the model, whose second order terms reproduce the
same experimentally verified fields with the same masses as the Standard
Electroweak Model. The vector bosons masses are automatically generated, so
there is no need in special mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
  The limiting case of the modified Higgsless Electroweak Model, which
corresponds to the contracted gauge group $SU(2;j)\times U(1)$ is discussed.
Within framework of the limit model Z-boson, electromagnetic and electron
fields are interpreted as an external ones with respect to W-bosons and
neutrino fields. The W-bosons and neutrino fields do not effect on these
external fields. The masses of all particles remain the same, but the field
interactions in contracted model are more simple as compared with the standard
Electroweak Model due to nullification of some terms.
