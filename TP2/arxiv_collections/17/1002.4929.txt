We study the effects of a scalar condensate on a class of 2+1 dimensional
non- Fermi liquids by introducing fermionic probes in the corresponding
asymptotically AdS4 black hole backgrounds. For the range of parameters and
couplings we consider we find gapless fermionic excitations whose properties
are model-dependent.
