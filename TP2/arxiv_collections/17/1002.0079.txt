A novel conductance oscillation in a twisted quantum ring composed of a
helical atomic configuration is theoretically predicted. Internal torsion of
the ring is found to cause a quantum phase shift in the wavefunction that
describes the electron's motion along the ring. The resulting conductance
oscillation is free from magnetic flux penetrating inside the ring, which is in
complete contrast with the ordinary Aharonov-Bohm effect observed in untwisted
quantum rings.
