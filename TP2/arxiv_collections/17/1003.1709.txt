A theory for the relation between the spin polarization and luminescence in
silicon is presented. The theory provides intuitive relations for
phonon-assisted optical transitions between the conduction and valence band
edges. It is shown that an opposite behavior of longitudinal and transverse
optical phonon-assisted transitions is responsible to recent experimental
results of spin injection into silicon. The effects of spin-orbit coupling and
doping are studied in detail.
