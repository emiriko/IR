Based on time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory, a new inverse quasifission
mechanism is proposed to produce neutron-rich transfermium nuclei, in collision
of prolate deformed actinides. Calculations show that collision of the tip of
one nucleus with the side of the other results in a nucleon flux toward the
latter. The role of nucleon evaporation and impact parameter, as well as the
collision time are discussed.
