Very recent analysis of the radio spectral index and high energy observations
have shown that the two-peak accretion/ejection microquasar model applies for
LSI+61303. The fast variations of the position angle observed with MERLIN and
confirmed by consecutive VLBA images must therefore be explained in the context
of the microquasar scenario. We calculate what could be the precessional period
for the accretion disk in LSI+61303 under tidal forces of the Be star
(P_{tidal-forces}) or under the effect of frame dragging produced by the
rotation of the compact object (P_{Lense-Thirring}). P_{tidal-forces}$ is more
than one year. P_{Lense-Thirring} depends on the truncated radius of the
accretion disk, $R_{tr}$. We determined R_{tr}=300 r_g for observed QPO at 2
Hz. This value is much above the few $r_g$, where the Bardeen-Petterson effect
should align the midplane of the disk. For this truncated radius of the
accretion disk P_{Lense-Thirring} for a slow rotator results in a few days.
Therefore, Lense-Thirring precession induced by a slowly rotating compact
object could be compatible with the daily variations of the ejecta angle
observed in LSI+61303.
