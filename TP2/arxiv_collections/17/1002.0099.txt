We demonstrate that a distinct high-disorder anomalous Hall effect phase
emerges at the correlated insulator threshold of ultra-thin, amorphous,
ferromagnetic CNi3 films. In the weak localization regime, where the sheet
conductance G >> e^2/h, the anomalous Hall resistance of the films increases
with increasing disorder and the Hall conductance scales as Gxy ~ G^1.6.
However, at sufficiently high disorder the system begins to enter the 2D
correlated insulator regime, at which point the Hall resistance Rxy abruptly
saturates and the scaling exponent becomes 2. Tunneling measurements show that
the saturation behavior is commensurate with the emergence of the 2D Coulomb
gap, suggesting that e-e interactions mediate the high-disorder phase.
