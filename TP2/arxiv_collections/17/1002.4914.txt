Much progress in realistic modeling of core-collapse supernovae has occurred
recently through the availability of multi-teraflop machines and the increasing
sophistication of supernova codes. These improvements are enabling simulations
with enough realism that the explosion mechanism, long a mystery, may soon be
delineated. We briefly describe the CHIMERA code, a supernova code we have
developed to simulate core-collapse supernovae in 1, 2, and 3 spatial
dimensions. We then describe the results of an ongoing suite of 2D simulations
initiated from a 12, 15, 20, and 25 solar mass progenitor. These have all
exhibited explosions and are currently in the expanding phase with the shock at
between 5,000 and 20,000 km. We also briefly describe an ongoing simulation in
3 spatial dimensions initiated from the 15 solar mass progenitor.
