We report on epitaxial growth of single-phase
[Pb(Zr0.57Ti0.43)O3]0.8[Pb(Fe2/3W1/3)O3]0.2 (PZT-PFW) solid-solution thin films
using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the
films have a tetragonal structure. The films exhibit ferroelectric properties
and weak ferromagnetic responses at room temperature. Magnetoelectric effects
were investigated; the nonlinear magnetoelectric coefficient was measured and
found to be comparable to those of multiferroic hexagonal manganites, but at
least two orders of magnitude smaller than that for polycrystalline PZT-PFW
films.
