Cobalt-containing deposits from Cobalt carbonyl are experimentally produced
and their composition is measured. The Cobalt concentration is found to be
readily tunable between 20 and 70 at.% by variation of the dwell time. The
variations in metallic concentration are explained by co-deposition of
hydrocarbons present in the chamber background pressure.
