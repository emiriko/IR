The theory of monotonicity and duality is developed for general
one-dimensional Feller processes. Moreover it is shown that local monotonicity
conditions (conditions on the L\'evy kernel) are sufficient to prove the
well-posedness of the corresponding Markov semigroup and process, including
unbounded coefficients and processes on the half-line.
