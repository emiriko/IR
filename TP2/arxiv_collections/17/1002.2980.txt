We derive a version of the virial theorem that is applicable to diatomic
planetary atmospheres that are in approximate thermal equilibrium at moderate
temperatures and pressures and are sufficiently thin such that the
gravitational acceleration can be considered constant. We contrast a
pedagogically inclined theoretical presentation with the actual measured
properties of air.
