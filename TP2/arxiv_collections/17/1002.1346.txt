Much of the surface of Mars is covered by dunes, ripples, and other features
formed by the blowing of sand by wind, known as saltation. In addition,
saltation loads the atmosphere with dust aerosols, which dominate the Martian
climate. We show here that saltation can be maintained on Mars by wind speeds
an order of magnitude less than required to initiate it. We further show that
the resulting hysteresis effect causes saltation to occur for much lower wind
speeds than previously thought. These findings have important implications for
the formation of dust storms, sand dunes, and ripples on Mars.
