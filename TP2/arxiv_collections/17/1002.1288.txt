This paper investigates, using prior shape models and the concept of ball
scale (b-scale), ways of automatically recognizing objects in 3D images without
performing elaborate searches or optimization. That is, the goal is to place
the model in a single shot close to the right pose (position, orientation, and
scale) in a given image so that the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity
of object boundaries in the image. This is achieved via the following set of
key ideas: (a) A semi-automatic way of constructing a multi-object shape model
assembly. (b) A novel strategy of encoding, via b-scale, the pose relationship
between objects in the training images and their intensity patterns captured in
b-scale images. (c) A hierarchical mechanism of positioning the model, in a
one-shot way, in a given image from a knowledge of the learnt pose relationship
and the b-scale image of the given image to be segmented. The evaluation
results on a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets
indicate the following: (1) Incorporating a large number of objects improves
the recognition accuracy dramatically. (2) The recognition algorithm can be
thought as a hierarchical framework such that quick replacement of the model
assembly is defined as coarse recognition and delineation itself is known as
finest recognition. (3) Scale yields useful information about the relationship
between the model assembly and any given image such that the recognition
results in a placement of the model close to the actual pose without doing any
elaborate searches or optimization. (4) Effective object recognition can make
delineation most accurate.
