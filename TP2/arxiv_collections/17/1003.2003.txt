The stability of de Sitter spacetime in Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity
with projectability but without detailed balance condition is studied. It is
found that, in contrast to the case of the Minkowski background, the spin-0
graviton now is stable for any given $\xi$, and free of ghost for $\xi \le 0$
in the infrared limit, where $\xi$ is the dynamical coupling constant.
