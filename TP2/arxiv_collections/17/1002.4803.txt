We provide an unifying polynomial expression giving moments in terms of
cumulants, and viceversa, holding in the classical, boolean and free setting.
This is done by using a symbolic treatment of Abel polynomials. As a
by-product, we show that in the free cumulant theory the volume polynomial of
Pitman and Stanley plays the role of the complete Bell exponential polynomial
in the classical theory. Moreover via generalized Abel polynomials we construct
a new class of cumulants, including the classical, boolean and free ones, and
the convolutions linearized by them. Finally, via an umbral Fourier transform,
we state a explicit connection between boolean and free convolution.
