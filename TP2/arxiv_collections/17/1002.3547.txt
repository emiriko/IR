We show results for the universal anomalous dimension gamma_{uni}(j) of
Wilson twist-2 operators in the N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the
first three orders of perturbation theory. These expressions are obtained by
extracting the most complicated contributions from the corresponding anomalous
dimensions in QCD.
