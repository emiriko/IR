We introduce a deconstructed model that incorporates both Higgsless and
top-color mechanisms. The model alleviates the typical tension in Higgsless
models between obtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping delta-rho
small. It does so by singling out the top quark mass generation as arising from
a Yukawa coupling to an effective top-Higgs which develops a small vacuum
expectation value, while electroweak symmetry breaking results largely from a
Higgsless mechanism. As a result, the heavy partners of the SM fermions can be
light enough to be seen at the LHC.
