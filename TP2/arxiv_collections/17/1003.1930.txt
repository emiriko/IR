The rapid progress of computer science has been accompanied by a
corresponding evolution of computation, from classical computation to quantum
computation. As quantum computing is on its way to becoming an established
discipline of computing science, much effort is being put into the development
of new quantum algorithms. One of quantum algorithms is Grover algorithm, which
is used for searching an element in an unstructured list of N elements with
quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms. In this work, Quantum Computer
Language (QCL) is used to make a Grover's quantum search simulation in a
classical computer
