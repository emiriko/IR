Context: With the increasing knowledge of the terrestrial planets due to
recent space probes it is possible to model their rotation with increasing
accuracy. Despite that fact, an accurate determination of Venus precession and
nutation is lacking.
  Aims : Although Venus rotation has been studied in several aspects, a full
and precise analytical model of its precession-nutation motion remains to be
constructed. We propose to determine this motion with up-to-date physical
parameters of the planet
  Methods: We adopt a theoritical framework already used for a precise
precession-nutation model of the Earth, based on a Hamiltonian formulation,
canonical equations and an accurate development of the perturbing function due
to the Sun.
  Results: After integrating the disturbing function and applying the canonical
equations, we can evaluate the precession constant $\dot{\Psi}$ and the
coefficients of nutation, both in longitude and in obliquity. We get
$\dot{\Psi}=4474".35/Jcy \pm 66.5 $, corresponding to a precession period of
$28965.10 \pm 437$ years. This result, based on recent estimations of the Venus
moment of inertia is significantly different from previous estimations. The
largest nutation coefficient in longitude with an argument $2L_{S}$ (where
$L_{S}$ is the longitude of the Sun) has a 2"19 amplitude and a 112.35 d
period. We show that the coefficients of nutation of Venus due to its
triaxiality are of the same order of amplitude as these values due to its
dynamical flattening, unlike of the Earth, for which they are negligible.
