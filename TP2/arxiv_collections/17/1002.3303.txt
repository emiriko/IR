The signcryption is a relatively new cryptographic technique that is supposed
to fulfill the functionalities of encryption and digital signature in a single
logical step. Several signcryption schemes are proposed throughout the years,
each of them having its own problems and limitations. In this paper, the
security of a recent signcryption scheme, i.e. Hwang et al.'s scheme is
analyzed, and it is proved that it involves several security flaws and
shortcomings. Several devastating attacks are also introduced to the mentioned
scheme whereby it fails all the desired and essential security attributes of a
signcryption scheme.
