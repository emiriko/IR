We investigate the relationship between R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and
hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) stars by measuring precise 16O/18O ratios for
five cool RCB stars. The 16O/18O ratios are derived by spectrum synthesis from
high-resolution (R=50,000) K-band spectra. Lower limits to the 16O/17O and
14N/15}N ratios as well as Na and S abundances (when possible) are also given.
RCB stars in our sample generally display less 18O than HdC stars - the derived
16O/18O ratios range from 3 to 20. The only exception is the RCB star WX CrA,
which seems to be a HdC-like star with 16O/18O=0.3. Our result of a higher
16O/18O ratio for the RCB stars must be accounted for by a theory of the
formation and evolution of HdC and RCB stars. We speculate that a late
dredge-up of products of He-burning, principally 12C and 16O, may convert a
18O-rich HdC star into a 18O-poor RCB star as the H-deficient star begins its
final evolution from a cool supergiant to the top of the white dwarf cooling
track.
