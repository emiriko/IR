We review recent progress in the perturbative calculations for semileptonic
and hadronic B meson decays with an emphasis on the phenomenological
implications of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections.
Specifically, we consider CP-averaged branching ratios of tree-dominated B ->
pi pi/pi rho/rho rho decays and the inclusive determination of |V_ub| from B ->
X_u l nu.
