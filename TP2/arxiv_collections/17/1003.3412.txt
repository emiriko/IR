In a recent Letter, Peets, et al. measured the x-ray intensity at the oxygen
K-edge in overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{4\pm\delta}$ (LSCO) and
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. They claimed that, unlike the underdoped samples
of LSCO and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ in which the integrated intensity increases at
least linearly with doping, it saturates abruptly for a hole count exceeding
$x\approx 0.23$. They interpreted the saturation as a breakdown of the 1-band
Hubbard model in the cuprates. However, we show that their results are in
quantitative agreement with the 1-band Hubbard model.
