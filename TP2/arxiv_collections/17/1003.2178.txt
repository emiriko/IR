We introduce a "loosely coherent" method for detection of continuous
gravitational waves that bridges the gap between semi-coherent and purely
coherent methods. Explicit control over accepted families of signals is used to
increase sensitivity of power-based statistic while avoiding the high
computational costs of conventional matched filters. Several examples as well
as a prototype implementation are discussed.
