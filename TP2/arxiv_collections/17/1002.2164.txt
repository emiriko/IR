Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) computation for non-binary modulations over fading
channels is complicated. A measure of LLR accuracy on asymmetric binary
channels is introduced to facilitate good LLR approximations for non-binary
modulations. Considering piecewise linear LLR approximations, we prove
convexity of optimizing the coefficients according to this measure. For the
optimized approximate LLRs, we report negligible performance losses compared to
true LLRs.
