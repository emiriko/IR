We study the QCD phase structure in the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model, incorporating the interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates
induced by the axial anomaly. We demonstrate that for an appropriate range of
parameters of the model, the interplay leads to the low temperature critical
point in the phase structure predicted by a previous Ginzburg-Landau analysis.
We also show that a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of diquark molecules emerges
in the intermediate density region, and as a result, a BEC-BCS crossover is
realized with increasing quark chemical potential.
