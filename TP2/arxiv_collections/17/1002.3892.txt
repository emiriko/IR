This contribution reports on the research project SKRIBT and some of its
results. An evacuation simulation based on VISSIM's pedestrian dynamics
simulation was developed, that -- with high time resolution -- integrates
results from studies on behavior in stress and crisis situations, results from
CFD models for e.g. fire dynamics simulations, and considers visibility of
signage and -- adding a psychological model -- its cognition. A crucial issue
is the cognition of smoke or fire by the occupant and his / her resulting
spontaneous or deliberate reaction to this episode.
