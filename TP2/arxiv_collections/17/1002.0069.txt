The dynamics of Davydov-Scott monomer in a thermal bath with higher order
amide-site's displacement leads to anharmonic oscillation effect is
investigated using full-quantum approach and the Lindblad formulation of master
equation. The specific heat is calculated based on the thermodynamic partition
function using the path integral method. The temperature dependence of the
specific heat is studied. In the model the specific heat anomaly as pointed out
in recent works by Ingold et.al is also observed. However it is found that the
anomaly occurs at high temperature region, and the anharmonic oscillation
restores the positivity of specific heat.
