We combine published optical and near-infrared photometry to identify new
low-mass candidate members in an area of about 0.64 deg^2 in Corona Australis,
using the S-parameter method. Five new candidate members of the region are
selected, with estimated ages between 3 and 15 Myr, and masses between 0.05 and
0.15 M_Sun. Using Spitzer photometry, we confirm that these objects are not
surrounded by optically thick disks. However, one of them is found to display
excess at 24 micron, thus suggesting it harbours a disk with an inner hole.
With an estimated mass of 0.07 M_Sun according to the SED fitting, this is one
of the lowest-mass objects reported to possess a transitional disk.
  Including these new members, the fraction of disks is about 50% among the
total Corona Australis population selected by the same criteria, lower than the
70% fraction reported earlier for this region. Even so, we find a ratio of
transitional to primordial disks (45%) very similar to the value derived by
other authors. This ratio is higher than for solar-type stars (5-10%),
suggesting that disk evolution is faster in the latter, and/or that the
"transitional disk" stage is not such a short-lived step in the case of very
low-mass objects. However, this impression needs to be confirmed with better
statistics.
