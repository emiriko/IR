Conformal many-body mechanics in Newton-Hooke spacetime is studied within the
framework of the Lagrangian formalism. Global symmetries and Noether charges
are given in a form convenient for analyzing the flat space limit. N=2
superconformal extension is built and a new class on N=2 models related to
simple Lie algebras is presented. A decoupling similarity transformation on N=2
quantum mechanics in Newton-Hooke spacetime is discussed.
