The magnetization of the PrFeAsO$_{0.60}$F$_{0.12}$ polycrystalline sample
has been measured as functions of temperature and magnetic field $(H)$. The
observed total magnetization is the sum of a superconducting irreversible
magnetization ($M_s$) and a paramagnetic magnetization ($M_p$). Analysis of dc
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ in the normal state shows that the paramagnetic
component of magnetization comes from the Pr$^{+3}$ magnetic moments. The
intragrain critical current density $(J_L)$ derived from the magnetization
measurement is large. The $J_L(H)$ curve displays a second peak which shifts
towards the high-field region with decreasing temperature. In the low-field
region, a plateau up to a field $H^*$ followed by a power law $H^{-5/8}$
behavior of $J_L(H)$ is the characteristic of the strong pinning. A vortex
phase diagram for the present superconductor has been obtained from the
magnetization and resistivity data.
