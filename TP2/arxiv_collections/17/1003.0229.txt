We have investigated the empirical lag-luminosity relation in the Gamma-ray
Burst (GRB) source-frame. We selected two energy bands (100-200 keV and 300-400
keV) in the GRB source-frame, which after redshift correction, lie in the
observer-frame energy range of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). The
spectral lags between these energy channels are then presented as a function of
the isotropic peak luminosity of the GRBs in the sample.
