Recently our understanding of black holes in D-spacetime dimensions, as
solutions of the Einstein equation, has advanced greatly. Besides the well
established spherical black hole we have now explicitly found other species of
topologies of the event horizons. Whether in asymptotically flat, AntideSitter
or deSitter spaces, the different species are really non-unique when D > 4. An
example of this are the black rings. Another issue in higher dimensions that is
not fully understood is the struggle for existence of regular black hole
solutions. However, we managed to observe a selection rule for regular
solutions of thin black rings: they have to be balanced i.e. in vacuum, a
neutral asymptotically flat black ring incorporates a balance between the
centrifugal repulsion and the tension. The equilibrium condition seems to be
equivalent to the condition to guarantee regularity on the geometry of the
black ring solution. We will review the tree of species of black holes and
present new results on exotic black holes with charges.
