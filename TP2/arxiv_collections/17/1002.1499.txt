Microtubules are highly regulated dynamic elements of the cytoskeleton of
eukaryotic cells. One of the regulation mechanisms observed in living cells is
the severing by the proteins katanin and spastin. We introduce a model for the
dynamics of microtubules in the presence of randomly occurring severing events.
Under the biologically motivated assumption that the newly created plus end
undergoes a catastrophe, we investigate the steady state length distribution.
We show that the presence of severing does not affect the number of
microtubules, regardless of the distribution of severing events. In the special
case in which the microtubules cannot recover from the depolymerizing state (no
rescue events) we derive an analytical expression for the length distribution.
In the general case we transform the problem into a single ODE that is solved
numerically.
