The electronic structure of a-Fe1.06Te is studied with angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We show that there is substantial spectral weight
around Gamma and X, and lineshapes are intrinsically incoherent in the
paramagnetic state. The magnetic transition is characterized by a massive
spectral-weight transfer over an energy range as large as the band width, which
even exhibits a hysteresis loop that marks the strong first order transition.
Coherent quasiparticles emerge in the magnetically ordered state due to
decreased spin fluctuations, which account for the change of transport
properties from insulating behavior to metallic behavior. Our observation
demonstrates that Fe1.06Te distinguishes itself from other iron-based systems
with more local characters and much stronger interactions among different
degrees of freedom, and how a spin density wave is formed in the presence of
strong correlation.
