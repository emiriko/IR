Using the perturbation-response scanning (PRS) technique, we study a set of
23 proteins that display a variety of conformational motions upon ligand
binding (e.g. shear, hinge, allosteric). In most cases, PRS determines residues
that may be manipulated to achieve the resulting conformational change. PRS
reveals that for some proteins, binding induced conformational change may be
achieved through the perturbation of residues scattered throughout the protein,
whereas in others, perturbation of specific residues confined to a highly
specific region are necessary. Correlations between the experimental and
calculated atomic displacements are always better or equivalent to those
obtained from a modal analysis of elastic network models. Furthermore, best
correlations obtained by the latter approach do not always appear in the most
collective modes. We show that success of the modal analysis depends on the
lack of redundant paths that exist in the protein. PRS thus demonstrates that
several relevant modes may simultaneously be induced by perturbing a single
select residue on the protein. We also illustrate the biological relevance of
applying PRS on the GroEL and ADK structures in detail, where we show that the
residues whose perturbation lead to the precise conformational changes usually
correspond to those experimentally determined to be functionally important.
