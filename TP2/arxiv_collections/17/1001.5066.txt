We construct non-stationary exact solutions to five dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with positive cosmological constant. The
solutions are based on four-dimensional Atiyah-Hitchin space. In asymptotic
regions, the solutions approach to Gibbons-Perry-Sorkin monopole solutions. On
the other hand, near the four-dimensional bolt of Atiyah-Hitchin space, our
solutions show a bolt structure in five dimensions. The c-function for the
solutions shows monotonic increase in time, in agreement with the general
expected behaviour of c-function in asymptotically dS spacetimes.
