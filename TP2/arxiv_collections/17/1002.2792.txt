In this paper we give a rigorous proof of the equivalence of some different
forms of Faraday's law of induction clarifying some misconceptions on the
subject and emphasizing that many derivations of this law appearing in
textbooks and papers are only valid under very special circumstances and not
satisfactory under a mathematical point of view.
