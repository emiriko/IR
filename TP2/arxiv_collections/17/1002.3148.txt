We introduce a proposal for explaining manganites behavior, in the
Pr1-xCaxMnO3 series with x=0.30-0.50. We carry out computer simulations for the
Oguchi model along with the crystal field contribution. We contrast the
outcomings to experimental measurements made with a commercial magnetometer
SQUID. For analyzing the magnetization drop at low temperatures, we take into
account quasi-probability distributions.
