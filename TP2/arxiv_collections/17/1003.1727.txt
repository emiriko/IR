In this paper we introduce a new method to add a parameter to a family of
distributions. The additional parameter is completely studied and a full
description of its behaviour in the distribution is given. We obtain several
mathematical properties of the new class of distributions such as
Kullback-Leibler divergence, Shannon entropy, moments, order statistics,
estimation of the parameters and inference for large sample. Further, we showed
that the new distribution have the reference distribution as special case, and
that the usual inference procedures also hold in this case. Furthermore, we
applied our method to yield three-parameter extensions of the Weibull and beta
distributions. To motivate the use of our class of distributions, we present a
successful application to fatigue life data.
