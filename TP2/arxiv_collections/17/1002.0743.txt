Light interacts differently with left and right handed three dimensional
chiral objects, like helices, and this leads to the phenomenon known as optical
activity. Here, by applying a polarization tomography, we show experimentally,
for the first time in the visible domain, that chirality has a different
optical manifestation for twisted planar nanostructured metallic objects acting
as isolated chiral metaobjects. Our analysis demonstrate how surface plasmons,
which are lossy bidimensional electromagnetic waves propagating on top of the
structure, can delocalize light information in the just precise way for giving
rise to this subtle effect.
