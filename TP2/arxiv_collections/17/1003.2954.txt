As a part of our galaxy-cluster redshift survey, we present a set of 80 new
velocities in the 4 clusters Abell 376, Abell 970, Abell 1356, and Abell 2244,
obtained at Haute-Provence observatory. This set now completes our previous
analysis, especially for the first two clusters. Data on individual galaxies
are presented, and we discuss some cluster properties. For A376, we obtained an
improved mean redshift <z> = 0.047503$ with a velocity dispersion of \sigma_V =
860 km/s. For A970, we have <z> = 0.058747 with \sigma_V = 881 km/s. We show
that the A1356 cluster is not a member of the "Leo-Virgo" supercluster at a
mean redshift <z>= 0.112 and should be considered just as a foreground group of
galaxies at <z> = 0.0689, as well as A1435 at <z> = 0.062. We obtain <z> =
0.099623 for A2244 with \sigma_V = 965 km/s. The relative proximity of clusters
A2244 and A2245 (<z> = 0.0873816, \sigma_V = 992 km/s) suggests that these
could be members of a supercluster that would include A2249; however, from
X-ray data there is no indication of interaction between A2244 and A2245.
