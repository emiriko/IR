Our aim is to propose a collaborative methodological approach centred on
learners and based on the Web 2.0 tools in order to make E-learning 2.0. It is
based on a process consisting of four iterative steps which are: grouping,
collaborating, validating and publishing content. In this context, learners
will be the creators of the content of assigned courses in a virtual meeting
through the chat. These contents will be validated after a pedagogical
monitoring by the instructor through the class's blog and merged into a single
course content published on a class wiki. Social interaction and sharing of
files on the web will be the responsibility of social networks. The rest of the
web 2.0 tools such as RSS feeds, tags, podcasts and video casts will be used as
complementary tools in order to improve the quality of training. This
methodological approach will allow E-learning 2.0 by ensuring a better
interactivity, collaboration, sharing and an optimal exploitation of
collaborative intelligence in the classroom.
