We present the current status of our computation of quark bilinear
renormalization constants for Wilson fermions and Symanzik improved gauge
action. Computations are performed in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory.
Volumes range from 10^4 to 32^4. Renormalization conditions are those of the
RI'-MOM scheme, imposed at different values of the physical scale. Having
measurements available at several momenta, irrelevant effects are taken into
account by means of hypercubic symmetric Taylor expansions. Finite volumes
effects are assessed repeating the computations at different lattice sizes. In
this way we can extrapolate our results to the continuum limit, in infinite
volume.
