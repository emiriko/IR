Up to now, for efficiency reasons cryptographic algorithm has been written in
an imperative language. But to get acquaintance with a functional programming
language a question arises: functional programming offers some new for secure
communication or not? This article investigates this question giving an
overview on some cryptography algorithms and presents how the RSA encryption in
the functional language Clean can be implemented and how can be measured the
efficiency of a certain application.
