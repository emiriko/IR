Fermi can measure the spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts over a very
large energy range and is opening a new window on the prompt emission of these
energetic events. Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with
follow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer
wavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget,
host galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.
Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of
four bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT : GRB090323,
GRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the
optical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope
and additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in
Tautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while
GRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host
galaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up
was initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow
observations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies
are investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction
enables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general
sample. The spectroscopic redshifts of GRB090328 and GRB090510 were determined
to be z=0.7354+/-0.0003 and z=0.903 +/- 0.001 and dust corrected star-formation
rates of 4.8 Mdot yr^-1 and 0.60 M_dot yr^-1 were derived for their host
galaxies, respectively. The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay
indices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from
0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows. Constraints are
placed on the jet half opening angles of less than 2.1 deg to greater than 6.4
deg which allows limits to be placed on the beaming corrected energies. These
range from less than 5x10^50 erg to the one of the highest values ever
recorded, greater than 2.2x10^52 erg for GRB090902B, and are not consistent
with a standard candle. The extremely energetic long Fermi bursts have optical
afterglows which lie in the top half of the brightness distribution of all
optical afterglows detected in the Swift era or even in the top 5% if
incompleteness is considered. The properties of the host galaxies of these LAT
detected bursts in terms of extinction, star formation rates and masses do not
appear to differ from previous samples.
