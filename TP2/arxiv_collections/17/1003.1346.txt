Photoproduction of neutral pions has been studied with the CBELSA/TAPS
detector for photon energies between 0.92 and 1.68~GeV at the electron
accelerator ELSA. The beam asymmetry~$\Sigma$ has been extracted for $115^\circ
< \theta_{\rm c.m.} < 155^\circ$ of the $\pi^0$~meson and for $\theta_{\rm
c.m.} < 60^\circ$. The new beam asymmetry data improve the world database for
photon energies above 1.5~GeV and, by covering the very forward region, extend
previously published data for the same reaction by our collaboration. The
angular dependence of $\Sigma$ shows overall good agreement with the SAID
parameterization.
