The varying metallic antiferromagnetic correlations observed in iron-based
superconductors are unified in a model consisting of both itinerant electrons
and localized spins. The decisive factor is found to be the sensitive
competition between the superexchange antiferromagnetism and the
orbital-degenerate double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our results reveal the
crucial role of Hund's rule coupling for the strongly correlated nature of the
system and suggest that the iron-based superconductors are closer kin to
manganites than cuprates in terms of their diverse magnetism and incoherent
normal-state electron transport. This unified picture would be instrumental for
exploring other exotic properties and the mechanism of superconductivity in
this new class of superconductors.
