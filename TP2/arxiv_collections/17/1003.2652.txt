Let $Q$ be any invertible valued quiver without oriented cycles. We study
connections between the category of valued representations of $Q$ and
expansions of cluster variables in terms of the initial cluster in quantum
cluster algebras. We show that an analogue of the Caldero-Chapoton formula
holds for all quantum cluster algebras of finite type and for any cluster
variable in an almost acyclic cluster.
