We have calculated the absorption characteristics of different hybrid systems
consisting of Ag, Ag2 or Ag3 atomic clusters and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA)
using the time-dependent density-functional theory. The polymer is found to
have an extensive structural-dependency on the spectral patterns of the hybrid
systems relative to the bare clusters. The absorption spectrum can be `tuned'
to the visible range for hybrid systems with an odd number of electrons per
silver cluster, whereas for hybrid systems comprising an even number of
electrons, the leading absorption edge can be shifted up to about 4.5 eV. The
results give theoretical support to the experimental observations on the
absorption in the visible range in metal cluster-polymer hybrid structures.
