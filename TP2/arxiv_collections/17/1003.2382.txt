While evidence of a topologically nontrivial surface state has been
identified in surface-sensitive measurements of Bi2Se3, a significant
experimental concern is that no signatures have been observed in bulk
transport. In a search for such states, nominally undoped single crystals of
Bi2Se3 with carrier densities approaching 10^16 cm^-3 and very high mobilities
exceeding 2 m^2 V^-1 s^-1 have been studied. A comprehensive analysis of
Shubnikov de Haas oscillations, Hall effect, and optical reflectivity indicates
that the measured electrical transport can be attributed solely to bulk states,
even at 50 mK at low Landau level filling factor, and in the quantum limit. The
absence of a significant surface contribution to bulk conduction demonstrates
that even in very clean samples, the surface mobility is lower than that of the
bulk, despite its topological protection.
