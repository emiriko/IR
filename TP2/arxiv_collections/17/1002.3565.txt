We studied the influence of 30keV Ga$^+$-ions -- commonly used in focused ion
beam (FIB) devices -- on the transport properties of thin crystalline graphite
flake, La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ and Co thin films. The changes of the
electrical resistance were measured in-situ during irradiation and also the
temperature and magnetic field dependence before and after irradiation. Our
results show that the transport properties of these materials strongly change
at Ga$^+$ fluences much below those used for patterning and ion beam induced
deposition (IBID), limiting seriously the use of FIB when the intrinsic
properties of the materials of interest are of importance. We present a method
that can be used to protect the sample as well as to produce selectively
irradiation-induced changes.
