In order to evaluate the potential of MEMS deformable mirrors for open-loop
applications, a complete calibration process was performed on a 1024-actuator
mirror. The mirror must be perfectly calibrated to obtain deterministic
membrane deflection. The actuator's stroke-voltage relationship and the effect
of the non- additivity of the influence functions are studied and finally
integrated in an open-loop control process. This experiment aimed at minimizing
the residual error obtained in open-loop control.
