We propose a hybrid technique for image encryption which employs the concept
of carrier image and SCAN patterns generated by SCAN methodology. Although it
involves existing method like SCAN methodology, the novelty of the work lies in
hybridizing and carrier image creation for encryption. Here the carrier image
is created with the help of alphanumeric keyword. Each alphanumeric key will be
having a unique 8bit value generated by 4 out of 8-code. This newly generated
carrier image is added with original image to obtain encrypted image. The scan
methodology is applied to either original image or carrier image, after the
addition of original image and carrier image to obtain highly distorted
encrypted image. The resulting image is found to be more distorted in hybrid
technique. By applying the reverse process we get the decrypted image.
