This review provides an overview of many recent advances in detector
technologies for particle physics experiments. Challenges for new technologies
include increasing spatial and temporal sensitivity, speed, and radiation
hardness while minimizing power and cost. Applications are directed at several
future collider experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider luminosity
upgrade (sLHC), the linear collider, and the super high luminosity B factory,
as well as neutrino and other fixed target experiments, and direct dark matter
searches. Furthermore, particle physics has moved into space, with significant
contributions of detector technology, and new challenges for future efforts.
