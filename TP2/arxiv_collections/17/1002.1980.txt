Measuring subdiffraction separations between single fluorescent particles is
important for biological, nano-, and medical-technology studies. Major
challenges include (i) measuring changing molecular separations with high
temporal resolution while (ii) using identical fluorescent labels. Here we
report a method that measures subdiffraction separations between two identical
fluorophores by using a single image of milliseconds exposure time and a
standard single-molecule fluorescent imaging setup. The fluorophores do not
need to be bleached and the separations can be measured down to 40 nm with
nanometer precision. The method is called single-molecule image deconvolution
-- SMID, and in this article it measures the standard deviation (SD) of
Gaussian-approximated combined fluorescent intensity profiles of the two
subdiffraction-separated fluorophores. This study enables measurements of (i)
subdiffraction dimolecular separations using a single image, lifting the
temporal resolution of seconds to milliseconds, while (ii) using identical
fluorophores. The single-image nature of this dimer separation study makes it a
single-image molecular analysis (SIMA) study.
