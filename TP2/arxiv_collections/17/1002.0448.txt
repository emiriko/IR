A simple model, in which nuclei are represented as homogeneous spheres of
symmetric nuclear matter, is used to study the effects of a self-consistent
pairing interaction on the nuclear response. Effects due to the finite size of
nuclei are suitably taken into account. The semiclassical equations of motion
derived in a previous paper for the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
problem are solved in an improved (linear) approximation in which the pairing
field is allowed to oscillate and to become complex. The new solutions are in
good agreement with the old ones and also with the result of well-known quantum
approaches. The role of the Pauli principle in eliminating one possible set of
solutions is also discussed. The pairing-field fluctuations have two main
effects: they restore the particle-number symmetry which is broken in the
constant-$\Delta$ approximation and introduce the possibility of collective
eigenfrequencies of the system due to the pairing interaction. A numerical
study with values of parameters appropriate for nuclei, shows an enhancement of
the density-density strength function in the region of the low-energy giant
octupole resonance, while no similar effect is present in the region of the
high-energy octupole resonance and for the giant monopole and quadrupole
resonances.
