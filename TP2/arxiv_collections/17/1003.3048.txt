In the present work, we demonstrate the possibility of controlling by an
external field the dynamics of collective excitations (excitons) of molecules
on an optical lattice. We show that a suitably chosen two-species mixture of
ultracold polar molecules loaded on an optical lattice forms a phononless
crystal, where exciton-impurity interactions can be controlled by applying an
external electric field. This can be used for the controlled creation of
many-body entangled states of ultracold molecules and the time-domain quantum
simulation of disorder-induced localization and delocalization of quantum
particles.
