We report $^{77}$Se and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
investigation on the charge-density-wave (CDW) superconductor Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$
($x=0.05$ and 0.07). At high magnetic fields where superconductivity is
suppressed, the temperature dependence of $^{77}$Se and $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice
relaxation rates 1/T_{1}$ follow a linear relation. The slope of $^{77}1/T_{1}$
vs \emph{T} increases with the Cu doping. This can be described by a modified
Korringa relation which suggests the significance of electronic correlations
and the Se 4\emph{p}- and Ti 3\emph{d}-band contribution to the density of
states at the Fermi level in the studied compounds.
