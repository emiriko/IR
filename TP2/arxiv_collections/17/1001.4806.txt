We study the stability of magnetization precessions induced in spin-transfer
devices by the injection of spin-polarized electric currents. Instability
conditions are derived by introducing a generalized, far-from-equilibrium
interpretation of spin-waves. It is shown that instabilities are generated by
distinct groups of magnetostatically coupled spin-waves. Stability diagrams are
constructed as a function of external magnetic field and injected
spin-polarized current. These diagrams show that applying larger fields and
currents has a stabilizing effect on magnetization precessions. Analytical
results are compared with numerical simulations of spin-transfer-driven
magnetization dynamics.
