We inspect the relationship between relative Fourier multipliers on
noncommutative Lebesgue-Orlicz spaces of a discrete group and relative
Toeplitz-Schur multipliers on Schatten-von-Neumann-Orlicz classes. Four
applications are given: lacunary sets; unconditional Schauder bases for the
subspace of a Lebesgue space determined by a given spectrum, that is, by a
subset of the group; the norm of the Hilbert transform and the Riesz projection
on Schatten-von-Neumann classes with exponent a power of 2; the norm of
Toeplitz Schur multipliers on Schatten-von-Neumann classes with exponent less
than 1.
