We present a study of the inclusive photon spectra from 5.9 million J/psi
decays collected with the KEDR detector at the VEPP-4M e+e- collider. We
measure the branching fraction of radiative decay J/psi to eta_c gamma, eta_c
width and mass. Our preliminary results are: M(eta_c) = 2979.4+-1.5+-1.9 MeV,
G(eta_c) = 27.8+-5.1+-3.3 MeV, B(J/psi to eta_c gamma) = (2.34+-0.15+-0.40)%.
