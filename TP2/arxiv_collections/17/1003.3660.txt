We construct the model of a long lived plasma structure based on spherically
symmetric oscillations of electrons in plasma. Oscillations of electrons are
studied in frames of both classical and quantum approaches. We obtain the
density profile of electrons and the dispersion relations for these
oscillations. The differences between classical and quantum approaches are
discussed. Then we study the interaction between electrons participating in
spherically symmetric oscillations. We find that this interaction can be
attractive and electrons can form bound states. The applications of the
obtained results to the theory of natural plasmoids are considered.
