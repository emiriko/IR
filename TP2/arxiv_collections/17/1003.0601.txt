By combining methods of kinetic and density functional theory, we present a
description of molecular fluids which accounts for their microscopic structure
and thermodynamic properties as well as for the hydrodynamic behavior. We focus
on the evolution of the one particle phase space distribution, rather than on
the evolution of the average particle density, which features in dynamic
density functional theory. The resulting equation can be studied in two
different physical limits: diffusive dynamics, typical of colloidal fluids
without hydrodynamic interaction, where particles are subject to overdamped
motion resulting from the coupling with a solvent at rest, and inertial
dynamics, typical of molecular fluids. Finally, we propose an algorithm to
solve numerically and efficiently the resulting kinetic equation by employing a
discretization procedure analogous to the one used in the Lattice Boltzmann
method.
