For an epitaxial Pr0.48Ca0.52MnO3 film on NdGaO3, we use transmission
electron microscopy to observe a "charge-ordered" superlattice along the
in-plane direction a. The same film shows no electrical signatures of charge
order. The in-plane electrical anisotropy (rho)a/(rho)c = 28 is constant, and
there is no evidence of sliding charge density waves up to the large field of
~10^3 V/cm.
