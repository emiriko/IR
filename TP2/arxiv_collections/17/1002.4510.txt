We characterize all linear $q$-ary completely regular codes with covering
radius $\rho=2$ when the dual codes are antipodal. These completely regular
codes are extensions of linear completely regular codes with covering radius 1,
which are all classified. For $\rho=2$, we give a list of all such codes known
to us. This also gives the characterization of two weight linear antipodal
codes.
