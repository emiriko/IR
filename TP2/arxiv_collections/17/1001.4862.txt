An example due to Erdos and Fortet shows that, for a lacunary sequence of
integers (q_n) and a trigonometric polynomial f, the asymptotic distribution of
normalized sums of f(q_k x) can be a mixture of gaussian laws. Here we give a
generalization of their example interpreted as the limiting behavior of some
modified ergodic sums in the framework of dynamical systems.
