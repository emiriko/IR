We review recent results from computer simulation studies of polymer glasses,
from chain dynamics around the glass transition temperature Tg to the
mechanical behaviour below Tg. These results clearly show that modern computer
simulations are able to address and give clear answers to some important issues
in the field, in spite of the obvious limitations in terms of length and time
scales. In the present review we discuss the cooling rate effects, and dynamic
slowing down of different relaxation processes when approaching Tg for both
model and chemistry-specific polymer glasses. The impact of geometric
confinement on the glass transition is discussed in detail. We also show that
computer simulations are very useful tools to study structure and mechanical
response of glassy polymers. The influence of large deformations on mechanical
behaviour of polymer glasses in general, and strain hardening effect in
particular are reviewed. Finally, we suggest some directions for future
research, which we believe will be soon within the capabilities of state of the
art computer simulations, and correspond to problems of fundamental interest.
