We present optical and near infrared observations of GRB 080325 classified as
a "Dark GRB". Near-infrared observations with Subaru/MOIRCS provided a clear
detection of afterglow in Ks band, although no optical counterpart was
reported. The flux ratio of rest-wavelength optical to X-ray bands of the
afterglow indicates that the dust extinction along the line of sight to the
afterglow is Av = 2.7 - 10 mag. This large extinction is probably the major
reason for optical faintness of GRB 080325. The J - Ks color of the host
galaxy, (J - Ks = 1.3 in AB magnitude), is significantly redder than those for
typical GRB hosts previously identified. In addition to J and Ks bands, optical
images in B, Rc, i', and z' bands with Subaru/Suprime-Cam were obtained at
about one year after the burst, and a photometric redshift of the host is
estimated to be z_{photo} = 1.9. The host luminosity is comparable to L^{*} at
z \sim 2 in contrast to the sub-L^{*} property of typical GRB hosts at lower
redshifts. The best-fit stellar population synthesis model for the host shows
that a large dust extinction (Av = 0.8 mag) attributes to the red nature of the
host and that the host galaxy is massive (M_{*} = 7.0 \times 10^{10} Msun)
which is one of the most massive GRB hosts previously identified. By assuming
that the mass-metallicity relation for star-forming galaxies at z \sim 2 is
applicable for the GRB host, this large stellar mass suggests the high
metallicity environment around GRB 080325, consistent with inferred large
extinction.
