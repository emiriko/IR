Software engineering is one of the most recent additions in various
disciplines of system engineering. It has emerged as a key obedience of system
engineering in a quick succession of time. Various Software Engineering
approaches are followed in order to produce comprehensive software solutions of
affordable cost with reasonable delivery timeframe with less uncertainty. All
these objectives are only satisfied when project's status is properly monitored
and controlled; eXtreme Programming (XP) uses the best practices of AGILE
methodology and helps in development of small size software very sharply. In
this paper, authors proposed that via XP, high quality software with less
uncertainty and under estimated cost can be developed due to proper monitoring
and controlling of project. Moreover, authors give guidelines that how
activities of project management can be embedded into development life cycle of
XP to enhance the quality of software products and reduce the uncertainty.
