Secure sum computation of private data inputs is an interesting example of
Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) which has attracted many researchers to
devise secure protocols with lower probability of data leakage. In this paper,
we provide a novel protocol to compute the sum of individual data inputs with
zero probability of data leakage when two neighbor parties collude to know the
data of a middle party. We break the data block of each party into number of
segments and redistribute the segments among parties before the computation.
These entire steps create a scenario in which it becomes impossible for semi
honest parties to know the private data of some other party.
