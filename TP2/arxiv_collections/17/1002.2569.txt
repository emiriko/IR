Motivated by the advent of the Large Hadron Collider the aim of the present
work is the non-perturbative determination of the cutoff-dependent upper and
lower mass bounds of the Standard Model Higgs boson based on first principle
calculations, in particular not relying on additional information such as the
triviality property of the Higgs-Yukawa sector or indirect arguments like
vacuum stability considerations. For that purpose the lattice approach is
employed to allow for a non-perturbative investigation of a chirally invariant
lattice Higgs-Yukawa model, serving here as a reasonable simplification of the
full Standard Model, containing only those fields and interactions which are
most essential for the intended Higgs boson mass determination. These are the
complex Higgs doublet as well as the top and bottom quark fields and their
mutual interactions. To maintain the chiral character of the Standard Model
Higgs-fermion coupling also on the lattice, the latter model is constructed on
the basis of the Neuberger overlap operator, obeying then an exact global
lattice chiral symmetry.
