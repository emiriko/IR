A summary of neutrino oscillation results is given along with a discussion of
neutrino mass generation mechanisms, including high and low-scale seesaw, with
and without supersymmetry, as well as recent attempts to understand flavor. I
argue that if the origin of neutrino masses is intrinsically supersymmetric, it
may lead to clear tests at the LHC. Finally, I briefly discuss thermal
leptogenesis and dark matter.
