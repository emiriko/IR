We study with ARPES the electronic structure of CoO2 slabs, stacked with
rock-salt (RS) layers exhibiting a different (misfit) periodicity. Fermi
Surfaces (FS) in phases with different doping and/or periodicities reveal the
influence of the RS potential on the electronic structure. We show that these
RS potentials are well ordered, even in incommensurate phases, where STM images
reveal broad stripes with width as large as 80\AA. The anomalous evolution of
the FS area at low dopings is consistent with the localization of a fraction of
the electrons. We propose that this is a new form of electronic ordering,
induced by the potential of the stacked layers (RS or Na in NaxCoO2) when the
FS becomes smaller than the Brillouin Zone of the stacked structure.
