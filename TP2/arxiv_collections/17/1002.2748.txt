The present paper considers if the new proposed conformal geometrodynamics
(CGD) can extend the Nature features compared with general theory of relativity
(GTR). The answer for this question can be connected with unique phenomenon
arising from Riemann space transition used in GTR, to Weyl space used in CGD.
We have in mind the possibility to set up the perfect correspondence in certain
spatial regions between the equations of different physical phenomena: (1)
Phenomena associated with Weyl degrees of freedom in a plane space. (2)
Phenomena described in terms of half-integer spin particles and observed
quantities corresponding to the full set of bispinors. The said phenomenon is
described in the present paper. Analyzed here are the new prospects in the
problem of combination of quantum physics concepts and GTR, unification of
physical interactions and understanding of many of the effects known from the
experiments but not properly understood yet.
