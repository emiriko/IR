In this paper we present qualitative and quantitative comparison of various
analytical and numerical approximation methods for calculating a position of
the early exercise boundary of the American put option paying zero dividends.
First we analyze their asymptotic behavior close to expiration. In the second
part of the paper, we introduce a new numerical scheme for computing the entire
early exercise boundary. The local iterative numerical scheme is based on a
solution to a nonlinear integral equation. We compare numerical results
obtained by the new method to those of the projected successive over relaxation
method and the analytical approximation formula recently derived by Zhu.
