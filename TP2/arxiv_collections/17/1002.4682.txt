This article presents a statistical analysis method and introduces the
corresponding software package "tailstat," which is believed to be widely
applicable to today's internet society. The proposed method facilitates
statistical analyses with small sample sets from given populations, which
render the central limit theorem inapplicable. A large-scale case study
demonstrates the effectiveness of the method and provides implications for
applying similar analyses to other cases.
