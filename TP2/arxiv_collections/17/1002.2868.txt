We re-examine the challenges concerning causality in the semantics of Esterel
and show that they pertain to the known issues in the semantics of Structured
Operational Semantics with negative premises. We show that the solutions
offered for the semantics of SOS also provide answers to the semantic
challenges of Esterel and that they satisfy the intuitive requirements set by
the language designers.
