The solving of scientific and practical application connected with conducting
of satellite experiments and measurement demand analysis of geometric and
physic conditions according to different kind of models. This is forced in
connect of optimization of complex and expensive scientific projects. This
article treat complex situation conditions described as conjunction of
elementary mutually independent are discussed. Two formal algorithms based on
alternative strategy for verification of multitude of the checked conditions
which increase effectiveness of model calculation are present in this article.
Every algorithm is connected with an approach for rearranging of the multitude
of conditions. The inverse problem is presented as disjunction of all inverse
constrains. The possibilities for applying of these algorithms are analyzed and
behavior and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are discussed.
