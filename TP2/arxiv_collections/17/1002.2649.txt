The dynamics of neutrino mixing and oscillations are studied directly in
finite real time in a model that effectively describes charged current weak
interactions. Finite time corrections to the S-matrix result for the appearance
and disappearance probabilities are obtained. It is observed that these effects
may be of the same order of the S-matrix result in long-baseline appearance
experiments. We argue that fundamentally, the S-matrix is ill-suited to
describe long-baseline events due to the fact that the neutrino is produced in
an entangled state with the charged lepton, which can be disentangled by the
measurement of the charged lepton near the production site. The appearance and
disappearance far-detection process is described from the time evolution of
this disentangled "collapsed" state, allowing us to establish the conditions
under which factorization of detection rates emerges in long-baseline
experiments. We also study the time evolution of the reduced density matrix and
show explicitly how oscillations are manifest in the off-diagonal terms, i.e.,
coherences, as a result of a finite time analysis. Lastly, we study a model for
the "GSI anomaly" obtaining the time evolution of the population of parent and
daughter particles directly in real time. We confirm that the decay rate of
parent and growth rate of daughters do NOT feature oscillatory behavior from
interference of mass eigenstates.
