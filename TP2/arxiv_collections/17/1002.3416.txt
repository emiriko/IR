Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we calculate the explicit form of the
entanglement entropy for the charged BTZ black hole. The leading term in the
large temperature expansion of the entropy function for this black hole
reproduces its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the subleading term, representing
the first corrections due to quantum entanglement, behaves as a logarithm of
the BH entropy.
