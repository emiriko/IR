The interlayer spacings near the surface of a crystal are different from that
of the bulk. As a result, the value of the ionic density in the normal
direction and near to the surface shows some oscillations around the bulk
value. To describe this behavior in a simple way, we have formulated the
self-compressed inhomogeneous stabilized jellium model and have applied it to
simple metal thin films. In this model, for a $\nu$-layered slab, each ionic
layer is replaced by a jellium slice of constant density. The equilibrium
densities of the slices can be determined by minimizing the total energy per
electron of the slab with respect to the slice densities. To avoid the
complications that arise due to the number of independent slice-density
parameters for large-$\nu$ slabs, we consider a simplified version of the model
with three jellium slices: one inner bulk slice with density $\bar n_1$ and two
similar surface slices of densities $\bar n_2$. In this simplified model, each
slice may contain more than one ionic layer. Application of this model to the
$\nu$-layered slabs ($3\le\nu\le 10$) of Al, Na, and Cs shows that, in the
equilibrium state, $\bar n_1$ and $\bar n_2$ assume different values, which is
significant in the Al case, and the state is more stable than that predicted in
the homogeneous model in which only one global jellium density is used for the
whole system. In addition, we have calculated the overall relaxations, the work
functions, and the surface energies, and compared with the results of the
earlier works.
