A high angular resolution, multi-wavelength study of the LINER galaxy NGC1614
has been carried out. OVRO CO 1-0 observations are presented together with
extensive multi-frequency radio continuum and HI absorption observations with
the VLA and MERLIN. Toward the center of NGC1614, we have detected a ring of
radio continuum emission with a radius of 300 pc. This ring is coincident with
previous radio and Paschen-alpha observations. The dynamical mass of the ring
based on HI absorption is 3.1 x 10E9 Msun. The peak of the integrated CO 1-0
emission is shifted by 1" to the north-west of the ring center and a
significant fraction of the CO emission is associated with a crossing dust
lane. An upper limit to the molecular gas mass in the ring region is 1.7 x 10E9
Msun. Inside the ring, there is a north to south elongated 1.4GHz radio
continuum feature with a nuclear peak. This peak is also seen in the 5GHz radio
continuum and in the CO. We suggest that the R=300 pc star forming ring
represents the radius of a dynamical resonance - as an alternative to the
scenario that the starburst is propagating outwards from the center into a
molecular ring. The ring-like appearance probably part of a spiral structure.
Substantial amounts of molecular gas have passed the radius of the ring and
reached the nuclear region. The nuclear peak seen in 5GHz radio continuum and
CO is likely related to previous star formation, where all molecular gas was
not consumed. The LINER-like optical spectrum observed in NGC1614 may be due to
nuclear starburst activity, and not to an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
Although the presence of an AGN cannot be excluded.
