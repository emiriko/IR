We present a theoretical study of the intrinsic quality factor of the
fundamental flexural vibration in a carbon nanotube and its dependence on
temperature, radius, length and tension. In particular, we examine three- and
four-phonon decays of the fundamental flexural mode within quantized elasticity
theory. This analysis reveals design principles for the construction of
ultrasensitive nanotube mass sensors: under tensions close to the elastic
limit, intrinsic losses allow for \emph{single yoctogram} mass resolution at
room temperature, while cooling opens the possibility of \emph{sub-yoctogram}
mass resolution.
