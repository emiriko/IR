We present an alternate solution of a Gaussian spin-glass model with infinite
ranged interactions and a global spherical constraint at zero magnetic field.
The replicated spin-glass Hamiltonian is mapped onto a Coulomb gas of
logarithmically interacting particles confined by a logarithmic single particle
potential. The precise free energy is obtained by analyzing the Painlev\'e
$\tau^{IV} [n]$ function in the $n\to 0$ limit. The large $N$ thermodynamics
exactly recovers that of Kosterlitz, Thouless and Jones \cite{ktjonesPRL}. It
is hoped that the approach here can be extended to apply to systems beyond the
spherical model, particularly those in which destabilizing terms lead to
replica symmetry breaking.
