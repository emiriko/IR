The pressure and the viscosity in two-dimensional sheared granular assemblies
are investigated numerically. The behavior of both pressure and viscosity is
smoothly changing qualitatively when starting from a mono-disperse hard-disk
system without dissipation and moving towards a system of (i) poly-disperse,
(ii) soft particles with (iii) considerable dissipation.
  In the rigid, elastic limit of mono-disperse systems, the viscosity is
approximately inverse proportional to the area fraction difference from
$\phi_{\eta} \simeq 0.7$, but the pressure is still finite at $\phi_{\eta}$. In
moderately soft, dissipative and poly-disperse systems, on the other hand, we
confirm the recent theoretical prediction that both scaled pressure (divided by
the kinetic temperature $T$) and scaled viscosity (divided by $\sqrt{T}$)
diverge at the same density, i.e., the jamming transition point $\phi_J >
\phi_\eta$, with the exponents -2 and -3, respectively. Furthermore, we observe
that the critical region of the jamming transition becomes invisible as the
restitution coefficient approaches unity, i.e. for vanishing dissipation.
  In order to understand the conflict between these two different predictions
on the divergence of the pressure and the viscosity, the transition from soft
to hard particles is studied in detail and the dimensionless control parameters
are defined as ratios of various time-scales. We introduce a dimensionless
number, i.e. the ratio of dissipation rate and shear rate, that can identify
the crossover from the scaling of very hard, i.e. rigid disks to the scaling in
the soft, jamming regime.
