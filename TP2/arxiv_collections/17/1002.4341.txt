Single photon emitters often rely on a strong nonlinearity to make the
behaviour of a quantum mode susceptible to a change in the number of quanta
between one and two. In most systems the strength of nonlinearity is weak, such
that changes at the single quantum level have little effect. Here, we consider
coupled quantum modes and and that they can be strongly sensitive at the single
quantum level, even if nonlinear interactions are modest. As examples, we
consider solid-state implementations based on the tunneling of polaritons
between quantum boxes or their parametric modes in a microcavity. We find that
these systems can act as promising single photon emitters.
