In this paper, we investigate output accuracy for a Discrete Event Simulation
(DES) model and Agent Based Simulation (ABS) model. The purpose of this
investigation is to find out which of these simulation techniques is the best
one for modelling human reactive behaviour in the retail sector. In order to
study the output accuracy in both models, we have carried out a validation
experiment in which we compared the results from our simulation models to the
performance of a real system. Our experiment was carried out using a large UK
department store as a case study. We had to determine an efficient
implementation of management policy in the store's fitting room using DES and
ABS. Overall, we have found that both simulation models were a good
representation of the real system when modelling human reactive behaviour.
