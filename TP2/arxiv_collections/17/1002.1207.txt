We consider a nanoelectromechanical Josephson junction, where a suspended
nanowire serves as a superconducting weak link, and show that an applied DC
bias voltage an result in suppression of the flexural vibrations of the wire.
This cooling effect is achieved through the transfer of vibronic energy quanta
first to voltage driven Andreev states and then to extended quasiparticle
electronic states. Our analysis, which is performed for a nanowire in the form
of a metallic carbon nanotube and in the framework of the density matrix
formalism, shows that such self-cooling is possible down to a level where the
average occupation number of the lowest flexural vibration mode of the nanowire
is $\sim 0.1$.
