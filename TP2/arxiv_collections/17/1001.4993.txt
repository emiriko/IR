The aim of "A glance beyond the quantum model" [arXiv:0907.0372] to modernize
the Correspondence Principle is compromised by an assumption that a classical
model must start with the idea of particles, whereas in empirical terms
particles are secondary to events. The discussion also proposes,
contradictorily, that observers who wish to model the macroscopic world
classically should do so in terms of classical fields, whereas, if we are to
use fields, it would more appropriate to adopt the mathematics of random
fields. Finally, the formalism used for discussion of Bell inequalities
introduces two assumptions that are not necessary for a random field model,
locality of initial conditions and non-contextuality, even though these
assumptions are, in contrast, very natural for a classical particle model.
Whether we discuss physics in terms of particles or in terms of events and
(random) fields leads to differences that a glance would be well to notice.
