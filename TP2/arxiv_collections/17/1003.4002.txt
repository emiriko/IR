Beginning with a historical account of the spectral classification, its
refinement through additional criteria is presented. The line strengths and
ratios used in two dimensional classifications of each spectral class are
described. A parallel classification scheme for metal-poor stars and the
standards used for classification are presented. The extension of spectral
classification beyond M to L and T and spectroscopic classification criteria
relevant to these classes are described. Contemporary methods of
classifications based upon different automated approaches are introduced.
