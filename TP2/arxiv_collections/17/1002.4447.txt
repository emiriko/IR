GJ 436b is the first extrasolar planet discovered that resembles Neptune in
mass and radius. The particularly interesting property of Neptune-sized planets
is that their mass Mp and radius Rp are close to theoretical M-R relations of
water planets. Given Mp, Rp, and equilibrium temperature, however, various
internal compositions are possible. A broad set of interior structure models is
presented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and
possible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets, such as GJ
436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density. We
show how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints
from formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational
constraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2. We
model the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope,
water layer, rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope, rocky core). For
water, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.
Some admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.
For the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,
still extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in
the plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.
Metal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be
determined from a measurement of k2. In contrast, models with 0.3<k2<0.82
require high metallicities Z1<0.89 in the outer envelope. The uncertainty in
core mass decreases to 0.4 Mp, if k2>0.3, and further to 0.2 Mp, if k2>0.5, and
core mass and Z1 become sensitive functions of k2. To further narrow the set of
solutions, a proper treatment of the atmosphere and the evolution is necessary.
