The mechanism of superconductivity and magnetism and their possible interplay
have recently been under debate in pnictides. A likely pairing mechanism
includes an important role of spin fluctuations and can be expressed in terms
of the magnetic susceptibility chi. The latter is therefore a key quantity in
the determination of both the magnetic properties of the system in the normal
state, and of the contribution of spin fluctuations to the pairing potential. A
basic ingredient to obtain chi is the independent-electron susceptibility chi0.
Using LaO1-xFxFeAs as a prototype material, in this report we present a
detailed ab-initio study of chi0(q,omega), as a function of doping and of the
internal atomic positions. The resulting static chi0(q,0) is consistent with
both the observed M-point related magnetic stripe phase in the parent compound,
and with the existence of incommensurate magnetic structures predicted by
ab-initio calculations upon doping.
