Let D = (D_n)_{n\ge1} be an elliptic divisibility sequence. We study the set
S(D) of indices n satisfying n | D_n. In particular, given an index n in S(D),
we explain how to construct elements nd in S(D), where d is either a prime
divisor of D_n, or d is the product of the primes in an aliquot cycle for D. We
also give bounds for the exceptional indices that are not constructed in this
way.
