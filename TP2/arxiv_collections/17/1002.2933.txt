The Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) is being used to conduct a low-Galactic
latitude survey, to map the distribution of galaxies and large-scale structures
behind the Milky Way through detection of galaxies' neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm
emission. This Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) survey finds new HI galaxies which lie
hidden behind the Milky Way, and also provides redshifts for partially-obscured
galaxies known at other wavelengths. Before the commencement of the full
survey, two low-latitude precursor regions were observed, totalling 138 square
degrees, with 72 HI galaxies detected. Detections through the inner Galaxy
generally have no cataloged counterparts in any other waveband, due to the
heavy extinction and stellar confusion. Detections through the outer Galaxy are
more likely to have 2MASS counterparts. We present the results of these
precursor observations, including a catalog of the detected galaxies, with
their HI parameters. The survey sensitivity is well described by a flux- and
linewidth-dependent signal-to-noise ratio of 6.5. ALFA ZOA galaxies which also
have HI measurements in the literature show good agreement between our
measurements and previous work. The inner Galaxy precursor region was chosen to
overlap the HI Parkes Zone of Avoidance Survey so ALFA performance could be
quickly assessed. The outer Galaxy precursor region lies north of the Parkes
sky. Low-latitude large-scale structure in this region is revealed, including
an overdensity of galaxies near l = 183 deg and between 5000 - 6000 km/s in the
ZOA. The full ALFA ZOA survey will be conducted in two phases: a shallow survey
using the observing techniques of the precursor observations, and also a deep
phase with much longer integration time, with thousands of galaxies predicted
for the final catalog.
