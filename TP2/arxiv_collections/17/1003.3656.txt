It is not easy to identify and classify low-amplitude variables, but it is
important that the classification is done correctly. We use photometry and
spectroscopy to classify low-amplitude variables in a 246 deg^2 part of the
Akerlof et al. (2002) field. Akerlof and collaborators found that 38% of the RR
Lyrae stars in their 2000 deg^2 test field were RR1 (type c). This suggests
that these RR Lyrae stars belong to an Oosterhoff Type II population while
their period distribution is primarily Oosterhoff Type I. Our observations
support their RR0 (type ab) classifications, however 6 of the 7 stars that they
classified as RR1 (type c) are eclipsing binaries. Our classifications are
supported by spectroscopic metallicities, line-broadening and Galactic rotation
measurements. Our 246 deg^2 field contains 16 RR Lyrae stars that are brighter
than m_R = 14.5; only four of these are RR1 (type c). This corresponds to an
Oosterhoff Type I population in agreement with the period distribution.
