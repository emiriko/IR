Tabish Qureshi (2010) has recently objected to an aspect of my discussion of
a thought experiment by Srikanth (2001). I believe his objection is based on a
misunderstanding about my presentation, but I accept responsibility for not
being more clear. Here I attempt to clear up any confusion and to point out
that one can indeed obtain interference in this experiment based on taking care
to correctly characterize the detection process. I also emphasize that Qureshi
and I are in full agreement concerning the assertion that when interference is
present, there is no genuine 'which slit' information, and that in this case,
the measurement necessary to preserve interference precludes determination of
an actual slit of origin for the photon.
