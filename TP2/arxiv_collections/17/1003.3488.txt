We present precise Doppler measurements of four stars obtained during the
past decade at Keck Observatory by the California Planet Survey (CPS). These
stars, namely, HD 34445, HD 126614, HD 13931, and Gl 179, all show evidence for
a single planet in Keplerian motion. We also present Doppler measurements from
the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) for two of the stars, HD 34445 and Gl 179,
that confirm the Keck detections and significantly refine the orbital
parameters. These planets add to the statistical properties of giant planets
orbiting near or beyond the ice line, and merit follow-up by astrometry,
imaging, and space-borne spectroscopy. Their orbital parameters span wide
ranges of planetary minimum mass (M sin i = 0.38-1.9 M_Jup), orbital period (P
= 2.87-11.5 yr), semi-major axis (a = 2.1-5.2 AU), and eccentricity (e =
0.02-0.41). HD 34445b (P = 2.87 yr, M sin i = 0.79 M_Jup, e = 0.27) is a
massive planet orbiting an old, G-type star. We announce a planet, HD 126614Ab,
and an M dwarf, HD 126614B, orbiting the metal-rich star HD 126614 (which we
now refer to as HD 126614A). The planet, HD 126614Ab, has minimum mass M sin i
= 0.38 M_Jup and orbits the stellar primary with period P = 3.41 yr and orbital
separation a = 2.3 AU. The faint M dwarf companion, HD 126614B, is separated
from the stellar primary by 489 mas (33 AU) and was discovered with direct
observations using adaptive optics and the PHARO camera at Palomar Observatory.
The stellar primary in this new system, HD 126614 A, has the highest measured
metallicity (\feh = +0.56) of any known planet-bearing star. HD 13931b (P =
11.5 yr, M sin i = 1.88 M_Jup, e = 0.02) is a Jupiter analog orbiting a near
solar twin. Gl 179b (P = 6.3 yr, M sin i = 0.82 M_Jup, e = 0.21) is a massive
planet orbiting a faint M dwarf. The high metallicity of Gl 179 is consistent
with the planet-metallicity correlation among M dwarfs, as documented recently
by Johnson and Apps.
