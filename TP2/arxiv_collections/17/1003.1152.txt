Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) states typically have a singlet-gap that vanishes
along real-space lines. These real-space nodes lead to Andreev midgap states
which can serve as a signature of LO pairing. We show that at these nodes, an
odd-parity, spin-triplet component is always induced, leading to a nodeless LO
phase. We find the two-dimensional weak coupling, clean limit s-wave phase
diagram when this spin-triplet part is included. The triplet component is large
and increases the stability of the FFLO phase. We also show that the
spin-triplet contribution pushes the midgap states away from zero energy.
Finally, we show how our results can be explained phenomenologically though
Lifshitz invariants. These invariants provide a simple approach to understand
the role of unconventional pairing states, spin-orbit coupling, and
inhomogeneous mixed singlet-triplet states that are not due to a FFLO
instability. We discuss our results in the context of organic superconductors.
