Algorithms distinguishing jets originating from b quarks from other jet
flavors are important tools in the physics program of the D0 experiment at the
Fermilab Tevatron p-pbar collider. This article describes the methods that have
been used to identify b-quark jets, exploiting in particular the long lifetimes
of b-flavored hadrons, and the calibration of the performance of these
algorithms based on collider data.
