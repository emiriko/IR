This paper defines the Arrwwid number of a recursive tiling (or space-filling
curve) as the smallest number w such that any ball Q can be covered by w tiles
(or curve sections) with total volume O(vol(Q)). Recursive tilings and
space-filling curves with low Arrwwid numbers can be applied to optimise disk,
memory or server access patterns when processing sets of points in
d-dimensional space. This paper presents recursive tilings and space-filling
curves with optimal Arrwwid numbers. For d >= 3, we see that regular cube
tilings and space-filling curves cannot have optimal Arrwwid number, and we see
how to construct alternatives with better Arrwwid numbers.
