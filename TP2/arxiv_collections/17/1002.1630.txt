By confusing the radiance of a single mode light beam, constant in a
transparent medium, with the irradiance which decreases away from the source,
Menzel purports to show that coherent interactions of light with the diluted
media of astrophysics, are negligible. Therefore, to study the interaction of
light with gases, astrophysicists use Monte Carlo computations which work to
study nuclear systems, but not optics: optical modes which may be defined in
inhomogeneous media or for the emissions of single atoms interact coherently
with these systems: a unique formula represents, according to the sign of a
parameter, absorption and coherent emission. The optical and spectroscopic
properties of a very simple model, an extremely hot source in an isotropic
cloud of pure, low pressure, initially cold, huge hydrogen cloud are studied
using Planck's and Einstein's theories. The similarities of the images and the
spectra of this simple model with astronomical observations, for instance of
SNR1987A, Einstein cross, lyman break galaxies, quasars,... is so large that
this model may be an elementary first step in the study of many astrophysical
objects. Adaptations of the model to complex astrophysical systems could
represent them using only the old, standard theories of physics commonly used
in laser spectroscopy.
