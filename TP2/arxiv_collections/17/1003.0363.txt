The complex elastic compliance and dielectric susceptibility of
(Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5})_{1-x}Ba_{x}TiO_{3} (NBT-BT) have been measured in the
composition range between pure NBT and the morphotropic phase boundary
included, 0 <= x <= 0.08. The compliance of NBT presents sharp peaks at the
rhombohedral/tetragonal and tetragonal/cubic transitions, allowing the
determination of the tetragonal region of the phase diagram, up to now
impossible due to the strong lattice disorder and small distortions and
polarizations involved. In spite of ample evidence of disorder and structural
heterogeneity, the R-T transition remains sharp up to x = 0.06, whereas the T-C
transition merges into the diffuse and relaxor-like transition associated with
broad maxima of the dielectric and elastic susceptibilities. An attempt is made
at relating the different features in the anelastic and dielectric curves to
different modes of octahedral rotations and polar cation shifts. The
possibility is also considered that the cation displacements locally have
monoclinic symmetry, as for PZT near the morphotropic phase boundary.
