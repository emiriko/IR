We examine the diffraction properties of lattice dynamical systems of
algebraic origin. It is well-known that diverse dynamical properties occur
within this class. These include different orders of mixing (or higher-order
correlations), the presence or absence of measure rigidity (restrictions on the
set of possible shift-invariant ergodic measures to being those of algebraic
origin), and different entropy ranks (which may be viewed as the maximal
spatial dimension in which the system resembles an i.i.d.\ process). Despite
these differences, it is shown that the resulting diffraction spectra are
essentially indistinguishable, thus raising further difficulties for the
inverse problem of structure determination from diffraction spectra. Some of
them may be resolved on the level of higher-order correlation functions, which
we also briefly compare.
