We propose and demonstrate scheme for direct experimental testing of quantum
commutation relations for Pauli operators. The implemented device is an
advanced quantum processor that involves two programmable quantum gates.
Depending on a state of two-qubit program register, we can test either
commutation or anti-commutation relations. Very good agreement between theory
and experiment is observed, indicating high-quality performance of the
implemented quantum processor and reliable verification of commutation
relations for Pauli operators.
