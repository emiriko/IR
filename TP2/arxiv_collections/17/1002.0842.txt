We study the excitation spectrum of a topological insulator in contact with
an s-wave superconductor, starting from a microscopic model, and develop an
effective low-energy model for the proximity effect. In the vicinity of the
Dirac cone vertex, the effective model describing the states localized at the
interface is well approximated by a model of Dirac electrons experiencing
superconducting s-wave pairing. Away from the cone vertex, the induced pairing
potential develops a p-wave component with a magnitude sensitive to the
structure of the interface. Observing the induced s-wave superconductivity may
require tuning the chemical potential close to the Dirac point. Furthermore, we
find that the proximity of the superconductor leads to a significant
renormalization of the original parameters of the effective model describing
the surface states of a topological insulator.
