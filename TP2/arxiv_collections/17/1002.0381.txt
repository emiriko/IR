We study the massless field on $D_n = D \cap \tfrac{1}{n} \Z^2$, where $D
\subseteq \R^2$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary, with Hamiltonian
$\CH(h) = \sum_{x \sim y} \CV(h(x) - h(y))$. The interaction $\CV$ is assumed
to be symmetric and uniformly convex. This is a general model for a
$(2+1)$-dimensional effective interface where $h$ represents the height. We
take our boundary conditions to be a continuous perturbation of a macroscopic
tilt: $h(x) = n x \cdot u + f(x)$ for $x \in \partial D_n$, $u \in \R^2$, and
$f \colon \R^2 \to \R$ continuous. We prove that the fluctuations of linear
functionals of $h(x)$ about the tilt converge in the limit to a Gaussian free
field on $D$, the standard Gaussian with respect to the weighted Dirichlet
inner product $(f,g)_\nabla^\beta = \int_D \sum_i \beta_i \partial_i f_i
\partial_i g_i$ for some explicit $\beta = \beta(u)$. In a subsequent article,
we will employ the tools developed here to resolve a conjecture of Sheffield
that the zero contour lines of $h$ are asymptotically described by $SLE(4)$, a
conformally invariant random curve.
