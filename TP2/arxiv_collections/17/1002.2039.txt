Overlap with the separable state is introduced in this paper for the purpose
of characterizing the overall correlation in many-body systems. This definition
has clear geometric and physical meaning, and moreover can be considered as the
generalization of the concept-Anderson Orthogonality Catastrophe. As an
exemplification, it is used to mark the phase transition in the Dicke model for
zero and finite temperature. And our discussion shows that it can faithfully
reflect the phase transition properties of this model whether for zero or
finite temperature. Furthermore the overlap for ground state also indicates the
appearance of multipartite entanglement in Dicke model.
