The last decade has seen a revival of interest in pebble games in the context
of proof complexity. Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying
resolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different
subsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space
trade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a
graph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit
(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.
Unfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution
proofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling
is needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate
deterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to
find specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties
for black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit
simulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to
both these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white
pebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph
families for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than
black pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution
can strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower
bounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.
Second, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the
same properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp
simultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various
parameter settings. Both of our contributions have been instrumental in
obtaining the time-space trade-off results for resolution-based proof systems
in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2009].
