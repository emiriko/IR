In this paper, a different perspective of constructing the CA models is
proposed. Its kernel, the Local Symmetric Distribution Principle, relates to
some fundamental concepts in physics, which maybe raise a wide interest. With a
rich palette of configurations, this model also hints its capability of
universal computation.
