ALADIN multifragmentation data show features characteristic of a critical
behavior, which are very well reproduced by a bond percolation model. This
suggests, in the context of the lattice gas model, that fragments are formed at
nearly normal nuclear densities and temperatures corresponding to the Kertesz
line. Calculations performed with a lattice gas model have shown that similarly
good reproduction of the data can also be achieved at lower densities,
particularly in the liquid-gas coexistence region.
