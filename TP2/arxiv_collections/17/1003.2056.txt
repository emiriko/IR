It's widely recognized that general relativity emerges if we impose
invariance under local translations and local Lorentz transformations. In the
same manner supergravity arises when we impose invariance under local
supersymmetry. In this paper we show how to treat general relativity as a
common gauge theory, without introducing a metric or a tetrad field. The price
to pay for such simplification is the acceptance of non-locality. At first
glance the resulting theory seems renormalizable. Finally we derive Feynman
vertices for such theory.
