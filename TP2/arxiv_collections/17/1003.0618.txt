In order to understand the formation mechanism of the disks around Be stars
it is imperative to have a good overview of both the differences and
similarities between normal B stars and the Be stars. Here we investigate a
previous report that there may be a large population of sub-arcsecond
companions to Be stars. We present the first systematic, comparative imaging
study of the binary properties of matched samples of B and Be stars observed
using the same equipment. We obtained high angular resolution (0.07-0.1 arcsec)
K band Adaptive Optics data of 40 B stars and 39 Be stars. The separations that
can be probed range from 0.1 to 8 arcsec (corresponding to 20-1000 AU), and
magnitude differences up to 10 magnitudes can in principle be covered. We
detect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of
30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests
demonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency
but also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences
and mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as
responsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than
20 AU. Close companions are known to affect the circumstellar disks of Be
stars, but as not all Be stars have been found to be close binaries, the data
suggest that binarity can not be responsible for the Be phenomenon in all Be
stars. Finally, the similarities of the binary parameters themselves also shed
light on the Be formation mechanism. They strongly suggest that the initial
conditions that gave rise to B and Be star formation must, to all intents and
purposes, be similar. This in turn indicates that the Be phenomenon is not the
result of a different star formation mechanism.
