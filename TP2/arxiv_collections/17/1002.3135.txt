We show that, for any system with a number of levels which can be identified
with n qubits, there is an inequality for the correlations between three
compatible dichotomic measurements which must be satisfied by any noncontextual
theory, but is violated by any quantum state. Remarkably, the violation grows
exponentially with n, and the tolerated error per correlation also increases
with n, showing that state-independent quantum contextuality is experimentally
observable in complex systems.
