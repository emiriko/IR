We study the use of atom interferometers as detectors for gravitational waves
in the mHz - Hz frequency band, which is complementary to planned optical
interferometers, such as laser interferometer gravitational wave observatories
(LIGOs) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We describe an
optimized atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor (AGIS), whose
sensitivity is proportional to the baseline length to power of 5/2, as opposed
to the linear scaling of a more conservative design. Technical challenges are
briefly discussed, as is a table-top demonstrator AGIS that is presently under
construction at Berkeley. We study a range of potential sources of
gravitational waves visible to AGIS, including galactic and extra-galactic
binaries. Based on the predicted shot noise limited performance, AGIS should be
capable of detecting type Ia supernovae precursors within 500 pc, up to 200
years beforehand. An optimized detector may be capable of detecting waves from
RX J0806.3+1527.
