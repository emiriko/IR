We have investigated the effect of Cd substitution on the archetypal heavy
fermion antiferromagnet CeIn$_3$ via magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and
resistivity measurements. The suppression of the Neel temperature, T$_{N}$,
with Cd doping is more pronounced than with Sn. Nevertheless, a doping induced
quantum critical point does not appear to be achievable in this system. The
magnetic entropy at $T_N$ and the temperature of the maximum in resistivity are
also systematically suppressed with Cd, while the effective moment and the
Curie-Weiss temperature in the paramagnetic state are not affected. These
results suggest that Cd locally disrupts the AFM order on its neighboring Ce
moments, without affecting the valence of Ce. Moreover, the temperature
dependence of the specific heat below $T_N$ is not consistent with 3D magnons
in pure as well as in Cd-doped CeIn$_3$, a point that has been missed in
previous investigations of CeIn$_3$ and that has bearing on the type of quantum
criticality in this system.
