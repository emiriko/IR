This contribution is a first step aiming to address a general question: what
can be concluded on impact craters which exist on various planetary system
objects, by combining astronomical data and known theoretical results from
solid state physics. Assuming that the material of the target body is of
crystaline structure,it is shown that a simple calculation gives the
possibility of estimating the speed of the impactor responsible for the
creation of a crater.A test value,calculated using observed data on the
composition of some asteroids,gives a value of the speed in good agreement with
results of celestial mechanics.
