We investigate the effect of anharmonicity on the one-dimensional half-filled
Holstein model by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. By
calculating the order parameters we find that with and without anharmonicity
there is always an transition from a disorder phase to a dimerized phase.
Moreover, in the dimerized phase a lattice dimerization and a charge density
wave coexist. The anharmonicity represented by the quartic term suppresses the
dimerization as well as the charge density wave, while a double-well potential
favors the dimerization. In addition, by calculating the correlation exponents
we show that the disorder phase is metallic with gapless charge excitations and
gapful spin excitations while in the dimerized phase both excitations are
gapful.
