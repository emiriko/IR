We investigate a phase-field-crystal model for homogeneous nucleation.
Instead of solving the time evolution of a density field towards equilibrium we
use a String Method to identify saddle points in phase space. The saddle points
allow to obtain the nucleation barrier and the critical nucleus. The advantage
of using the phase-field-crystal model for this task is its ability to resolve
atomistic effects. The obtained results indicate different properties of the
critical nucleus compared with bulk crystals and show a detailed description of
the nucleation process.
