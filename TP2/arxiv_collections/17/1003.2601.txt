We compute the thermal conductivity and sound attenuation length of a dilute
atomic Fermi gas in the framework of kinetic theory. Above the critical
temperature for superfluidity, T_c, the quasi-particles are fermions, whereas
below T_c, the dominant excitations are phonons. We calculate the thermal
conductivity in both cases. We find that at unitarity the thermal conductivity
\kappa in the normal phase scales as \kappa ~ T^{3/2}. In the superfluid phase
we find \kappa ~ T^{2}. At high temperature the Prandtl number, the ratio of
the momentum and thermal diffusion constants, is 2/3. The ratio increases as
the temperature is lowered. As a consequence we expect sound attenuation in the
normal phase just above T_c to be dominated by shear viscosity. We comment on
the possibility of extracting the shear viscosity of the dilute Fermi gas at
unitarity using measurements of the sound absorption length.
