We study higher rank Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold using
Joyce-Song's wall-crossing formula. We construct quivers whose counting
invariants coincide with the Donaldson-Thomas invariants. As a corollary, we
prove the integrality and a certain symmetry for the higher rank invariants.
