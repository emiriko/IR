The corotation radius in a spiral galaxy is the radius where the spiral
pattern speed has the same velocity of the rotation curve. By compiling results
from the literature for 20 spiral galaxies we verified a strong correlation
between the radius of the minima or inflections of the metallicity distribution
and the corotation radius.
