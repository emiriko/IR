The static electric polarizability of the neutron is evaluated using
domain-wall valence quarks on a MILC asqtad sea quark ensemble corresponding to
a pion mass of m_pi = 357 MeV. Both connected as well as disconnected
contributions are included. The result is quantitatively compatible with the
expectation from chiral effective theory.
