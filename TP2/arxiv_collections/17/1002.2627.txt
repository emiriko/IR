The main goal of the Pennsylvania - Torun Planet Search (PTPS) is detection
and characterization of planets around evolved stars using the high-accuracy
radial velocity (RV) technique. The project is performed with the 9.2 m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. To determine stellar parameters and evolutionary status
for targets observed within the survey complete spectral analysis of all
objects is required. In this paper we present the atmospheric parameters
(effective temperatures, surface gravities, microturbulent velocities and
metallicities) of a subsample of Red Giant Clump stars using strictly
spectroscopic methods based on analysis of equivalent widths of Fe I and Fe II
lines. It is shown that our spectroscopic approach brings reliable and
consistent results.
