Quantum computation has revolutionary potential for speeding algorithms and
for simulating quantum systems such as molecules. We report here a quantum
computer design that performs universal quantum computation within a single
non-degenerate ground state protected from decohering noise by an energy gap
that we argue is system-size-independent. Closely analogous to a traditional
electric circuit, it substantially changes the requirements for quantum
computer construction, easing measurement, timing, and heating problems. Using
the standard adiabatic condition, we present evidence that this design permits
"quantum concurrent processing" distributing a quantum computation among extra
qubits to perform a quantum algorithm of N gates in an amount of time that
scales with the square root of N. One consequence of our work is a fixed gap
version of adiabatic quantum computation, which several arguments hinted could
be impossible.
