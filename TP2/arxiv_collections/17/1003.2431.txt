In this paper, the non-generalized or restricted second law blackhole
dynamics as given by Bekenstein in the beginning is restated, with a rigid
proof, in a different form akin to the statement of the second law of
thermodynamics given by Clausius. The various physical possibilities and
implications of this statement are discussed therein. This paper is a mere
venture into the restricted second law of blackhole dynamics pertaining to
blackholes emitting Hawking radiation. The paper thus considers a didactically
interesting reformulation of the second law of blackhole thermodynamics after
some revisions.
