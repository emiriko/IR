The notions of spectral stability and the spectrum for the Vlasov-Poisson
system linearized about homogeneous equilibria, f_0(v), are reviewed.
Structural stability is reviewed and applied to perturbations of the linearized
Vlasov operator through perturbations of f_0. We prove that for each f_0 there
is an arbitrarily small delta f_0' in W^{1,1}(R) such that f_0+delta f_0$ is
unstable. When $f_0$ is perturbed by an area preserving rearrangement, f_0 will
always be stable if the continuous spectrum is only of positive signature,
where the signature of the continuous spectrum is defined as in previous work.
If there is a signature change, then there is a rearrangement of f_0 that is
unstable and arbitrarily close to f_0 with f_0' in W^{1,1}. This result is
analogous to Krein's theorem for the continuous spectrum. We prove that if a
discrete mode embedded in the continuous spectrum is surrounded by the opposite
signature there is an infinitesimal perturbation in C^n norm that makes f_0
unstable. If f_0 is stable we prove that the signature of every discrete mode
is the opposite of the continuum surrounding it.
