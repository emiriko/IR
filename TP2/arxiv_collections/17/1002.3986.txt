In this work we consider the problem on group classification and conservation
laws of the general first order evolution equations. We obtain the subclasses
of these general equations which are quasi-self-adjoint and self-adjoint. By
using the recent Ibragimov's Theorem on conservation laws, we establish the
conservation laws of the equations admiting self-adjoint equations. We
illustrate our results applying them to the inviscid Burgers' equation. In
particular an infinite number of new symmetries of these equations are found
and their corresponding conservation laws are established.
