K-shell photoabsorption cross sections for the isonuclear C I - C IV ions
have been computed using the R-matrix method. Above the K-shell threshold, the
present results are in good agreement with the independent-particle results of
Reilman & Manson (1979). Below threshold, we also compute the strong 1s -> np
absorption resonances with the inclusion of important spectator Auger
broadening effects. For the lowest 1s -> 2p, 3p resonances, comparisons to
available C II, C III, and C IV experimental results show good agreement in
general for the resonance strengths and positions, but unexplained
discrepancies exist. Our results also provide detailed information on the C I
K-shell photoabsorption cross section including the strong resonance features,
since very limited laboratory experimental data exist. The resultant R-matrix
cross sections are then used to model the Chandra X-ray absorption spectrum of
the blazar Mkn 421.
