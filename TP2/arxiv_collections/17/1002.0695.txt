Double-slit experiments inferring the phase and the amplitude of the
transmission coefficient performed at quantum dots (QD), in the Coulomb
blockade regime, present anomalies at the phase changes depending on the number
of electrons confined. This phase change cannot be explained if one neglects
the electron-electron interactions. Here, we present our numerical results,
which simulate the real sample geometry by solving the Poisson equation in 3D.
The screened potential profile is used to obtain energy eigenstates and
eigenvalues of the QD. We find that, certain energy levels are coupled to the
leads stronger compared to others. Our results give strong support to the
phenomenological models in the literature describing the charging of a QD and
the abrupt phase changes.
