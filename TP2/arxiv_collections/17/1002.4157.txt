We give an explicit formula for the effective partition function of a
harmonically bound particle minimally coupled to a photon field in the dipole
approximation. The effective partition function is shown to be the Laplace
transform of a positive Borel measure, the effective measure of states. The
absolutely continuous part of the latter allows for an analytic continuation,
the singularities of which give rise to resonances. We give the precise
location of these singularities, and show that they are well approximated by of
first order poles with residues equal the multiplicities of the corresponding
eigenspaces of the uncoupled quantum oscillator. Thus we obtain a complete
analytic description of the natural line spectrum of the charged oscillator.
