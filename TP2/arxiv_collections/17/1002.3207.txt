We demonstrate channel selective 0.1-Gb/s photo-receiver operation at telecom
wavelength using a silicon high-Q photonic crystal nanocavity with a laterally
integrated p-i-n diode. Due to the good crystal property of silicon the
measured dark current is only 15 pA. The linear and nonlinear characteristics
are investigated in detail, in which we found that the photo-current is
enhanced of more than 100,000 due to the ultrahigh-Q (>100,000). With the help
of two-photon absorption, which is visible at a surprisingly low input power of
10 nW, the quantum efficiency of this device reaches about 10%.
