The Antarctic Multiband Infrared Camera (AMICA) is a double channel camera
operating in the 2-28 micron infrared domain (KLMNQ bands) that will allow to
characterize and exploit the exceptional advantages for Astronomy, expected
from Dome C in Antarctica. The development of the camera control system is at
its final stage. After the investigation of appropriate solutions against the
critical environment, a reliable instrumentation has been developed. It is
currently being integrated and tested to ensure the correct execution of
automatic operations. Once it will be mounted on the International Robotic
Antarctic Infrared Telescope (IRAIT), AMICA and its equipment will contribute
to the accomplishment of a fully autonomous observatory.
