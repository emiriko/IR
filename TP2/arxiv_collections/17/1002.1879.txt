We consider the KPZ equation in one space dimension with narrow wedge initial
condition, $h(x,t=0)=- |x|/\delta$, $\delta\ll 1$. Based on previous results
for the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with step initial
conditions, we obtain a determinantal formula for the one-point distribution of
the solution $h(x,t)$ valid for any $x$ and $t>0$. The corresponding
distribution function converges in the long time limit, $t\to\infty$, to the
Tracy-Widom distribution. The first order correction is a shift of order
$t^{-1/3}$. We provide numerical computations based on the exact formula.
