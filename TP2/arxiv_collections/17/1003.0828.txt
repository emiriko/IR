The exclusive processes in electron-proton ($ep$) interactions are an
important tool to investigate the QCD dynamics at high energies as they are in
general driven by the gluon content of proton which is strongly subject to
parton saturation effects. In this paper we compute the cross sections for the
exclusive vector meson production as well as the deeply virtual Compton
scattering (DVCS) relying on the color dipole approach and considering the
numerical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation including running
coupling corrections. We show that the small-$x$ evolution given by this
evolution equation is able to describe the DESY-HERA data and is relevant for
the physics of the exclusive observables in future electron-proton colliders
and in photoproduction processes to be measured in coherent interactions at the
LHC.
