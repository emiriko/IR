Recently, a field theoretic model for a UV complete theory of gravity has
been proposed by Ho\~{r}ava. This theory is a non-relativistic renormalizable
gravity theory which coincides with Einstein's general relativity at large
distances. Subsequently L\"{u} et al have formulated the modified Friedmann
equations and have presented a solution in vacuum. In the present work, we
rewrite the modified FRW equations in the form of usual FRW equations in
Einstein gravity and consequences has been analyzed. Also the thermodynamics of
the FRW universe has been studied.
