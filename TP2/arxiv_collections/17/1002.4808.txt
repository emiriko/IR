The transport of relativistic electrons generated in the interaction of
petawatt class lasers with solid targets has been studied through measurements
of the optical emission from their rear surface. The high degree of
polarization of the emission indicates that it is predominantly optical
transition radiation. A halo that surrounds the main region of emission is also
polarized, and is attributed to the effect of electron recirculation. The
variation of the amplitude of the transition radiation with respect to
observation angle provides evidence for the presence of {$\mu$m-size}
filaments.
