Propose a new cryptographic information concept. It allows : - to create
absolutely algorithmic unbreakable ciphers for communication through open
digital channels; - to create new code-breaking methods. They will be the most
efficient decoding methods to-date, with the help of which any of the existing
codes could, in principle, be broken, provided it is not absolutely
unbreakable.
