A search for the Z(3930) resonance in gamma gamma production of the DDbar
system has been performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 384 fb^-1 recorded by the BABAR experiment at the PEP-II
asymmetric-energy electron-positron collider. The DDbar invariant mass
distribution shows clear evidence of the Z(3930) state with a significance of
5.8 sigma. We determine mass and width values of (3926.7 +- 2.7 +- 1.1) MeV/c^2
and (21.3 +- 6.8 +- 3.6) MeV, respectively. A decay angular analysis provides
evidence that the Z(3930) is a tensor state with positive parity and C-parity
(J^PC = 2^++); therefore we identify the Z(3930) state as the chi_c2(2P) meson.
The value of the partial width Gamma_(gamma gamma)xB(Z(3930)-> DDbar) is found
to be (0.24 +- 0.05 +- 0.04) keV.
