The paper presents a current conveyor based multifunction filter. The
proposed circuit can be realized as low pass, high pass, band pass and
elliptical notch filter. The circuit employs two balanced output current
conveyors, four resistors and two grounded capacitors, ideal for integration.
It has only one output terminal and the number of input terminals may be used.
Further, there is no requirement for component matching in the circuit. The
parameter resonance frequency (\omega_0) and bandwidth (\omega_0 /Q) enjoy
orthogonal tuning. The complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
realization of the current conveyor is given for the simulation of the proposed
circuit. A HSPICE simulation of circuit is also studied for the verification of
theoretical results. The non-ideal analysis of CCII is also studied.
