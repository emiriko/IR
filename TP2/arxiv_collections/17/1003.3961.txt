Between July 5th and July 7th 2004, two intriguing fast coronal mass
ejection(CME)-streamer interaction events were recorded by the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). At the beginning of the events, the streamer
was pushed aside from their equilibrium position upon the impact of the rapidly
outgoing and expanding ejecta; then, the streamer structure, mainly the bright
streamer belt, exhibited elegant large scale sinusoidal wavelike motions. The
motions were apparently driven by the restoring magnetic forces resulting from
the CME impingement, suggestive of magnetohydrodynamic kink mode propagating
outwards along the plasma sheet of the streamer. The mode is supported
collectively by the streamer-plasma sheet structure and is therefore named
"streamer wave" in the present study. With the white light coronagraph data, we
show that the streamer wave has a period of about 1 hour, a wavelength varying
from 2 to 4 solar radii, an amplitude of about a few tens of solar radii, and a
propagating phase speed in the range 300 to 500 km s$^{-1}$. We also find that
there is a tendancy for the phase speed to decline with increasing heliocentric
distance. These observations provide good examples of large scale wave
phenomena carried by coronal structures, and have significance in developing
seismological techniques for diagnosing plasma and magnetic parameters in the
outer corona.
