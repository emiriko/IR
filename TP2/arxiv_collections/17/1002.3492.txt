This case study illustrates the potential benefits and risks associated with
the migration of an IT system in the oil & gas industry from an in-house data
center to Amazon EC2 from a broad variety of stakeholder perspectives across
the enterprise, thus transcending the typical, yet narrow, financial and
technical analysis offered by providers. Our results show that the system
infrastructure in the case study would have cost 37% less over 5 years on EC2,
and using cloud computing could have potentially eliminated 21% of the support
calls for this system. These findings seem significant enough to call for a
migration of the system to the cloud but our stakeholder impact analysis
revealed that there are significant risks associated with this. Whilst the
benefits of using the cloud are attractive, we argue that it is important that
enterprise decision-makers consider the overall organizational implications of
the changes brought about with cloud computing to avoid implementing local
optimizations at the cost of organization-wide performance.
