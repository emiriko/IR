We present X-ray observations of the northern outskirts of the relaxed galaxy
cluster A1413 with Suzaku, whose XIS instrument has the low intrinsic
background needed to make measurements of these low surface brightness regions.
We excise 15 point sources superimposed on the image above a flux of $1\times
10^{-14}$ \fluxunit (2--10keV) using XMM-Newton and Suzaku images of the
cluster. We quantify all known systematic errors as part of our analysis, and
show our statistical errors encompasses them for the most part. Our results
extend previous measurements with Chandra and XMM-Newton, and show a
significant temperature drop to about 3keV at the virial radius, $r_{200}$. Our
entropy profile in the outer region ($> 0.5 r_{200}$) joins smoothly onto that
of XMM-Newton, and shows a flatter slope compared with simple models, similar
to a few other clusters observed at the virial radius. The integrated mass of
the cluster at the virial radius is approximately $7.5\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$
and varies by about 30% depending on the particular method used to measure it.
