Some of radiopulsars have anomalous braking index values $n = \Omega
\ddot{\Omega} / \dot{\Omega}^2 \sim \pm (10^3 \div 10^4) $. It is shown that
such values may be related with nondipolar magnetic field. The precession of
neutron star lead to rotation (in reference frame related with neutron star) of
vector of angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}$ along direction of neutron star
magnetic dipole moment $\vec{m}$ with angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}_{p}$. This
process may cause the altering of electric current flow through inner gap and
consequently the current losses with the same time scale as precession period
$T_{p} = 2\pi / \Omega_{p}$. It occurs because of electric current in inner
gaps is determined by Goldreich-Julian charge density $\rho_{GJ} =
-\frac{\vec{\Omega} \cdot \vec{B}}{2\pi c}$, which are depend on angle between
direction of small scale magnetic field and angular velocity $\vec{\Omega}$. It
is essential that pulsar tubes nearby neutron star surface are curved. In
current paper it is considered the only inner gaps with steady, electron charge
limited flow regime.
