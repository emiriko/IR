For the asymmetric simple exclusion process on the integer lattice with
two-sided Bernoulli initial condition, we derive exact formulas for the
following quantities: (1) the probability that site x is occupied at time t;
(2) a correlation function, the probability that site 0 is occupied at time 0
and site x is occupied at time t; (3) the distribution function for the total
flux across 0 at time t and its exponential generating function.
