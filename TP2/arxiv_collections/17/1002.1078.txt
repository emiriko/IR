Representative members of the subatomic particle mass spectrum in the 100 MeV
to 7,000 MeV range are retrodicted to a first approximation using the Kerr
solution of General Relativity. The particle masses appear to form a restricted
set of quantized values of a Kerr-based angular momentum-mass relation: m =
(sqrt n)(M), where values of n are a set of discrete integers and M is a
revised Planck mass. A fractal paradigm manifesting global discrete
self-similarity is critical to a proper determination of M, which differs from
the conventional Planck mass by roughly 19 orders of magnitude. This
exceedingly simple and generic mass equation retrodicts the masses of a
representative set of 27 well-known particles with an average relative error of
1.6%. A more rigorous mass formula, which includes the total spin angular
momentum rule of Quantum Mechanics, the canonical spin values of the particles,
and the dimensionless rotational parameter of the Kerr angular momentum-mass
relation, is able to retrodict the masses of the 8 dominant baryons in the 900
MeV to 1700 MeV range at the 99.7% level, on average.
