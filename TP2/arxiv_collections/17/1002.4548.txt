We study a wiretap channel model where the sender has $M$ transmit antennas
and there are two groups consisting of $J_1$ and $J_2$ receivers respectively.
Each receiver has a single antenna. We consider two scenarios. First we
consider the compound wiretap model -- group 1 constitutes the set of
legitimate receivers, all interested in a common message, whereas group 2 is
the set of eavesdroppers. We establish new lower and upper bounds on the secure
degrees of freedom. Our lower bound is based on the recently proposed
\emph{real interference alignment} scheme. The upper bound provides the first
known example which illustrates that the \emph{pairwise upper bound} used in
earlier works is not tight.
  The second scenario we study is the compound private broadcast channel. Each
group is interested in a message that must be protected from the other group.
Upper and lower bounds on the degrees of freedom are developed by extending the
results on the compound wiretap channel.
