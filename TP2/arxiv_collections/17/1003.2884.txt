Prigogine and Stengers (1988) have pointed to the centrality of the concepts
of "time and eternity" for the cosmology contained in Newtonian physics, but
they have not addressed this issue beyond the domain of physics. The
construction of "time" in the cosmology dates back to debates among Huygens,
Newton, and Leibniz. The deconstruction of this cosmology in terms of the
philosophical questions of the 17th century suggests an uncertainty in the time
dimension. While order has been conceived as an "harmonie pr\'e\'etablie", it
is considered as emergent from an evolutionary perspective. In a "chaology",
one should fully appreciate that different systems may use different clocks.
Communication systems can be considered as contingent in space and time:
substances contain force or action, and they communicate not only in
(observable) extension, but also over time. While each communication system can
be considered as a system of reference for a special theory of communication,
the addition of an evolutionary perspective to the mathematical theory of
communication opens up the possibility of a general theory of communication.
