Statistical properties of the inhomogeneous version of the
Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model of earthquakes is investigated by numerical
simulations. The spatial inhomogeneity is assumed to be dynamical. Critical
features found in the original homogeneous OFC model, e.g., the
Gutenberg-Richter law and the Omori law are often weakened or suppressed in the
presence of inhomogeneity, whereas the characteristic features found in the
original homogeneous OFC model, e.g., the near-periodic recurrence of large
events and the asperity-like phenomena persist.
