We study the origin of the large Seebeck coefficient despite the metallic
conductivity in the La-doped SrTiO$_3$ and Ba-doped KTaO$_3$. We calculate the
band structure of SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, from which the Seebeck coefficient is
obtained using the Boltzmann's equation. We conclude that the multiplicity of
the $t_{2g}$ bands in these materials is one major origin of the good
thermoelectric property in that when compared at a fixed total number of doped
electrons, the Seebeck coefficient and thus the power factor are larger in
multiple band systems than in single band ones because the number of doped
electron bands {\it per band} is smaller in the former. We also find that the
second nearest neighbor hopping integral, which generally has negative values
in these materials and works destructively against the Seebeck effect, is
nearly similar between KTaO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ despite the larger band width in
the former. This can be another factor favorable for thermopower in the
Ba-doped KTaO$_3$.
