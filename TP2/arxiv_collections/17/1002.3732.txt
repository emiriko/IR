In the recent preprints the authors claim that conclusions on the violation
of the Luttinger sum rule (LSR) as put forward in published papers by the
present authors are false or at least not conclusive enough. It concerns the
validity of the LSR within the Mott-Hubbard insulator as manifested in the 1D
model of spinless fermions, and the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. We
show below that arguments against the presented analysis are rather easily
rejected while still the general question of the validity and breakdown of the
LSR remains to be answered.
