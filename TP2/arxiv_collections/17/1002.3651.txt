We have studied a sample of Large Magellanic Cloud red giant binaries that
lie on sequence E in the period--luminosity plane. We show that their combined
light and velocity curves unambiguously demonstrate that they are binaries
showing ellipsoidal variability. By comparing the phased light and velocity
curves of both sequence D and E variables, we show that the sequence D
variation -- the Long Secondary Period -- is not caused by ellipsoidal
variability. We also demonstrate several further differences between stars on
sequences D and E. These include differences in velocity amplitude, in the
distribution of eccentricity, and in the correlations of velocity amplitude
with luminosity and period. We also show that the sequence E stars, unlike
stars on sequence D, do not show any evidence of a mid-infrared excess that
would indicate circumstellar dust.
