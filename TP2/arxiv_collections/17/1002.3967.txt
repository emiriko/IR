We show that any differential operator of the form $L(y)=\sum_{k=0}^{k=N}
a_{k}(x) y^{(k)}$, where $a_k$ is a real polynomial of degree $\leq k$, has all
real eigenvalues in the space of polynomials of degree at most n, for all n.
The eigenvalues are given by the coefficient of $x^n$ in $L(x^{n})$.
  If these eigenvalues are distinct, then there is a unique monic polynomial of
degree n which is an eigenfunction of the operator L- for every non-negative
integer n. As an application we recover Bochner's classification of second
order ODEs with polynomial coefficients and polynomial solutions, as well as a
family of non-classical polynomials.
