The $n$-step delayed sharing information structure is investigated. This
information structure comprises of $K$ controllers that share their information
with a delay of $n$ time steps. This information structure is a link between
the classical information structure, where information is shared perfectly
between the controllers, and a non-classical information structure, where there
is no "lateral" sharing of information among the controllers. Structural
results for optimal control strategies for systems with such information
structures are presented. A sequential methodology for finding the optimal
strategies is also derived. The solution approach provides an insight for
identifying structural results and sequential decomposition for general
decentralized stochastic control problems.
