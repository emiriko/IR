We introduce a generalization of elliptic 6j-symbols, which can be
interpreted as matrix elements for intertwiners between corepresentations of
Felder's elliptic quantum group. For special parameter values, they can be
expressed in terms of multivariable elliptic hypergeometric series related to
the root system A_n. As a consequence, we obtain new biorthogonality relations
for such series.
