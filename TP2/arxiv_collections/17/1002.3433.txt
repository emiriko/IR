High-resolution spectroscopy is a very important tool for studying stellar
physics, perhaps, particularly so for such enigmatic objects like the R Coronae
Borealis and related Hydrogen deficient stars that produce carbon dust in
addition to their peculiar abundances.
  Examples of how high-resolution spectroscopy is used in the study of these
stars to address the two major puzzles are presented: (i) How are such rare
H-deficient stars created? and (ii) How and where are the obscuring soot clouds
produced around the R Coronae Borealis stars?
