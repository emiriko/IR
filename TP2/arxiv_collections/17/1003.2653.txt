Sideband cooling is a technique that potentially allows mechanical resonators
to be prepared in their ground states, important for future applications in
quantum technologies. Tian has recently shown that side-band cooling can be
implemented by modulating the coupling between a nano-resonator and a
superconducting oscillator, a process of frequency conversion [L. Tian, PRB 79,
193407 (2009)]. While side-band cooling is usually treated in the steady-state
regime, the effective resonant coupling will also generate near perfect
state-swapping from the superconductor to the mechanical resonator. We perform
numerical simulations of this system, examining the ground-state cooling
achieved by the state-swapping. Further, we show that the superconducting
oscillator can be used to control the amplitude and phase of the resonator,
while simultaneously cooling it, and thus act as a coherent "quantum feedback
controller".
