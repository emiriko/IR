The fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics is that the system is
equally likely in any of the accessible microstates. Based on this assumption,
the Boltzmann distribution is derived and the full theory of statistical
thermodynamics can be built. In this paper, we show that the Boltzmann
distribution in general can not describe the steady state of open system. Based
on the effective Hamiltonian approach, we calculate the specific heat, the free
energy and the entropy for an open system in steady states. Examples are
illustrated and discussed.
