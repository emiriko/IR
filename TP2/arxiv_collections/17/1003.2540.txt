In these proceedings we illustrate that light, very weakly interacting
particles can arise naturally from physics which is fundamentally connected to
very high energy scales. Searching for them therefore may give us interesting
new insights into the structure of fundamental physics. Prime examples are the
axion, and more general axion-like particles, as well as hidden sector photons
and matter charged under them.
