We present the numerical Quantum Monte Carlo results for the ground state
energy of circular quantum dots in which Rashba spin-orbit iteraction is
present. Diffusion Monte Carlo with spin propagation is applied in order to
treat the spin-orbit interaction correctly, following previous work done in the
fieldof the two-dimensional electron gas. Together with ground state energies,
also numerical results for density and spin-density profiles are given.
