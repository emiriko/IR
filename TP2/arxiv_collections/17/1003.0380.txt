In this article we present an example of a discrete group $\Sigma_\C\subset
PSL(3,\Bbb{R})$ whose action on $\P^2$ does no have invariant projective
subspaces, is not conjugated to complex hyperbolic group and its limit set in
the sense of Kulkarni on $\Bbb{P}^2_\Bbb{C}$ has infinite lines in general
position.
