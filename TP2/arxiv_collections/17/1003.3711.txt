A new technique has been developed to calculate scattering of spin-1/2 and
spin-0 particles. The so called momentum-helicity basis states are constructed
from the helicity and the momentum states, which are not expanded in the
angular momentum states. Thus, all angular momentum states are taken into
account. Compared with the partial-wave approach this technique will then give
more benefit especially in calculations for higher energies. Taking as input a
simple spin-orbit potential, the Lippman-Schwinger equations for the T-matrix
elements are solved and some observables are calculated.
