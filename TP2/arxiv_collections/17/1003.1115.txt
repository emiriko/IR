This paper performs a semi-analytic study of relativistic blast waves in the
context of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Although commonly used in a wide range of
analytical and numerical studies, the equation of state (EOS) with a constant
adiabatic index is a poor approximation for relativistic hydrodynamics.
Adopting a more realistic EOS with a variable adiabatic index, we present a
simple form of jump conditions for relativistic hydrodynamical shocks. Then we
describe in detail our technique of modeling a very general class of GRB blast
waves with a long-lived reverse shock. Our technique admits an arbitrary radial
stratification of the ejecta and ambient medium. We use two different methods
to find dynamics of the blast wave: (1) customary pressure balance across the
blast wave and (2) the "mechanical model". Using a simple example model, we
demonstrate that the two methods yield significantly different dynamical
evolutions of the blast wave. We show that the pressure balance does not
satisfy the energy conservation for an adiabatic blast wave while the
mechanical model does. We also compare two sets of afterglow light curves
obtained with the two different methods.
