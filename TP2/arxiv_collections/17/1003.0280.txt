Studying the radial variation of the stellar mass function in globular
clusters (GCs) has proved a valuable tool to explore the collisional dynamics
leading to mass segregation and core collapse. In order to study the radial
dependence of the luminosity and mass function of M 10, we used ACS/HST deep
high resolution archival images, reaching out to approximately the cluster's
half-mass radius (rhm), combined with deep WFPC2 images that extend our radial
coverage to more than 2 rhm. From our photometry, we derived a radial mass
segregation profile and a global mass function that we compared with those of
simulated clusters containing different energy sources (namely hard binaries
and/or an IMBH) able to halt core collapse and to quench mass segregation. A
set of direct N-body simulations of GCs, with and without an IMBH of mass 1% of
the total cluster mass, comprising different initial mass functions (IMFs) and
primordial binary fractions, was used to predict the observed mass segregation
profile and mass function. The mass segregation profile of M 10 is not
compatible with cluster models without either an IMBH or primordial binaries,
as a source of energy appears to be moderately quenching mass segregation in
the cluster. Unfortunately, the present observational uncertainty on the binary
fraction in M10 does not allow us to confirm the presence of an IMBH in the
cluster, since an IMBH, a dynamically non-negligible binary fraction (~ 5%), or
both can equally well explain the radial dependence of the cluster mass
function.
