In view of the implementation of beam-monitoring sensors for CERN's Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), and also in order to validate Thermoluminescence
Detectors as a versatile tool to measure ionizing radiation doses in mixed
fields at hadron colliders such as the LHC, chemical vapor deposition diamond
sensors have been evaluated and calibrated at CERN's Proton Synchrotron
accelerator. Special attention was paid to understanding whether
lithiumfluoride thermoluminescence detectors are suitable as measuring devices
in these radiation fields.
