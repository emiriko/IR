We present the first full interferometric simulations of galaxy clusters
containing radio plasma bubbles as observed by the proposed band 1 receiver
system for the ALMA telescope. We discuss the observational requirements for
detecting intracluster substructure directly from the SZ signal, including
integration time estimates, and the advantages of these observations over those
made with the current generation of SZ survey instruments.
