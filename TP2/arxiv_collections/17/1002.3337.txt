Selection of the most suitable substrate for a Microstrip antenna is a matter
of prime importance. This is because many limitations of the microstrip antenna
such as high return loss, low gain and low efficiency can be overcome by
selecting an appropriate substrate for fabrication of the antenna, without
shifting the resonant frequency significantly. The substate properties such as
its dielectric constant, loss tangent have a pronounced effect on the antenna
characteristics. Some of the critical properties that are to be taken care of
while selecting a dielectric are homogeneity, moisture absorption and adhesion
of metal- foil cladding. In this paper a comprehensive study of the effect of
variation of substrate material on the antenna properties has been presented.
