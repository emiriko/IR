We study relaxation towards a stationary out of equilibrium state by
analizing a one-dimensional stochastic process followed by a particle
accelerated by an external field and propagating through a thermal bath. The
effect of collisions is described within Botlzmann's kinetic theory. We present
analytical solutions for the Maxwell gas and for the very hard particle model.
The exponentially fast relaxation of the velocity distribution toward the
stationary form is demonstrated. In the reference frame moving with constant
drift velocity the hydrodynamic diffusive mode is shown to govern the
distribution in the position space. We show that the exact value of the
diffusion coefficient for any value of the field is correctly predicted by
Green-Kubo autocorrelation formula generalized to the stationary state.
