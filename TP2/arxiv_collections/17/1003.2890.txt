The effect of disorder on the electronic properties near the Mott transition
is studied in an organic superconductor
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Br, which is systematically irradiated
by X-ray. We observe that X-ray irradiation causes Anderson-type electron
localization due to molecular disorder. The resistivity at low temperatures
demonstrates variable range hopping conduction with Coulomb interaction. The
experimental results show clearly that the electron localization by disorder is
enhanced by the Coulomb interaction near the Mott transition.
