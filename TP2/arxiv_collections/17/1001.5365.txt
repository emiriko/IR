We investigate the many-body level density of gas of non-interacting
fermions. We determine its behavior as a function of the temperature and the
number of particles. As the temperature increases, and beyond the usual
Sommerfeld expansion that describes the degenerate gas behavior, corrections
due to a finite number of particles lead to Gumbel-like contributions. We
discuss connections with the partition problem in number theory, extreme value
statistics as well as differences with respect to the Bose gas.
