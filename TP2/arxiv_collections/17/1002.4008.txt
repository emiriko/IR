There are several well-known methods that one can use to construct Hadamard
matrices from base sequences BS(m,n). In view of the recent classification of
base sequences BS(n+1,n) for n <= 30, it may be of interest to show on an
example how prolific these methods are. For that purpose we have selected the
Hadamard matrices of order 60. By using these methods and the transposition map
we have constructed 1759 nonequivalent Hadamard matrices of order 60.
