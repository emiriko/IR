We present here the preliminary results of the study of the fluorescent iron
line emission from X-ray pulsars with Be companions. We propose to use
properties of this emission to investigate the spatial distribution and
physical conditions of the matter around the compact object as well as in the
binary system as a whole. Using data of the RXTE observatory the iron line
behavior in the transient X-ray pulsar V 0332+53 spectrum was studied during
the powerful type II outburst in 2004-2005. Particularly, we investigated a
variability of the iron line equivalent width on different time scales (pulse
period, orbital period, outburst phase) and searched for its correlation with
the continuum flux, spectral parameters, etc.
