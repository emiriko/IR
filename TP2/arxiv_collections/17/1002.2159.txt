Recent measurements have shown that a continuously tunable bandgap of up to
250 meV can be generated in biased bilayer graphene [Y. Zhang et al., Nature
459, 820 (2009)], opening up pathway for possible graphene-based nanoelectronic
and nanophotonic devices operating at room temperature. Here, we show that the
optical response of this system is dominated by bound excitons. The main
feature of the optical absorbance spectrum is determined by a single symmetric
peak arising from excitons, a profile that is markedly different from that of
an interband transition picture. Under laboratory conditions, the binding
energy of the excitons may be tuned with the external bias going from zero to
several tens of meV's. These novel strong excitonic behaviors result from a
peculiar, effective ``one-dimensional'' joint density of states and a
continuously-tunable bandgap in biased bilayer graphene. Moreover, we show that
the electronic structure (level degeneracy, optical selection rules, etc.) of
the bound excitons in a biased bilayer graphene is markedly different from that
of a two-dimensional hydrogen atom because of the pseudospin physics.
