The slow neutron capture process in massive stars (the weak s-process)
produces most of the s-only isotopes in the mass region 60 < A < 90. The
nuclear reaction rates used in simulations of this process have a profound
effect on the final s-process yields. We generated 1D stellar models of a 25
solar mass star varying the 12C + 12C rate by a factor of 10 and calculated
full nucleosynthesis using the post-processing code PPN. Increasing or
decreasing the rate by a factor of 10 affects the convective history and
nucleosynthesis, and consequently the final yields.
