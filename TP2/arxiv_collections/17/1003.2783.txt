According to the so-called Quantum Darwinist approach, the emergence of
"classical islands" from a quantum background is assumed to obey a (selection)
principle of maximal information. We illustrate this idea by considering the
coupling of two oscillators (modes). As our approach suggests that the
classical limit could have emerged throughout a long and progressive Evolution
mechanism, it is likely that primitive living organisms behave in a "more
quantum", "less classical" way than more evolved ones. This brings us to
seriously consider the possibility to measure departures from classicality
exhibited by biological systems. We describe an experimental proposal the aimed
at revealing the presence of entanglement in the biophotonic radiation emitted
by biological sources.
