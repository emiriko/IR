The flux pinning force density (Fp) of the single crystalline FeTe0.60Se0.40
superconductor has been calculated from the magnetization measurements. The
normalized Fp versus h (=H/Hirr) curves are scaled using the Dew-Hughes formula
to underline the pinning mechanism in the compound. The obtained values of
pinning parameters p and q indicate the vortex pinning by the mixing of the
surface and the point core pinning of the normal centers. The vortex phase
diagram has also been drawn for the first time for the FeTe0.60Se0.40, which
has very high values of critical current density Jc ~ 1.10(5) Amp/cm2 and the
upper critical field Hc2(0) = 65T, with a reasonably high transition
temperature Tc =14.5K.
