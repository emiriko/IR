A simple model and method is proposed here to determine argon metastable
number densities and electron temperature with the assumption of a
Maxwell-Boltzmann electron energy distribution. This method is based on the
availability of experimental relative emission intensities of only four argon
lines that originate from any of the 4p argon levels. The proposed model has a
relatively wide range of validity for laboratory plasmas that contain argon gas
and can be a valuable tool for the emerging field of atmospheric microplasmas,
for which diagnostics is still limited.
