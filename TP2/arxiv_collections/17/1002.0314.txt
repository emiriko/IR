We discuss quantum entanglement in the context of the thermodynamic arrow of
time. We review the role of correlations in entropy-decreasing events and prove
that the occurrence of a transformation between two thermodynamic states
constitutes a new type of entanglement witness, one not defined as a separating
plane in state space between separable and entangled states, but as a physical
process dependent on the local initial properties of the states. Extending work
by Partovi, we consider a general entangled multipartite system that allows
large reversals of the thermodynamic arrow of time. We describe a hierarchy of
arrows that arises from the different correlations allowed in a quantum state
and examine these features in the context of Maxwell's Demon. We examine in
detail the case of three qubits, and also propose some simple experimental
demonstrations possible with small numbers of qubits.
