We study the coupling between a photonic crystal cavity and an off-resonant
quantum dot under resonant excitation of the cavity or the quantum dot.
Linewidths of the quantum dot and the cavity as a function of the excitation
laser power are measured. We show that the linewidth of the quantum dot,
measured by observing the cavity emission, is significantly broadened compared
to the theoretical estimate. This indicates additional incoherent coupling
between the quantum dot and the cavity.
