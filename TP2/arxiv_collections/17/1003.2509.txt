We have studied the interplay between disorder and cooperative scattering for
single scattering limit in the presence of a driving laser. Analytical results
have been derived and we have observed cooperative scattering effects in a
variety of experiments, ranging from thermal atoms in an optical dipole trap,
atoms released from a dark MOT and atoms in a BEC, consistent with our
theoretical predictions.
