Models for noncoherent error control in random linear network coding (RLNC)
and store and forward (SAF) have been recently proposed. In this paper, we
model different types of random network communications as the transmission of
flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us
to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding
(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously
proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we
first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in
the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and
throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of
partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC
outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more
efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible
alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which
generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus
reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct
metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of
codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in
particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on
rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The
gain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of
complexity.
