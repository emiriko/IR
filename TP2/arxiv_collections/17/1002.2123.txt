We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices where the
matrix elements depend exponentially on the distance between uniformly and
randomly distributed points. This model arises naturally in various physical
contexts, such as the diffusion of particles, slow relaxations in glasses, and
scalar phonon localization. Using a combination of a renormalization group
procedure and a direct moment calculation, we find the eigenvalue distribution
density (i.e., the spectrum) and the localization properties of the eigenmodes,
for arbitrary dimension. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of the
results.
