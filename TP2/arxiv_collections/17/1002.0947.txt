We study theoretically the surface of a topological insulator with a sliding
magnetic superlattice coated above. By analyzing time-dependent Dirac
equations, the dynamics of the zero mode is investigated. When the
superlattice's sliding velocity is smaller (larger) than the Fermi velocity of
topological insulator, the zero mode is perfectly (imperfectly) pumped. We also
propose the application of this setup, which rectifies currents or generates
pulse currents. It would provide a prototype of electronic devices based on
topological insulator.
