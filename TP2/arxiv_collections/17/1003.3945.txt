The improved two-scale model is used to perform the fit to the semi-inclusive
deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) data of HERMES experiment at DESY on nuclear
targets. The ratio of hadron multiplicity on nuclear target to the deuterium
one is chosen as observable, as usually. The two-parameter's fit gives
satisfactory agreement with the data in term of $\chi^2$ criterium. Best values
of parameters are then used to calculate the nuclear multiplicity ratio for the
hadrons not included in the fit procedure.
