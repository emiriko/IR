Alternative materials are required to enhance the efficacy of plasmonic
devices. We discuss the optical properties of a number of alloys, doped metals,
intermetallics, silicides, metallic glasses and high pressure materials. We
conclude that due to the probability of low frequency interband transitions,
materials with partially occupied d-states perform poorly as plasmonic
materials, ruling out many alloys, intermetallics and silicides as viable. The
increased probability of electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering rules
out many doped and glassy metals.
