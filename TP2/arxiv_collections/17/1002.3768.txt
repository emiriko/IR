We present combined searches for the Low Mass Standard Model Higgs boson at a
center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV, using up to 5 fb$^{-1}$ of data
collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The major
contributing processes are associated production ($WH\to l\nu bb$, $ZH\to\nu\nu
bb$, $ZH\to ll bb$). The significant improvements across the full mass range
resulting from the larger data sets and improved analyses as well as future
prospects are discussed.
