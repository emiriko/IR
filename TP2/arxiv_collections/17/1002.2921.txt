A nanometer-sized superconducting quantum interference device (nanoSQUID) is
fabricated on the apex of a sharp quartz tip and integrated into a scanning
SQUID microscope. A simple self-aligned fabrication method results in
nanoSQUIDs with diameters down to 100 nm with no lithographic processing. An
aluminum nanoSQUID with an effective area of 0.034 $\mu$m$^2$ displays flux
sensitivity of 1.8$\cdot 10^{-6}$ $\Phi_0/\mathrm{Hz}^{1/2} and operates in
fields as high as 0.6 T. With projected spin sensitivity of 65
$\mu_B/\mathrm{Hz}^{1/2}$ and high bandwidth, the SQUID on a tip is a highly
promising probe for nanoscale magnetic imaging and spectroscopy.
