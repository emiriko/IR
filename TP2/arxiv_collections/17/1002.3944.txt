Hom-Maltsev(-admissible) algebras are defined, and it is shown that
Hom-alternative algebras are Hom-Maltsev-admissible. With a new definition of a
Hom-Jordan algebra, it is shown that Hom-alternative algebras are
Hom-Jordan-admissible. Hom-type generalizations of some well-known identities
in alternative algebras, including the Moufang identities, are obtained.
