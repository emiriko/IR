The environment near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center is
very hostile for star formation. Nevertheless, many young stars (both O and B
stars) are observed close the MBH. The B-stars seems to have an isotropic,
continuous distribution between 0.01 pc and up to a pc. The O (and
Wolf-Rayet;WR) stars, in contrast, seem to be distributed in a coherent disk
like configuration, extending only between ~0.04 pc to ~0.5 pc. Our current
understanding favors an in-situ formation origin for the more massive (O and
WR) stars, in gaseous disk and/or streams from an in-falling gas clump. The
B-stars seem to have a different origin, more likely through a dynamical
capture, following a binary disruption by the MBH. This scenario could also be
able to explain the origin of hypervelocity stars in the Galactic halo. These
and other possible origins of the young stars in the Galactic center are
briefly reviewed and their possible observational signatures and constraints
are detailed.
