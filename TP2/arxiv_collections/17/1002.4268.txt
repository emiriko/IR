We combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and spectroscopy to
determine accurate fundamental parameters of 23 bright solar-type stars, from
spectral type F5 to K2 and luminosity classes III to V. For some stars we can
use direct techniques to determine the mass, radius, luminosity and effective
temperature, and we compare with indirect methods that rely on photometric
calibrations or spectroscopic analyses. We use the asteroseismic information
available in the literature to infer an indirect mass with an accuracy of 4-15
percent. From indirect methods we determine luminosity and radius to 3 percent.
For Teff we find a slight offset of -40+-20 K between the spectroscopic method
and the direct method, meaning the spectroscopic temperatures are too high.
  From the spectroscopic analysis we determine the detailed chemical
composition for 13 elements, including Li, C and O. We find no significant
offset between the spectroscopic surface gravity and the value from combining
asteroseismology with radius estimates. From the spectroscopy we also determine
vsini and we present a new calibration of macro- and microturbulence. From the
comparison between the results from the direct and spectroscopic methods we
claim that we can determine Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] with absolute accuracies of
80 K, 0.08 dex, and 0.07 dex. The indirect methods are important to obtain
reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of relatively faint stars when
interferometry cannot be used. Our study is the first to compare direct and
indirect methods for a large sample of stars, and we conclude that indirect
methods are valid, although slight corrections may be needed.
