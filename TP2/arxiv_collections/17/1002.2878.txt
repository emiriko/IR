High--quality single crystals of the heavy fermion superconductors CeCoIn$_5$
and CeIrIn$_5$ have been studied by means of low--temperature Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy. Methods were established to facilitate \textit{in-situ}
sample cleaving. Spectroscopy in CeCoIn$_5$ reveals a gap which persists to
above $T_c$, possibly evidencing a precursor state to SC. Atomically resolved
topographs show a rearrangement of the atoms at the crystal surface. This
modification at the surface might influence the surface properties as detected
by tunneling spectroscopy.
