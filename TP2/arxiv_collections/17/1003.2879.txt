In this paper, we introduce two new features for the design of
electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): one feature
based on multifractal cumulants, and one feature based on the predictive
complexity of the EEG time series. The multifractal cumulants feature measures
the signal regularity, while the predictive complexity measures the difficulty
to predict the future of the signal based on its past, hence a degree of how
complex it is. We have conducted an evaluation of the performance of these two
novel features on EEG data corresponding to motor-imagery. We also compared
them to the most successful features used in the BCI field, namely the
Band-Power features. We evaluated these three kinds of features and their
combinations on EEG signals from 13 subjects. Results obtained show that our
novel features can lead to BCI designs with improved classification
performance, notably when using and combining the three kinds of feature
(band-power, multifractal cumulants, predictive complexity) together.
