Molecular spin clusters are mesoscopic systems whose structural and physical
features can be tailored at the synthetic level. Besides, their quantum
behavior is directly accessible in laboratory and their magnetic properties can
be rationalized in terms of microscopic spin models. Thus they represent an
ideal playground within solid state systems to test concepts in quantum
mechanics. One intriguing challenge is to control entanglement between
molecular spins. Here we show how this goal can be pursued by discussing
specific examples and referring to recent achievements.
