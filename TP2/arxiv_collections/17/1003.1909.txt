The determination of the energy spectra of small spin systems as for instance
given by magnetic molecules is a demanding numerical problem. In this work we
review numerical approaches to diagonalize the Heisenberg Hamiltonian that
employ symmetries; in particular we focus on the spin-rotational symmetry SU(2)
in combination with point-group symmetries. With these methods one is able to
block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian and thus to treat spin systems of
unprecedented size. In addition it provides a spectroscopic labeling by
irreducible representations that is helpful when interpreting transitions
induced by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) or Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS). It is our aim to provide the
reader with detailed knowledge on how to set up such a diagonalization scheme.
