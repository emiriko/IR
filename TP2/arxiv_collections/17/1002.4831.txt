This piece of research belongs to the field of educational assessment issue
based upon the cognitive multimedia theory. Considering that theory; visual and
auditory material should be presented simultaneously to reinforce the retention
of a mathematical learned topic, a carefully computer-assisted learning (CAL)
module is designed for development of a multimedia tutorial for our suggested
mathematical topic. The designed CAL module is a multimedia tutorial computer
package with visual and/or auditory material. So, via suggested computer
package, Multi-Sensory associative memories and classical conditioning theories
are practically applicable at an educational field (a children classroom). It
is noticed that comparative practical results obtained are interesting for
field application of CAL package with and without associated teacher's voice.
Finally, the presented study highly recommends application of a novel teaching
trend aiming to improve quality of children mathematical learning performance.
