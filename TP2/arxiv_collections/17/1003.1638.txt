We present a novel experimental platform that links topographical and
material changes with the friction and wear behavior of oil-lubricated metal
surfaces. This concept combines state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of
the surface topography on the micro- and nano-scale with the online measurement
of wear. At the same time, it allows for frictional and lateral force
detection. Information on the topography of one of the two surfaces is gathered
in-situ with a 3D holography microscope at a maximum frequency of 15 fps and
higher resolution images are provided at defined time intervals by an atomic
force microscope (AFM). The wear measurement is conducted on-line by means of
radio nuclide technique (RNT). The quantitative measurement of the lateral and
frictional forces is conducted with a custom-built 3D force sensor. The
surfaces can be lubricated with an optically transparent oil or water. The
stability and precision of the setup have been tested in a model experiment.
The results show that the exact same position can be relocated and examined
after each load cycle. Wear and topography measurements were performed with a
radioactive labeled iron pin sliding against an iron plate.
