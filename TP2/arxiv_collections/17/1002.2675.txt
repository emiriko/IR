I discuss Gisin's result showing that sets of quantum-correlated spacelike
events cannot be described by a covariant probability distribution over hidden
variables, and his conclusion that Tumulka's "rGRWf" (relativistic GRW "flash
ontology" model) is an appropriate model to resolve the apparent conflict
between quantum theory and relativity. The contrasts and similarities between
the Transactional Interpretation's (TI) handling of a specific measurement
result and that of GRW approaches are clarified. I argue that TI resolves the
apparent conflict between quantum theory and relativity described by Gisin in a
harmonious manner, without the necessity of modifying the theory.
