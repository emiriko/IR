A generalized version of the nonequilibrium linear Glauber model with $q$
states in $d$ dimensions is introduced and analyzed. The model is fully
symmetric, its dynamics being invariant under all permutations of the $q$
states. Exact expressions for the two-time autocorrelation and response
functions on a $d$-dimensional lattice are obtained. In the stationary regime,
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds, while in the transient the aging is
observed with the fluctuation-dissipation ratio leading to the value predicted
for the linear Glauber model.
