This paper reviews our current understanding of the possible birth
environments of our Solar System. Since most stars form within groups and
clusters, the question becomes one of determining the nature of the birth
aggregate of the Sun. This discussion starts by reviewing Solar System
properties that provide constraints on our environmental history. We then
outline the range of star-forming environments that are available in the
Galaxy, and discuss how they affect star and planet formation. The nature of
the solar birth cluster is constrained by many physical considerations,
including radiation fields provided by the background environment, dynamical
scattering interactions, and by the necessity of producing the short-lived
radioactive nuclear species inferred from meteoritic measurements. Working
scenarios for the solar birth aggregate can be constructed, as discussed
herein, although significant uncertainties remain.
