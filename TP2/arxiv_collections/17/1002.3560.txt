We analyze operational risk in terms of a spin glass model. Several regimes
are investigated, as a functions of the parameters that characterize the
dynamics. The system is found to be robust against variations of these
parameters. We unveil the presence of limit cycles and scrutinize the features
of the asymptotic state.
