In this paper, we study the recent excess of low energy events observed by
the CoGeNT collaboration, and discuss the possibility that these events
originate from the elastic scattering of a light (m_DM ~ 5-10 GeV) dark matter
particle. We find that such a dark matter candidate may also be capable of
generating the annual modulation reported by DAMA, as well as the small excess
recently reported by CDMS, without conflicting with the null results from other
experiments, such as XENON10. A dark matter interpretation of the CoGeNT and
DAMA observations favors a region of parameter space that is especially
attractive within the context of Asymmetric Dark Matter models. In such models,
the cosmological dark matter density arises from the baryon asymmetry of the
universe, naturally leading to the expectation that m_DM ~ 1-10 GeV. We also
discuss neutralino dark matter from extended supersymmetric frameworks, such as
the NMSSM. Lastly, we explore the implications of such a dark matter candidate
for indirect searches, and find that the prospects for detecting the neutrino
and gamma ray annihilation products of such a particle to be very encouraging.
