A deterministic design of an ultrahigh Q, wavelength scale mode volume
photonic crystal nanobeam cavity is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.
Using this approach, cavities with Q>10^6 and on-resonance transmission T>90%
are designed. The devices fabricated in Si and capped with low-index polymer,
have Q=80,000 and T=73%. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest
transmission measured in deterministically designed, wavelength scale high Q
cavities.
