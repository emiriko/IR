A novel use of Majorana geometric representation brings out distinct
entanglement families of permutation symmetric states of qubits. The
paradigmatic W and GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states of three qubits
respectively contain two and three independent Majorana spinors. Another unique
state with three distinct Majorana spinors -- constructed through a permutation
symmetric superposition of two up qubits and one down qubit (W state) and its
obverse state Wbar) exhibits genuine three-party entanglement, which is robust
under loss of a qubit. While the GHZ state has irreducible correlations and
cannot be determined from its parts, we show here that the correlation
information of the W-superposition state is imprinted uniquely in its two party
reduced states. This striking example sheds light on the contrasting
irreducibility features of interconvertible states.
