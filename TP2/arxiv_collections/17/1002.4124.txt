We present a review of recent research on quantum entanglement, with special
emphasis on entanglement between single atoms, processing of an encoded
entanglement and its temporary evolution. Analysis based on the density matrix
formalism are described. We give a simple description of the entangling
procedure and explore the role of the environment in creation of entanglement
and in disentanglement of atomic systems. A particular process we will focus on
is spontaneous emission, usually recognized as an irreversible loss of
information and entanglement encoded in the internal states of the system. We
illustrate some certain circumstances where this irreversible process can in
fact induce entanglement between separated systems. We also show how
spontaneous emission reveals a competition between the Bell states of a two
qubit system that leads to the recently discovered "sudden" features in the
temporal evolution of entanglement. An another problem illustrated in details
is a deterministic preparation of atoms and atomic ensembles in long-lived
stationary squeezed states and entangled cluster states. We then determine how
to trigger the evolution of the stable entanglement and also address the issue
of a steered evolution of entanglement between desired pairs of qubits that can
be achieved simply by varying the parameters of a given system.
