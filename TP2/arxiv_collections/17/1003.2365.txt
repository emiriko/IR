Here we consider the entropy-corrected version of the new agegraphic dark
energy model in the non-flat FRW universe. We derive the exact differential
equation that determines the evolution of the entropy-corrected new agegraphic
dark energy density parameter in the presence of interaction with dark matter.
We also obtain the equation of state and deceleration parameters and present a
necessary condition for the selected model to cross the phantom divide.
Moreover, we reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the phantom scalar
field according to the evolutionary behavior of the interacting
entropy-corrected new agegraphic model.
