In this Comment, using Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent-potential
approximation method in the atomic-sphere approximation (KKR-ASA CPA) to
describe the effects of disorder due to excess Fe in FeTe alloys, we show that
(i) the rigid-band approximation is inadequate to describe the effects of
disorder and its application leads to an incorrect description of the
underlying physics, (ii) the rigid-band energy shift of ~0.76 eV for going from
FeTe to Fe_{1.068}Te (or Fe_{1.063}Te), as obtained by Han and Savrasov (Phys.
Rev. Lett. 103, 067001(2009)), is inconsistent with our FP-LMTO as well as the
KKR-ASA results, and thus the FS of Fe_{1.063}Te shown in Fig. 3(b) of their
paper is not correct.
