Recently, it has been demonstrated that an arbitrary linear quantum
stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of simpler one degree
of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators together with a direct interaction
Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of the oscillators.
However, from an experimental point of view, realizations by pure cascading,
without a direct interaction Hamiltonian, would be much simpler to implement
and this raises the natural question of what class of linear quantum stochastic
systems are realizable by cascading alone. This paper gives a precise
characterization of this class of linear quantum stochastic systems and then it
is proved that, in the weaker sense of transfer function realizability, all
passive linear quantum stochastic systems belong to this class. A constructive
example is given to show the transfer function realization of a two degrees of
freedom passive linear quantum stochastic system by pure cascading.
