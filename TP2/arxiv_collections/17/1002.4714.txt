The Carte Synoptique catalogue of solar filaments from March 1919 to December
1989, corresponding to complete cycles 16 to 21 is utilized to show latitudinal
migration of filaments at low latitudes (less than 50 deg), and the latitudinal
drift of solar filaments in each hemisphere in each cycle of the time interval
is compared with the corresponding drift of sunspot groups. The physical
implication behind the latitudinal drift of filaments is explored.
