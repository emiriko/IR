A Brownian pump of particles in an asymmetric finite tube is investigated in
the presence of an unbiased external force. The pumping system is bounded by
two particle reservoirs. It is found that the particles can be pumped through
the tube from a reservoir at low concentration to one at the same or higher
concentration. There exists an optimized value of temperature (or the amplitude
of the external force) at which the pumping capacity takes its maximum value.
The pumping capacity decreases with increasing the radius at the bottleneck of
the tube.
