We predict the quantum correlations between non-interacting particles
evolving simultaneously in a disordered medium. While the particle density
follows the single-particle dynamics and exhibits Anderson localization, the
two-particle correlation develops unique features that depend on the quantum
statistics of the particles and their initial separation. On short time scales,
the localization of one particle becomes dependent on whether the other
particle is localized or not. On long time scales, the localized particles show
oscillatory correlations within the localization length. These effects can be
observed in Anderson localization of non-classical light and ultra-cold atoms.
