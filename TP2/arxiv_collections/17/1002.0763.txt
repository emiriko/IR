We present a study of the reciprocity of human behaviour based on mobile
phone usage records. The underlying question is whether human relationships are
mutual, in the sense that both are equally active in keeping up the
relationship, or is it on the contrary typical that relationships are lopsided,
with one party being significantly more active than the other. We study this
question with the help of a mobile phone data set consisting of all mobile
phone calls between 5.3 million customers of a single mobile phone operator. It
turns out that lopsided relations are indeed quite common, to the extent that
the variation cannot be explained by simple random deviations or by variations
in personal activity. We also show that there is no non-trivial correlation
between reciprocity and local network density.
