Recently, Verlinde conjectured that gravity may be an entropic force, arising
from thermodynamics on the holographic screen. We investigate the implications
of the entropic force formalism for inflationary cosmology. We find the
background dynamics of inflation can be dually described in the holographic
language. At the perturbation level, two kinds of novel scale invariant scalar
fluctuations arise from thermal fluctuations on the holographic screen. These
fluctuations can be responsible for CMB anisotropy and structure formation.
