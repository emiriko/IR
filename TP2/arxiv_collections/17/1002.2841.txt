We have employed complete micromagnetic simulations to analyze dc current
driven self-oscillations of a vortex core in a spin-valve nanopillar in a
perpendicular field by including the coupled effect of the spin-torque and the
magnetostatic field computed self-consistently for the entire spin-valve. The
vortex in the thicker nanomagnet moves along a quasi-elliptical trajectory that
expands with applied current, resulting in blue-shifting of the frequency,
while the magnetization of the thinner nanomagnet is non-uniform due to the
bias current. The simulations explain the experimental magnetoresistance-field
hysteresis loop and yield good agreement with the measured frequency vs.
current behavior of this spin-torque vortex oscillator.
