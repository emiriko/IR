We present a novel antireflection approach utilizing planar metamaterials on
dielectric surfaces. It consists of a split-ring resonator array and a metal
mesh separated by a thin dielectric spacer. The coating dramatically reduces
the reflectance and greatly enhances the transmittance over a wide range of
incidence angles and a narrow bandwidth. Antireflection is achieved by
tailoring the magnitude and phase shifts of waves reflected and transmitted at
metamaterial boundaries, resulting in a destructive interference in reflection
and constructive interference in transmission. The coating can be very thin and
there is no requirement for the spacer dielectric constant.
