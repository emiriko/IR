A new algorithm to generate all Dyck words is presented, which is used in
ranking and unranking Dyck words. We emphasize the importance of using Dyck
words in encoding objects related to Catalan numbers. As a consequence of
formulas used in the ranking algorithm we can obtain a recursive formula for
the nth Catalan number.
