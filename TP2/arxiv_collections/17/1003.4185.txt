Starting from noncommutative generalization of Minkowski space we consider
quantum deformed relativistic symmetries which lead to the modification of
kinematics of special relativity. The noncommutative field theory framework
described by means of the star product formalism is briefly described. We
briefly present the quantum modifications of Einstein gravity
