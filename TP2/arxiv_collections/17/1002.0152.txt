We tackle the issue of the blind prediction of a Gaussian time series. For
this, we construct a projection operator build by plugging an empirical
covariance estimation into a Schur complement decomposition of the projector.
This operator is then used to compute the predictor. Rates of convergence of
the estimates are given.
