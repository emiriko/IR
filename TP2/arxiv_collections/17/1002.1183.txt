We discuss a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure for the random
sampling of some one-dimensional lattice paths with constraints, for various
constraints. We show that an approach inspired by optimal transport allows us
to bound efficiently the mixing time of the associated Markov chain. The
algorithm is robust and easy to implement, and samples an "almost" uniform path
of length $n$ in $n^{3+\eps}$ steps. This bound makes use of a certain
contraction property of the Markov chain, and is also used to derive a bound
for the running time of Propp-Wilson's CFTP algorithm.
