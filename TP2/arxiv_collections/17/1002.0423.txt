The generic singularities and bifurcations are classified for one-parameter
families of curves with frames in a space form, the Euclidean space, the
elliptic space or the hyperbolic space via projective geometry. Two kinds of
frames are considered, adapted frames and osculating frames, in terms of
certain differential systems on flag manifolds.
