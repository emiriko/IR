We present a study of mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties of two
dimensional (2D), monolayer of silicon carbide (SiC) in honeycomb structure and
its quasi 1D armchair nanoribbons using first-principles plane wave method. In
order to reveal dimensionality effects, a brief study of 3D bulk and 1D atomic
chain of SiC are also included. Calculated bond-lengths, cohesive energies,
charge transfers and band gaps display a clear dimensionality effect. The
stability analysis based on the calculation of phonon frequencies indicates
that 2D SiC monolayer is stable in planar geometry. We found that 2D SiC
monolayer in honeycomb structure and its bare and hydrogen passivated
nanoribbons are ionic, non-magnetic, wide band gap semiconductors. The band gap
is further increased upon self-energy corrections. The mechanical properties
are investigated using the strain energy calculations. The effect of various
vacancy defects, adatoms and substitutional impurities on electronic and
magnetic properties in 2D SiC monolayer and in its armchair nanoribbons are
also investigated. Some of these vacancy defects and impurities, which are
found to influence physical properties and attain magnetic moments, can be used
to functionalize SiC honeycomb structures.
