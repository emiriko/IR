We give a complete answer to the analogue of Grothendieck conjecture on
p-curvatures for q-difference equations defined over K(x), where K is any
finitely generated extension of Q and q\in K can be either a transcendental or
an algebraic number. This generalizes the results in [DV02], proved under the
assumption that K is a number field and q an algebraic number. The results also
hold for a field K which is a finite extension of a purely transcendental
extension k(q) of a perfect field k. In Part 3, we consider two Galois groups
attached to a q-difference module M over K(x): (1) the intrinsic Galois group
Gal(M), in the sense of [Kat82]; (2) if char K=0, the intrinsic differential
Galois group Gal^D(M), which is a Kolchin differential algebraic group. We
deduce an arithmetic description of Gal(M) (resp. Gal^D(M)). In Part 4, we show
that the Galois D-groupoid [Gra09] of a nonlinear q-difference system
generalizes Gal^D(M).
