The electron affinities eA(S) are measured for the two isotopes 32S and 34S
(16752.9753(41) and 16752.9776(85) cm-1, respectively). The isotope shift in
the electron affinity is found to be positive, eA(34S)-eA(32S) = +0.0023(70)
cm-1, but the uncertainty allows for the possibility that it may be either
"normal" (eA(34S) > eA(32S)) or "anomalous" (eA(34S) < eA(32S)). The isotope
shift is estimated theoretically using elaborate correlation models, monitoring
the electron affinity and the mass polarization term expectation value. The
theoretical analysis predicts a very large specific mass shift that
counterbalances the normal mass shift and produces an anomalous isotope shift,
eA(34S)-eA(32S) = - 0.0053(24) cm-1. The observed and theoretical residual
isotope shifts agree with each other within the estimated uncertainties.
