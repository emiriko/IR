We study the possibility to generate a new type of spin-orbit coupling for
the center of mass motion of cold atoms, using laser beams that resonantly
couple N atomic internal ground states to an extra state. After a general
analysis of the scheme, we concentrate on the tetrapod setup (N=4) where the
atomic state can be described by a three-component spinor, evolving under the
action of a Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling for a spin 1 particle. We
illustrate a consequence of this coupling by studying the negative refraction
of atoms at a potential step, and show that the amplitude of the refracted beam
is significantly increased in comparison to the known case of spin 1/2 Rashba
coupling. Finally we explore a possible implementation of this tetrapod setup,
using stimulated Raman couplings between Zeeman sublevels of the ground state
of alkali atoms.
