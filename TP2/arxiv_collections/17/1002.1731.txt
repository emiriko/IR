It is possible to talk about the \'etale homotopy equivalence of rational
points on algebraic varieties by using a relative version of the \'etale
homotopy type. We show that over $p$-adic fields rational points are homotopy
equivalent in this sense if and only if they are \'etale-Brauer equivalent. We
also show that over the real field rational points on projective varieties are
\'etale homotopy equivalent if and only if they are in the same connected
component. We also study this equivalence relation over number fields and prove
that in this case it is finer than the other two equivalence relations for
certain generalised Ch\^atelet surfaces.
