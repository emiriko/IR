The problem of computing an explicit isogeny between two given elliptic
curves over F_q, originally motivated by point counting, has recently awaken
new interest in the cryptology community thanks to the works of Teske and
Rostovstev & Stolbunov.
  While the large characteristic case is well understood, only suboptimal
algorithms are known in small characteristic; they are due to Couveignes,
Lercier, Lercier & Joux and Lercier & Sirvent. In this paper we discuss the
differences between them and run some comparative experiments. We also present
the first complete implementation of Couveignes' second algorithm and present
improvements that make it the algorithm having the best asymptotic complexity
in the degree of the isogeny.
