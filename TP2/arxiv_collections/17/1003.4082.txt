Dynamics of a single stranded DNA, which can form a hairpin have been studied
in the constant force ensemble. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we
obtained the force-temperature diagram, which differs from the theoretical
prediction based on the lattice model. Probability analysis of the extreme
bases of the stem revealed that at high temperature, the hairpin to coil
transition is entropy dominated and the loop contributes significantly in its
opening. However, at low temperature, the transition is force driven and the
hairpin opens from the stem side. It is shown that the elastic energy plays a
crucial role at high force. As a result, the phase diagram differs
significantly with the theoretical prediction.
