We construct irreducible modules for twisted toroidal Lie algebras and
extended affine Lie algebras. This is done by combining the representation
theory of untwisted toroidal algebras with the technique of thin coverings of
modules. We illustrate our method with examples of extended affine Lie algebras
of Clifford type.
