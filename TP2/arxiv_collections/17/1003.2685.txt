We report the effect of La-substitution on the magnetic and magnetotransport
properties of Brownmillerite-like bilayered compounds Ca2.5-xLaxSr0.5GaMn2O8 (x
= 0, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1) by using dc-magnetization, resistivity and
magnetoresistance techniques. The Rietveld analysis of the room temperature
x-ray diffraction patterns confirms no observable change of average crystal
structure with the La-substitution. Both magnetic and magnetotransport
properties are found to be very sensitive to the La-substitution.
Interestingly, the La-substituted compounds show ferromagnetic-like behavior
(due to the occurrence of a double exchange mechanism) whereas, the parent
compound is an antiferromagnet (TN 150 K). All compounds show an insulating
behavior, in the measured temperature range of 100 - 300 K, with an overall
decrease in the resistivity with the substitution. A higher value of
magnetoresistance has been successfully achieved by the La-substitution. We
have proposed an electronic phase separation model, considering the formation
of ferromagnetic clusters in the antiferromagnetic matrix, to interpret the
observed magnetization and magnetotransport results for the La-substituted
samples. The present study demonstrates an approach to achieve new functional
materials, based on naturally occurring layered system like
Ca2.5-xLaxSr0.5GaMn2O8, for possible spintronics applications.
