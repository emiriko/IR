The temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy in (113)A (Ga,Mn)As layers
grown by molecular beam epitaxy is studied by means of superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID) magnetometry as well as by ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) and magnetooptical effects. Experimental results are described
considering cubic and two kinds of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The magnitude
of cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants is found to be proportional to the
fourth and second power of saturation magnetization, respectively. Similarly to
the case of (001) samples, the spin reorientation transition from uniaxial
anisotropy with the easy along the [-1, 1, 0] direction at high temperatures to
the biaxial <100> anisotropy at low temperatures is observed around 25 K. The
determined values of the anisotropy constants have been confirmed by FMR
studies. As evidenced by investigations of the polar magnetooptical Kerr
effect, the particular combination of magnetic anisotropies allows the
out-of-plane component of magnetization to be reversed by an in-plane magnetic
field. Theoretical calculations within the p-d Zener model explain the
magnitude of the out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy constant caused by epitaxial
strain, but do not explain satisfactorily the cubic anisotropy constant. At the
same time the findings point to the presence of an additional uniaxial
anisotropy of unknown origin. Similarly to the case of (001) films, this
additional anisotropy can be explained by assuming the existence of a shear
strain. However, in contrast to the (001) samples, this additional strain has
an out-of-the-(001)-plane character.
