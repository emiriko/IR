Helical magnetic fields are injected into the cosmic medium during
cosmological baryogenesis and can potentially provide a useful probe of the
early universe. We construct a model to study the injection process during a
first order phase transition and to determine the power spectra of the injected
magnetic field. By Monte Carlo simulations we evaluate the Fourier space
symmetric and helical power spectra of the magnetic field at the time the phase
transition completes. The spectra are peaked at the scale given by the inverse
size of bubbles at percolation and with a comparable width. These injected
magnetic fields set the initial conditions for further cosmological
magneto-hydrodynamical evolution.
