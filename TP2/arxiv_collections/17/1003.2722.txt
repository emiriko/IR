In a previous paper we formulated the problem of the formation and evolution
of fragments (or cores) in magnetically-supported, self-gravitating molecular
clouds in axisymmetric geometry, accounting for the effects of ambipolar
diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, grain chemistry and dynamics, and radiative
transfer. Here we present results of star formation simulations that accurately
track the evolution of a protostellar fragment over eleven orders of magnitude
in density (from 300 cm^-3 to \approx 10^14 cm^-3), i.e., from the early
ambipolar-diffusion--initiated fragmentation phase, through the magnetically
supercritical, dynamical-contraction phase and the subsequent magnetic
decoupling stage, to the formation of a protostellar core in near hydrostatic
equilibrium. As found by Fiedler & Mouschovias (1993), gravitationally-driven
ambipolar diffusion leads to the formation and subsequent dynamic contraction
of a magnetically supercritical core. Moreover, we find that ambipolar
diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species
except the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \approx 3 x 10^12
cm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object
and ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic
wall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias
(2005a,b) through a different approach. At approximately the same density at
which Ohmic dissipation becomes more important than ambipolar diffusion
(\gtrsim 7 x 10^12 cm^-3), the grains carry most of the electric charge as well
as the electric current. The prestellar core remains disclike down to radii ~
10 AU, inside which thermal pressure becomes important. The magnetic flux
problem of star formation is resolved for at least strongly magnetic newborn
stars by this stage of the evolution, i.e., by a central density \approx 10^14
cm^-3. The hydrostatic core has radius \approx 2 AU, density \approx 10^14
cm^-3, temperature \approx 300 K, magnetic field strength \approx 0.2 G,
magnetic flux \approx 5 x 10^18 Wb, luminosity ~ 10^-3 L_\odot, and mass ~
10^-2 M_\odot.
