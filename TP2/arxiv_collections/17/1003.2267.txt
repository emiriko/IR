Angle-resolved photoemission measurements were performed on Zn-doped
La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) to investigate the effects of Zn impurities on the low
energy electronic structure. The Zn-impurity-induced increase in the
quasi-particle (QP) width in momentum distribution curves (MDC) is
approximately isotropic on the entire Fermi surface and energy-independent near
the Fermi level (EF). The increase in the MDC width is consistent with the
increase in the residual resistivity due to the Zn impurities if we assume the
carrier number to be 1-x for x=0.17 and the Zn impurity to be a potential
scatterer close to the unitarity limit. For x=0.03, the residual resistivity is
found to be higher than that expected from the MDC width, and the effects of
antifferomagnetic fluctuations induced around the Zn impurities are discussed.
The leading edges of the spectra near (pi,0) for x=0.17 are shifted toward
higher energies relative to EF with Zn substitution, indicating a reduction of
the superconducting gap.
