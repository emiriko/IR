In this paper, we introduce an approach to the protein folding problem from
the point of view of statistical physics. Protein folding is a stochastic
process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D
structure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between
global geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special
problems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of
protein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the
Monte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a
random coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and
other interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account
by imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a
generalized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities
of the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic
properties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW
simulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for
proteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue
number $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\sim N^{\nu}$
in different regions with exponents $\nu =3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the
observed unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively. These
results indicate that CSAW can serve as a theoretical laboratory to study
universal principles in protein folding.
