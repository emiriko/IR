We calculate finite volume effects on the pion masses and decay constant in
twisted mass lattice QCD (tmLQCD) at finite lattice spacing. We show that the
lighter neutral pion in tmLQCD gives rise to finite volume effects that are
exponentially enhanced when compared to those arising from the heavier charged
pions. We demonstrate that the recent two flavour twisted mass lattice data can
be better fitted when twisted mass effects in finite volume corrections are
taken into account.
