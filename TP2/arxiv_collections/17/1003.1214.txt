Many sources listed in the 4th IBIS/ISGRI survey are still unidentified, i.e.
lacking an X-ray counterpart or simply not studied at lower energies (< 10
keV). The cross-correlation between the list of IBIS sources in the 4th
catalogue and the Swift/XRT data archive is of key importance to search for the
X-ray counterparts; in fact, the positional accuracy of few arcseconds obtained
with XRT allows us to perform more efficient and reliable follow-up
observations at other wavelengths (optical, UV, radio). In this work, we
present the results of the XRT observations for four new gamma-ray sources: IGR
J12123-5802, IGR J1248.2-5828, IGR J13107-5626 and IGR J14080-3023. For IGR
J12123-5802 we find a likely counterpart, but further information are needed to
classified this object, IGR J1248.2-5828 is found to be a Seyfert 1.9, for IGR
J13107-5626 we suggest a possible AGN nature, while IGR J14080-3023 is
classified as a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy.
