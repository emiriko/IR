We study a lattice model where the coupling stochastically switches between
repulsive (subtractive) and attractive (additive) at each site with probability
p at every time instance. We observe that such kind of coupling stabilizes the
local fixed point of a circle map, with the resultant globally stable attractor
providing a unique absorbing state. Interestingly, a continuous phase
transition is observed from the absorbing state to spatiotemporal chaos via
spatiotemporal intermittency for a range of values of p. It is interesting to
note that the transition falls in class of directed percolation. Static and
spreading exponents along with relevant scaling laws are found to be obeyed
confirming the directed percolation universality class in spatiotemporal
intermittency regime.
