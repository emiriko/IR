The work is devoted to Computability Logic (CoL) -- the
philosophical/mathematical platform and long-term project for redeveloping
classical logic after replacing truth} by computability in its underlying
semantics (see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html). This article
elaborates some basic complexity theory for the CoL framework. Then it proves
soundness and completeness for the deductive system CL12 with respect to the
semantics of CoL, including the version of the latter based on polynomial time
computability instead of computability-in-principle. CL12 is a sequent calculus
system, where the meaning of a sequent intuitively can be characterized as "the
succedent is algorithmically reducible to the antecedent", and where formulas
are built from predicate letters, function letters, variables, constants,
identity, negation, parallel and choice connectives, and blind and choice
quantifiers. A case is made that CL12 is an adequate logical basis for
constructive applied theories, including complexity-oriented ones.
