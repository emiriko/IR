This article is a review on Berezin-Toeplitz operator and Berezin-Toeplitz
deformation quantization for compact quantizable Kaehler manifolds. The basic
objects, concepts, and results are given. This concerns the correct
semi-classical limit behaviour of the operator quantization, the unique
Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization (star product), covariant and
contravariant Berezin symbols, and Berezin transform. Other related objects and
constructions are also discussed.
