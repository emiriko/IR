In this paper we investigate the theory behind the results in [11]. In [11]
we calculated the magnetic dipole moment of the muon and the electric dipole
moments of the muon, electron and the neutron (in a simple quark model) to
first order in loop corrections in both S$_1$ and S$_1 \backslash \,
\boldsymbol{Z}_2$. In these calculations in [11] we investigated the effect of
fields possibly generated by higher dimensional superconducting cosmic strings
[12] that interact with the charged fields on the manifold. In comparing the
results in [11] with standard model precision tests for the electric and
magnetic dipole moments of the various fermions in the model, we were able to
obtain upper limits on the compactification size as well as an upper limit for
the new $b$ parameter. This new model has several important phenomenological
implications. One of these is a theoretical phenomenon that is a source for
parity violation in QED processes. In this paper we will be presenting the
theory of the model in the compactification $M_4 \, \bigotimes$ S$_1 \backslash
\, \boldsymbol{Z}_2$ (orbifold geometry). The theory predicts nontrivial
couplings of the Higgs and lepton fields to the SU(2) gauge bosons, these
differ from the standard model couplings. The theory also expounds upon the
standard model results for the masses of the charged fields in the model and
has other significant physical implications. The model is rooted in the notion
that very light charged particles traveling next to superconducting cosmic
strings [12] at distances on the order of the compactification size of the
extra dimensional space, could generate currents that intern can create
magnetic fields that interact with the particle fields on the UED manifold.
