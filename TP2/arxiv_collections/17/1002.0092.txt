A Monte Carlo program based on a three dimensional vector approach was
developed to model multiple refractive scattering of X-ray photons in objects
with a fine structure. A particular interest was paid to the investigation of
lung tissue. Alveoli are low contrast and low absorbing structures. Hence, they
are not visible in the conventional radiography which is based on the changes
in the absorption arising from density differences and from variation in the
thickness and composition of the object. Another possibility to image fine
structure objects is to use the phase imaging techniques. As known, the phase
change constant delta at low energies (15-30 keV) is 1000 times larger than the
absorption constant beta. The Diffraction Enhance Imaging (DEI) technique is
one of the recent phase sensitive techniques based on the use of an analyzer
crystal placed between the sample and the detector.
