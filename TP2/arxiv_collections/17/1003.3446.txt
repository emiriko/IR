We present HST/WFC3 grism spectroscopy of the brightest galaxy at z>1.5 in
the GOODS-South WFC3 Early Release Science grism pointing, covering the
wavelength range 0.9-1.7 micron. The spectrum is of remarkable quality and
shows the redshifted Balmer lines Hbeta, Hgamma, and Hdelta in absorption at
z=1.902, correcting previous erroneous redshift measurements from the
rest-frame UV. The average rest-frame equivalent width of the Balmer lines is
8+-1 Angstrom, which can be produced by a post-starburst stellar population
with a luminosity-weighted age of ~0.5 Gyr. The M/L ratio inferred from the
spectrum implies a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 Msun. We determine the morphology
of the galaxy from a deep WFC3 F160W image. Similar to other massive galaxies
at z~2 the galaxy is compact, with an effective radius of 2.1+-0.3 kpc.
Although most of the light is in a compact core, the galaxy has two red, smooth
spiral arms that appear to be tidally-induced. The spatially-resolved
spectroscopy demonstrates that the center of the galaxy is quiescent and the
surrounding disk is forming stars, as it shows Hbeta in emission. The galaxy is
interacting with a companion at a projected distance of 18 kpc, which also
shows prominent tidal features. The companion has a slightly redder spectrum
than the primary galaxy but is a factor of ~10 fainter and may have a lower
metallicity. It is tempting to interpret these observations as "smoking gun"
evidence for the growth of compact, quiescent high redshift galaxies through
minor mergers, which has been proposed by several recent observational and
theoretical studies. Interestingly both objects host luminous AGNs, as
indicated by their X-ray luminosities, which implies that these mergers can be
accompanied by significant black hole growth. This study illustrates the power
of moderate dispersion, low background near-IR spectroscopy at HST resolution,
which is now available with the WFC3 grism.
