A formalism is described that greatly simplifies the derivation of scalar,
electromagnetic, and gravitational self-forces and self-torques acting on
extended bodies in curved spacetimes. Commonly-studied aspects of these effects
are normally dominated by the so-called "regular" component of a body's
self-field. The only consequence of the remaining (much larger) portion of the
self-field turns out to be very simple. It exerts forces and torques that
effectively renormalize all multipole moments of the body's stress-energy
tensor in its laws of motion.
