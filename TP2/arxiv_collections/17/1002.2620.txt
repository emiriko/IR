We study the spectroscopy of atoms dressed by a resonant radiofrequency (RF)
field inside an inhomogeneous magnetic field and confined in the resulting
adiabatic potential. The spectroscopic probe is a second, weak, RF field. The
observed line shape is related to the temperature of the trapped cloud. We
demonstrate evaporative cooling of the RF-dressed atoms by sweeping the
frequency of the second RF field around the Rabi frequency of the dressing
field.
