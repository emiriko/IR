In this note, we show how the classical Hodge index theorem implies the Hodge
index conjecture of Beilinson for height pairing of homologically trivial
codimension two cycles over function field of characteristic 0. Such an index
conjecture has been used in our paper on Gross-Schoen cycles to deduce the
Bogomolov conjecture and a lower bound for Hodge class (or Faltings height)
from some conjectures about metrized graphs which have just been recently
proved by Zubeyir Cinkir.
