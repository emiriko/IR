In this paper we investigate the dispersive properties of the solutions of
the two dimensional water-waves system. First we prove Strichartz type
estimates with loss of derivatives at the same low level of regularity we were
able to construct the solutions in [2]. On the other hand, for smoother initial
data, we prove that the solutions enjoy the optimal Strichartz estimates (i.e,
without loss of regularity compared to the system linearized at (? = 0, ? =
0)).
