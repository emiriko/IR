We formulate minimum-error and unambiguous discrimination problems for
quantum processes in the language of process positive operator valued measures
(PPOVM). In this framework we present the known solution for minimum-error
discrimination of unitary channels. We derive a "fidelity-like" lower bound on
the failure probability of the unambiguous discrimination of arbitrary quantum
processes. This bound is saturated (in a certain range of apriori
probabilities) in the case of unambiguous discrimination of unitary channels.
Surprisingly, the optimal solution for both tasks is based on the optimization
of the same quantity called completely bounded process fidelity.
