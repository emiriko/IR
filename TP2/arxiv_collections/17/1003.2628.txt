Certain migratory birds can sense the earth's magnetic field. The nature of
this process is not yet properly understood. Here we offer a simple explanation
according to which birds literally `see' the local magnetic field: Our model
relates the well-established radical pair hypothesis to the phenomenon of
Haidinger's brush, a capacity to see the polarisation of light. This new
picture explains recent surprising experimental data indicating long lifetimes
for the radical pair. Moreover there is a clear evolutionary path toward this
field sensing mechanism: it is an enhancement of a weak effect that may be
present in many species.
