A three-step laser excitation scheme is used to make absolute frequency
measurements of highly excited nF7/2 Rydberg states in 85Rb for principal
quantum numbers n=33-100. This work demonstrates the first absolute frequency
measurements of rubidium Rydberg levels using a purely optical detection
scheme. The Rydberg states are excited in a heated Rb vapour cell and Doppler
free signals are detected via purely optical means. All of the frequency
measurements are made using a wavemeter which is calibrated against a GPS
disciplined self-referenced optical frequency comb. We find that the measured
levels have a very high frequency stability, and are especially robust to
electric fields. The apparatus has allowed measurements of the states to an
accuracy of 8.0MHz. The new measurements are analysed by extracting the
modified Rydberg-Ritz series parameters.
