We use universality in two-body dipolar physics to study three-body
recombination. We present results for the universal structure of weakly bound
two-dipole states that depend only on the s-wave scattering length ($a$). We
study threshold three-body recombination rates into weakly-bound dimer states
as a function of the scattering length. A Fermi Golden rule analysis is used to
estimate rates for different events mediated by the dipole-dipole interaction
and a phenomenological contact interaction. The three-body recombination rate
in the limit where $a\gg D$ contains terms which scale as $a^{4}$, $a^{2}D^{2}$
and $D^{4}$, where $D$ is the dipolar length. When $a \ll D$, the three-boby
recombination rate scales as $D^4$.
