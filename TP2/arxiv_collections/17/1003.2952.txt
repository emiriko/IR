In the current work considering the wave model of the crystal growth control,
an influence of heterogeneity of the medium on the forming martensite crystal s
profile was examined. The considering of the heterogeneity is provided with the
help of putting into operations the space-depending effective attenuation of
the waves. The description of the heterogeneity was fulfilled in three
different ways: exponential, quadratic and inverse-quadratic. It was shown,
that dependently of the heterogeneity of the medium various martensite crystal
s profile can be implemented, considering the shape of its butts as well. In
particular the plate-like and the wedge-like of the crystal shapes are
feasible.
