A shifted or misaligned feedback loop gives rise to a two-point nonlocality
that is the spatial analog of a temporal delay. Important consequences of this
nonlocal coupling have been found both in diffusive and in diffractive systems,
and include convective instabilities, independent tuning of phase and group
velocities, as well as amplification, chirping and even splitting of localized
perturbations. Analytical predictions about these nonlocal systems as well as
their spatio-temporal dynamics are discussed in one and two transverse
dimensions and in presence of noise.
