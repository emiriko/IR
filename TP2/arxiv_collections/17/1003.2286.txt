We report on the phase-locking of two diode lasers based on self-seeded
tapered amplifiers. In these lasers, a reduction of linewidth is achieved using
narrow-band high-transmission interference filters for frequency selection. The
lasers combine a compact design with a Lorentzian linewidth below 200 kHz at an
output power of 300 mW. We characterize the phase noise of the phase-locked
laser system and study its potential for coherent beam-splitting in atom
interferometers.
