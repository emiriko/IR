The Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm with the Finite Element method applied
to compute electrostatic interaction energy between charge densities is
described in this work. By using the Finite Element method to integrate
numerically the Poisson's equation, it is shown that the computing time to
obtain the acceptance probability of an elementary trial move does not, in
principle, depend on the number of charged particles present in the system.
