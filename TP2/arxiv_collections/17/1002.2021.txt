We introduce a numerical method for solving Grad's moment equations or
regularized moment equations for arbitrary order of moments. In our algorithm,
we do not need explicitly the moment equations. As an instead, we directly
start from the Boltzmann equation and perform Grad's moment method \cite{Grad}
and the regularization technique \cite{Struchtrup2003} numerically. We define a
conservative projection operator and propose a fast implementation which makes
it convenient to add up two distributions and provides more efficient flux
calculations compared with the classic method using explicit expressions of
flux functions. For the collision term, the BGK model is adopted so that the
production step can be done trivially based on the Hermite expansion. Extensive
numerical examples for one- and two-dimensional problems are presented.
Convergence in moments can be validated by the numerical results for different
number of moments.
