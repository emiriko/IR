The ability to reliably measure the energy of an excited hadron in Lattice
QCD simulations hinges on the accurate determination of all lower-lying
energies in the same symmetry channel. These include not only single-particle
energies, but also the energies of multi-hadron states. This talk deals with
the determination of multi-hadron energies in Lattice QCD. The
group-theoretical derivation of lattice interpolating operators that couple
optimally to multi-hadron states is described. We briefly discuss recent
algorithmic developments which allow for the efficient implementation of these
operators in software, and present numerical results from the Hadron Spectrum
Collaboration.
