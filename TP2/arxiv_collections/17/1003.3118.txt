Several perturbative computations of finite-size effects, performed on the
gauge side of the AdS/CFT correspondence by means of superspace techniques, are
presented. First, wrapping effects are analyzed in the standard N = 4 theory,
by means of the calculation of the four-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi
operator. Then, a similar computation at five loops is described. Afterwards,
finite-size effects are studied in the beta-deformed case, where thanks to the
reduced number of supersymmetries the simpler class of single-impurity
operators can be considered, so that the leading corrections to the anomalous
dimensions at generic order can be reduced to the computation of a class of
integrals. Explicit results are given up to eleven loops. A further chapter is
dedicated to the computation of the leading finite-size effects on operators
dual to open strings. In the end, some comments are made and proposals for
future developments are discussed.
