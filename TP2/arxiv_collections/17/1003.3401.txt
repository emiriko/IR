We consider the three-body decays of gravitino dark matter in supersymmetric
scenarios with bilinear R-parity violation. In particular, gravitino decays
into lepton+W^* (lepton f\bar f') and \nu+Z^* (\nu f\bar f) are examined for
gravitino masses below Mw. After computing the gravitino decay rates into these
three-body final states and studying their dependence on supersymmetric
parameters, we find that these new decay modes are often more important than
the two-body decay, into a photon and a neutrino, considered in previous works.
Consequently, the gravitino lifetime and its branching ratios are substantially
modified, with important implications for the indirect detection of gravitino
dark matter.
