The 30 and 44 GHz Back End Modules (BEM) for the Planck Low Frequency
Instrument are broadband receivers (20% relative bandwidth) working at room
temperature. The signals coming from the Front End Module are amplified, band
pass filtered and finally converted to DC by a detector diode. Each receiver
has two identical branches following the differential scheme of the Planck
radiometers. The BEM design is based on MMIC Low Noise Amplifiers using GaAs
P-HEMT devices, microstrip filters and Schottky diode detectors. Their
manufacturing development has included elegant breadboard prototypes and
finally qualification and flight model units. Electrical, mechanical and
environmental tests were carried out for the characterization and verification
of the manufactured BEMs. A description of the 30 and 44 GHz Back End Modules
of Planck-LFI radiometers is given, with details of the tests done to determine
their electrical and environmental performances. The electrical performances of
the 30 and 44 GHz Back End Modules: frequency response, effective bandwidth,
equivalent noise temperature, 1/f noise and linearity are presented.
