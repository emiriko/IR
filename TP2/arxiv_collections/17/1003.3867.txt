We report Bose-Einstein condensation of $^{88}$Sr, which has a small,
negative s-wave scattering length ($a_{88}=-2$\,$a_0$). We overcome the poor
evaporative cooling characteristics of this isotope by sympathetic cooling with
$^{87}$Sr atoms. $^{87}$Sr is effective in this role in spite of the fact that
it is a fermion because of the large ground state degeneracy arising from a
nuclear spin of $I=9/2$, which reduces the impact of Pauli blocking of
collisions. We observe a limited number of atoms in the condensate
($N_{max}\approx 10^4$) that is consistent with the value of $a_{88}$ and the
optical dipole trap parameters.
