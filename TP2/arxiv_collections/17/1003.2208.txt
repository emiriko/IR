We present adaptive optics (AO) near-infrared observations of the core of the
Tr 14 cluster in the Carina region obtained with the ESO multi-conjugate AO
demonstrator, MAD. Our campaign yields AO-corrected observations with an image
quality of about 0.2 arcsec across the 2 arcmin field of view, which is the
widest AO mosaic ever obtained. We detected almost 2000 sources spanning a
dynamic range of 10 mag. The pre-main sequence (PMS) locus in the
colour-magnitude diagram is well reproduced by Palla & Stahler isochrones with
an age of 3 to 5 1E+05 yr, confirming the very young age of the cluster. We
derive a very high (deprojected) central density n0~4.5(+/-0.5) \times 10^4
pc^-3 and estimate the total mass of the cluster to be about ~4.3^{+3.3}_{-1.5}
\times 10^3 Msun, although contamination of the field of view might have a
significant impact on the derived mass. We show that the pairing process is
largely dominated by chance alignment so that physical pairs are difficult to
disentangle from spurious ones based on our single epoch observation. Yet, we
identify 150 likely bound pairs, 30% of these with a separation smaller than
0.5 arcsec (~1300AU). We further show that at the 2-sigma level massive stars
have more companions than lower-mass stars and that those companions are
respectively brighter on average, thus more massive. Finally, we find some
hints of mass segregation for stars heavier than about 10 Msun. If confirmed,
the observed degree of mass segregation could be explained by dynamical
evolution, despite the young age of the cluster.
