This report presents properties of the Discrete Pulse Transform on
multi-dimensional arrays introduced by the authors two or so years ago. The
main result given here in Lemma 2.1 is also formulated in a paper to appear in
IEEE Transactions on Image Processing. However, the proof, being too technical,
was omitted there and hence it appears in full in this publication.
