We investigate the dynamics of a driven system of dissipative hard spheres in
the framework of mode-coupling theory. The dissipation is modeled by normal
restitution, and driving is applied to individual particles in the bulk. In
such a system, a glass transition is predicted for a finite transition density.
For increasing inelasticity, the transition shifts to higher densities. Despite
the strong driving at high dissipation, the transition persists up to the limit
of totally inelastic normal restitution.
