The bar formation is still an open problem in modern astrophysics. In this
paper we present numerical simulation performed with the aim of analyzing the
growth of the bar instability inside stellar-gaseous disks, where the star
formation is triggered, and a central black hole is present. The aim of this
paper is to point out the impact of such a central massive black hole on the
growth of the bar. We use N-body-SPH simulations of the same isolated
disk-to-halo mass systems harboring black holes with different initial masses
and different energy feedback on the surrounding gas. We compare the results of
these simulations with the one of the same disk without black hole in its
center. We make the same comparison (disk with and without black hole) for a
stellar disk in a fully cosmological scenario. A stellar bar, lasting 10 Gyrs,
is present in all our simulations. The central black hole mass has in general a
mild effect on the ellipticity of the bar but it is never able to destroy it.
The black holes grow in different way according their initial mass and their
feedback efficiency, the final values of the velocity dispersions and of the
black hole masses are near to the phenomenological constraints.
