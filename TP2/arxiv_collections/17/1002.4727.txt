CDMA is a multiple access method in which the user's uses spread spectrum
techniques and occupy the entire spectrum whenever they transmit. In wireless
communication signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the very important parameter that
influences the system performance. Any mode of mobile transmission is not free
from channel impairment such as noise, interference and fading. This channel
impairment caused signal distortion and degradation in SNR.Also there are
differences between uplink (forward channel) and downlink (reverse
channel).Along with these differences, both the links use different codes for
chanellizing the individual users. This paper simulates the expressions for the
pdfs of the SNR for both uplink and downlink transmission assuming that the
system is operating at an average signal-to-noise ratio is 6dB per information
bit.
