Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs, are a type of low
temperature detector that exhibit intrinsic frequency domain multiplexing at
microwave frequencies. We present the first theory and measurements on a MKID
based on a microstrip transmission line resonator. A complete characterization
of the dielectric loss and noise properties of these resonators is performed,
and agrees well with the derived theory. A competitive noise equivalent power
of 5$\times10^{-17}$ W Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 1 Hz has been demonstrated. The
resonators exhibit the highest quality factors known in a microstrip resonator
with a deposited thin film dielectric.
