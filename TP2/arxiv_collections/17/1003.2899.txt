Proposed by Maxwell in 1879 detector of aether seems, at a superficial
glance, a simple device. For example, Michelson in 1881 thought that he built
an instrument that (when you turn it in the horizontal plane) will measure in
vacuum (refractive index n=1) the harmonic shift of the interference fringe. In
reality the case is much more involved. Not at once it was understood (the
misunderstanding lasted about 90 years) that the shift of interference fringe
occurs only when the carriers of light contain particles, i.e. have n>1. In
1968-1975 I have demonstrated experimentally that during the pumping of the gas
from the zones where the light propagates, i.e. with decreasing the number of
particles of the light's carrier, along with the reduction of noise
disturbances always necessarily vanishes the harmonic shift of the interference
fringe. As soon as the correlation of the observability of the fringe shift
with the concentration of particles in the light's carrier has been taken into
account, I was able to reliably measure the speed of absolute motion of the
Earth as a few hundred km/s. In the sixth version I corrected the slip in
formula (21). There is suggested for experimenters the advice how to diminish
below the measurable level of the sought-for signal the harmful influence of
the noise and false interferences, and for interpreters of measurements of
non-zero fringe shift the derivation is given of a relativistically invariant
formula of the aether wind speed that agrees with the experiments in optical
media with 1<n<1.8. In the publication Phys.Lett.A 374 (2010) 1110 I reported
about measuring the horizontal projection of absolute velocity of the Earth at
the latitude of Obninsk as 140-480 km/s depending on the time of day and night.
This experimental result became possible only owing to that I was able to
overcome the above mentioned methodical and interpretational artifacts.
