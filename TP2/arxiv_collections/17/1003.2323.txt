We have combined the thermo-chemical disc code ProDiMo with the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code MCFOST to calculate a grid of ~300000 circumstellar
disc models, systematically varying 11 stellar, disc and dust parameters
including the total disc mass, several disc shape parameters and the
dust-to-gas ratio. For each model, dust continuum and line radiative transfer
calculations are carried out for 29 far IR, sub-mm and mm lines of [OI], [CII],
12CO and o/p-H2O under 5 inclinations. The grid allows to study the influence
of the input parameters on the observables, to make statistical predictions for
different types of circumstellar discs, and to find systematic trends and
correlations between the parameters, the continuum fluxes, and the line fluxes.
The model grid, comprising the calculated disc temperatures and chemical
structures, the computed SEDs, line fluxes and profiles, will be used in
particular for the data interpretation of the Herschel open time key programme
GASPS. The calculated line fluxes show a strong dependence on the assumed UV
excess of the central star, and on the disc flaring. The fraction of models
predicting [OI] and [CII] fine-structure lines fluxes above Herschel/PACS and
Spica/SAFARI detection limits are calculated as function of disc mass. The
possibility of deriving the disc gas mass from line observations is discussed.
