The feasibility of a European next-generation very massive neutrino
observatory in seven potential candidate sites located at distances from CERN
ranging from 130 km to 2300 km, is being considered within the LAGUNA design
study. The study is providing a coordinated technical design and assessment of
the underground research infrastructure in the various sites, and its coherent
cost estimation. It aims at a prioritization of the sites within summer 2010
and a start of operation around 2020. In addition to a rich non-accelerator
based physics programme including the GUT-scale with proton decay searches, the
detection of a next-generation neutrino superbeam tuned to measure the
flavor-conversion oscillatory pattern (i.e. 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima)
would allow to complete our understanding of the leptonic mixing matrix, in
particular by determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and by studying
CP-violation in the leptonic sector, thereby addressing the outstanding puzzle
of the origin of the excess of matter over antimatter created in the very early
stages of evolution of the Universe. We focus on a multi-MW-power neutrino
superbeam (="hyperbeam") produced by high-intensity primary protons of energy
30$\div$50 GeV. We argue that this option is an effective way to establish long
baseline neutrino physics in Europe with the high-stake prospects of measuring
$\theta_{13}$ and addressing CP-violation in the leptonic sector.
