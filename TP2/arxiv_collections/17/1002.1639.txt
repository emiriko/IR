SrFe2As2 is the end-member for a series of iron-pnictide superconductors and
has a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition near 200 K. Previous
macroscopic measurements to determine the nature of the transition gave
seemingly inconsistent results so we use electron microscopy to monitor the
local order parameter showing that the transformation is first order and that
the orthorhombic phase grows as needle domains. This suggests the transition
occurs via the passage of transformation dislocations, explaining the apparent
inconsistencies. This mechanism may be common to similar transitions.
