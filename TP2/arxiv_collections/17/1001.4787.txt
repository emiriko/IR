  Planck's Low Frequency Instrument is an array of 22 pseudo-correlation
radiometers at 30, 44, and 70 GHz. Before integrating the overall array
assembly, a first set of tests has been performed for each radiometer chain
assembly (RCA), consisting of two radiometers. In this paper, we describe
Rachel, a software application which has been purposely developed and used
during the RCA test campaign to carry out both near-realtime on-line data
analysis and data storage (in FITS format) of the raw output from the
radiometric chains.
