We provide a minimal continuum model for mesoscale plasticity, explaining the
cellular dislocation structures observed in deformed crystals. Our dislocation
density tensor evolves from random, smooth initial conditions to form
self-similar structures strikingly similar to those seen experimentally -
reproducing both the fractal morphologies and some features of the scaling of
cell sizes and misorientations analyzed experimentally. Our model provides a
framework for understanding emergent dislocation structures on the mesoscale, a
bridge across a computationally demanding mesoscale gap in the multiscale
modeling program, and a new example of self-similar structure formation in
non-equilibrium systems.
