We previously attempted to ascertain why the Li I 6708 line-strengths of
Sun-like stars differ so significantly despite the superficial similarities of
stellar parameters. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of 118 solar
analogs and reported that a close connection exists between the Li abundance
A_Li and the line-broadening width (v_r+m; mainly contributed by rotational
effect), which led us to conclude that stellar rotation may be the primary
control of the surface Li content. To examine our claim in more detail, we
study whether the degree of stellar activity exhibits a similar correlation
with the Li abundance, which is expected because of the widely believed close
connection between rotation and activity. We measured the residual flux at the
line center of the strong Ca II 8542 line, r_0(8542), known to be a useful
index of stellar activity, for all sample stars using newly acquired spectra in
this near-IR region. The projected rotational velocity (v_e sin i) was
estimated by subtracting the macroturbulence contribution from v_r+m that we
had already established. A remarkable (positive) correlation was found in the
A_Li versus (vs.) r_0(8542) diagram as well as in both the r_0(8542) vs. v_e
sin i and A_Li vs. v_e sin i diagrams, as had been expected. With the
confirmation of rotation-dependent stellar activity, this clearly shows that
the surface Li abundances of these solar analogs progressively decrease as the
rotation rate decreases. Given this observational evidence, we conclude that
the depletion of surface Li in solar-type stars, probably caused by effective
envelope mixing, operates more efficiently as stellar rotation decelerates. It
may be promising to attribute the low-Li tendency of planet-host G dwarfs to
their different nature in the stellar angular momentum.
