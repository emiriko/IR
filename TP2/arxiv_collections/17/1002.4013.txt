In this paper we propose a semiring-theoretic approach to MV-algebras based
on the connection between such algebras and idempotent semirings - such an
approach naturally imposing the introduction and study of a suitable
corresponding class of semimodules, called MV-semimodules.
  We present several results addressed toward a semiring theory for
MV-algebras. In particular we show a representation of MV-algebras as a
subsemiring of the endomorphism semiring of a semilattice, the construction of
the Grothendieck group of a semiring and its functorial nature, and the effect
of Mundici categorical equivalence between MV-algebras and lattice-ordered
Abelian groups with a distinguished strong order unit upon the relationship
between MV-semimodules and semimodules over idempotent semifields.
