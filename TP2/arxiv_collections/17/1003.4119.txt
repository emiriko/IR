Cosmology provides a unique and very powerful laboratory for testing neutrino
physics. Here, I review the current status of cosmological neutrino
measurements. Future prospects are also discussed, with particular emphasis on
the interplay with experimental neutrino physics. Finally I discuss the
possibility of a direct detection of the cosmic neutrino background and its
associated anisotropy.
