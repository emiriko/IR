When a rotating neutron star loses angular momentum, the reduction in the
centrifugal force makes it contract. This perturbs each fluid element, raising
the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium that
enhance the neutrino emissivity and produce thermal energy. This mechanism is
named rotochemical heating and has previously been studied for neutron stars of
non-superfluid matter, finding that they reach a quasi-steady state in which
the rate that the spin-down modifies the equilibrium concentrations is the same
to that of the neutrino reactions restoring the equilibrium. On the other hand,
the neutron star interior is believed to contain superfluid nucleons, which
affect the thermal evolution of the star by suppressing the neutrino reactions
and the specific heat, and opening new Cooper pairing reactions.
  In this work we describe the thermal effects of Cooper pairing with spatially
uniform energy gaps of neutrons and protons on rotochemical heating in
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) when only modified Urca reactions are allowed. We
find that the chemical imbalances grow up to a value close to the energy gaps,
which is higher than the one of the nonsuperfluid case. Therefore, the surface
temperatures predicted with Cooper pairing are higher and explain the recent
measurement of MSP J0437-4715.
