Using the results recently obtained for computing integrals over
(non-minimal) pure spinor superspace, we compute the coefficient of the
massless two-loop four-point amplitude from first principles. Contrasting with
the mathematical difficulties in the RNS formalism where unknown normalizations
of chiral determinant formulae force the two-loop coefficient to be determined
only indirectly through factorization, the computation in the pure spinor
formalism can be smoothly carried out.
