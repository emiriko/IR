We introduce a toy model implementing the proposal of using a custodial
symmetry to protect the Z b_L bbar_L coupling from large corrections. This
"doublet-extended standard model" adds a weak doublet of fermions (including a
heavy partner of the top quark) to the particle content of the standard model
in order to implement an O(4) x U(1)_X = SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x P_LR x U(1)_X
symmetry in the top-quark mass generating sector. This symmetry is softly
broken to the gauged SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y electroweak symmetry by a Dirac mass M
for the new doublet; adjusting the value of M allows us to explore the range of
possibilities between the O(4)-symmetric (M to 0) and standard-model-like (M to
infinity) limits.
