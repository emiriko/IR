Cells must continuously sense and respond to time-varying environmental
stimuli. These signals are transmitted and processed by biochemical signalling
networks. However, the biochemical reactions making up these networks are
intrinsically noisy, which limits the reliability of intracellular signalling.
Here we use information theory to characterise the reliability of transmission
of time-varying signals through elementary biochemical reactions in the
presence of noise. We calculate the mutual information for both instantaneous
measurements and trajectories of biochemical systems for a Gaussian model. Our
results indicate that the same network can have radically different
characteristics for the transmission of instantaneous signals and trajectories.
For trajectories, the ability of a network to respond to changes in the input
signal is determined by the timing of reaction events, and is independent of
the correlation time of the output of the network. We also study how reliably
signals on different time-scales can be transmitted by considering the
frequency-dependent coherence and gain-to-noise ratio. We find that a detector
that does not consume the ligand molecule upon detection can more reliably
transmit slowly varying signals, while an absorbing detector can more reliably
transmit rapidly varying signals. Furthermore, we find that while one reaction
may more reliably transmit information than another when considered in
isolation, when placed within a signalling cascade the relative performance of
the two reactions can be reversed. This means that optimising signal
transmission at a single level of a signalling cascade can reduce signalling
performance for the cascade as a whole.
