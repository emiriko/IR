We study continuous-time quantum walks mimicking the quantum search based on
Grover's procedure. This allows us to consider structures, that is, databases,
with arbitrary topological arrangements of their entries. We show that the
topological structure of the database plays a crucial role by analyzing, both
analytically and numerically, the transition from the ground to the first
excited state of the Hamiltonian associated with different (fractal)
structures. Additionally, we use the probability of successfully finding a
specific target as another indicator of the importance of the topological
structure.
