The light reflectance and absorbance are calculated for a quantum well (QW)
the width of which is comparable with the light wave length. The difference of
the refraction coefficients of the quantum well and barriers is taken into
account. The stimulating pulse form is arbitrary. An existence of two closely
situated discrete excitation energy levels is supposed. Such energy level pare
may correspond to two magnetopolaron states in a quantizing magnetic field
perpendicular to the QW plane. The relationship of the radiative and
non-radiative damping is arbitrary. The final results does not use the
approximation of the weak Coulomb interaction of electrons and holes.
