Measurements of inclusive charged-hadron transverse-momentum and
pseudorapidity distributions are presented for proton-proton collisions at
sqrt(s) = 0.9 and 2.36 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector
during the LHC commissioning in December 2009. For non-single-diffractive
interactions, the average charged-hadron transverse momentum is measured to be
0.46 +/- 0.01 (stat.) +/- 0.01 (syst.) GeV/c at 0.9 TeV and 0.50 +/- 0.01
(stat.) +/- 0.01 (syst.) GeV/c at 2.36 TeV, for pseudorapidities between -2.4
and +2.4. At these energies, the measured pseudorapidity densities in the
central region, dN(charged)/d(eta) for |eta| < 0.5, are 3.48 +/- 0.02 (stat.)
+/- 0.13 (syst.) and 4.47 +/- 0.04 (stat.) +/- 0.16 (syst.), respectively. The
results at 0.9 TeV are in agreement with previous measurements and confirm the
expectation of near equal hadron production in p-pbar and pp collisions. The
results at 2.36 TeV represent the highest-energy measurements at a particle
collider to date.
