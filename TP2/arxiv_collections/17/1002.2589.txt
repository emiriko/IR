In principle, the Luttinger-Ward Green's function formalism allows one to
compute simultaneously the total energy and the quasiparticle band structure of
a many-body electronic system from first principles. We present approximate and
exact expressions for the correlation energy within the GW-RPA approximation
that are more amenable to computation and allow for developing efficient
approximations to the self-energy operator and correlation energy. The exact
form is a sum over differences between plasmon and interband energies. The
approximate forms are based on summing over screened interband transitions. We
also demonstrate that blind extremization of such functionals leads to
unphysical results: imposing physical constraints on the allowed solutions
(Green's functions) is necessary. Finally, we present some relevant numerical
results for atomic systems.
