We develop the theory of Abelian functions associated with cyclic trigonal
curves by considering two new cases. We investigate curves of genus six and
seven and consider whether it is the trigonal nature or the genus which
dictates certain areas of the theory. We present solutions to the Jacobi
inversion problem, sets of relations between the Abelian function, links to the
Boussinesq equation and a new addition formula.
