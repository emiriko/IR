We consider the problem of the soliton propagation, in a slowly varying
medium, for a generalized, variable-coefficients nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. We prove existence and uniqueness of new soliton-like solutions for a
large class of slowly varying media. Moreover, we describe for all time the
behavior of this new generalized soliton solution.
