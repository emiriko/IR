We consider the interference of two photons with different colors in the
context of a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment, in which single photons enter each of
the input ports of a beam splitter, and exit in the same, albeit undetermined,
output port. Such interference is possible if one uses an active
(energy-non-conserving) beam splitter. We find scenarios in which one "red" and
one "blue" photon enter the beam splitter, and either two red or two blue
photons exit, but never one of each color. We show how the precise form of the
active beam-splitter transformation determines in what way the spectral degrees
of freedom of the input photons should be related to each other for perfect
destructive interference of the different-color components in the output. We
discuss two examples of active beam splitters: one is a gedanken experiment
involving a moving mirror and the other is a more realistic example involving
four-wave mixing in an optical fiber.
