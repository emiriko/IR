This paper deals with the parallel raytracing part of virtual-reality system
PROLAND, developed at the home institution of authors. It describes an actual
implementation of the raytracing part and introduces a Coloured Petri Nets
model of the implementation. The model is used for an evaluation of the
implementation by means of simulation-based performance analysis and also forms
the basis for future improvements of its parallelization strategy.
