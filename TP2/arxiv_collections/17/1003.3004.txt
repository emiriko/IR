We study the collection of group structures that can be realized as a group
of rational points on an elliptic curve over a finite field (such groups are
well known to be of rank at most two). We also study various subsets of this
collection which correspond to curves over prime fields or to curves with a
prescribed torsion. Some of our results are rigorous and are based on recent
advances in analytic number theory, some are conditional under certain widely
believed conjectures, and others are purely heuristic in nature.
