The number of malware variants is growing tremendously and the study of
malware attacks on the Internet is still a demanding research domain. In this
research, various logs from different OSI layer are explore to identify the
traces leave on the attacker and victim logs, and the attack worm trace pattern
are establish in order to reveal true attacker or victim. For the purpose of
this paper, it will only concentrate on cybercrime that caused by malware
network intrusion and used the traditional worm namely blaster worm variants.
This research creates the concept of trace pattern by fusing the attackers and
victims perspective. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose on
attackers, victims and multistep, attacker or victim, trace patterns by
combining both perspectives. These three proposed worm trace patterns can be
extended into research areas in alert correlation and computer forensic
investigation.
