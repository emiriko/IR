VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) are highly mobile wireless ad hoc networks
and will play an important role in public safety communications and commercial
applications. Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly
changing topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Conventional routing
protocols in MANETs (Mobile Ad hoc Networks) are unable to fully address the
unique characteristics in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose EBGR
(Edge Node Based Greedy Routing), a reliable greedy position based routing
approach to forward packets to the node present in the edge of the transmission
range of source/forwarding node as most suitable next hop, with consideration
of nodes moving in the direction of the destination. We propose Revival
Mobility model (RMM) to evaluate the performance of our routing technique. This
paper presents a detailed description of our approach and simulation results
show that packet delivery ratio is improved considerably compared to other
routing techniques of VANET.
