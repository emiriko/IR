This paper describes a new algorithm for hyperspectral image unmixing. Most
of the unmixing algorithms proposed in the literature do not take into account
the possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian
model is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is
assumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical
properties of the abundance coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field
is then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any
class. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the
classical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy
is investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the
posterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow
ones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the
abundances for each pixel, the means and variances of the abundances for each
class, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in
the image. To overcome the complexity of the posterior distribution of
interest, we consider Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that generate samples
distributed according to the posterior of interest. The generated samples are
then used for parameter and hyperparameter estimation. The accuracy of the
proposed algorithms is illustrated on synthetic and real data.
