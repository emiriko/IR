The exciton-exciton effective scattering which rules the time evolution of
two excitons is studied as a function of initial momentum difference,
scattering angle and electron-to-hole mass ratio. We show that this effective
scattering can collapse for energy-conserving configurations provided that the
difference between the two initial exciton momenta is larger than a threshold
value. Sizeable scatterings then exist in the forward direction only. We even
find that, for an electron-to-hole mass ratio close to 1/2, the exciton-exciton
effective scattering stays close to zero in all directions when the difference
between the initial exciton momenta has a very specific value. This unexpected
but quite remarkable collapse comes from tricky compensation between direct and
exchange Coulomb processes which originates from the fundamental
undistinguishability of the exciton fermionic components.
