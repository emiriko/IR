In the abstract pseudodifferential setup of Connes and Moscovici, we prove a
general formula for the discrepancies of zeta-regularised traces associated
with certain spectral triples, and we introduce a canonical trace on operators,
whose order lies outside (minus) the dimension spectrum of the spectral triple.
