In this article we generalize the classical Sobolev's and Sobolev's trace
inequalities on the Grand Lebesgue Spaces instead the classical Lebesgue
Spaces. We will distinguish the classical Sobolev's inequality and the
so-called trace Sobolev's inequality. We consider for simplicity only the case
of whole space.
