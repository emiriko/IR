In a recent article R. T. Cahill claims that the cosmological model based on
his "new physics of a dynamical 3-space" resolves the CMB-BBN Lithium-7 and
Helium-4 abundance anomalies. In this note it is shown that this conclusion is
wrong, resulting from a misunderstanding. In fact, primordial nucleosynthesis
in this non-standard cosmological model exacerbates the LIthium-7 problem and
creates new problems for primordial Helium-4 and Deuterium.
