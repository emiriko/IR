We present a first temperature dependence and kinetic isotope effect study on
the reaction of C_2(a^3Pi_u) with methanol. The bimolecular rate constants for
a series of methanol isotopomers have been measured as a function of
temperature between 293 and 673 K. The observed positive temperature
dependences as well as deuterium kinetic isotope effects permit determination
of the reaction mechanism as a site-specific hydrogen abstraction from the
methyl site rather than from the hydroxyl site.
