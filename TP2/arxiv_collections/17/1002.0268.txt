We present a novel study of the time evolutions of entangled states of three
spin-1/2 particles in the presence of a constant external magnetic field, which
causes the individual spins to precess and leads to remarkable periodicities in
the correlations and density matrices. The emerging patterns of periodicity are
studied explicitly for different entangled states and in detail for a
particular initial configuration of the velocities. Contributions to precession
of anomalous magnetic moments are analysed and general results are also
obtained. We then introduce an electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field,
linking to the preceding case via a suitable Lorentz transformation, and obtain
the corresponding Wigner rotations of the spin states. Finally, we point out
for the first time that the entangled states corresponding to well-known ones
in the study of 3-particle entanglements, may be classified systematically
using a particular coupling of three angular momenta.
