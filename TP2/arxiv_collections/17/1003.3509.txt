We will see that key concepts of number theory can be defined for arbitrary
operations. We give a generalized distributivity for hyperoperations (usual
arithmetic operations and operations going beyond exponentiation) and a
generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for hyperoperations. We
also give a generalized definition of the prime numbers that are associated to
an arbitrary n-ary operation and take a few steps toward the development of its
modulo arithmetic by investigating a generalized form of Fermat's little
theorem. Those constructions give an interesting way to interpret diophantine
equations and we will see that the uniqueness of factorization under an
arbitrary operation can be linked with the Riemann zeta function. This language
of generalized primes and composites can be used to restate and extend certain
problems such as the Goldbach conjecture.
