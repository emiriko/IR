A generalized continuity equation extending the ordinary continuity equation
has been found using quanternions. It is shown to be compatible with Dirac,
Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon and diffusion equations. This generalized equation is
Lorentz invariant. The transport properties of electrons are found to be
governed by Schrodinger-like equation and not by the diffusion equation.
