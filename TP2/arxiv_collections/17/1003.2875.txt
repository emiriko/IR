We establish the existence of stationary Gibbsian point processes for
interactions that act on hyperedges between the points. For example, such
interactions can depend on Delaunay edges or triangles, cliques of Voronoi
cells or clusters of $k$-nearest neighbors. The classical case of pair
interactions is also included. The basic tools are an entropy bound and
stationarity.
