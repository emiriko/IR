If $X$ is a smooth scheme over a perfect field of characteristic $p$, and if
$\sD_X$ is the sheaf of differential operators on $X$ [EGAIV], it is well known
that giving an action of $\sD_X$ on an $\sO_X$-module $\sE$ is equivalent to
giving an infinite sequence of $\sO_X$-modules descending $\sE$ via the
iterates of the Frobenius endomorphism of $X$. We show that this result can be
generalized to any infinitesimal deformation $f : X \to S$ of a smooth morphism
in characteristic $p$, endowed with Frobenius liftings. We also show that it
extends to adic formal schemes such that $p$ belongs to an ideal of definition.
In a recent preprint, dos Santos used this result to lift $\sD_X$-modules from
characteristic $p$ to characteristic 0 with control of the differential Galois
group.
