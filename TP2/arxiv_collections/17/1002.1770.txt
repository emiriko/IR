Celestial objects, from earth like planets to clusters of galaxies, possess
angular momentum and magnetic fields. Here we compare the rotational and
magnetic energies of a whole range of these celestial objects together with
their gravitational self energies and find a number of interesting
relationships. The celestial objects, due to their magnetic fields, also posses
magnetic moments. The ratio of magnetic moments of these objects with the
nuclear magnetic moments also exhibits interesting trends. We also compare
their gyromagnetic ratio which appears to fall in a very narrow range for the
entire hierarchy of objects. Here we try to understand the physical aspects
implied by these observations and the origin of these properties in such a wide
range of celestial objects, spanning some twenty orders in mass, magnetic field
and other parameters.
