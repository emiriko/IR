We discuss a method to constrain the distance of blazars with unknown
redshift using combined observations in the GeV and TeV regimes. We assume that
the VHE spectrum corrected for the absorption through the interaction with the
Extragalactic Background Light can not be harder than the spectrum in the
Fermi/LAT band. Starting from the observed VHE spectral data we derive the
EBL-corrected spectra as a function of the redshift z and fit them with power
laws to be compared with power law fits to the LAT data. We apply the method to
all TeV blazars detected by LAT with known distance and derive an empirical law
describing the relation between the upper limits and the true redshifts that
can be used to estimate the distance of unknown redshift blazars. Using
different EBL models leads to systematic changes in the derived upper limits.
Finally, we use this relation to infer the distance of the unknown redshift
blazar PKS 1424+240.
