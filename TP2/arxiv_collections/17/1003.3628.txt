The effect of pressure on the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$ was tested
in the hole-doped superconductor YBa2Cu3O(7-d) and in the electron-doped one
Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of magnetization measurements. Whereas a large change
of $\lambda$ was found in YBa2Cu3O(7-d), confirming the non-adiabatic character
of the electron-phonon coupling in hole-doped superconductors, the same
quantity is not affected by pressure in the electron-doped Sr0.9La0.1CuO2,
suggesting a close similarity of the latter to conventional adiabatic BCS
superconductors. The present results imply a remarkable difference between the
electronic properties of hole-doped cuprates and the electron-doped
Sr0.9La0.1CuO2, giving a strong contribution to the long debated asymmetric
consequences of hole- and electron-doping in cuprate superconductors.
