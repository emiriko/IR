We have measured spatial and temporal variability in the y band sky
brightness over the course of four nights above Cerro Tololo near Cerro Pachon,
Chile, the planned site for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our
wide-angle camera lens provided a 41 deg field of view and a 145 arcsec pixel
scale. We minimized potential system throughput differences by deploying a deep
depletion CCD and a filter that matches the proposed LSST y_3 band (970 nm-1030
nm). Images of the sky exhibited coherent wave structure, attributable to
atmospheric gravity waves at 90 km altitude, creating 3%-4% rms spatial sky
flux variability on scales of about 2 degrees and larger. Over the course of a
full night the y_3 band additionally showed highly coherent temporal
variability of up to a factor of 2 in flux. We estimate the mean absolute sky
level to be approximately y_3 = 17.8 mag (Vega), or y_3 = 18.3 mag (AB). While
our observations were made through a y_3 filter, the relative sky brightness
variability should hold for all proposed y bands, whereas the absolute levels
should more strongly depend on spectral response. The spatial variability
presents a challenge to wide-field cameras that require illumination correction
strategies that make use of stacked sky flats. The temporal variability may
warrant an adaptive y band imaging strategy for LSST, to take advantage of
times when the sky is darkest.
