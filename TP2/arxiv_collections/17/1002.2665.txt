We refine a method for finding a canonical form for symmetry operators of
arbitrary order for the Schroedinger eigenvalue equation on any 2D Riemannian
manifold, real or complex, that admits a separation of variables in some
orthogonal coordinate system. As examples we treat two potentials with
parameter k (one of which is the Tremblay, Turbiner, and Winternitz system)
that have been shown to be classically superintegrable for all rational numbers
k. We apply the canonical operator method to give a constructive proof that
each of these systems is also quantum superintegrable for all rational k. We
also develop the classical analog of the quantum canonical form for a symmetry.
It is clear that our methods will generalize to other Hamiltonian systems.
