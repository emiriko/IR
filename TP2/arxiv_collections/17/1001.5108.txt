Photosynthetic antenna complexes capture and concentrate solar radiation by
transferring the excitation to the reaction center which stores energy from the
photon in chemical bonds. This process occurs with near-perfect quantum
efficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that
coherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many
photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
antenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both
incoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that
environmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological
temperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a
quantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum
coherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we
present the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at
physiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a
rudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the
wave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to
biological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime
to correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores,
and we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears
constant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and
mediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The
persistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these
conditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum
computational devices that can operate at high temperature.
