The unfolding of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) for Fall 2009 in the Northern
Hemisphere is still uncertain. Plans for vaccination campaigns and vaccine
trials are underway, with the first batches expected to be available early
October. Several studies point to the possibility of an anticipated pandemic
peak that could undermine the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Here we
use a structured global epidemic and mobility metapopulation model to assess
the effectiveness of massive vaccination campaigns for the Fall/Winter 2009.
Mitigation effects are explored depending on the interplay between the
predicted pandemic evolution and the expected delivery of vaccines. The model
is calibrated using recent estimates on the transmissibility of the new A(H1N1)
influenza. Results show that if additional intervention strategies were not
used to delay the time of pandemic peak, vaccination may not be able to
considerably reduce the cumulative number of cases, even when the mass
vaccination campaign is started as early as mid-October. Prioritized
vaccination would be crucial in slowing down the pandemic evolution and
reducing its burden.
