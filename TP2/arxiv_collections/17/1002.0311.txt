Isoscaling is derived within a recently proposed modified Fisher model where
the free energy near the critical point is described by the Landau O(m^6)
theory. In this model m = (N-Z)/A is the order parameter, a consequence of (one
of) the symmetries of the nuclear Hamiltonian. Within this framework we show
that isoscaling depends mainly on this order parameter through the 'external
(conjugate) field' H. The external field is just given by the difference in
chemical potentials of the neutrons and protons of the two sources. To
distinguish from previously employed isoscaling relationships, this approach is
dubbed: m - scaling. We discuss the relationship between this framework and the
standard isoscaling formalism and point out some substantial differences in
interpretation of experimental results which might result. These should be
investigated further both theoretically and experimentally.
