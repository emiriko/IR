We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with
two-sided Bernoulli initial condition, i.e., with left density rho_- and right
density rho_+. We consider the associated height function, whose discrete
gradient is given by the particle occurrences. Macroscopically one has a
deterministic limit shape with a shock or a rarefaction fan depending on the
values of rho_{+/-}. We characterize the large time scaling limit of the
fluctuations as a function of the densities rho_{+/-} and of the different
macroscopic regions. Moreover, using a slow decorrelation phenomena, the
results are extended from fixed time to the whole space-time, except along the
some directions (the characteristic solutions of the related Burgers equation)
where the problem is still open.
  On the way to proving the results for TASEP, we obtain the limit processes
for the fluctuations in a class of corner growth processes with external
sources, of equivalently for the last passage time in a directed percolation
model with two-sided boundary conditions. Additionally, we provide analogous
results for eigenvalues of perturbed complex Wishart (sample covariance)
matrices.
