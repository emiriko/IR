A thin film on a horizontal solid substrate and coated with a soluble
surfactant is considered. The governing degenerate parabolic equations for the
film height and the surfactant concentrations on the surface and in the bulk
are derived using a lubrication approximation when gravity is taken into
account. It is shown that the steady states are asymptotically stable.
