We have examined the valence-band electronic structures of gold and silver in
the same column in the periodic table with nominally filled d orbitals by means
of a recently developed polarization-dependent hard x-ray photoemission.
Contrary to a common expectation, it is found that the 5d-orbital electrons
contribute prominently to the conduction electrons in gold while the conduction
electrons in silver are to some extent free-electron-like with negligible 4d
contribution, which could be related to a well-known fact that gold is more
stable than silver in air. The 4d electron correlation effects are found to be
essential for the conduction electron character in silver.
