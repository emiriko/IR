The phase transition of a random mixed-bond Ising ferromagnet on a cubic
lattice model is studied both numerically and analytically. In this work, we
use the Cluster algorithms of Wolff and Glauber to simulate the dynamics of the
system. We obtained the thermodynamic quantities such as magnetization,
susceptibility, and specific heat. Our results were compared with those
obtained using a new technique in effective field theory that employs similar
probability distribution within the framework of two-site clusters
