This paper develops an analogy proposed by Stachel between general relativity
(GR) and quantum mechanics (QM) as regards permutation invariance. Our main
idea is to overcome Pooley's criticism of the analogy by appeal to
paraparticles.
  In GR the equations are (the solution space is) invariant under
diffeomorphisms permuting spacetime points. Similarly, in QM the equations are
invariant under particle permutations. Stachel argued that this feature--a
theory's `not caring which point, or particle, is which'--supported a
structuralist ontology.
  Pooley criticizes this analogy: in QM the (anti-)symmetrization of fermions
and bosons implies that each individual state (solution) is fixed by each
permutation, while in GR a diffeomorphism yields in general a distinct, albeit
isomorphic, solution.
  We define various versions of structuralism, and go on to formulate Stachel's
and Pooley's positions, admittedly in our own terms. We then reply to Pooley.
Though he is right about fermions and bosons, QM equally allows more general
types of symmetry, in which states (vectors, rays or density operators) are not
fixed by all permutations (called `paraparticle states'). Thus Stachel's
analogy is revived.
