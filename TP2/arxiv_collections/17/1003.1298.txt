Motivated by a recent astrophysical measurement of the pressure of cold
matter above nuclear-matter saturation density, we compute the equation of
state of neutron star matter using accurately calibrated relativistic models.
The uniform stellar core is assumed to consist of nucleons and leptons in beta
equilibrium; no exotic degrees of freedom are included. We found the
predictions of these models to be in fairly good agreement with the measured
equation of state. Yet the Mass-vs-Radius relations predicted by these same
models display radii that are consistently larger than the observations.
