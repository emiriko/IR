Multiple energy scales are detected in measurements of the thermodynamic and
transport properties in heavy fermion metals. We demonstrate that the
experimental data on the energy scales can be well described by the scaling
behavior of the effective mass at the fermion condensation quantum phase
transition, and show that the dependence of the effective mass on temperature
and applied magnetic fields gives rise to the non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our
analysis is placed in the context of recent salient experimental results. Our
calculations of the non-Fermi liquid behavior, of the scales and thermodynamic
and transport properties are in good agreement with the heat capacity,
magnetization, longitudinal magnetoresistance and magnetic entropy obtained in
remarkable measurements on the heavy fermion metal YbRh2Si2.
