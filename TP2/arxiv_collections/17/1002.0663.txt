The dielectric behavior of a linear cluster of two or more living cells
connected by tight junctions is analyzed using a spectral method. The
polarizability of this system is obtained as an expansion over the eigenmodes
of the linear response operator, showing a clear separation of geometry from
electric parameters. The eigenmode with the second largest eigenvalue dominates
the expansion as the junction between particles tightens, but only when the
applied field is aligned with the cluster axis. This effect explains a distinct
low-frequency relaxation observed in the impedance spectrum of a suspension of
linear clusters.
