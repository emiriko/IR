We study AKLT models on locally tree-like lattices of fixed connectivity and
find that they exhibit a variety of ground states depending upon the spin,
coordination and global (graph) topology. We find a) quantum paramagnetic or
valence bond solid ground states, b) critical and ordered N\'eel states on
bipartite infinite Cayley trees and c) critical and ordered quantum vector spin
glass states on random graphs of fixed connectivity. We argue, in consonance
with a previous analysis, that all phases are characterized by gaps to local
excitations. The spin glass states we report arise from random long ranged
loops which frustrate N\'eel ordering despite the lack of randomness in the
coupling strengths.
