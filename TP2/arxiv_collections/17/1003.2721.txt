The existence of plasma oscillations at multiples of the magnetoplasmon
frequency in a strongly coupled two-dimensional magnetized Yukawa plasma is
reported, based on extensive molecular dynamics simulations. These modes are
the analogues of Bernstein modes which are renormalized by strong interparticle
correlations. Their properties are theoretically explained by a dielectric
function incorporating the combined effect of a magnetic field, strong
correlations and finite temperature.
