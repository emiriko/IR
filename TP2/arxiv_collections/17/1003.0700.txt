We investigate the Lambda(1520,3/2^-)=Lambda* photoproduction off the proton
target with the Regge contributions to go beyond the resonance region, in
addition to the tree-level Born terms consisting of the s, t, and u channels,
and contact term. For this purpose, the Reggeized propagators for the K and K*
exchanges in the t channel are employed in a gauge-invariant manner. We also
take into account the contribution from a nucleon resonance D_{13}(2030). We
compute the angular and energy dependences of the production process, including
polarization observables, such as the photon-beam asymmetry and the
polarization-transfer coefficients, resulting in good qualitative agreement
with current experimental data. It turns out that the Regge contributions are
necessary to explain the high-energy data beyond E_{gamma}~4 GeV especially for
the angular dependences in the forward-scattering region. On the contrary, the
polarization observables are insensitive to the Regge contributions due to the
contact-term dominance and gauge invariance. We also compute the K^{-}-angle
distribution function in the Gottfried-Jackson frame, using the
polarization-transfer coefficients in the z direction. It shows nontrivial
theta and E_{gamma} dependences in the forward-scattering region.
