The constraints imposed by nano- and microscale confinement on the
conformational degrees of freedom of thermally fluctuating biopolymers are
utilized in contemporary nano-devices to specifically elongate and manipulate
single chains. A thorough theoretical understanding and quantification of the
statistical conformations of confined polymer chains is thus a central concern
in polymer physics. We present an analytical calculation of the radial
distribution function of harmonically confined semiflexible polymers in the
weakly bending limit. Special emphasis has been put on a proper treatment of
global modes, i.e. the possibility of the chain to perform global movements
within the channel. We show that the effect of these global modes significantly
impacts the chain statistics in cases of weak and intermediate confinement.
Comparing our analytical model to numerical data from Monte Carlo simulations
we find excellent agreement over a broad range of parameters.
