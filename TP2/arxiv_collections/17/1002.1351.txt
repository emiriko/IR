For the kinetic energy of 1d model finite systems the leading corrections to
local approximations as a functional of the potential are derived using
semiclassical methods. The corrections are simple, non-local functionals of the
potential. Turning points produce quantum oscillations leading to energy
corrections, which are completely different from the gradient corrections that
occur in bulk systems with slowly-varying densities. Approximations that
include quantum corrections are typically much more accurate than their local
analogs. The consequences for density functional theory are discussed.
