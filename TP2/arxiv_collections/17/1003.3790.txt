The AKARI FU-HYU mission program carried out mid-infrared imaging of several
well studied Spitzer fields preferentially selecting fields already rich in
multi-wavelength data from radio to X-ray wavelengths filling in the wavelength
desert between the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS bands.We present the initial results
for the FU-HYU survey in the GOODS-N field.We utilize the supreme
multiwavelength coverage in the GOODS-N field to produce a multiwavelength
catalogue from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, containing more than 4393
sources, including photometric redshifts. Using the FU-HYU catalogue we present
colour-colour diagrams that map the passage of PAH features through our
observation bands. We find that the longer mid-infrared bands from AKARI
(IRC-L18W 18 micron band) and Spitzer (MIPS24 24 micron band) provide an
accurate measure of the total MIR emission of the sources and therefore their
probable total mid-infrared luminosity. We also find that colours incorporating
the AKARI IRC-S11 11 micron band produce a bimodal distribution where an excess
at 11 microns preferentially selects moderate redshift star-forming galaxies.
These powerful colour-colour diagnostics are further used as tools to extract
anomalous colour populations, in particular a population of Silicate Break
galaxies from the GOODS-N field showing that dusty starbursts can be selected
of specific redshift ranges (z=1.2 - 1.6) by mid-infrared drop-out techniques.
The FU-HYU catalogue will be made publically available to the astronomical
community.
