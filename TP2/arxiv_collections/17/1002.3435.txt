We show a general two-step method to grow hydroxide and oxide nanocrystals of
the iron family elements (Ni, Co, Fe) on graphene with two degrees of
oxidation. Drastically different nanocrystal growth behaviors were observed on
low-oxidation graphene sheets (GS) and highly oxidized graphite oxide (GO) in
hydrothermal reactions. Small particles pre-coated on GS with few
oxygen-containing surface groups diffused and recrystallized into
single-crystalline nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates or iron oxide
Fe2O3 nanorods with well defined morphologies. In contrast, particles
pre-coated on GO were pinned by the high-concentration oxygen groups and
defects on GO without recrystallization into well-defined shapes. Adjusting
reaction temperature can be combined to further control materials grown on
graphene. For materials with weak interactions with graphene, increasing the
reaction temperature can lead to diffusion and recrystallization of surface
species into larger crystals even on highly oxidized and defective GO. Our
results suggest an interesting new approach to controlling the morphology of
nanomaterials grown on graphene by tuning the surface chemistry of graphene as
substrates for crystal nucleation and growth.
