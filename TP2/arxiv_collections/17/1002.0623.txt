In this paper the spin-dependent singlet and nonsinglet structure functions
have been obtained by solving Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
evolution equations in leading order in the small x limit. Here we have used
Taylor series expansion and then the particular and unique solution to solve
the evolution equations. We have also calculated t evolutions of deuteron,
proton and neutron structure functions and the results are compared with the
SLAC E-143 Collaboration data.
