The possibility to explain basic physical properties of relaxors within the
concept of the dipole-glass transition is discussed. We argue that this concept
provides the only consistent picture accounting of all known anomalous features
of relaxors. The origin of their history-dependent properties can be naturally
traced to the main paradigm of glass-state theory - the existence of numerous
metastable states. Based on this paradigm phenomenological description of known
history-dependent phenomena in relaxors agrees qualitatively with experiments.
