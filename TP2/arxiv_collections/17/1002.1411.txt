Recent experiments revealing possible nanoscale electrostatic interactions in
force generation at kinetochores for chromosome motions have prompted
speculation regarding possible models for interactions between positively
charged molecules in kinetochores and negative charge on C-termini near the
plus ends of microtubules. A clear picture of how kinetochores establish and
maintain a dynamic coupling to microtubules for force generation during the
complex motions of mitosis remains elusive. The current paradigm of molecular
cell biology requires that specific molecules, or molecular geometries, for
force generation be identified. However, it is possible to account for mitotic
motions within a classical electrostatics approach in terms of experimentally
known cellular electric charge interacting over nanometer distances. These
charges are modeled as bound surface and volume continuum charge distributions.
Electrostatic consequences of intracellular pH changes during mitosis may
provide a master clock for the events of mitosis.
