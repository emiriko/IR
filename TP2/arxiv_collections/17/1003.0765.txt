We explore the spontaneous formation of an excitonic insulator state at the
semimetal-semiconductor transition of mixed-valence materials in the framework
of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model with direct $f$-$f$ electron hopping.
Adapting the projector-based renormalization method, we obtain a set of
renormalization differential equations for the extended Falicov-Kimball model
parameters and finally derive analytical expressions for the order parameter,
as well as for the renormalized $c$- and $f$-electron dispersions, momentum
distributions, and wave-vector resolved single-particle spectral functions. Our
numerical results proved the valence transition picture, related to the
appearance of the excitonic insulator phase, in the case of overlapping $c$ and
$f$ bands. Thereby the photoemission spectra show significant differences
between the weak-to-intermediate and intermediate-to-strong Coulomb attraction
regimes, indicating a BCS-BEC transition of the excitonic condensate.
