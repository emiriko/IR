We consider a class of supersymmetric models containing baryon number
violating processes such as observable neutron - antineutron oscillations that
are mediated by color triplet diquark fields. For plausible values of the
diquark-quark couplings, the scalar diquark with mass between a few hundred GeV
and one TeV or so can be produced in the s-channel at the LHC and detected
through its decay into a top quark and a hadronic jet.
