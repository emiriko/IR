We discuss how a possible violation of the combined symmetry CPT in the B
meson system can be investigated at the LHC. We show how a tagged and an
untagged analysis of the decay modes of both B(d) and B(s) mesons can lead not
only to a possible detection of a CPT-violating new physics but also to an
understanding of its precise nature. The implication of CPT violation to a
large mixing phase in the B(s) system is also discussed.
