Recent developments of high-order CCM have been to extend existing formalism
and codes to $s \ge \frac 12$ for both the ground and excited states, and
independently to "generalised" expectation values for a wide range of one- and
two-body spin operators. An advantage of the CCM is that the Goldstone
linked-cluster theorem is obeyed at all levels of approximation and so it
provides results in the infinite lattice limit $N \to \infty$ from the outset.
However, recent results have also shown that the CCM can provide exact
(symmetry-breaking) results for the spin-half linear-chain $J_1$--$J_2$ at the
Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2/J_1=0.5$ by identifying special solutions of the CCM
equations for the usual N\'eel model state. Interestingly, the CCM provides
exact (non-symmetry-breaking) results for systems in which small magnetic
clusters become de-coupled from each other when the bonds connecting them tend
to zero. These exact results involve the identification of "special solutions"
of the CCM equations for the N\'eel state. An example of this is given by a
spin-half system with nearest-neighbour bonds for an underlying lattice
corresponding to the magnetic material CaV$_4$O$_9$ (CAVO) in which one of the
two different types of bonds on the lattice tend to zero. Larger finite-sized
systems may be considered by appropriate choice of the unit cell and the bonds
on it. We show here that exact diagonalisation results for ground-state energy
and excitation energy gap for the spin-half and spin-one linear Heisenberg
model on chains of length up to N=12 sites for s=1/2 and N=6 sites for s=1 with
periodic boundary conditions are reproduced exactly using high-order CCM via
this "brute-force" approach; i.e., one in which none of the translational or
point-group symmetries of the finite lattice are used.
