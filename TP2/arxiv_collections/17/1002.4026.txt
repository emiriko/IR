This is a general description of a probabilistic formalism of mechanics,
i.e., an extension of the Newtonian mechanics principles to the systems
undergoing random motion. From an analysis of the induction procedure from
experimental data to the Newtonian laws, it is shown that the experimental
verification of Newton law in a random motion implies a stochastic extension of
the virtual work principle and the least action principle, i.e., <dW>=0 and
<dA>=0 averaged over all the random paths instead of dW=0 and dA=0 for single
path in regular dynamics. A probabilistic mechanics is formulated and applied
to thermodynamic system. Several known results, rules and principles can be
reproduced and justified from this new point of view. To mention some, we have
obtain the entropy variation of the free expansion of gas and heat conduction
without considering local equilibrium, and a violation of the Liouville theorem
and Poincar\'e recurrence theorem, which allows to relate the entropy
production to the work performed by random forces in nonequilibrium process.
