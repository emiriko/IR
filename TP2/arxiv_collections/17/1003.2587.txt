High-dispersion spectra of 89 potential members of the old, super-metal-rich
open cluster, NGC 6253, have been obtained with the HYDRA multi-object
spectrograph. Based upon radial-velocity measurements alone, 47 stars at the
turnoff of the cluster color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and 18 giants are
identified as potential members. Five turnoff stars exhibit evidence of
binarity while proper-motion data eliminates two of the dwarfs as members. The
mean cluster radial velocity from probable single-star members is -29.4 +/- 1.3
km/sec (sd). A discussion of the current estimates for the cluster reddening,
derived independently of potential issues with the BV cluster photometry, lead
to an adopted reddening of E(B-V) = 0.22 +/- 0.04. From equivalent width
analyses of 38 probable single-star members near the CMD turnoff, the weighted
average abundances are found to be [Fe/H] = +0.43 +/- 0.01, [Ni/H] = +0.53 +/-
0.02 and [Si/H] = +0.43 (+0.03,-0.04), where the errors refer to the standard
errors of the weighted mean. Weak evidence is found for a possible decline in
metallicity with increasing luminosity among stars at the turnoff. We discuss
the possibility that our turnoff stars have been affected by microscopic
diffusion. For 15 probable single-star members among the giants, spectrum
synthesis leads to abundances of +0.46 (+0.02,-0.03) for [Fe/H]. While less
than half the age of NGC 6791, NGC 6253 is at least as metal-rich and, within
the uncertainties, exhibits the same general abundance pattern as that typified
by super-metal-rich dwarfs of the galactic bulge.
