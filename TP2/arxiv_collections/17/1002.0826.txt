Loewner Theory is a deep technique in Complex Analysis affording a basis for
many further important developments such as the proof of famous Bieberbach's
conjecture and well-celebrated Schramm's Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE). It
provides analytic description of expanding domains dynamics in the plane. Two
cases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the {\it radial} and
the {\it chordal} Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of
holomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of
the reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new
approach [arXiv:0807.1594v1, arXiv:0807.1715v1, arXiv:0902.3116v1] bringing
together, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of
Loewner Theory. In the framework of this approach we address the question what
kind of systems of simply connected domains can be described by means of
Loewner chains of chordal type. As an answer to this question we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simply connected domains to be
the range of a generalized Loewner chain of chordal type. We also provide an
easy-to-check geometric sufficient condition for that. In addition, we obtain
analogous results for the less general case of chordal Loewner evolution
considered by I.A.Aleksandrov, S.T.Aleksandrov and V.V.Sobolev, 1983;
V.V.Goryainov and I.Ba, 1992; R.O.Bauer, 2005 [arXiv:math/0306130v1].
