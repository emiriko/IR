The rapidly increasing volume of asteroseismic observations on solar-type
stars has revealed a need for automated analysis tools. The reason for this is
not only that individual analyses of single stars are rather time consuming,
but more importantly that these large volumes of observations open the
possibility to do population studies on large samples of stars and such
population studies demand a consistent analysis. By consistent analysis we
understand an analysis that can be performed without the need to make any
subjective choices on e.g. mode identification and an analysis where the
uncertainties are calculated in a consistent way.
  Here we present a set of automated asterosesimic analysis tools. The main
engine of these set of tools is an algorithm for modelling the autocovariance
spectra of the stellar acoustic spectra allowing us to measure not only the
frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation, but also the
small frequency separation and potentially the mean rotational rate and the
inclination.
  The measured large and small frequency separations and the frequency of
maximum power are used as input to an algorithm that estimates fundamental
stellar parameters such as mass, radius, luminosity, effective temperature,
surface gravity and age based on grid modeling.
  All the tools take into account the window function of the observations which
means that they work equally well for space-based photometry observations from
e.g. the NASA Kepler satellite and ground-based velocity observations from e.g.
the ESO HARPS spectrograph.
