The electronic valence state of Mn in Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3
multiferroic heterostructures is probed by near edge x-ray absorption
spectroscopy as a function of the ferroelectric polarization. We observe a
temperature independent shift in the absorption edge of Mn associated with a
change in valency induced by charge carrier modulation in the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3,
demonstrating the electronic origin of the magnetoelectric effect.
Spectroscopic, magnetic, and electric characterization shows that the large
magnetoelectric response originates from a modified interfacial spin
configuration, opening a new pathway to the electronic control of spin in
complex oxide materials.
