We present early results from our multi-wavelength follow-up campaigns of the
AKARI Deep Fields at the North and South Ecliptic Poles. We summarize our
campaigns in this poster paper, and present three early outcomes. (a) Our
AAOmega optical spectroscopy of the Deep Field South at the AAT has observed
over 550 different targets, and our preliminary local luminosity function at 90
microns from the first four hours of data is in good agreement with the
predictions from Serjeant & Harrison 2005. (b) Our GMRT 610 MHz imaging in the
Deep Field North has reached ~30 microJy RMS, making this among the deepest
images at this frequency. Our 610 MHz source counts at >200 microJy are the
deepest ever derived at this frequency. (c) Comparing our GMRT data with our
1.4 GHz WSRT data, we have found two examples of radio-loud AGN that may have
more than one epoch of activity.
