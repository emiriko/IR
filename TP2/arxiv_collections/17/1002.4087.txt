In this paper we study the regularity of viscosity solutions to the following
Hamilton-Jacobi equations $$ \partial_t u + H(D_{x} u)=0 \qquad \textrm{in}
\Omega\subset \mathbb R\times \mathbb R^{n} . $$ In particular, under the
assumption that the Hamiltonian $H\in C^2(\mathbb R^n)$ is uniformly convex, we
prove that $D_{x}u$ and $\partial_t u$ belong to the class $SBV_{loc}(\Omega)$.
