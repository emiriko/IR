The anapole moment of a charged scalar particle is studied in a model
independent fashion, using the effective Lagrangian technique, as well as
radiatively within the context of scalar quantum electrodynamics (SQED). It is
shown that this gauge structure is characterized by a non renormalizable
interaction, which is radiatively generated at the one--loop. It is found that
the resulting anapole moment for off-shell particles, though free of
ultraviolet divergences, is gauge dependent and thus it is not a physical
observable. We also study some of its kinematical limits. In particular, it is
shown that its value comes out to be zero when all particles are on--shell.
