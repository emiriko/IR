In device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD), the violation of a
Bell inequality is exploited to establish a shared key that is secure
independently of the internal workings of the QKD devices. An experimental
implementation of DIQKD, however, is still awaited, since hitherto all optical
Bell tests are subject to the detection loophole, making the protocol
unsecured. In particular, photon losses in the quantum channel represent a
fundamental limitation for DIQKD. Here, we introduce a heralded qubit amplifier
based on single-photon sources and linear optics that provides a realistic
solution to overcome the problem of channel losses in Bell tests.
