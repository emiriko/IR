Pulsed magnetic fields of up to 55T are used to investigate the transport
properties of the topological insulator Bi_2Se_3 in the extreme quantum limit.
For samples with a bulk carrier density of n = 2.9\times10^16cm^-3, the lowest
Landau level of the bulk 3D Fermi surface is reached by a field of 4T. For
fields well beyond this limit, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising from
quantization of the 2D surface state are observed, with the \nu =1 Landau level
attained by a field of 35T. These measurements reveal the presence of
additional oscillations which occur at fields corresponding to simple rational
fractions of the integer Landau indices.
