In order to find novel examples of non-simply connected Calabi-Yau
threefolds, free quotients of complete intersections in products of projective
spaces are classified by means of a computer search. More precisely, all
automorphisms of the product of projective spaces that descend to a free action
on the Calabi-Yau manifold are identified.
