In the system made of Korteweg-de Vries with one source, we first show by
applying the Painleve' test that the two components of the source must have the
same potential. We then explain the natural introduction of an additional term
in the potential of the source equations while preserving the existence of a
Lax pair. This allows us to prove the identity between the travelling wave
reduction and one of the three integrable cases of the cubic He'non-Heiles
Hamiltonian system.
