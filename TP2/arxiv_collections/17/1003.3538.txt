We consider the $SU(N_{TC})$ Farhi - Susskind Technicolor model, in which
SU(2) doublets of technifermions are right-handed while SU(2) singlets of
technifermions are left-handed. We add coupling of fermions and technifermions
to $SU(N_{TC})$ fundamental massive scalar fields. Due to this coupling the
transitions between both types of fermions occur. Therefore the Standard Model
fermions acquire masses.
