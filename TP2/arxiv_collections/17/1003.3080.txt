Multimedia data is a form of data that can represent all types of data
(images, sound and text). The use of multimedia data for the online application
requires a more comprehensive database in the use of storage media, Sorting /
indexing, search and system / data searching. This is necessary in order to
help providers and users to access multimedia data online. Systems that use of
the index image as a reference requires storage media so that the rules and
require special expertise to obtain the desired file. Changes in multimedia
data into a series of stories / storyboard in the form of a text will help
reduce the consumption of media storage, system index / sorting and search
applications. Oriented Movement is one method that is being developed to change
