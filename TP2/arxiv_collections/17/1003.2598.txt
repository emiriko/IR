We calculate the Schiff moments of the nuclei 199Hg and 211Ra in completely
self-consistent odd-nucleus mean-field theory by modifying the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov code HFODD. We allow for arbitrary shape deformation,
and include the effects of nucleon dipole moments alongside those of a
CP-violating pion-exchange nucleon-nucleon interaction. The results for 199Hg
differ significantly from those of previous calculations when the CP-violating
interaction is of isovector character.
