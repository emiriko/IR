For beta-equilibrated nuclear matter we estimate the contribution to the bulk
viscosity from purely leptonic processes, namely the conversion of electrons to
and from muons. For oscillation frequencies in the kiloHertz range, we find
that this process provides the dominant contribution to the bulk viscosity when
the temperature is well below the critical temperature for superconductivity or
superfluidity of the nuclear matter.
