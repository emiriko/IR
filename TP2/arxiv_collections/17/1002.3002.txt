We investigate gas accretion onto a protoplanet, by considering the thermal
effect of gas in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, in which the
wide region from a protoplanetary gas disk to a Jovian radius planet is
resolved using the nested-grid method. We estimate the mass accretion rate and
growth timescale of gas giant planets. The mass accretion rate increases with
protoplanet mass for M_p < M_cri, while it becomes saturated or decreases for
M_p > M_cri, where M_cri = 0.036 M_Jup (a_p/1AU)^0.75, and M_Jup and a_p are
the Jovian mass and the orbital radius, respectively. The growth timescale of a
gas giant planet or the timescale of the gas accretion onto the protoplanet is
about 10^5 yr, that is two orders of magnitude shorter than the growth
timescale of the solid core. The thermal effects barely affect the mass
accretion rate because the gravitational energy dominates the thermal energy
around the protoplanet. The mass accretion rate obtained in our local
simulations agrees quantitatively well with those obtained in global
simulations with coarser spatial resolution. The mass accretion rate is mainly
determined by the protoplanet mass and the property of the protoplanetary disk.
We find that the mass accretion rate is correctly calculated when the Hill or
Bondi radius is sufficiently resolved. Using the oligarchic growth of
protoplanets, we discuss the formation timescale of gas giant planets.
