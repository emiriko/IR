Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) is known to be a key technology for next
generation mobile communications systems, as it allows to overcome the burden
of inter-cell interference. Especially in the uplink, it is likely that
interference exploitation schemes will be used in the near future, as they can
be used with legacy terminals and require no or little changes in
standardization. Major drawbacks, however, are the extent of additional
backhaul infrastructure needed, and the sensitivity to imperfect channel
knowledge. This paper jointly addresses both issues in a new framework
incorporating a multitude of proposed theoretical uplink CoMP concepts, which
are then put into perspective with practical CoMP algorithms. This
comprehensive analysis provides new insight into the potential usage of uplink
CoMP in next generation wireless communications systems.
