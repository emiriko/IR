We discuss generic limits posed by the trap in atomic systems on the accurate
determination of critical parameters for second-order phase transitions, from
which we deduce optimal protocols to extract them. We show that under current
experimental conditions the in-situ density profiles are barely suitable for an
accurate study of critical points in the strongly correlated regime. Contrary
to recent claims, the proper analysis of time-of-fight images yields critical
parameters accurately.
