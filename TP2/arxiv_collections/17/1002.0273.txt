We study a continuous-space version of the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process (TASEP), consisting of interacting Brownian particles subject
to a driving force in a periodic external potential. Particles are inserted at
the leftmost site at rate $\alpha$, hop to the right at unit rate, and are
removed at the rightmost site at rate $\beta$. Our study is motivated by recent
experiments on colloidal particles in optical tweezer arrays. The external
potential is of the form generated by such an array. Particles spend most of
the time near potential minima, approximating the situation in the lattice gas;
a short-range repulsive interaction prevents two particles from occupying the
same potential well. A constant driving force, representing Stokes drag on
particles suspended in a moving fluid, leads to biased motion. Our results for
the density profile and current, obtained via numerical integration of the
Langevin equation and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the
continuous-space model exhibits phase transitions analogous to those observed
in the lattice model. The correspondence is not exact, however, due to the lack
of particle-hole symmetry in our model.
