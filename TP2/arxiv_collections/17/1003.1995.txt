We perform coupled-cluster calculations of the energies and lifetimes of
single-particle states around the doubly magic nucleus 16O based on chiral
nucleon-nucleon interactions at next-to-next- to-next-to-leading order. To
incorporate effects from the scattering continuum, we solve the coupled-
cluster equations with a Gamow-Hartree-Fock basis. Our calculations for the
1/2+ proton-halo state in 17F and the 1/2+ state in 17O agree well with
experiment, while the calculated spin-orbit splitting between d5/2 and d3/2
states is too small due to the lack of three-nucleon forces. We find that
continuum effects yield a significant amount of additional binding energy for
the 1/2+ and 3/2+ states in 17O and 17F.
