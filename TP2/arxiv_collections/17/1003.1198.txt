We propose a simple method to detect the relative strength of Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-obit interactions in quantum wells (QWs) without relying on
the directional-dependent physical quantities. This method utilize the
asymmetry of critical gate voltages that leading to the remarkable signals of
SU(2) symmetry, which happens to reflect the intrinsic structure inversion
asymmetry of the QW. We support our proposal by the numerical calculation of
in-plane relaxation times based on the self-consistent eight-band Kane model.
We find that the two different critical gate voltages leading to the maximum
spin relaxation times [one effect of the SU(2) symmetry] can simply determine
the ratio of the coefficients of Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. Our proposal can
also be generalized to extract the relative strengths of the spin-orbit
interactions in quantum wire and quantum dot structures.
