The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the epoch in which hydrogen in the
Universe reionize after the "Dark Ages". This is the second of two major phase
transitions that hydrogen in the Universe underwent, the first phase being the
recombination era in which hydrogen became neutral at redshift about 1100. The
EoR, occurs around z of 10 and is probably caused by the first radiation
emitting astrophysical sources, hence it is crucial to our understanding of
when and how the Universe "decided" to start forming astrophysical objects and
how that influenced subsequent structure formation in the Universe. As such,
the EoR is related to many fundamental questions in cosmology, galaxy
formation, quasars and very metal poor stars; all are foremost research issues
in modern astrophysics. The redshifted 21 cm hyperfine line is widely
considered as the most promising probe for studying the EoR in detail. In the
near future a number of low frequency radio telescopes (LOFAR, MWA, GMRT and
SKA) will be able to observe the 21 cm radiation arriving from the high
redshift Universe. In this paper I present our current picture of the
ionization process, review the 21 cm line physics and discuss the challenges
that the current generation experiments are expected to face. Finally, I
discuss the potential of SKA in exploring the EoR and the Universe's Dark Ages.
