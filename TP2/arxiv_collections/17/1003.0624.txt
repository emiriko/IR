We distinguish three mechanisms of doping graphene. Density functional theory
is used to show that electronegative molecule like F4-TCNQ and electropositive
metals like K dope graphene p- and n-type respectively. These dopants are
expected to lead to a decrease in carrier mobility arising from Coulomb
scattering but without any hysteresis effects. Secondly, a novel doping
mechanism is exhibited by Au which dopes bilayer graphene but not single layer.
Thirdly, electrochemical doping is effected by redox reactions and can result
in p-doping by humid atmospheres and n-doping by NH3 and toluene.
