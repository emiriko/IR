An associative ring $R$ with identity is left pseudo-morphic if for every
$a$$\in$$R$, there exists $b$$\in$$R$ such that $Ra=l_R(b)$. If, in addition,
$l_R(a)=Rb$, then $R$ is called left morphic. $R$ is morphic if it is both left
and right morphic. We characterize left pseudo-morphic rings; identify the
cases a (left) pseudo morphic ring is (left) quasi-morphic, morphic,
Quasi-Frobenius, von Neumann regular, etc.; correct two results in a book and a
paper; and completely determine when the trivial extension of a commutative
domain is morphic which positively answered a question in a paper.
