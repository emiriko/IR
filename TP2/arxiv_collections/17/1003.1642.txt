Applications of the covariant theory of drive-forms are considered for a
class of perfectly insulating media. The distinction between the notions of
"classical photons" in homogeneous bounded and unbounded stationary media and
in stationary unbounded magneto-electric media is pointed out in the context of
the Abraham, Minkowski and symmetrized Minkowski electromagnetic
stress-energy-momentum tensors. Such notions have led to intense debate about
the role of these (and other) tensors in describing electromagnetic
interactions in moving media. In order to address some of these issues for
material subject to the Minkowski constitutive relations, the propagation of
harmonic waves through homogeneous and inhomogeneous, isotropic plane-faced
slabs at rest is first considered. To motivate the subsequent analysis on
accelerating media two classes of electromagnetic modes that solve Maxwell's
equations for uniformly rotating homogeneous polarizable media are enumerated.
Finally it is shown that, under the influence of an incident monochromatic,
circularly polarized, plane electromagnetic wave, the Abraham and symmetrized
Minkowski tensors induce different time-averaged torques on a uniformly
rotating materially inhomogeneous dielectric cylinder. We suggest that this
observation may offer new avenues to explore experimentally the covariant
electrodynamics of more general accelerating media.
