Following upon our recent work on vector correlations in the Ar-NO collisions
[PCCP 12, 1038 (2010)], we compare model results with close-coupling
calculations for a range of channels and collision energies for the He-NO
system. The striking agreement between the model and exact polarization moments
indicates that the stereodynamics of rotationally inelastic atom-molecule
collisions at thermal energies is governed by diffraction of matter waves from
a two-dimensional repulsive core of the atom-molecule potential. Furthermore,
the model polarization moments characterizing the He-NO, He-O$_2$, He-OH, and
He-CaH stereodynamics are found to coalesce into a single, distinctive pattern,
which can serve as a "fingerprint" to identify diffraction-driven
stereodynamics in future work.
