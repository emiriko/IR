We use exact diagonalization to explore the many-body localization transition
in a random-field spin-1/2 chain. We examine the correlations within each
many-body eigenstate, looking at all states and thus effectively working at
infinite temperature. For weak random field the eigenstates are thermal, as
expected in this nonlocalized, ergodic phase. For strong random field the
eigenstates are localized, with only short-range entanglement. We roughly
locate the localization transition and examine the probability distributions of
the correlations, finding that this quantum phase transition at nonzero
temperature may be showing infinite-randomness scaling.
