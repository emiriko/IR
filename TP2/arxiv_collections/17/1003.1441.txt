In this paper, we established the existence and uniqueness of the spherically
symmetric monopole solutions in SO(5) gauge theory with Higgs scalar fields in
the vector representation in six-dimensional Minkowski space-time and obtain
sharp asymptotic estimates for the solutions. Our method is based on a
dynamical shooting approach that depends on two shooting parameters which
provides an effective framework for constructing the generalized monopoles in
six-dimensional Minkowski space-time.
