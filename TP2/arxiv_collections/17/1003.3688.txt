The electric current and the magnetoresistance effect are studied in a double
quantum-dot system, where one of the dots QDa is coupled to two ferromagnetic
electrodes (F1,F2), while the second QDb is connected to a superconductor S.
For energy scales within the superconductor gap, electric conduction is allowed
by Andreev reflection processes. Due to the presence of two ferromagnetic
leads, non-local crossed Andreev reflections are possible. We found that the
magnetoresistance sign can be changed by tuning the external potential applied
to the ferromagnets. In addition, it is possible to control the current of the
first ferromagnet (F1) through the potential applied to the second one (F2). We
have also included intradot interaction and gate voltages at each quantum dot
and analyzed their influence through a mean field approximation. The
interaction reduces the current amplitudes with respect to the non-interacting
case, but the switching effect still remains as a manifestation of quantum
coherence, in scales of the order of the superconductor coherence length.
