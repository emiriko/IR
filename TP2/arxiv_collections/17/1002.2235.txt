Pads of beetles are covered with long, deformable setae, each ending in a
micrometric terminal plate coated with secretory fluid. It was recently shown
that the layer of the pad secretion covering the terminal plates is responsible
for the generation of strong attractive forces. However, less is known about
the fluid itself because it is produced in extremely small quantity. We here
present a first experimental investigation of the rheological properties of the
pad secretion in the Colorado potato beetle {\it Leptinotarsa decemlineata}.
Because the secretion is produced in an extremely small amount at the level of
the terminal plate, we first develop a procedure based on capillary effects to
collect the secretion. We then manage to incorporate micrometric beads,
initially in the form of a dry powder, and record their thermal motion to
determine the mechanical properties of the surrounding medium. We achieve such
a quantitative measurement within the collected volume, much smaller than the
$1 {\rm \mu}$l sample volume usually required for this technique. Surprisingly,
the beetle secretion was found to behave as a purely viscous liquid, of high
viscosity. This suggests that no specific complex fluid behaviour is needed
during beetle locomotion. We build a scenario for the contact formation between
the spatula at the setal tip and a substrate, during the insect walk. We show
that the attachment dynamics of the insect pad computed from the high measured
viscosity is in good agreement with observed insect pace. We finally discuss
the consequences of the secretion viscosity on the insect adhesion.
