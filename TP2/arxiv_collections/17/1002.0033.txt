Organ motion induced by respiration may cause clinically significant
targeting errors and greatly degrade the effectiveness of conformal
radiotherapy. It is therefore crucial to be able to model respiratory motion
accurately. A recently proposed lung motion model based on principal component
analysis (PCA) has been shown to be promising on a few patients. However, there
is still a need to understand the underlying reason why it works. In this
paper, we present a much deeper and detailed analysis of the PCA-based lung
motion model. We provide the theoretical justification of the effectiveness of
PCA in modeling lung motion. We also prove that under certain conditions, the
PCA motion model is equivalent to 5D motion model, which is based on physiology
and anatomy of the lung. The modeling power of PCA model was tested on clinical
data and the average 3D error was found to be below 1 mm.
