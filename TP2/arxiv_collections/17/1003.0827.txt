Clusters of galaxies are effective gravitational lenses able to magnify
background galaxies and making it possible to probe the fainter part of the
galaxy population. Submillimeter galaxies, which are believed to be
star-forming galaxies at typical redshifts of 2 to 3, are a major contaminant
to the extended Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal of galaxy clusters. For a proper
quantification of the SZ signal the contribution of submillimeter galaxies
needs to be quantified. The aims of this study are to identify submillimeter
sources in the field of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), a massive cluster of
galaxies at z~0.3, measure their flux densities at 870 micron, and search for
counterparts at other wavelengths to constrain their properties. We carried out
deep observations of the submillimeter continuum emission at 870 micron using
the Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment
(APEX) telescope. Several numerical techniques were used to quantify the noise
properties of the data and extract sources. In total, seventeen sources were
found. Thirteen of them lie in the central 10 arcminutes of the map, which has
a pixel sensitivity of 1.2 mJy per 22 arcsec beam. After correction for flux
boosting and gravitational lensing, the number counts are consistent with
published submm measurements. Nine of the sources have infrared counterparts in
Spitzer maps. The strongest submm detection coincides with a source previously
reported at other wavelengths, at an estimated redshift z~2.7. If the submm
flux arises from two images of a galaxy magnified by a total factor of 75, as
models have suggested, its intrinsic flux would be around 0.6 mJy, consistent
with an intrinsic luminosity below 10^12 L_sun.
