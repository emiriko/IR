We investigate the photoemission-type spectrum in a cold Fermi gas which was
recently measured by JILA group [J. T. Stewart {\it et al}., Nature
\textbf{454}, 744 (2008)]. This quantity gives us very useful information about
single-particle properties in the BCS-BEC crossover. In this letter, including
pairing fluctuations within a $T$-matrix theory, as well as effects of a
harmonic trap within the local density approximation, we show that spatially
inhomogeneous pairing fluctuations due to the trap potential is an important
key to understand the observed spectrum. In the crossover region, while strong
pairing fluctuations lead to the so-called pseudogap phenomenon in the trap
center, such strong-coupling effects are found to be weak around the edge of
the gas. Our results including this effect are shown to agree well with the
recent photoemission data by JILA group.
