We consider deep inelastic scattering off nuclei in the Regge limit within
the Glauber-Gribov model. Using unitarized parton distribution functions for
the proton, we find sizeable shadowing effects on the nuclear total and
longitudinal structure functions, $F_2^A$ and $F_L^A$, in the low-x limit.
Extending a fan-diagram analysis for the large-mass region of coherent
diffraction off nuclei to high Q2, we also find significant shadowing effects
in this kinematical regime. Finally, we discuss shortcomings of our approach
and possible extensions of the model to other kinematical regimes.
