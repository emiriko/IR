In this work consideration is given to massless and massive gauge-invariant
spin 0 and spin 1 fields (particles) within the scope of a theory of the
generalized relativistic wave equations with an extended set of the Lorentz
group representations. The results obtained may be useful as regards the
application of a relativistic wave-equation theory in modern field models.
