We introduce an in-situ characterization method of resists used for e-beam
lithography. The technique is based on the application of an atomic force
microscope which is directly mounted below the cathode of an electron-beam
lithography system. We demonstrate that patterns irradiated by the e-beam can
be efficiently visualized and analyzed in surface topography directly after the
e-beam exposure. This in-situ analysis takes place without any development or
baking steps, and gives access to the chemical (or latent) image of the
irradiated resist.
