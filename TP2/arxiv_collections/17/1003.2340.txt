Resonant microwave-assisted and DC transport are investigated in degenerately
doped silicon single electron transistors. A model based on hopping via
localized impurity states is developed and first used to explain both the DC
temperature dependence and the AC response. In particular, the non-monotonic
power dependence of the resonant current under irradiation is proved to be
consistent with spatial Rabi oscillations between these localized states.
