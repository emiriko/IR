We introduce the isothermal cavity, static holographic screen, and
accelerating surface as holographic screen to study the entropic force in the
presence of the Schwarzschild black hole. These may merge to provide a
consistent holographic screen to define the entropic force on the stretched
horizon near the event horizon. Considering the similarity between the
stretched horizon of black hole and the entanglement system, we may define the
entropic force in the entanglement system without referring the source mass.
