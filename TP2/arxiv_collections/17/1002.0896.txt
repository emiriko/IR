We have investigated the isoscalar giant resonances in the Sn isotopes using
inelastic scattering of 386-MeV alpha-particles at extremely forward angles,
including 0deg. We have obtained completely "background-free
inelastic-scattering spectra for the Sn isotopes over the angular range
0deg--9deg and up to an excitation energy of 31.5 MeV. The strength
distributions for various multipoles were extracted by a multipole
decomposition analysis based on the expected angular distributions of the
respective multipoles. We find that the centroid energies of the isoscalar
giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) in the Sn isotopes are significantly lower
than the theoretical predictions. In addition, based on the ISGMR results, a
value of K_{tau} = -550 \pm 100 MeV is obtained for the asymmetry term in the
nuclear incompressibility. Constraints on interactions employed in nuclear
structure calculations are discussed on the basis of the
experimentally-obtained values for K_(infty) and K_(tau).
