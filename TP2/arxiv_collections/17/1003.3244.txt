For systems with three and four fermions within a single-j shell, analytical
expressions for the state energies are presented from a decomposition of the
angular momentum. In some important cases the expressions acquire a very simple
form. The expression may help us in understanding the structure of isomeric
states. The decomposition also makes it possible to construct the algebraic
condition for conservation of seniority.
