Attacks on cryptographic systems are limited by the available computational
resources. A theoretical understanding of these resource limitations is needed
to evaluate the security of cryptographic primitives and procedures. This study
uses an Attacker versus Environment game formalism based on computability logic
to quantify Shannon's work function and evaluate resource use in cryptanalysis.
A simple cost function is defined which allows to quantify a wide range of
theoretical and real computational resources. With this approach the use of
custom hardware, e.g., FPGA boards, in cryptanalysis can be analyzed. Applied
to real cryptanalytic problems, it raises, for instance, the expectation that
the computer time needed to break some simple 90 bit strong cryptographic
primitives might theoretically be less than two years.
