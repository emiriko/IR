We report on the discovery of a new heavily polluted white dwarf. The DAZ
white dwarf GALEX J193156.8+011745 was identified in a joint GALEX/GSC survey
of ultraviolet-excess objects. Optical spectra obtained at ESO NTT show strong
absorption lines of magnesium and silicon and a detailed abundance analysis
based on VLT-Kueyen UVES spectra reveal super-solar abundances of silicon and
magnesium, and near-solar abundances of oxygen, calcium, and iron. The overall
abundance pattern bears the signature of ongoing accretion onto the white dwarf
atmosphere. The infrared spectral energy distribution shows an excess in the H
and K bands likely associated with the accretion source.
