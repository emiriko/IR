We describe a general framework for regarding oracle-assisted quantum
algorithms as tools for discriminating between unitary transformations. We
apply this to the Deutsch-Jozsa problem and derive all possible quantum
algorithms which solve the problem with certainty using oracle unitaries in a
particular form. We also use this to show that any quantum algorithm that
solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem starting with a quantum system in a particular
class of initial, thermal equilibrium-based states of the type encountered in
solution state NMR can only succeed with greater probability than a classical
algorithm when the problem size exceeds $n \sim 10^5.$
