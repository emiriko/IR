Multiple outbursts of type Ia SNe in one galaxy present a unique opportunity
to study the homogeneity of these objects. NGC 3147 is only the second known
galaxy with three SNe Ia, another one is NGC 1316. We present CCD UBVRI
photometry for SN Ia 2008fv and compare the light and color curves of this
object with those for SNe Ia discovered earlier in NGC 3147: 1972H and 1997bq.
The photometric properties of SNe 1997bq and 2008fv are nearly identical, while
SN 1972H exhibits faster declining light curve.
