Critical analysis shows that all estimates of the velocity of the radio jets
of SS433 and the distance to the object based on the relativistic effect of
light travel time are not accurate enough to be conclusive. From our
elaboration of kinematics of knots in the radio jets in a sequence of images, a
kinematic model of the radio jets with a velocity of 0.20c is a little better
than one with the canonical velocity 0.26c observed actually in the optical and
X-ray jets of SS433. Consequently the distance to SS433 should be lowered to
4.3 kpc.
  Besides this difference in velocity, the shift of the radio jets in the
precession phase reveals itself in non-transient fashion, whereas it is not
observed in the optical jets. In light of these differences, the jets must have
two-component structure: with on-axis channel - optical jets, and low velocity
shell - radio jets.
