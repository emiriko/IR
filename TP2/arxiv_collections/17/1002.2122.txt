We have used the variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods to
calculate the energy, pair correlation function, static structure factor, and
momentum density of the ground state of the two-dimensional homogeneous
electron gas. We have used highly accurate Slater-Jastrow-backflow trial wave
functions and twist averaging to reduce finite-size effects where applicable.
We compare our results with others in the literature and construct a
local-density-approximation exchange-correlation functional for 2D systems.
