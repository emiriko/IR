The next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to top anti-top bottom
anti-bottom (tTbB) production at the LHC reveal that the scale choice adopted
in previous lowest-order simulations underestimates the tTbB cross section by a
factor two. We discuss a new dynamical scale that stabilizes the perturbative
predictions and describe the impact of the corrections on the shape of
distributions. We also account for the techniques employed to compute the
six-particle one-loop amplitudes with high CPU efficiency.
