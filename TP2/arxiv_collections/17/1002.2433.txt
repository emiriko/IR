We study the time evolution of the entropy of a collapsing charged spherical
domain wall, from the point of view of an asymptotic observer, by investigating
the entropy of the entire system (i.e. charged domain wall and radiation) and
induced radiation alone during the collapse. By taking the difference, we find
the entropy of the collapsing charged domain wall, since this is the object
which will form a black hole. We find that for large values of time (times
larger than $tf_-/R_+\approx8$), the entropy of the collapsing domain wall is a
constant, which is of the same order as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
