We use combinatorial description of bases of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's type
subspaces of standard modules of level 1 for affine Lie algebras of types
$A_\ell^{(1)}$ and $D_4^{(1)}$ to obtain character formulas. These descriptions
naturally lead to systems of recurrence relations for which we also find
solutions.
