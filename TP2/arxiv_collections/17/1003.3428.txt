We apply the no-core shell model to the nuclear structure of odd-mass nuclei
straddling $^{48}$Ca. Starting with the NN interaction, that fits two-body
scattering and bound state data we evaluate the nuclear properties of $A = 47$
and $A = 49$ nuclei while preserving all the underlying symmetries. Due to
model space limitations and the absence of 3-body interactions, we incorporate
phenomenological interaction terms determined by fits to $A = 48$ nuclei in a
previous effort. Our modified Hamiltonian produces reasonable spectra for these
odd mass nuclei. In addition to the differences in single-particle basis
states, the absence of a single-particle Hamiltonian in our no-core approach
complicates comparisons with valence effective NN interactions. We focus on
purely off-diagonal two-body matrix elements since they are not affected by
ambiguities in the different roles for one-body potentials and we compare
selected sets of $fp$-shell matrix elements of our initial and modified
Hamiltonians in the harmonic oscillator basis with those of a recent model
$fp$-shell interaction, the GXPF1 interaction of Honma, Otsuka, Brown and
Mizusaki. While some significant differences emerge from these comparisons,
there is an overall reasonably good correlation between our off-diagonal matrix
elements and those of GXPF1.
