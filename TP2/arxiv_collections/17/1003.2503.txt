The quest for Anderson localization of light is at the center of many
experimental and the- oretical activities. Atomic vapors play a particular role
in this research field, as they show a number of specific properties which
makes them quite different from other materials used to look for Anderson
localization. The very narrow resonance of the atomic line, the mechanical
effects of the light on the atoms and the potential for quantum features with
of these scatter- ers calls for more detailed analysis of the behavior of light
in large and dense samples of cold atoms.
