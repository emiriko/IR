We present a measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in
ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV using a data sample corresponding to
1.7/fb of integrated luminosity collected with the Collider Detector at
Fermilab. We reconstruct ttbar events in the lepton+jets channel. The dominant
background is the production of W bosons in association with multiple jets. To
suppress this background, we identify electrons from the semileptonic decay of
heavy-flavor jets. We measure a production cross section of 7.8 +/- 2.4 (stat)
+/- 1.6 (syst) +/- 0.5 (lumi) pb. This is the first measurement of the top pair
production cross section with soft electron tags in Run II of the Tevatron.
