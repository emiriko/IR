Characteristic functions contain complete information about all the moments
of a classical distribution and the same holds for the Fourier transform of the
Wigner function: a quantum characteristic function, or the chord function.
However, knowledge of a finite number of moments does not allow for accurate
determination of the chord function. For pure states this provides the overlap
of the state with all its possible rigid translations (or displacements). We
here present a semiclassical approximation of the chord function for large
Bohr-quantized states, which is accurate right up to a caustic, beyond which
the chord function becomes evanescent. It is verified to pick out blind spots,
which are displacements for zero overlaps. These occur even for translations
within a Planck area of the origin. We derive a simple approximation for the
closest blind spots, depending on the Schroedinger covariance matrix, which is
verified for Bohr-quantized states.
