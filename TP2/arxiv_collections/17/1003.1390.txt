The high reset current, IR, in unipolar resistance switching is an important
issue which should be resolved for practical applications in nonvolatile
memories. We showed that,during the forming and set processes, the compliance
current, Icomp, can work as a crucial parameter to reduce IR. Doping with Co or
Mn can significantly reduce the leakage current in capacitors made using SrTiOx
film, opening a larger operation window for Icomp. By decreasing Icomp with
acceptor doping, we could reduce IR in SrTiOx films by a factor of
approximately 20. Our work suggests that the decrease of Icomp by carrier
doping could be a viable alternative for reducing IR in unipolar resistance
switching.
