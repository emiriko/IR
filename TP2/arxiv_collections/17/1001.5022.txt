Planetary migration in standard models of gaseous protoplanetary disks is
known to be very rapid ($\sim 10^5$ years) jeopardizing the existence of
planetary systems. We present a new mechanism for significantly slowing rapid
planetary migration, discovered by means of radiative transfer calculations of
the thermal structure of protoplanetary disks irradiated by their central
stars. Rapid dust settling in a disk's dead zone - a region with very little
turbulence - leaves a dusty wall at its outer edge. We show that the
back-heating of the dead zone by this irradiated wall produces a positive
gradient of the disk temperature which acts as a thermal barrier to planetary
migration which persists for the disk lifetime. Although we analyze in detail
the migration of a Super-Earth in a low mass disk around an M star, our
findings can apply to wide variety of young planetary systems. We compare our
findings with other potentially important stopping mechanisms and show that
there are large parameter spaces for which dead zones are likely to play the
most important role for reproducing the observed mass-period relation in longer
planetary periods.
