The Casselman basis of Iwahori fixed vectors in a principal series
representation of a p-adic group G is dual to the standard intertwining
operators. To compute it one must compute a matrix m(u,v) indexed by pairs of
Weyl group elements. This matrix is upper triangular with respect to the Bruhat
order. In general this matrix is difficult to compute but it is shown that
certain elements have a nice expression. This is also true of the inverse
matrix to m(u,v). This leads to interesting conjectures regarding the Bruhat
order.
