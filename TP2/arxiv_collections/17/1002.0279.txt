Using the radiative return method, experiments at high luminosity
electron-positron colliders allow to explore the kaon and the pion form factors
in the time-like region up to fairly high energies. This opens the possibility
to study kaon and pion pair production at and around the narrow resonances
J/psi and psi(2S) and explore the interference between electromagnetic and
hadronic amplitudes. Parameterizations of charged and neutral kaon as well as
pion form factors are derived, which lead to an improved description of the
data in the region of large invariant masses of the meson pair. These form
factors are combined with the hadronic couplings of charged and neutral kaons
to J/psi and psi(2S) and implemented into the Monte Carlo generator PHOKHARA,
which is now, for the first time, able to simulate the production of narrow
resonances and their decay into kaon, pion and muon pairs.
