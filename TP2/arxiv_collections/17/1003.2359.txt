In his monumental discoveries, the driving force for Einstein was, I believe,
consistency of concept and principle rather than conflict with experiment.
Following this Einsteinian dictum, we would first argue that homogeneity
(universal character) of space and time characterizes 'no force' (absence of
force) and leads to existence of a universal velocity while inhomogeneity
(again a universal property) characterizes curved spacetime and presence of a
universal force which is present everywhere and always. The former gives rise
to Special Relativity while the latter to General Relativity.
