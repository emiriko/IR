The overall classification of X-ray jets has clung to that prevalent in the
radio: FRI vs. FRII (including quasars). Indeed, the common perception is that
X-ray emission from FRI's is synchrotron emission whereas that from FRII's may
be IC/CMB and/or synchrotron. Now that we have a sizable collection of sources
with detected X-ray emission from jets and hotspots, it seems that a more
unbiased study of these objects could yield additional insights on jets and
their X-ray emission. The current contribution is a first step in the process
of analyzing all of the relevant parameters for each detected component for the
sources collected in the XJET website. This initial effort involves measuring
the ratio of X-ray to radio fluxes and evaluating correlations with other jet
parameters. For single zone synchrotron X-ray emission, we anticipate that
larger values of fx/fr should correlate inversely with the average magnetic
field strength (if the acceleration process is limited by loss time equals
acceleration time). Beamed IC/CMB X-rays should produce larger values of fx/fr
for smaller values of the angle between the jet direction and the line of sight
but will also be affected by the low frequency radio spectral index.
