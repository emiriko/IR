We have investigated the effects of structure change and electron correlation
on SrTiO$_{3}$ single crystals using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.
We show that the cubic to tetragonal phase transition at 105$^\circ$K is
manifested by a charge transfer from in-plane ($d_{yz}$ and $d_{zx}$) bands to
out-of-plane ($d_{xy}$) band, which is opposite to the theoretical predictions.
Along this second-order phase transition, we find a smooth evolution of the
quasiparticle strength and effective masses. The in-plane band exhibits a
peak-dip-hump lineshape, indicating a high degree of correlation on a
relatively large (170 meV) energy scale, which is attributed to the polaron
formation.
