The Nikolaevskiy equation was originally proposed as a model for seismic
waves and is also a model for a wide variety of systems incorporating a
neutral, Goldstone mode, including electroconvection and reaction-diffusion
systems. It is known to exhibit chaotic dynamics at the onset of pattern
formation, at least when the dispersive terms in the equation are suppressed,
as is commonly the practice in previous analyses. In this paper, the effects of
reinstating the dispersive terms are examined. It is shown that such terms can
stabilise some of the spatially periodic traveling waves; this allows us to
study the loss of stability and transition to chaos of the waves. The secondary
stability diagram (Busse balloon) for the traveling waves can be remarkably
complicated.
