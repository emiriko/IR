In this paper we modified the Navier-Stokes equations by adding a higher
order artificial viscosity term to the conventional system. We first show that
the solution of the regularized system converges strongly to the solution of
the conventional system as the regularization parameter goes to zero, for each
dimension d $\le$ 4. Then we show that the use of this artificial viscosity
term leads to truncated the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time
behavior of the solutions to these equations. This result suggests that the
hyperviscous Navier-Stokes system is an interesting model for three-dimensional
fluid turbulence.
