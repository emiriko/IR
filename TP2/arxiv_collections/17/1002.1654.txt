This review presents the analysis of leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays
data done by the FlaviaNet Kaon Working group, as described in FlaviaNet Note
of October 2008. Data include all recent results by BNL-E865, KLOE, KTeV,
ISTRA+, and NA48. Experimental results are critically reviewed and combined,
taking into account theoretical (both analytical and numerical) constraints on
the semileptonic kaon form factors. We report on a very accurate determination
of Vus as well as on many other tests of the SM which can be performed with
leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays.
