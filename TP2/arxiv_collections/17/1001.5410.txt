Discovered in 1996 by BeppoSAX during a single type-I burst event, SAX
J1753.5-2349 was classified as "burst-only" source. Its persistent emission,
either in outburst or in quiescence, had never been observed before October
2008, when SAX J1753.5-2349 was observed for the first time in outburst. Based
on INTEGRAL observations,we present here the first high-energy emission study
(above 10 keV) of a so-called "burst-only". During the outburst the SAX
J1753.5-2349 flux decreased from 10 to 4 mCrab in 18-40 keV, while it was found
being in a constant low/hard spectral state. The broad-band (0.3-100 keV)
averaged spectrum obtained by combining INTEGRAL/IBIS and Swift/XRT data has
been fitted with a thermal Comptonisation model and an electron temperature >24
keV inferred. However, the observed high column density does not allow the
detection of the emission from the neutron star surface. Based on the whole set
of observations of SAX J1753.5-2349, we are able to provide a rough estimate of
the duty cycle of the system and the time-averaged mass-accretion rate. We
conclude that the low to very low luminosity of SAX J1753.5-2349 during
outburst may make it a good candidate to harbor a very compact binary system.
