We use recently acquired geomagnetic archival data to extend our long-term
reconstruction of the HMF strength. The 1835-2009 HMF series is based on an
updated and substantiated IDV series from 1872-onwards and on Bartels'
extension, by proxy, of his u-series from 1835-1871. The new IDV series, termed
IDV09, has excellent agreement (R^2 = 0.98; RMS = 0.3 nT) with the earlier
IDV05 series, and also with the negative component of Love's extended (to 1905)
Dst series (R^2 = 0.91). Of greatest importance to the community, in an area of
research that has been contentious, comparison of the extended HMF series with
other recent reconstructions of solar wind B for the last ~100 years yields a
strong consensus between series based on geomagnetic data. Differences exist
from ~1900-1910 but they are far smaller than the previous disagreement for
this key interval of low solar wind B values which closely resembles current
solar activity. Equally encouraging, a discrepancy with an HMF reconstruction
based on 10Be data for the first half of the 20th century has largely been
removed by a revised 10Be-based reconstruction published after we submitted
this paper, although a remaining discrepancy for the years ~1885-1905 will need
to be resolved.
