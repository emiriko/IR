Nowadays, the electric lighting is an important part of our lives and also
represents a significant part of the electric power consumption. Alternative
solutions such as renewable energy applied in this domain are thus welcomed.
This paper presents a workstation conceived for the study of photovoltaic solar
energy for lighting systems by students of power engineering and civil
engineering faculty. The proposed system is realized to study the generated
photovoltaic solar energy parameters for lighting systems. For an easier way to
study the most relevant parameters virtual instrumentation is implemented.
National Instruments LabWindows CVI environment is used as a platform for
virtual instrumentation. For future developments remote communication feature
intends to be added on which currently remote monitoring of solar photovoltaic
energy and electric energy parameters are monitored.
