Soft X-ray resonant scattering studies at the Mn $L_{\texttt{II, III}}$- and
the La $M_{\texttt{IV, V}}$- edges of single-crystal LaSr$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$ are
reported. At low temperatures, below $T_\texttt{N} \approx 160$ K, energy scans
with a fixed momentum transfer at the \emph{A}-type antiferromagnetic (0 0 1)
reflection around the Mn $L_{\texttt{II, III}}$-edges with incident linear
$\sigma$ and $\pi$ polarizations show strong resonant enhancements. The
splitting of the energy spectra around the Mn $L_{\texttt{II, III}}$-edges may
indicate the presence of a mixed valence state, e.g., Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$. The
relative intensities of the resonance and the clear shoulder-feature as well as
the strong incident $\sigma$ and $\pi$ polarization dependences strongly
indicate its complex electronic origin. Unexpected enhancement of the charge
Bragg (0 0 2) reflection at the La $M_{\texttt{IV, V}}$-edges with $\sigma$
polarization has been observed up to 300 K, with an anomaly appearing around
the orbital-ordering transition temperature, $T_{\texttt{OO}} \approx 220$ K,
suggesting a strong coupling (competition) between them.
