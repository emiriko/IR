We study the decay of a prepared state $E_0$ into a continuum {E_k} in the
case of non-Ohmic models. This means that the coupling is $|V_{k,0}| \propto
|E_k-E_0|^{s-1}$ with $s \ne 1$. We find that irrespective of model details
there is a universal generalized Wigner time $t_0$ that characterizes the
evolution of the survival probability $P_0(t)$. The generic decay behavior
which is implied by rate equation phenomenology is a slowing down stretched
exponential, reflecting the gradual resolution of the bandprofile. But
depending on non-universal features of the model a power-law decay might take
over: it is only for an Ohmic coupling to the continuum that we get a robust
exponential decay that is insensitive to the nature of the intra-continuum
couplings. The analysis highlights the co-existence of perturbative and
non-perturbative features in the dynamics. It turns out that there are special
circumstances in which $t_0$ is reflected in the spreading process and not only
in the survival probability, contrary to the naive linear response theory
expectation.
