We consider the evolution of a network of neurons, focusing on the asymptotic
behavior of spikes dynamics instead of membrane potential dynamics. The spike
response is not sought as a deterministic response in this context, but as a
conditional probability : "Reading out the code" consists of inferring such a
probability. This probability is computed from empirical raster plots, by using
the framework of thermodynamic formalism in ergodic theory. This gives us a
parametric statistical model where the probability has the form of a Gibbs
distribution. In this respect, this approach generalizes the seminal and
profound work of Schneidman and collaborators. A minimal presentation of the
formalism is reviewed here, while a general algorithmic estimation method is
proposed yielding fast convergent implementations. It is also made explicit how
several spike observables (entropy, rate, synchronizations, correlations) are
given in closed-form from the parametric estimation. This paradigm does not
only allow us to estimate the spike statistics, given a design choice, but also
to compare different models, thus answering comparative questions about the
neural code such as : "are correlations (or time synchrony or a given set of
spike patterns, ..) significant with respect to rate coding only ?" A numerical
validation of the method is proposed and the perspectives regarding spike-train
code analysis are also discussed.
