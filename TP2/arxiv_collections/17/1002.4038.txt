Based on the recent paper (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 216803, (2009)), we study
the nonequilibrium occupation number and charge susceptibility of a resonance
level close to a dissipative quantum phase transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type between a de-localized phase for weak dissipation
and a localized phase for strong dissipation. The resonance level is coupled to
two spinless fermionic baths with a finite bias voltage and an Ohmic bosonic
bath representing the dissipative environment. The system is equivalent to an
effective anisotropic Kondo model out of equilibrium. Within the nonequilibrium
Renormalization Group (RG) approach, we calculate nonequilibrium magnetization
and spin susceptibility in the effective Kondo model, corresponding to
occupation number and charge susceptibility of a resonance level, respectively.
We demonstrate the smearing of the KT transition in the nonequilibrium
magnetization as a function of the effective anisotropic Kondo couplings, in
contrast to a perfect jump in magnetization at the transition in equilibrium.
In the limit of large bias voltages, we find both quantities at the KT
transition and in the localized phase show deviations from the equilibrium
Curie-law behavior. As the system gets deeper in the localized phase, both
quantities decrease more rapidly to zero with increasing bias voltages.
