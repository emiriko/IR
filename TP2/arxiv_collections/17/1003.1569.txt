A body-centered tetragonal carbon (bct-Carbon) allotrope has been predicted
to be a transparent carbon polymorph obtained under pressure. The structural
transition pathways from graphite to diamond, M-Carbon, and bct-Carbon are
simulated and the lowest activation barrier is found for the graphite-bct
transition. Furthermore, bct-Carbon has higher shear strength than diamond due
to its perpendicular graphene-like structure. Our results provide a possible
explanation for the formation of a transparent carbon allotrope via the cold
compression of graphite. We also verify that this allotrope is hard enough to
crack diamond.
