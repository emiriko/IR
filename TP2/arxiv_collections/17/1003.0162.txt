We present a co-axial dual-core resonant leaky optical fibre design, in which
the outer core is made highly leaky. A suitable choice of parameters can enable
us to resonantly couple power from the inner core to the outer core. In a
large-core fibre, such a resonant coupling can considerably increase the
differential leakage loss between the fundamental and the higher order modes
and can result in effective single-mode operation. In a small-core single-mode
fibre, such a coupling can lead to sharp increase in the wavelength dependent
leakage loss near the resonant wavelength and can be utilized for the
suppression of amplified spontaneous emission and thereby gain equalization of
an optical amplifier. We study the propagation characteristics of the fibre
using the transfer matrix method and present an example of each, the
large-mode-area design for high power amplifiers and the wavelength tunable
leakage loss design for inherent gain equalization of optical amplifiers.
