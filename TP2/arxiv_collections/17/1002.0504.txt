We report the discovery of two new Milky Way satellites in the neighboring
constellations of Pisces and Pegasus identified in data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. Pisces II, an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy lies at the distance of ~180
kpc, some 15 degrees away from the recently detected Pisces I. Segue 3, an
ultra-faint star cluster lies at the distance of 16 kpc. We use deep follow-up
imaging obtained with the 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak National
Observatory to derive their structural parameters. Pisces II has a half-light
radius of ~60 pc, while Segue 3 is twenty times smaller at only 3pc.
