The influence of local oxidation in silicon nanowires on hole transport, and
hence the effect of varying the oxidation state of silicon atoms at the wire
surface, is studied using density functional theory in conjunction with a
Green's function scattering method. For silicon nanowires with growth direction
along [110] and diameters of a few nanometers, it is found that the
introduction of oxygen bridging and back bonds does not significantly degrade
hole transport for voltages up to several hundred millivolts relative to the
valence band edge. As a result, the mean free paths are comparable to or longer
than the wire lengths envisioned for transistor and other nanoelectronics
applications. Transport along [100]-oriented nanowires is less favorable, thus
providing an advantage in terms of hole mobilities for [110] nanowire
orientations, as preferentially produced in some growth methods.
