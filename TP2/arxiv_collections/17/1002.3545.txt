Momentum-conserving one-dimensional models are known to exhibit anomalous
Fourier's law, with a thermal conductivity varying as a power law of the system
size. Here we measure, by numerical simulations, several cumulants of the heat
flux of a one-dimensional hard particle gas. We find that the cumulants, like
the conductivity, vary as power laws of the system size. Our results also
indicate that cumulants higher than the second follow different power laws when
one compares the ring geometry at equilibrium and the linear case in contact
with two heat baths (at equal or unequal temperatures). keywords: current
