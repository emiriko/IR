We extend the quantum discord to continuous variable systems and evaluate
Gaussian quantum discord C(\rho) for bipartite Gaussian states. In particular,
for squeezed thermal states (STS), we explicitly maximize the extractable
information over Gaussian measurements: C(\rho) is minimized by a generalized
measurement rather than a projective one. Almost all STS have nonzero Gaussian
discord: they may be either separable or entangled if the discord is below the
threshold C(\rho)=1, whereas they are all entangled above the threshold. We
elucidate the general role of state parameters in determining the discord and
discuss its evolution in noisy channels.
