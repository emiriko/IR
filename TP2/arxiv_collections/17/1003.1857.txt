We describe application of Bogoliubov compensation principle to calculation
of non-perturbative contribution in the electroweak theory and QCD. We obtain
unique solutions of compensation equations, which impose strong restrictions on
parameters of theories and on functional dependence of corresponding
form-factors. We calculate value of running gauge electroweak coupling
$\alpha_w(M_W)=0.0374$, that differs from the experimental value less than by
10%. We derive effective Nambu-Jona-Lasinio interaction from fundamental QCD
and express its parameters in terms of initial QCD parameters: $\alpha_s$ at
low-momenta and current mass of light quarks. This leads to satisfactory
description of low-mass hadron physics.
