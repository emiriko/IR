We extend a recently developed galaxy morphology classification method,
Quantitative Multiwavelength Morphology (QMM), to connect galaxy morphologies
to their underlying physical properties. The traditional classification of
galaxies approaches the problem separately through either morphological
classification or, in more recent times, through analysis of physical
properties. A combined approach has significant potential in producing a
consistent and accurate classification scheme as well as shedding light on the
origin and evolution of galaxy morphology. Here we present an analysis of a
volume limited sample of 31703 galaxies from the fourth data release of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use an image analysis method called Pixel-z to
extract the underlying physical properties of the galaxies, which is then
quantified using the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness (CAS) parameters.
The galaxies also have their multiwavelength morphologies quantified using QMM,
and these results are then related to the distributed physical properties
through a regression analysis. We show that this method can be used to relate
the spatial distribution of physical properties with the morphological
properties of galaxies.
