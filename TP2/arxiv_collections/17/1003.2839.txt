Protein/Peptide microarrays are rapidly gaining momentum in the diagnosis of
cancer. High-density and highthroughput peptide arrays are being extensively
used to detect tumor biomarkers, examine kinase activity, identify antibodies
having low serum titers and locate antibody signatures. Improving the yield of
microarray fabrication involves solving a hard combinatorial optimization
problem called the Border Length Minimization Problem (BLMP). An important
question that remained open for the past seven years is if the BLMP is
tractable or not. We settle this open problem by proving that the BLMP is
NP-hard. We also present a hierarchical refinement algorithm which can refine
any heuristic solution for the BLMP problem. We also prove that the
TSP+1-threading heuristic is an O(N)- approximation. The hierarchical
refinement solver is available as an opensource code at
