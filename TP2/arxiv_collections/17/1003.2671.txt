A new model for the double well potential is presented in the paper. In the
new potential, the exchanging rate could be easily calculated by the
perturbation method in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. It gives good results
whether the barrier is high or sallow. The new model have many merits and may
be used in the double well problem.
