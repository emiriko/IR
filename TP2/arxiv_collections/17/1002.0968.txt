The central topic of this work is the categories of modules over unital
quantales. The main categorical properties are established and a special class
of operators, called Q-module transforms, is defined. Such operators - that
turn out to be precisely the homomorphisms between free objects in those
categories - find concrete applications in two different branches of image
processing, namely fuzzy image compression and mathematical morphology.
