We present an update on the NZ-wide advances in the field of Radio Astronomy
and Radio Engineering with a particular focus on contributions, not thus
reported elsewhere, which hope to either directly or indirectly contribute to
New Zealand's engagement with the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA)
project. We discuss the status of the SKA project in New Zealand with
particular reference to activities of the New Zealand Square Kilometre Array
Research and Development Consortium.
