We developed a method to calculate the magnetoresistance of magnetic
nanostructures. We discretize a magnetic disk in small cells and numerically
solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in order to obtain its
magnetization profile. We consider a anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) that
depends on the local magnetization as the main source of the magnetoresistance.
We then use it as an input to calculate the resistance and current distribution
numerically, using a relaxation method. We show how magnetoresistance
measurements can be useful to obtain information on the magnetic structure.
Additionally, we obtain non-homogeneous current distributions for different
magnetic configurations in static and dynamical regimes.
