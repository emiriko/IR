The crystal base of the modified quantized enveloping algebras of type
$A_{+\infty}$ or $A_\infty$ is realized as a set of integral bimatrices. It is
obtained by describing the decomposition of the tensor product of a highest
weight crystal and a lowest weight crystal into extremal weight crystals, and
taking its limit using a tableaux model of extremal weight crystals. This
realization induces in a purely combinatorial way a bicrystal structure of the
crystal base of the modified quantized enveloping algebras and hence its
Peter-Weyl type decomposition generalizing the classical RSK correspondence.
