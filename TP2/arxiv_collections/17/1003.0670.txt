In this paper, we examine in detail the key structural properties of high
redshift dark matter haloes as a function of their spin parameter. We perform
and analyze high resolution cosmological simulations of the formation of
structure in a LCDM Universe. We study the mass function, ellipticities,
shapes, density profiles, rotation curves and virialization for a large sample
of dark matter haloes from z = 15 - 6. We also present detailed convergence
tests for individual haloes. We find that high spin haloes have stronger
clustering strengths (up to 25%) at all mass and redshift ranges at these early
epochs. High redshift spherical haloes are also up to 50% more clustered than
aspherical haloes. High spin haloes at these redshifts are also preferentially
found in high density environments, and have more neighbors than their low spin
counterparts. We report a systematic offset in the peak of the circular
velocity curves for high and low spin haloes of the same mass. Therefore,
estimating halo masses without knowledge of the spin, using only the circular
velocity can yield errors of up to 40%. The strong dependence of key structural
properties on spin that we report here likely have important implications for
studies of star formation and feedback from these galaxies.
