We apply the recently developed triangular tessellation technique as
presented in [J. de Graaf et al., Phys. Rev. E 80, 051405 (2009)] to calculate
the free energy associated with the adsorption of anisotropic colloidal
particles at a flat interface. From the free-energy landscape, we analyze the
adsorption process, using a simplified version of Langevin dynamics. The
present result is a first step to understand the time-dependent behavior of
colloids near interfaces. This study shows a wide range of adsorption
trajectories, where the emphasis lies on a strong dependence of the dynamics on
the orientation of the colloid at initial contact with the interface. We
believe that the observed orientational dependence in our simple model can be
recovered in suitable experimental systems.
