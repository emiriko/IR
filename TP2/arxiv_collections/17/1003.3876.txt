Coupled structural and electronic phase transitions underlie the
multifunctional properties of strongly-correlated materials. For example,
colossal magnetoresistance1,2 in manganites involves phase transition from
paramagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal linked to a structural
Jahn-Teller distortion3. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) likewise exhibits an
insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) at ~67oC with abrupt changes in transport
and optical properties and coupled to a structural phase transition (SPT) from
monoclinic to tetragonal4. The IMT and SPT hystereses are signatures of
first-order phase transition tracking the nucleation to stabilization of a new
phase. Here we have for the first time measured independently the IMT and SPT
hystereses in epitaxial VO2 films, and shown that the hystereses are not
congruent. From the measured volume fractions of the two phases in the region
of strong correlation, we have computed the evolving dielectric function under
an effective-medium approximation. But the computed dielectric functions could
not reproduce the measured IMT, implying that there is a strongly correlated
metallic phase that is not in the stable rutile structure, consistent with
Qazilbash et al5. Search for a corresponding macroscopic structural
intermediate also yielded negative result.
