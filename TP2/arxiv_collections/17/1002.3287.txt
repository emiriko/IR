We demonstrate that the introduction of a subwavelength periodic modulation
into a metallic structure strongly modifies the guiding characteristics of the
surface plasmon modes supported by the system. Moreover, it is also shown how a
new type of a tightly confined surface plasmon polariton mode can be created by
just milling a periodic corrugation into a metallic ridge placed on top of a
metal surface.
