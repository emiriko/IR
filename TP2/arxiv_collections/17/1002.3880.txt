Diffraction patterns of electrons are believed to resemble those of
electromagnetic waves (EMW). I performed a series of experiments invoked to
show that the periodicity of peaks in the diffraction diagram of electrons is
concerned with the periodicity of the arrangement of scattering centers in the
diffraction grating in combination with the supposed character of the spatial
structure of the electron as a system of regularly spaced concentric shells of
elasticity. I started from the experiment on the diffraction of electrons and
EMWs at the sharp edge of the opaque half-plane. This simple scattering
configuration enabled me to discriminate between the re-radiation mechanism of
the wave diffraction and ricochet scattering of electrons on the edge of the
half-plane. Then I made experiments with scattering on composite objects
proceeding step by step from a single straight edge to a couple of edges (one
slit) and then to four edges (two slits). Thus I succeeded in interpretation of
the double-slit diffraction (four straight edges) in terms of the scattering on
a single edge. I managed also to observe the electron's trajectory. Equipping
the slit's edge with a semiconductor sensors I registered the passing of the
electron through the slit detecting simultaneously a weaker signal at another
slit. This technique appeared not to destroy or disturb the "interference"
pattern. Closing one slit by inserting therein a transparent for EMWs piece of
dielectric I have found that the scattering pattern beneath this slit vanishes
while the scattering pattern under the open slit remains as before when both
slits were open. This experiment indicates that the electron "interferes" with
its electromagnetic component passed via the slit plugged by the transparent
for it dielectric.
