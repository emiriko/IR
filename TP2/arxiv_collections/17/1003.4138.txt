In this paper, we demonstrate that interleaved sampling techniques can be
used to characterize the Hamiltonian of a qubit and its environmental
decoherence rate. The technique offers a significant advantage in terms of the
number of measurements that are required to characterize a qubit. When compared
to the standard Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate, the saving in the total
measurement time for the interleaved method is approximately proportional to
the ratio of the sample rates.
