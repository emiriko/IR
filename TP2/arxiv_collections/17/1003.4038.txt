The CMS collaboration used the past year to greatly improve the level of
detector readiness for the first collisions data. The acquired operational
experience over this year, large gains in understanding the detector and
improved preparedness for early physics will be instrumental in minimizing the
time from the first collisions to first LHC physics. The following describes
the status of the CMS experiment and outlines early physics plans with the
first LHC data.
