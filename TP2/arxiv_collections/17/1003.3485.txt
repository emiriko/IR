We derive an analytical expression for the count probability of a single
photon detector for a wide range of input optical power that includes
afterpulsing effects. We confirm the validity of the expression by fitting it
to the data obtained from a saturated commercial Single Photon Detector by
illuminating it with a cw laser. Detector efficiency and afterpulsing
probability extracted from the fits agree with the manufacture specs for low
repetition frequencies.
