In this paper the authors describe a theoretical simple statistical modelling
of relaxation process in metal-oxide semiconductor devices that governs its
degradation. Basically, starting from an initial state where a given number of
traps are occupied, the dynamics of the relaxation process is measured
calculating the density of occupied traps and its fluctuations (second moment)
as function of time. Our theoretical results show a universal logarithmic law
for the density of occupied traps $\bar{<n(t)>} \sim \phi (T,E_{F}) (A+B \ln
t)$, i.e., the degradation is logarithmic and its amplitude depends on the
temperature and Fermi Level of device. Our approach reduces the work to the
averages determined by simple binomial sums that are corroborated by our Monte
Carlo simulations and by experimental results from literature, which bear in
mind enlightening elucidations about the physics of degradation of
semiconductor devices of our modern life.
