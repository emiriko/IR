Two most outstanding questions are puzzling the world of neutrino Physics:
the possible Majorana nature of neutrinos and their absolute mass scale. Direct
neutrino mass measurements and neutrinoless double beta decay (0nuDBD) are the
present strategy to solve the puzzle. Neutrinoless double beta decay violates
lepton number by two units and can occurr only if neutrinos are massive
Majorana particles. A positive observation would therefore necessarily imply a
new regime of physics beyond the standard model, providing fundamental
information on the nature of the neutrinos and on their absolute mass scale.
After the observation of neutrino oscillations and given the present knowledge
of neutrino masses and mixing parameters, a possibility to observe 0nuDBDD at a
neutrino mass scale in the range 10-50 meV could actually exist. This is a real
challenge faced by a number of new proposed projects. Present status and future
perpectives of neutrinoless double-beta decay experimental searches is
reviewed. The most important parameters contributing to the experimental
sensitivity are outlined. A short discussion on nuclear matrix element
calculations is also given. Complementary measurements to assess the absolute
neutrino mass scale (cosmology and single beta decays) are also discussed.
