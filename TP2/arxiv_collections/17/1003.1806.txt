When Bluetooth devices come within the range of another, an electronic
conversation takes place to determine whether the devices in range are known or
whether one needs to control the other. Most Bluetooth devices do not require
any form of user interaction for this to occur. If devices within range are
known to one another, the devices automatically form a network known as a
pairing. Authentication addresses the identity of each communicating device.
The sender sends an encrypted authentication request frame to the receiver. The
receiver sends an encrypted challenge frame back to the sender. Both perform a
predefined algorithm. The sender sends its findings back to the receiver, which
in turn either allows or denies the connection. There are three different
functions for authentication in Bluetooth-E1, E2, and E3. E1 is used when
encrypting the authorization challenge-response values.E2 is for generating
different link keys.E3 is used when creating the encryption key.
