Recent studies have pointed out the importance of transient synchronization
between widely distributed neural assemblies to understand conscious
perception. These neural assemblies form intricate networks of neurons and
synapses whose detailed map for mammals is still unknown and far from our
experimental capabilities. Only in a few cases, for example the C. elegans, we
know the complete mapping of the neuronal tissue or its mesoscopic level of
description provided by cortical areas. Here we study the process of transient
and global synchronization using a simple model of phase-coupled oscillators
assigned to cortical areas in the cerebral cat cortex. Our results highlight
the impact of the topological connectivity in the developing of
synchronization, revealing a transition in the synchronization organization
that goes from a modular decentralized coherence to a centralized synchronized
regime controlled by a few cortical areas forming a Rich-Club connectivity
pattern.
