We study the structure of the electronic states and the transport properties
of a Kronig-Penney model with weak compositional and structural disorder. Using
a perturbative approach we obtain an analytical expression for the localisation
length which is valid for disorder with arbitrary correlations. We show how to
generate disorder with self- and cross-correlations and we analyse both the
known delocalisation effects of the long-range self-correlations and new
effects produced by cross-correlations. We finally discuss how both kinds of
correlations alter the transport properties in Kronig-Penney models of finite
size.
