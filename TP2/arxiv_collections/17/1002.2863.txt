The bright short-hard GRB 090510 was observed by both Swift and Fermi
telescopes. The study of the prompt emission by Fermi revealed an additional
high-energy spectral component, the largest lower limit ever on the bulk
Lorentz factor in a short GRB jet, and brought the most stringent constraint
ever on linear Lorentz invariance violation models. The fast repoint and
follow-up by both telescopes allowed the first multiwavelength study of a GRB
afterglow from optical range to several GeV. This long-lived emission has been
studied in the framework of the internal shock and external shock models.
