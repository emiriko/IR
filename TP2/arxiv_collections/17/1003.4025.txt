We investigate in more detail the two-state free convolution semigroups of
pairs of measures whose Jacobi parameters are linear in the convolution
parameter $t$. These semigroups were constructed in arXiv:1001.1540, where we
also showed that measures with the analogous property for the usual and free
convolution are exactly the classical, resp. free Meixner classes. The class of
measures in this paper has not been considered explicitly before, but we show
that it also has Meixner-type properties. Specifically, it appears in limit
theorems, has a Laha-Lukacs-type characterization, and is related to the $q=0$
case of quadratic harnesses.
