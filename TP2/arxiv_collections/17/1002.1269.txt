We investigate pattern speeds in spiral galaxies where the structure is
induced by an interaction with a companion galaxy. We perform calculations
modeling the response of the stellar and/or gaseous components of a disc.
Generally we do not find a unique pattern speed in these simulations, rather
the pattern speed decreases with radius, and the pattern speed for individual
spiral arms differ. The maximum pattern speed is ~20 km/s/kpc for the discs
with a live stellar component, decreasing to 5 km/s/kpc at the edge of the
spiral perturbation. When only the gas is modeled, Omega_p is typically very
low (5 km/s/kpc) at all radii.
