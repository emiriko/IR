We study classical open string solutions with a null polygonal boundary in
AdS_3 in relation to gluon scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills at
strong coupling. We derive in full detail the set of integral equations
governing the decagonal and the dodecagonal solutions and identify them with
the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations of the homogeneous sine-Gordon models.
By evaluating the free energy in the conformal limit we compute the central
charges, from which we observe general correspondence between the polygonal
solutions in AdS_n and generalized parafermions.
