Five different methods which can be used to analytically calculate entropies
that are nonconcave as functions of the energy in the thermodynamic limit are
discussed and compared. The five methods are based on the following ideas and
techniques: i) microcanonical contraction, ii) metastable branches of the free
energy, iii) generalized canonical ensembles with specific illustrations
involving the so-called Gaussian and Betrag ensembles, iv) restricted canonical
ensemble, and v) inverse Laplace transform. A simple long-range spin model
having a nonconcave entropy is used to illustrate each method.
