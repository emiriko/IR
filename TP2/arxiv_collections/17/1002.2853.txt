We use two simulations performed within the Constrained Local UniversE
Simulation (CLUES) project to study both the shape and radial alignment of (the
dark matter component of) subhaloes; one of the simulations is a dark matter
only model while the other run includes all the relevant gas physics and star
formation recipes. We find that the involvement of gas physics does not have a
statistically significant effect on either property -- at least not for the
most massive subhaloes considered in this study. However, we observe in both
simulations including and excluding gasdynamics a (pronounced) evolution of the
dark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal since
infall time. Further, this evolution is different when positioned in the
central and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend to
become more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, the
radial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outer
parts. We confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact that
subhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.
