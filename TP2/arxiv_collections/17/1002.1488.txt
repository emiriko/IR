We use data from large surveys of the local Universe (SDSS+Galaxy Zoo) to
show that the galaxy-black hole connection is linked to host morphology at a
fundamental level. The fraction of early-type galaxies with actively growing
black holes, and therefore the AGN duty cycle, declines significantly with
increasing black hole mass. Late-type galaxies exhibit the opposite trend: the
fraction of actively growing black holes increases with black hole mass.
