We consider possible experimental tests of recent hypotheses suggesting that
TeV photons survive the pair production interaction with extragalactic
background light over cosmological distances by converting to axion-like
particles (ALPs) in galactic magnetic fields. We show that proposed giant
ultra-low background scintillation detectors will even have a difficult time
reaching the present CAST sensitivity, which is one to two orders of magnitude
less sensitive than necessary for a meaningful test of the ALP-photon
oscillation hypothesis. Potential alternative tests are briefly discussed.
