The seesaw mechanism is conceived on the basis that a mass scale, $\xi$, and
a dimensionless scale, $s$, can be fine-tuned in order to control the dynamics
of active and sterile neutrinos through cosmon-type equations of motion: the
seesaw cosmon equations. This allows for sterile neutrinos to be a dark matter
candidate. In this scenario, the dynamical masses and energy densities of
active and sterile neutrinos can be consistently embedded into the generalized
Chaplygin gas (GCG), the unified dark sector model. In addition, dark matter
adiabatically coupled to dark energy allows for a natural decoupling of the
(active) mass varying neutrino (MaVaN) component from the dark sector. Thus
MaVaN's turn into a secondary effect. Through the scale parameters, $\xi$ and
$s$, the proposed scenario allows for a convergence among three distinct
frameworks: the cosmon scenario, the seesaw mechanism for mass generation and
the GCG model. It is found that the equation of state of the perturbations is
the very one of the GCG background cosmology so that all the results from this
approach are maintained, being smoothly modified by active neutrinos.
Constrained by the seesaw relations, it is shown that the mass varying
mechanism is responsible for the stability against linear perturbations and is
indirectly related to the late time cosmological acceleration.
