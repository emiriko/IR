We study the entropy of Kerr-Sen black hole of heterotic string theory beyond
semiclassical approximations. Applying the properties of exact differentials
for three variables to the first law thermodynamics we derive the corrections
to the entropy of the black hole. The leading (logarithmic) and non leading
corrections to the area law are obtained.
