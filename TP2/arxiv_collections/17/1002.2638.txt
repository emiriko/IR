The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the enduring
mysteries of high-energy astrophysics. To investigate this, we cross-correlate
the recently released Fermi Large Area Telescope First Source Catalog (1FGL)
with the public sample of UHECRs made available by the Pierre Auger
collaboration. Of the 27 UHECRs in the sample, we find 12 events that arrived
within 3.1 degrees of Fermi sources. However, we find similar or larger number
of matches in 63 out of 100 artificial UHECR samples constructed using
positions randomly drawn from the BATSE 4B catalog of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
collected from 1991 until 1996. Based on our analysis, we find no evidence that
UHECRs are associated with Fermi sources. We conclude with some remarks about
the astrophysical origin of cosmic rays.
