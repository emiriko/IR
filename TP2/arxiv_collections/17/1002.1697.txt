We use a tight binding approach and density functional theory calculations to
study the band structure of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride bilayer system in
the most stable configuration. We show that an electric field applied in the
direction perpendicular to the layers significantly modifies the electronic
structure of the whole system, including shifts, anticrossing and other
deformations of bands, which can allow to control the value of the energy gap.
It is shown that band structure of biased system may be tailored for specific
requirements of nanoelectronics applications. The carriers' mobilities are
expected to be higher than in the bilayer graphene devices.
