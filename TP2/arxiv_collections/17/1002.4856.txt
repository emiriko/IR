We report the results from observations of H30$\alpha$ line emission in Sgr A
West with the Submillimeter Array at a resolution of 2\arcsec and a field of
view of about 40\arcsec. The H30$\alpha$ line is sensitive to the high-density
ionized gas in the minispiral structure. We compare the velocity field obtained
from H30$\alpha$ line emission to a Keplerian model, and our results suggest
that the supermassive black hole at Sgr A* dominates the dynamics of the
ionized gas. However, we also detect significant deviations from the Keplerian
motion, which show that the impact of strong stellar winds from the massive
stars along the ionized flows and the interaction between Northern and Eastern
arms play significant roles in the local gas dynamics.
