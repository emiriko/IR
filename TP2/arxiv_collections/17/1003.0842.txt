In graphene, after the electric field is turned-on, the ballistic
acceleration of charge carriers up to the monochromatic optic phonon energy
generates a back-and-forth motion of the whole distribution function between
the zero point energy and the phonon energy. This effect is predicted to
manifest in damped terahertz oscillations of the carrier drift velocity and
average energy. The most dramatic feature of this transient phenomenon is the
onset of momentum-free areas surrounded by high momentum probability in phase
space, and smooth steps or terraces in the distribution function. This
dynamical effect that only takes place within a voltage and sample length
window, is the direct consequence of the interplay between the electric force
and the randomizing nature of deformation potential optic phonons in the linear
band structure of graphene.
