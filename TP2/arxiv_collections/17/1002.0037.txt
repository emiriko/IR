We measure the temperature of a mesoscopic system consisting of an
ultra-dilute two dimensional electron gas at the $Si/SiO_2$ interface in a
metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) quantum dot by means
of the capture and emission of an electron in a point defect close to the
interface. Contrarily to previous reports, we show that the capture and
emission by point defects in Si n-MOSFETs can be temperature dependent down to
800 mK. As the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble model applies, the time
domain charge fluctuation in the defect is used to determine the temperature of
the few electron gas in the channel.
