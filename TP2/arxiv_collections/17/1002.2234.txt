Previously, we have presented a methodology to extend canonical Monte Carlo
methods inspired on a suitable extension of the canonical fluctuation relation
$C=\beta^{2}<\delta E^{2}>$ compatible with negative heat capacities $C<0$.
Now, we improve this methodology by introducing a better treatment of finite
size effects affecting the precision of a direct determination of the
microcanonical caloric curve $\beta (E) =\partial S(E) /\partial E$, as well as
a better implementation of MC schemes. We shall show that despite the
modifications considered, the extended canonical MC methods possibility an
impressive overcome of the so-called \textit{super-critical slowing down}
observed close to the region of a temperature driven first-order phase
transition. In this case, the dependence of the decorrelation time $\tau$ with
the system size $N$ is reduced from an exponential growth to a weak power-law
behavior $\tau(N)\propto N^{\alpha}$, which is shown in the particular case of
the 2D seven-state Potts model where the exponent $\alpha=0.14-0.18$.
