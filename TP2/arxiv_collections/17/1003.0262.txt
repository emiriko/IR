We report electrical resistivity measurements and neutron diffraction studies
under magnetic fields of
Bi$_{1.75}$Pb$_{0.35}$Sr$_{1.90}$Cu$_{0.91}$Fe$_{0.09}$O$_{6+y}$, in which hole
carriers are overdoped. This compound shows short-range incommensurate magnetic
correlation with incommensurability $\delta=0.21$, whereas a Fe-free compound
shows no magnetic correlation. Resistivity shows an up turn at low temperature
in the form of $ln(1/T)$ and shows no superconductivity. We observe reduction
of resistivity by applying magnetic fields (i.e., a negative magnetoresistive
effect) at temperatures below the onset of short-range magnetic correlation.
Application of magnetic fields also suppresses the Fe induced incommensurate
magnetic correlation. We compare and contrast these observations with two
different models: 1) stripe order, and 2) dilute magnetic moments in a metallic
alloy, with associated Kondo behavior. The latter picture appears to be more
relevant to the present results.
