Adiabatic frequency tuning of finite-lifetime-nanocavity electromagnetic
modes affects also their quality-factor (Q). Perturbative Q change resulting
from (real) frequency tuning, is a controllable parameter. Here, the influence
of dielectric constant modulation (DCM) on cavity resonances is presented, by
first order perturbation analysis for a 3D cavity with radiation losses.
Semi-analytical expressions for DCM induced cavity mode frequency and Q changes
are derived. The obtained results are in good agreement with numerical
calculations.
