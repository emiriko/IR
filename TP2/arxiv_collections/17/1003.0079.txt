Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy
when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple
kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support
interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this 1-norm MKL is rarely
observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow
for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new
insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and
develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms,
like p-norms with p>1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved
optimization strategies are much faster compared to the commonly used wrapper
approaches. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artificial
data experiment sheds light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and
$\ell_\infty$-norm MKL in various scenarios. Empirical applications of p-norm
MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that
non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art.
