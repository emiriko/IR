We present the results of an analysis of hard X-ray observations of the C2.7
solar flare detected by the RT-2 Experiment onboard the Coronas - Photon
satellite. We detect hard X-ray pulsations at periods of ~12 s and ~15 s. We
find a marginal evidence for a decrease in period with time. We have augmented
these results using the publicly available data from the RHESSI satellite. We
present a spectral analysis and measure the spectral parameters.
