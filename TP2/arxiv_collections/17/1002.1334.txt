Heat capacity and magnetic torque measurements are used to probe the
anisotropic temperature-field phase diagram of the frustrated spin dimer
compound Ba3Mn2O8 in the field range from 0T to 18T. For fields oriented along
the c axis a single magnetically ordered phase is found in this field range,
whereas for fields oriented along the a axis two distinct phases are observed.
The present measurements reveal a surprising non-monotonic evolution of the
phase diagram as the magnetic field is rotated in the [001]-[100] plane. The
angle dependence of the critical field (Hc1) that marks the closing of the spin
gap can be quantitatively accounted for using a minimal spin Hamiltonian
comprising superexchange between nearest and next nearest Mn ions, the Zeeman
energy and single ion anisotropy. This Hamiltonian also predicts a
non-monotonic evolution of the transition between the two ordered states as the
field is rotated in the a-c plane. However, the observed effect is found to be
significantly larger in magnitude, implying that either this minimal spin
Hamiltonian is incomplete or that the magnetically ordered states have a
slightly different structure than previously proposed.
