We obtained X-ray XMM-Newton observations of the open cluster Berkeley 87 and
the massive star-forming region (SFR) ON 2. In addition, archival infrared
Spitzer Space Telescope observations were used. It is likely that the SFR ON 2
and Berkeley 87 are at the same distance, 1.23 kpc, and hence are associated.
The XMM-Newton observations detected X-rays from massive stars in Berkeley 87
as well as diffuse emission from the SFR ON 2. The two patches of diffuse X-ray
emission are encompassed in the shell-like H II region GAL 75.84+0.40 in the
northern part of ON 2 and in the ON 2S region in the southern part of ON 2. The
diffuse emission from GAL 75.84+0.40 suffers an absorption column equivalent to
A_V approx. 28 mag. Its spectrum can be fitted either with a thermal plasma
model at T < 30 MK or by an absorbed power-law model with gamma; approx. -2.6.
The X-ray luminosity of GAL 75.84+0.40 is L_X approx. 6 10^31 erg/s. The
diffuse emission from ON 2S is adjacent to the ultra-compact H II (UCHII)
region Cygnus 2N, but does not coincide with it or with any other known UCHII
region. It has a luminosity of L_X approx. 4 10^31 erg/s. The spectrum can be
fitted with an absorbed power-law model with gamma; approx.-1.4. We adopt the
view of Turner and Forbes (1982) that the SFR ON 2 is physically associated
with the massive star cluster Berkeley 87 hosting the WO type star WR 142. We
discuss different explanations for the apparently diffuse X-ray emission in
these SFRs. These include synchrotron radiation, invoked by the co-existence of
strongly shocked stellar winds and turbulent magnetic fields in the
star-forming complex, cluster wind emission, or an unresolved population of
discrete sources.
