It is shown that, the wavelet regression detrended fluctuations of the
reconstructed temperature for the past 400,000 years (Antarctic ice cores data)
are completely dominated by one-third subharmonic resonance, presumably related
to Earth precession effect on the energy that the intertropical regions receive
from the Sun. Effects of Galactic turbulence on the temperature fluctuations
are also discussed. Direct evidence of chaotic response of the atmospheric CO_2
dynamics to obliquity periodic forcing has been found in a reconstruction of
atmospheric CO_2 data (deep sea proxies), for the past 650,000 years.
