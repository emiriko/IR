In this paper we calculate the energy distribution of some charged black
holes in generalized dilaton-axion gravity. The solutions correspond to charged
black holes arising in a Kalb-Ramond-dilaton background and some existing
non-rotating black hole solutions are recovered in special cases. We focus our
study to asymptotically flat and asymptotically non-flat types of solutions and
resort for this purpose to the M{\o}ller prescription. Various aspects of
energy are also analyzed.
