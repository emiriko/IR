The ability to unconditionally verify the location of a communication
receiver would lead to a wide range of new security paradigms. However, it is
known that unconditional location verification in classical communication
systems is impossible. In this work we show how unconditional location
verification can be achieved with the use of quantum communication channels.
Our verification remains unconditional irrespective of the number of receivers,
computational capacity, or any other physical resource held by an adversary.
Quantum location verification represents a new application of quantum
entanglement that delivers a feat not possible in the classical-only channel.
For the first time, we possess the ability to deliver real-time communications
viable only at specified geographical coordinates.
