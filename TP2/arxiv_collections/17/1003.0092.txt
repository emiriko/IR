We report the observation of a pronounced dip in the in-plane field (H//)
dependence of the critical current density Jc(H) and a peak in resistance R(H)
of a NbN-HoNi5 bilayer at temperatures below the magnetic ordering temperature
(TCurie ~ 5.5 K) of HoNi5, which is lower than the onset temperature (~ 9 K) of
superconductivity in the NbN layer. The extrema in Jc(H) and R(H) appear at
fields much below the upper critical field of NbN. It is suggested that the
origin of this feature is linked with the non-collinear magnetization of HoNi5
whose normal component assists in depairing of Pearl vortex-antivortex pairs in
the system. A spin reorientation transition driven by the H// diminishes this
normal component and consequently the excess dissipation.
