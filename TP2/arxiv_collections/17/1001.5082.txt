Simulation results for head-on collisions of equal-sized spherical polymer
nanodroplets using molecular dynamics are presented. Elastic behavior of an
initial compressed phase for the colliding droplets is analyzed. Deformations
and contact radii of the nanodroplets are compared with the Hertzian model of
elastic solid balls. It is found that at least the initial phase of collision
can be explained by this continuum model, except at the very moment of the
beginning of collision.
