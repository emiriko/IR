Angular momentum transport owing to hydrodynamic turbulent convection is
studied using local three dimensional numerical simulations employing the
shearing box approximation. We determine the turbulent viscosity from
non-rotating runs over a range of values of the shear parameter and use a
simple analytical model in order to extract the non-diffusive contribution
(Lambda-effect) to the stress in runs where rotation is included. Our results
suggest that the turbulent viscosity is of the order of the mixing length
estimate and weakly affected by rotation. The Lambda-effect is non-zero and a
factor of 2-4 smaller than the turbulent viscosity in the slow rotation regime.
We demonstrate that for Keplerian shear, the angular momentum transport can
change sign and be outward when the rotation period is greater than the
turnover time, i.e. when the Coriolis number is below unity. This result seems
to be relatively independent of the value of the Rayleigh number.
