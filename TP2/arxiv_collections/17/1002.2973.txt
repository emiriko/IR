In this paper we revisit the issue of the propagation of warps in thin and
viscous accretion discs. In this regime warps are know to propagate
diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient approximately inversely proportional
to the disc viscosity. Previous numerical investigations of this problem
(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical
results and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both
in the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,
low-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high
resolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,
implementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the
origin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new
and improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory
both in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion
coefficient and precession rate. It is worth noting that the resulting
diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the disc viscosity only for
small amplitude warps and small values of the disc $\alpha$ coefficient
($\alpha < 0.1$). For non-linear warps, the diffusion coefficient is a function
of both radius and time, and is significantly smaller than the standard value.
Warped accretion discs are present in many contexts, from protostellar discs to
accretion discs around supermassive black holes. In all such cases, the exact
value of the warp diffusion coefficient may strongly affect the evolution of
the system and therefore its careful evaluation is critical in order to
correctly estimate the system dynamics (abridged).
