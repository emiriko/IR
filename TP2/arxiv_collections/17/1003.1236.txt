Let f be a polynomial of degree at least 2 with coefficients in a number
field K, let x_0 be a sufficiently general element of K, and let alpha be a
root of f. We give precise conditions under which Newton iteration, started at
the point x_0, converges v-adically to the root alpha for infinitely many
places v of K. As a corollary we show that if f is irreducible over K of degree
at least 3, then Newton iteration converges v-adically to any given root of f
for infinitely many places v. We also conjecture that the set of places for
which Newton iteration diverges has full density and give some heuristic and
numerical evidence.
