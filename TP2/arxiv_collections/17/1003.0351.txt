We present Spitzer MIPS observations at 24 um of 37 solar-type stars in the
Pleiades and combine them with previous observations to obtain a sample of 71
stars. We report that 23 stars, or 32 +/- 6.8%, have excesses at 24 um at least
10% above their photospheric emission. We compare our results with studies of
debris disks in other open clusters and with a study of A stars to show that
debris disks around solar-type stars at 115 Myr occur at nearly the same rate
as around A-type stars. We analyze the effects of binarity and X-ray activity
on the excess flux. Stars with warm excesses tend not to be in equal-mass
binary systems, possibly due to clearing of planetesimals by binary companions
in similar orbits. We find that the apparent anti-correlations in the incidence
of excess and both the rate of stellar rotation and also the level of activity
as judged by X-ray emission are statistically weak.
