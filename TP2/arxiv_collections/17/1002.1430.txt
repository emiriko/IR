Superconductivity in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ is unconventional, believed to be of
$p_{x}\pm ip_{y}$ pairing symmetry. These two degenerate order parameters allow
the formation of chiral domains separated by domain walls. In a Josephson
junction formed on the edge of a single crystal of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, the
chiral domains can create a variation of the phase in the tunneling direction
causing interference effects which suppress and modulate the critical current
of the junction. Cooling the junction in a magnetic field lifts the degeneracy
between the order parameter states and induces a preferential chirality,
significantly modifying the phase interference. We present experimental results
on Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$/Cu/Pb Josephson junctions cooled in a magnetic field
showing a dramatic enhancement of their critical current, giving direct
evidence for the presence of chiral domains and their alignment in a magnetic
field.
