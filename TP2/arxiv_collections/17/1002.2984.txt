A point of an algebraic curve of genus g is subcanonical if some regular
differential vanishes only at that point, with multiplicity 2g-2. Subcanonical
points are Weierstrass points, and we compute the associated gap sequence at a
general point of each component of the moduli space of curves with marked
subcanonical point. We also construct subcanonical points with other gap
sequences as ramification points of certain cyclic covers.
