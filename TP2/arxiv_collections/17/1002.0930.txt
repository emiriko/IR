We present a unified framework for the declarative analysis of structured
communications. By relying on a (timed) concurrent constraint programming
language, we show that in addition to the usual operational techniques from
process calculi, the analysis of structured communications can elegantly
exploit logic-based reasoning techniques. We introduce a declarative
interpretation of the language for structured communications proposed by Honda,
Vasconcelos, and Kubo. Distinguishing features of our approach are: the
possibility of including partial information (constraints) in the session
model; the use of explicit time for reasoning about session duration and
expiration; a tight correspondence with logic, which formally relates session
execution and linear-time temporal logic formulas.
