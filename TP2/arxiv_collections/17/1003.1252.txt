We investigate Galactic bulge planetary nebulae without emission-line central
stars for which peculiar infrared spectra have been obtained with the Spitzer
Space Telescope, including the simultaneous signs of oxygen and carbon based
dust. Three separate sub-groups can be defined characterized by the different
chemical composition of the dust and the presence of crystalline and amorphous
silicates.
  We find that the classification based on the dust properties is reflected in
the more general properties of these planetary nebulae. However, some observed
properties are difficult to relate to the common view of planetary nebulae. In
particular, it is challenging to interpret the peculiar gas chemical
composition of many analyzed objects in the standard picture of the evolution
of planetary nebulae progenitors.
  We confirm that the dual-dust chemistry phenomenon is not limited to
planetary nebulae with emission-line central stars.
