We consider the scattering transform for the Schr\"odinger equation with a
singular potential and no bound states. Using the Riccati representation for
real-valued potentials on the line, we obtain invertibility and Lipschitz
continuity of the scattering transform between weighted and Sobolev spaces. Our
approach exploits the connection between scattering theory for the
Schr\"odinger equation and scattering theory for the ZS-AKNS system
