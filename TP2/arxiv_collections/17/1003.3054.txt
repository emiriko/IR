We measure the coherence of a new superconducting qubit, the {\em
low-impedance flux qubit}, finding $T_2^* \sim T_1 \sim 1.5\mu$s. It is a
three-junction flux qubit, but the ratio of junction critical currents is
chosen to make the qubit's potential have a single well form. The low impedance
of its large shunting capacitance protects it from decoherence. This qubit has
a moderate anharmonicity, whose sign is reversed compared with all other
popular qubit designs. The qubit is capacitively coupled to a high-Q resonator
in a $\lambda/2$ configuration, which permits the qubit's state to be read out
dispersively.
