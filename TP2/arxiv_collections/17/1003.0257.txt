The relativistic six-quark equations are found in the framework of the
dispersion relation technique. The approximate solutions of these equations
using the method based on the extraction of leading singularities of the
amplitudes are obtained. The relativistic six-quark amplitudes of hexaquarks
including the quarks of three flavors ($u$, $d$, $s$) are calculated. The poles
of these amplitudes determine the masses of six-quark systems.
