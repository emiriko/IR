An empirical model has been developed to reproduce the drift of the spectrum
recorded by EIS on board Hinode using instrumental temperatures and relative
motion of the spacecraft. The EIS spectrum shows an artificial drift in
wavelength dimension in sync with the revolution of the spacecraft, which is
caused by temperature variations inside the spectrometer. The drift amounts to
70 km s$^{-1}$ in Doppler velocity and introduces difficulties in velocity
measurements. An artificial neural network is incorporated to establish a
relationship between the instrumental temperatures and the spectral drift. This
empirical model reproduces observed spectrum shift with an rms error of 4.4 km
s$^{-1}$. This procedure is robust and applicable to any spectrum obtained with
EIS, regardless of of the observing field. In addition, spectral curvatures and
spatial offset in the North - South direction are determined to compensate for
instrumental effects.
