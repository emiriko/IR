In this contribution, we propose a new framework to evaluate pedestrian
simula-tions by using Extended Range Telepresence. Telepresence is used as a
virtual reality walking simulator, which provides the user with a realistic
impression of being present and walking in a virtual environment that is much
larger than the real physical environment, in which the user actually walks.
The validation of the simulation is performed by comparing motion data of the
telepresent user with simulated data at some points of the simulation. The use
of haptic feedback from the simulation makes the framework suitable for
training in emergency situations.
