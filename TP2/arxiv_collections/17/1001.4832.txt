It is shown by means of a simple analysis that the linearized system of
transport equations for a relativistic, single component ideal gas at rest
obeys the \textit{antecedence principle}, which is often referred to as
causality principle. This task is accomplished by examining the roots of the
dispersion relation for such a system. This result is important for recent
experiments performed in relativistic heavy ion colliders, since it suggests
that the Israel-Stewart like formalisms may be unnecessary in order to describe
relativistic fluids.
