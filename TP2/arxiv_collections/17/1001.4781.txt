Klein foams are analogues of Riemann and Klein surfaces with one-dimensional
singularities. We prove that the field of dianalytic functions on a Klein foam
$\Omega$ coincides with the field of dianalytic functions on a Klein surface
$K_{\Omega}$. We construct the moduli space of Klein foams and we prove that
the set of classes of topologically equivalent Klein foams form an analytic
space homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{n}/\mathsf{Mod}$, where $\mathsf{Mod}$ is a
discrete group.
