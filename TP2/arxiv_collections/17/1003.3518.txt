Hoyle and Folwler showed that there could be Radiation Pressure Supported
Stars (RPSS) even in Newtonian gravity. Much later, Mitra found that one could
also conceive of their General Relativistic (GR) version, "Relativistic
Radiation Pressure Supported Stars" (RRPSSs). While RPSSs have $z\ll 1$, RRPSSs
have $z \gg 1$, where $z$ is the surface gravitational redshift. Here we
elaborate on the formation of RRPSSs during continued gravitational collapse by
recalling that a contracting massive star must start trapping radiation as it
would enter its {\em photon sphere}. It is found that, irrespective of the
details of the contraction process, the trapped radiation flux should attain
the corresponding Eddington value at sufficiently large $z\gg 1$. This means
that continued GR collapse may generate an intermediate RRPSS with $z\gg 1$
before a true BH state with $z=\infty$ is formed asymptotically. An exciting
consequence of this is that the stellar mass black hole candidates, at present
epoch, should be hot balls of quark gluon plasma, as has been discussed by
Royzen in a recent article entitled "{\it QCD against black holes?}".
