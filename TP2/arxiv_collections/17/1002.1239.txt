Supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds is a key agent in generating
density enhancements that may subsequently go on to form stars. The stronger
the turbulence - the higher the Mach number - the more extreme the density
fluctuations are expected to be. Numerical models predict an increase in
density variance with rms Mach number of the form: sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}} =
b^{2}M^{2}, where b is a numerically-estimated parameter, and this prediction
forms the basis of a large number of analytic models of star formation. We
provide an estimate of the parameter b from 13CO J=1-0 spectral line imaging
observations and extinction mapping of the Taurus molecular cloud, using a
recently developed technique that needs information contained solely in the
projected column density field to calculate sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}}. We find b
~ 0.48, which is consistent with typical numerical estimates, and is
characteristic of turbulent driving that includes a mixture of solenoidal and
compressive modes. More conservatively, we constrain b to lie in the range
0.3-0.8, depending on the influence of sub-resolution structure and the role of
diffuse atomic material in the column density budget. We also report a break in
the Taurus column density power spectrum at a scale of ~1pc, and find that the
break is associated with anisotropy in the power spectrum. The break is
observed in both 13CO and dust extinction power spectra, which, remarkably, are
effectively identical despite detailed spatial differences between the 13CO and
dust extinction maps. [ abridged ]
