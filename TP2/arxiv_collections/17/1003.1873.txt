We study the dc Josephson effect in a diffusive multilayered SF'FF'S
structure, where S is a superconductor and F,F' are different ferromagnets. We
assume that the exchange energies in the F' and F layers are different ($% h $
and $H$, respectively) and the middle F layer consists of two layers with
parallel or antiparallel magnetization vectors $M$. The $M$ vectors in the left
and right F' layers are generally not collinear to those in the F layer. In the
limit of a weak proximity effect we use a linearized Usadel equation. Solving
this equation, we calculate the Josephson critical current for arbitrary
temperatures, arbitrary thicknesses of the F' and F layers ($% L_{h}$ and
$L_{H}$) in the case of parallel and antiparallel $M$ orientations in the F
layer. The part of the critical current $I_{cSR}$ formed by the short-range
(SRC) singlet and S=0 triplet condensate components decays on a short length
$\xi_{H}=\sqrt{D/H}$, whereas the part $% I_{cLR}$ due to the long-range
triplet $|S|=1$ component (LRTC) decreases with increasing $L_{H}$ on the
length $\xi_{N}=\sqrt{D/\pi T}$. Our results are in agreement with the
experiment \cite{Birge}.
