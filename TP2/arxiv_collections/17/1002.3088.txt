Different possible sources are discussed for enhancement of the calculation
time when solving ordinary differential equations systems to forecast space
objects' motion. This paper presents an approach for building an integrator of
ordinary differential equations systems for simultaneous solving of motion
equations of multiple objects. A parallelization of calculation on the base of
threads is offered. A method for synchronization is presented. The
technological advance and the invasion of multi-core processors make actual the
examined approach for developing an integrator of ordinary differential
equations systems.
