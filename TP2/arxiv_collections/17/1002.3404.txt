The brightest Ultra-Luminous X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49
currently provides strong evidence for the existence of intermediate mass black
holes. Here we present the latest multi-wavelength results on this intriguing
source in X-ray, UV and radio bands. We have refined the X-ray position to
sub-arcsecond accuracy. We also report the detection of UV emission that could
indicate ongoing star formation in the region around HLX-1. The lack of
detectable radio emission at the X-ray position strengthens the argument
against a background AGN.
