The possibility of reconstructing a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous
Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model with $\Lambda$CDM observations has drawn a
lot of attention. Recently, a LTB model having the same luminosity-distance and
light-cone mass density as the $\Lambda$CDM model was reconstructed. We
calculate the cosmic age at our position in this model, and get the age
$t_{LTB}<11.7$Gyr in 2$\sigma$ confidence level from the Seven-Year WMAP
observations. This result is inconsistent with some Milky Way observations.
