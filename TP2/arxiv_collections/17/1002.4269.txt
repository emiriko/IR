We obtain a new probabilistic representation for the solution of the heat
equation in terms of a product for smooth random variables which is introduced
and studied in this paper. This multiplication, expressed in terms of the
Hida-Malliavin derivatives of the random variables involved, exhibits many
useful properties which are to some extents opposite to some peculiar features
of the Wick product.
