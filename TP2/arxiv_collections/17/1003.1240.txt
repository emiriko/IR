A novel and relatively simple method of production of electrodes for a
multi-channel wire gas multiplier is developed. Two modifications of the
multipliers have been tested: with a multiplication of electrons between two
wire electrodes, MWGEM, and between a wire electrode and continuous anode,
MWCAT. For both MWGEM and MWCAT detectors, filled with neon under pressure of
760 Torr and irradiated by beta-particles (Ni-63), the coefficient of
proportional multiplication of electrons up to 10000 was obtained. For the
MWGEM detector irradiated by alpha-particles (Pu-239), the coefficient of
proportional multiplication of 300 was obtained. It is observed, that in
contrast to the GEM detectors, produced by perforation of a metal-clad plastic
foil, in a MWGEM the discharges do not destroy its electrodes even for the
potentials above the threshold of discharges. The results on operation of the
MWCAT filled with Ar, Ar+CH4 and Ar+1% Xe are also presented.
