Using a pulse-fit method, we investigate the spectral lags between the
traditional gamma-ray band (50-400 keV) and the X-ray band (6-25 keV) for 8
GRBs with known redshifts (GRB 010921, GRB 020124, GRB 020127, GRB 021211, GRB
030528, GRB 040924, GRB 041006, GRB 050408) detected with the WXM and FREGATE
instruments aboard the HETE-2 satellite. We find several relations for the
individual GRB pulses between the spectral lag and other observables, such as
the luminosity, pulse duration, and peak energy (Epeak). The obtained results
are consistent with those for BATSE, indicating that the BATSE correlations are
still valid at lower energies (6-25 keV). Furthermore, we find that the photon
energy dependence for the spectral lags can reconcile the simple curvature
effect model. We discuss the implication of these results from various points
of view.
