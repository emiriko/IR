Aggregates of twisted protein fibers, such as sickle hemoglobin and actin,
are important examples of biopolymers in which elastic interactions play a
crucial role in determining the (metastable) bundle radii. Here, we present a
corrected version of analysis on the stability of sickle hemoglobin fibers
using the classic nucleation theory.
