We consider excitations with the quantum numbers of a hole in the one
dimensional Hubbard model below half-filling. We calculate the finite-size
corrections to the energy. The results are then used to determine threshold
singularities in the single-particle Green's function for commensurate
fillings. We present the analogous results for the Yang-Gaudin model (electron
gas with delta-function interactions).
