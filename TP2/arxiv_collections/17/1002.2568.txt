We consider the contribution of Zero Point Energy on the induced Cosmological
Constant and on the induced Electric/Magnetic charge in absence of matter
fields. The method is applicable to every spherically symmetric background.
Extensions to a generic $f(R) $ theory are also allowed. Only the graviton
appears to be fundamental to the determination of Zero Point Energy.
