We explore possible CP violating effects, coming from the Dirac phase of the
Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata-Pontecorvo matrix, on the neutrino degeneracy parameters,
at the epoch of Big-Bang nucleosynthesis. We first demonstrate the conditions
under which such effects can arise. In particular it requires that the initial
muon and tau neutrino degeneracy parameters differ. Then we solve numerically
the kinetic equations for the three flavour neutrino density matrix with the
goal of quantifying the impact of the Dirac phase on the electron neutrino
degeneracy parameter. The calculations include the vacuum term, the coupling to
matter, the neutrino-neutrino interaction and the collisions. Effects on
electron neutrino degeneracy parameter up to almost 1.% and on Yp of about 0.1%
are found, depending on the initial conditions.
