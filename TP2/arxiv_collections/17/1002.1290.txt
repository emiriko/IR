We consider the regular model of formula generation in conjunctive normal
form (CNF) introduced by Boufkhad et. al. We derive an upper bound on the
satisfiability threshold and NAE-satisfiability threshold for regular random
$k$-SAT for any $k \geq 3$. We show that these bounds matches with the
corresponding bound for the uniform model of formula generation.
  We derive lower bound on the threshold by applying the second moment method
to the number of satisfying assignments. For large $k$, we note that the
obtained lower bounds on the threshold of a regular random formula converges to
the lower bound obtained for the uniform model. Thus, we answer the question
posed in \cite{AcM06} regarding the performance of the second moment method for
regular random formulas.
