The charged, spinning and gravitating soliton is realized as a regular
solution of the Kerr-Newman field coupled with a chiral Higgs model. A regular
core of the solution is formed by a domain wall bubble interpolating between
the external Kerr-Newman solution and a flat superconducting interior. An
internal electromagnetic (em) field is expelled to the boundary of the bubble
by the Higgs field. The solution reveals two new peculiarities: (i) the Higgs
field is oscillating, similar to the known oscillon models, (ii) the em field
forms on the edge of the bubble a Wilson loop, resulting in quantization of the
total angular momentum.
