We show that superradiant optical emission can be observed from the polarized
nuclear spin ensemble surrounding a single photon emitter such as a single
quantum dot (QD) or Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center. The superradiant light is
emitted under optical pumping conditions and would be observable with realistic
experimental parameters.
