TeV gamma-rays have been observed from blazars as well as from radio galaxies
like M87 and Cen A. In leptonic models, gamma-rays above the pair production
threshold can escape from the ultra-relativistic jet, since large Lorentz
factors reduce the background photon densities compared to those required for
isotropic emission. Here we discuss an alternative scenario, where VHE photons
are generated as secondaries from UHECR interaction in the AGN core. We show
that TeV gamma-rays can escape from the core despite large IR and UV
backgrounds. For the special case of Cen A, we study if the various existing
observations from the far infra-red to the UHE range can be reconciled within
this picture.
