We propose a scheme of "$R$-type" photoassociative adiabatic passage (PAP) to
create polar molecular condensates from two different species of ultracold
atoms. Due to the presence of a quasi-coherent population trapping state in the
scheme, it is possible to associate atoms into molecules with a
\textit{low-power} photoassociation (PA) laser. One remarkable advantage of our
scheme is that a tunable atom-molecule coupling strength can be achieved by
using a time-dependent PA field, which exhibits larger flexibility than using a
tunable magnetic field. In addition, our results show that the PA intensity
required in the "$R$-type" PAP could be greatly reduced compared to that in a
conventional "$\Lambda $-type" one.
