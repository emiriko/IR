We search a sample of photometric luminous red galaxies (LRGs) measured by
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for a quadrupolar anisotropy in the
primordial power spectrum, in which P(\vec{k}) is an isotropic power spectrum
P(k) multiplied by a quadrupolar modulation pattern. We first place limits on
the 5 coefficients of a general quadrupole anisotropy. We also consider
axisymmetric quadrupoles of the form P(\vec{k}) = P(k){1 +
g_*[(\hat{k}\cdot\hat{n})^2-1/3]} where \hat{n} is the axis of the anisotropy.
When we force the symmetry axis \hat{n} to be in the direction (l,b)=(94
degrees,26 degrees) identified in the recent Groeneboom et al. analysis of the
cosmic microwave background, we find g_*=0.006+/-0.036 (1 sigma). With uniform
priors on \hat{n} and g_* we find that -0.41<g_*<+0.38 with 95% probability,
with the wide range due mainly to the large uncertainty of asymmetries aligned
with the Galactic Plane. In none of these three analyses do we detect evidence
for quadrupolar power anisotropy in large scale structure.
