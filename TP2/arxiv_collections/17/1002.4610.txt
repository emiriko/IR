A version of the Swiss-cheese model is investigated. The flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is modified by the addition of
several spherical regions with Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric.
  We discuss light propagation in this model in detail to pave the way for a
detailed numerical study of the Hubble diagram.
