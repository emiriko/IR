We investigate heat transport in various quantum spin chains, using the
projector operator technique. We find that anomalous heat transport is linked
not to the integrability of the Hamiltonian, but to whether it can be mapped to
a model of non-interacting fermions. Our results also suggest how seemingly
anomalous transport may occur at low temperatures in a much wider class of
models.
