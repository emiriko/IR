Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data analyses based on event reconstruction
and classification are so far restricted to events of measured energy larger
than 100 MeV. We present a new technique to recover the signal from Gamma-Ray
Bursts' (GRB) prompt emission between ~30 MeV and 100 MeV, which differs from
the standard LAT analysis. Filling the gap between the energy ranges where the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and LAT operate is important to better constrain
the high-energy spectra of GRBs. The LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique is
described, first performance studies are presented, as well as preliminary
spectral re-analyses of two Fermi GRBs.
