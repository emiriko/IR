We discuss the coherent states for PT-/non-PT-Symmetric and non-Hermitian
generalized Morse Potential obtained by using path integral formalism over the
holomorphic coordinates. We transform the action of generalized Morse potential
into two harmonic oscillators with a new parametric time to establish the
parametric time coherent states. We calculate the energy eigenvalues and the
corresponding wave functions in parabolic coordinates.
