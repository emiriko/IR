Muon spin spectroscopy measurements have been used to study the
superconducting state of FeTe0.5Se0.5. The temperature dependence of the
in-plane magnetic penetration depth, lambda_ab(T), is found to be compatible
with either a two gap s+s wave or an anisotropic s-wave model. The value for
lambda_ab(T) at T=0 K is estimated to be lambda_ab(0)=534(2)nm.
