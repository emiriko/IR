The radiative seesaw model with an inert doublet has been shown to be
attractive from a viewpoint of both neutrino masses and cold dark matter.
However, if we apply this model to the explanation of the positron excess in
the cosmic ray observed by PAMELA, a huge boost factor is required although it
can be automatically explained that no anti-proton excess has been observed
there. We consider an extension of the model to enhance the thermally averaged
annihilation cross section without changing the features of the model favored
by both the neutrino oscillation and the relic abundance of dark matter. It is
shown that the data of PAMELA and Fermi-LAT can be well explained in this
extended model. Constraints from gamma ray observations are also discussed.
