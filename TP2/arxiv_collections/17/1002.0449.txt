To study the communication between information systems, Wang et al. [C. Wang,
C. Wu, D. Chen, Q. Hu, and C. Wu, Communicating between information systems,
Information Sciences 178 (2008) 3228-3239] proposed two concepts of type-1 and
type-2 consistent functions. Some properties of such functions and induced
relation mappings have been investigated there. In this paper, we provide an
improvement of the aforementioned work by disclosing the symmetric relationship
between type-1 and type-2 consistent functions. We present more properties of
consistent functions and induced relation mappings and improve upon several
deficient assertions in the original work. In particular, we unify and extend
type-1 and type-2 consistent functions into the so-called
neighborhood-consistent functions. This provides a convenient means for
studying the communication between information systems based on various
neighborhoods.
