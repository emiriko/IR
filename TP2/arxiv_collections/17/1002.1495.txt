We present simple protocols for oblivious transfer and password-based
identification which are secure against general attacks in the
noisy-quantum-storage model as defined in [KWW09]. We argue that a technical
tool from [KWW09] suffices to prove security of the known protocols. Whereas
the more involved protocol for oblivious transfer from [KWW09] requires less
noise in storage to achieve security, our "canonical" protocols have the
advantage of being simpler to implement and the security error is easier
control. Therefore, our protocols yield higher OT-rates for many realistic
noise parameters.
  Furthermore, the first proof of security of a direct protocol for
password-based identification against general noisy-quantum-storage attacks is
given.
