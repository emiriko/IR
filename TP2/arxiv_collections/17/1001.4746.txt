The theoretical and experimental aspects of particle production from the
strong equivalent photon fluxes present at high energy hadron colliders are
reviewed. The goal is to show how photons at hadron colliders can improve what
we have learnt from experiments with lepton beams. Experiments during the last
5-10 years have shown the feasibility of studying photoproduction in
proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. The experimental and theoretical
development has revealed new opportunities as well as challenges.
