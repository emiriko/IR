A multi-fermion interaction model is investigated in a compact spacetime with
non-trivial topology and in a weakly curved spacetime. Evaluating the effective
potential in the leading order of the 1/N expansion, we show the phase boundary
for a discrete chiral symmetry in an arbitrary dimensions, $2\leq D<4$.
