The mathematical model for hit phenomena in entertainments is presented as a
nonlinear, dynamical and non-equilibrium phenomena. The purchase intention for
each person is introduced and direct and indirect communications are expressed
as two-body and three-body interaction in our model. The mathematical model is
expressed as coupled nonlinear differential equations. The important factor in
the model is the decay time of rumor for the hit. The calculated results agree
very well with revenues of recent 25 movies.
