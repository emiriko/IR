The FFT EnKF data assimilation method is proposed and applied to a stochastic
cell simulation of an epidemic, based on the S-I-R spread model. The FFT EnKF
combines spatial statistics and ensemble filtering methodologies into a
localized and computationally inexpensive version of EnKF with a very small
ensemble, and it is further combined with the morphing EnKF to assimilate
changes in the position of the epidemic.
