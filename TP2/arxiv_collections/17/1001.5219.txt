We report nonresonant inelastic x-ray scattering from the semi-core 5d levels
of several actinide compounds. Dipole-forbidden, high-multipole features form a
rich bound-state spectrum dependent on valence electron configuration and
spin-orbit and Coulomb interactions. Cross-material comparisons, together with
the anomalously high Coulomb screening required for agreement between atomic
multiplet theory and experiment, demonstrate sensitivity to the neighboring
electronic environment, such as is needed to address long-standing questions of
electronic localization and bonding in 5f compounds.
