While Robert and Rousseau (2010) addressed the foundational aspects of
Bayesian analysis, the current chapter details its practical aspects through a
review of the computational methods available for approximating Bayesian
procedures. Recent innovations like Monte Carlo Markov chain, sequential Monte
Carlo methods and more recently Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques
have considerably increased the potential for Bayesian applications and they
have also opened new avenues for Bayesian inference, first and foremost
Bayesian model choice.
