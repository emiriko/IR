We demonstrate coaxial atomic force microscope (AFM) tweezers that can trap
and place small objects using dielectrophoresis (DEP). An attractive force is
generated at the tip of a coaxial AFM probe by applying a radio frequency
voltage between the center conductor and a grounded shield; the origin of the
force is found to be DEP by measuring the pull-off force vs. applied voltage.
We show that the coaxial AFM tweezers (CAT) can perform three dimensional
assembly by picking up a specified silica microsphere, imaging with the
microsphere at the end of the tip, and placing it at a target destination.
