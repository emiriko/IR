Nowadays government and private agencies use remote sensing imagery for a
wide range of applications from military applications to farm development. The
images may be a panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral or even
ultraspectral of terra bytes. Remote sensing image classification is one
amongst the most significant application worlds for remote sensing. A few
number of image classification algorithms have proved good precision in
classifying remote sensing data. But, of late, due to the increasing
spatiotemporal dimensions of the remote sensing data, traditional
classification algorithms have exposed weaknesses necessitating further
research in the field of remote sensing image classification. So an efficient
classifier is needed to classify the remote sensing images to extract
information. We are experimenting with both supervised and unsupervised
classification. Here we compare the different classification methods and their
performances. It is found that Mahalanobis classifier performed the best in our
classification.
