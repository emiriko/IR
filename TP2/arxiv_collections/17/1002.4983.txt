We decompose the fibers of the Springer resolution for the odd nilcone of the
Lie superalgebra $\osp(2n+1,2n)$ into locally closed subsets. We use this
decomposition to prove that almost all fibers are connected. However, in
contrast with the classical Springer fibers, we prove that the fibers can be
disconnected and non equidimensional.
