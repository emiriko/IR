A comprehensive, calculated line list of frequencies and transition
probabilities for the singly deuterated isotopologue of H3+, H2D+, is
presented. The line list, called ST1, contains over 22 million
rotational-vibrational transitions occurring between more than 33 thousand
energy levels; it covers frequencies up to 18500 cm-1. All energy levels with
rotational quantum number, J, up to 20 are considered, making the line list
useful for temperatures up to at least 3000 K. About 15% of these levels are
fully assigned with approximate rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. The
list is calculated using a previously proposed, high accuracy, ab initio model
and consistency checks are carried out to test and validate the results. These
checks confirm the accuracy of the list. A temperature-dependent partition
function, valid over a more extended temperature range than those previously
published, and cooling function are presented. Temperature-dependent synthetic
spectra in the frequency range 0 - 10000 cm-1 are also given.
