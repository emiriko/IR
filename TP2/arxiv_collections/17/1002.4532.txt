A comparison between full few-body Faddeev/Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas
(Faddeev/AGS) and continuum-discretized coupled channels (CDCC) calculations is
made for the resonant and nonresonant breakup of $^{11}$Be on proton target at
63.7 MeV/u incident energy. A simplified two-body model is used for $^{11}$Be
which involves an inert $^{10}$Be(0$^+$) core and a valence neutron. The
sensitivity of the calculated observables to the nucleon-nucleon potential
dynamical input is analysed. We show that with the present NN and N-core
dynamics the results remain a puzzle for the few-body problem of scattering
from light exotic halo nuclei.
