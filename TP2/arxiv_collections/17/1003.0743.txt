Currently, dynamics of a massive macroparticle is given by classical
analytical mechanics (CM), while that of a massive micro one is given by
quantum mechanics (QM). We propose a mechanics effective for both: We
transform, under coordinate transformation, the covariant tensor of order two
underlying the kinetic energy term of the Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) eq. of CM, not
with the action of the diffeomorphism group, but with an action of an extended
diffeomorphism group. Then, the H-J eq., a first-order partial differential
eq., is modified to a third-order one. The Euler-Lagrange eq. of CM, a
second-order ordinary differential eq., related to the H-J eq. through action
integral of the least action principle is accordingly modified to a
fourth-order one. We thus obtain a mechanics which, because of the higher-order
eqs., accommodates phenomena corresponding to quantum phenomena. Energy of a
particle in a confining potential is quantized to the same values as those of
QM. Particle distribution in an ensemble disagrees with that of QM, but agrees
with experiments within experimental uncertainty. The mechanics therefore is a
testable alternative to QM.
