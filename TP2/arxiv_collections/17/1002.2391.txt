We construct the effective chiral Lagrangian involving hadronic and
electromagnetic interactions originating from the QCD theta term. We impose
vacuum alignment at both quark and hadronic levels, including field
redefinitions to eliminate pion tadpoles. We show that leading
time-reversal-violating (TV) hadronic interactions are related to
isospin-violating interactions that can in principle be determined from
charge-symmetry-breaking experiments. We discuss the complications that arise
from TV electromagnetic interactions. Some implications of the expected sizes
of various pion-nucleon TV interactions are presented, and the pion-nucleon
form factor is used as an example.
