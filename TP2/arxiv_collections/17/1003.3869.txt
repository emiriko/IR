A simple covariant formalism to describe flavor and CP violation in the
left-handed quark sector in a model independent way is provided. The
introduction of a covariant basis, which makes the standard model approximate
symmetry structure manifest, leads to a physical and transparent picture of
flavor conversion processes. Our method is particularly useful to derive robust
bounds on models with arbitrary mechanisms of alignment. Known constraints on
flavor violation in the K and D systems are reproduced in a straightforward
manner. Assumptions-free limits, based on top flavor violation at the LHC, are
then obtained. In the absence of signal, with 100 fb^{-1} of data, the LHC will
exclude weakly coupled (strongly coupled) new physics up to a scale of 0.6 TeV
(7.6 TeV), while at present no general constraint can be set related to Delta
t=1 processes. LHC data will constrain Delta F=2 contributions via same-sign
tops signal, with a model independent exclusion region of 0.08 TeV (1.0 TeV).
However, in this case, stronger bounds are found from the study of CP violation
in D-bar D mixing with a scale of 0.57 TeV (7.2 TeV). In addition, we apply our
analysis to models of supersymmetry and warped extra dimension. The minimal
flavor violation framework is also discussed, where the formalism allows to
distinguish between the linear and generic non-linear limits within this class
of models.
