We propose a scheme for the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of Fock
states of a nanomechanical resonator via feedback control of a coupled circuit
QED system. A Cooper pair box (CPB) is coupled to both the nanoresonator and
microwave cavity. The CPB is read-out via homodyne detection on the cavity and
feedback control is used to effect a non-dissipative measurement of the CPB.
This realizes an indirect QND measurement of the nanoresonator via a
second-order coupling of the CPB to the nanoresonator number operator. The
phonon number of the Fock state may be determined by integrating the stochastic
master equation derived, or by processing of the measurement signal.
