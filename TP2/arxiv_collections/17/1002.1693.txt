The input to the configuration-interaction shell model includes many dozens
or hundreds of independent two-body matrix elements. Previous studies have
shown that when fitting to experimental low-lying spectra, the greatest
sensitivity is to only a few linear combinations of matrix elements. Here we
consider interactions drawn from the two-body random ensemble, or TBRE, and
find that the low-lying spectra are also most sensitive to only a few linear
combinations of two-body matrix elements, in a fashion nearly indistinguishable
from an interaction empirically fit to data. We find in particular the spectra
for both the random and empirical interactions are sensitive to similar matrix
elements, which we analyze using monopole and contact interactions.
