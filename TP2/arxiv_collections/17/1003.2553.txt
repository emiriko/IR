The origin of the long secondary periods (LSPs) in red variables remains a
mystery up to now, although there exist many models. The light curves of some
LSPs stars mimic an eclipsing binary with a pulsating red giant component. To
test this hypothesis, the observational data of two LSP variable red giants,
77.7795.29 and 77.8031.42, discovered by the MACHO project from the LMC, are
collected and analyzed. The probable eclipsing features of the light curves are
simulated by the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. The simulation yields a contact
and a semidetached geometry for the two systems, respectively. In addition, the
pulsation constant of the main pulsating component in each binary system is
derived. By combining the results of the binary model and the pulsation
component, we investigate the feasibility of the pulsating binary model. It is
found that the radial velocity curve expected from the binary model has a much
larger amplitude than the observed one and a period double the observed one.
Furthermore, the masses of the components based on the density derived from the
binary orbit solution are too low to be compatible with both the evolutionary
stage and the high luminosity. Although the pulsation mode identified by the
pulsation constant which is dependent on the density from the binary-model is
consistent with the first or second overtone radial pulsation, we conclude that
the pulsating binary model is a defective model for the LSP.
