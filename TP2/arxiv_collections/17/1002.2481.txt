We measured magnetotransport properties of PbS single crystals which exhibit
the quantum linear magnetoresistance (MR) as well as the static skin effect
that creates a surface layer of additional conductivity. The Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in the longitudinal MR signify the peculiar role of spin-orbit
coupling. In the angular-dependent MR, sharp peaks are observed when the
magnetic field is slightly inclined from the longitudinal configuration, which
is totally unexpected for a system with nearly spherical Fermi surface and
points to an intricate interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the
conducting surface layer in the quantum transport regime.
