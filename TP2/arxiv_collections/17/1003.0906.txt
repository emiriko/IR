I provide a comprehensive review of indirect searches for New Physics with
charmed mesons. I discuss current theoretical and experimental challenges and
successes in understanding decays and mixings of those mesons. I argue that in
many New Physics scenarios strong constraints, that surpass those from other
search techniques, could be placed on the allowed model parameter space using
the existent data from studies of charm transitions. This has direct
implications for direct searches of physics beyond the Standard Model at the
LHC.
