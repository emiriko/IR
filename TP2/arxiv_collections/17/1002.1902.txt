Pure hadronic compact stars, above a limiting value ($\approx$1.6 M$_\odot$)
of their gravitational masses, to which predictions of most of other equations
of state (EoSs) are restricted, can be reached from the equation of state (EoS)
obtained using DDM3Y effective interaction. This effective interaction is found
to be quite successful in providing unified description of elastic and
inelastic scattering, various radioactivities and nuclear matter properties. We
present a systematic study of the properties of pure hadronic compact stars.
The $\beta$-equilibrated neutron star matter using this EoS with a thin crust
is able to describe highly-massive compact stars, such as PSR B1516+02B with a
mass M=1.94$^{+0.17}_{-0.19}$ M$_\odot$ and PSR J0751+1807 with a mass
M=2.1$\pm$0.2 M$_\odot$ to a 1$\sigma$ confidence level.
