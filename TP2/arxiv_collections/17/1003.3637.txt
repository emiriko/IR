We study two body dipolar scattering with one dimension of confinement. We
include the effects of confinement by expanding this degree of freedom in
harmonic oscillator states. We then study the properties of the resulting
multi-channel system. We study the adiabatic curves as a function of D/l, the
ratio of the dipolar and confinement length scales. There is no dipolar barrier
for this system when D/l < 0.34. We also study the WKB tunneling probability as
a function of D/l and scattering energy. This can be used to estimate the
character of the scattering.
