Extrasolar planets are a natural extension of the interacting binaries
towards the companions with very small masses and similar tools might be used
to study them. Unfortunately, the generally accepted treatment of the
reflection effect in interacting binaries is not very suitable to study cold
objects irradiated by hot objects or extrasolar planets. Our simple model of
the reflection effect takes into account the reflection (scattering), heating
and heat redistribution over the surface of the irradiated object. The shape of
the objects is described by the Roche potential and limb and gravity darkening
can be taken into account. The orbital revolution and rotation of the planet
with proper Doppler shifts for the scattered and thermal radiation are also
accounted for. Subsequently, light-curves and/or spectra of exoplanets were
modeled and the effects of the heat redistribution, limb darkening/brightening,
(non-)grey albedo, and non-spherical shape were studied. Recent observations of
HD189733b, WASP12b, and Wasp-19b were reproduced reasonably well. HD189733b has
low Bond albedo and intense heat redistribution. Wasp-19b has low Bond albedo
and low heat redistribution. We also calculate the exact Roche shapes and
temperature distribution over the surface of all 78 transiting extrasolar
planets known so far. It is found that the departures from the sphere vary
considerably within the sample. Departures of about 1% are common. In some
cases: WASP-12b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b departures can reach about 14, 12, and 8%,
respectively. The mean temperatures of these planets also vary considerably
from 300 K to 2600 K. The extreme cases are WASP-33b, WASP-12b, and WASP-18b
with mean temperatures of about 2600, 2430, and 2330 K, respectively.
