A directly public verifiable signcryption scheme is introduced in this paper
that provides the security attributes of message confidentiality,
authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, unforgeability, and forward secrecy
of message confidentiality. It provides the attribute of direct public
verifiability so anyone can verify the signcryption without any need for any
secret information from the corresponding participants. The proposed scheme is
based on elliptic curve cryptography and is so suitable for environments with
resource constraints.
