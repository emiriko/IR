Neutrino emission in processes of breaking and formation of nucleon Cooper
pairs is calculated in the framework of the Larkin-Migdal and the Leggett
approaches to the description of superfluid Fermi liquids at finite
temperatures. We explain peculiarities of both approaches and explicitly
demonstrate that they lead to the same expression for the emissivity in pair
breaking and formation processes.
