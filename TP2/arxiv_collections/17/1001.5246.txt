We study massless Dirac fields in a portion of $AdS_3$, where one of the
boundaries coincides with the "boundary at infinity" of the Anti-de-Sitter
space. We evaluate the vacuum energy arising when the local boundary conditions
dictated by boundary chirality are imposed, in different combinations, at both
one-branes.
