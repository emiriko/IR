Chromospheric activity has been thought to decay smoothly with time and,
hence, to be a viable age indicator. Measurements in solar type stars in open
clusters seem to point to a different conclusion: chromospheric activity
undergoes a fast transition from Hyades level to that of the Sun after about 1
Gyr of main--sequence lifetime and any decaying trend before or after this
transition must be much less significant than the short term variations.
