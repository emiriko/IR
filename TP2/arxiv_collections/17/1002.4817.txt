The presence of non linear instruments is responsible for the emergence of
non Gaussian features in the price changes distribution of realistic
portfolios, even for Normally distributed risk factors. This is especially true
for the benchmark Delta Gamma Normal model, which in general exhibits
exponentially damped power law tails. We show how the knowledge of the model
characteristic function leads to Fourier representations for two standard risk
measures, the Value at Risk and the Expected Shortfall, and for their
sensitivities with respect to the model parameters. We detail the numerical
implementation of our formulae and we emphasizes the reliability and efficiency
of our results in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation.
