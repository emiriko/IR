The presence of a close, low-mass companion is thought to play a substantial
and perhaps necessary role in shaping post-Asymptotic Giant Branch and
Planetary Nebula outflows. During post-main-sequence evolution, radial
expansion of the primary star, accompanied by intense winds, can significantly
alter the binary orbit via tidal dissipation and mass loss. To investigate
this, we couple stellar evolution models (from the zero-age main-sequence
through the end of the post-main sequence) to a tidal evolution code. The
binary's fate is determined by the initial masses of the primary and the
companion, the initial orbit (taken to be circular), and the Reimers mass-loss
parameter. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether the orbit
expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a common
envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation based on
the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict period
gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. The upper end of
the gap is the shortest period at which a CE phase is avoided. The lower end is
the longest period at which companions survive their CE phase. For binary
systems with 1 $M_\odot$ progenitors, we predict no Jupiter-mass companions
with periods $\lesssim$270 days. Once engulfed, Jupiter-mass companions do not
survive a CE phase. For binary systems consisting of a 1 $M_\odot$ progenitor
with a companion 10 times the mass of Jupiter, we predict a period gap between
$\sim$0.1 and $\sim$380 days. These results are consistent with both the
detection of a $\sim$50 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf in a $\sim$0.003 AU ($\sim$0.08
day) orbit around the white dwarf WD 0137-349 and the tentative detection of a
$\sim$2 $M_{\rm J}$ planet in a $\gtrsim$2.7 AU ($\gtrsim$4 year) orbit around
the white dwarf GD66.
