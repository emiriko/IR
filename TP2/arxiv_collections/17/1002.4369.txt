In this paper we investigate the vacuum polarization effects associated with
a massive quantum scalar field in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of
gravitational topological defects. Specifically we calculate the vacuum
expectation value of the field square, $<\Phi^2>$. Because this investigation
has been developed in a pure de Sitter space, here we are mainly interested on
the effects induced by the presence of the defects.
