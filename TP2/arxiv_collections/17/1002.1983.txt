To use a 3D numerical MHD experiment representing magnetic flux emerging into
an open field region as a background field for tracing charged particles. The
interaction between the two flux systems generates a localised current sheet
where MHD reconnection takes place. We investigate how efficiently the
reconnection region accelerates charged particles and what kind of energy
distribution they acquire. The particle tracing is done numerically using the
Guiding Center Approximation on individual data sets from the numerical MHD
experiment. We derive particle and implied photon distribution functions having
power law forms, and look at the impact patterns of particles hitting the
photosphere. We find that particles reach energies far in excess of those seen
in observations of solar flares. However the structure of the impact region in
the photosphere gives a good representation of the topological structure of the
magnetic field.
