LA planning in cellular network is useful for minimizing location management
cost in GSM network. In fact, size of LA can be optimized to create a balance
between the LA update rate and expected paging rate within LA. To get optimal
result for LA planning in cellular network simulated annealing algorithm is
used. Simulated annealing give optimal results in acceptable run-time.
