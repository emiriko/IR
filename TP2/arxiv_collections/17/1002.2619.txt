We built a frequency-doubled laser for 87Rb laser cooling, from a Telecom
fiber laser. Thanks to intense technological development, telecom fiber lasers
exhibit outstanding properties regarding relative intensity noise and
modulation bandwidth. The enhanced doubling efficiency of periodically poled
crystals allowed to obtain up to 1.8 W at 780 nm from 10 W at 1560 nm, with a
simple pass configuration in a 50-mm long crystal of ppLN:MgO. This technique
can also be applied at the wavelength of potassium (767 nm) (Bourdel, 2009) and
could be of great interest for the realization of dipole traps.
