A new empirical formulae is given for estimating the masses of black holes in
AGNs from the H beta velocity dispersion and the continuum luminosity at 5100
Angstroms. It is calibrated to reverberation-mapping and stellar-dynamical
estimates of black hole masses. The resulting mass estimates are as accurate as
reverberation-mapping and stellar-dynamical estimates. The new mass estimates
show that there is very little scatter in the M_{bh} - L_{bulge} relationship
for high-luminosity galaxies, and that the scatter increases substantially in
lower-mass galaxies.
