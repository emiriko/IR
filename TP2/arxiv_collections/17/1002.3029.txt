Despite its fundamental role in the dynamics of compressible fluids, bulk
viscosity has received little experimental attention and there remains a
paucity of measured data. Acoustic spectroscopy provides a robust and accurate
approach to measuring this parameter. Working from the Navier-Stokes model of a
compressible fluid one can show that the bulk viscosity makes a significant and
measurable contribution to the frequency-squared acoustic attenuation. Here we
employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over
a temperature range of 7 to 50 degrees Celsius. The measured attenuation
spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk
viscosity of water is found to be approximately three times larger than its
shear counterpart, reinforcing its significance in acoustic propagation.
Moreover, our results demonstrate that this technique can be readily and
generally applied to fluids to accurately determine their temperature dependent
bulk viscosities.
