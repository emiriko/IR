This paper attempts to undertake the study of three types of noise such as
Salt and Pepper (SPN), Random variation Impulse Noise (RVIN), Speckle (SPKN).
Different noise densities have been removed between 10% to 60% by using five
types of filters as Mean Filter (MF), Adaptive Wiener Filter (AWF), Gaussian
Filter (GF), Standard Median Filter (SMF) and Adaptive Median Filter (AMF). The
same is applied to the Saturn remote sensing image and they are compared with
one another. The comparative study is conducted with the help of Mean Square
Errors (MSE) and Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). So as to choose the base
method for removal of noise from remote sensing image.
