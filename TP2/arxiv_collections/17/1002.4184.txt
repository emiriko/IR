We study the output coupling of atoms from a magnetic trap into a linear
potential slope of gravity using a weak radio-frequency field. We present a
one-dimensional wave-packet model based on a continuous loading of a continuous
spectrum of generalised eigenstates to describe the scenario. Analyzing the
model, we show how the interference of the classical coupling fields maps to
the interference of the resulting atomic streams.
