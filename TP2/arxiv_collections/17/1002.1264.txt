We consider a modification of the Minimal Analytic (MA) coupling of Shirkov
and Solovtsov. This modified MA (mMA) coupling reflects the desired analytic
properties of the space-like observables. We show that an approximation by
Dirac deltas of its discontinuity function $\rho$ is equivalent to a Pad\'e
(rational) approximation of the mMA coupling that keeps its analytic structure.
We propose a modification to mMA that, as preliminary results indicate, could
be an improvement in the evaluation of low-energy observables compared with
other analytic couplings.
