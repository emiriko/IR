Spontaneous emission through a coupled cavity can be a significant decay
channel for qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a circuit
design that effectively eliminates spontaneous emission due to the Purcell
effect while maintaining strong coupling to a low-Q cavity. Excellent agreement
over a wide range in frequency is found between measured qubit relaxation times
and the predictions of a circuit model. Using fast (nanosecond time-scale) flux
biasing of the qubit, we demonstrate in situ control of qubit lifetime over a
factor of 50. We realize qubit reset with 99.9% fidelity in 120 ns.
