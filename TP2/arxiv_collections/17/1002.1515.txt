Quantum coherence of open quantum systems is usually compromised because of
the interaction with the ambient environment. A "decoherence-free subspace"
(DFS) of the system Hilbert space is defined where the evolution remains
unitary. In the absence of a priori existence of such subspaces, it seems
natural that utilizing quantum control may help generate and/or retain a DFS.
Here, we introduce a time-varying DFS wherein the system's density matrix has a
unitarily evolving sub-density corresponding to some given set of its
eigenvalues (which we aim to preserve). This subspace is characterized from
both topological and algebraic perspectives. In particular, we show that this
DFS admits a complex vector bundle structure over a real-analytic manifold (the
decoherence-free manifold).
