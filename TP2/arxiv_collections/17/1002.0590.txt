We consider the effects of supernovae (SNe) on accretion and star formation
in a massive gaseous disk in a large primeval galaxy. The gaseous disk we
envisage, roughly 1 kiloparsec (kpc) in size with >~ 10^8 M_Sun of gas, could
have formed as a result of galaxy mergers where tidal interactions removed
angular momentum from gas at larger radius and thereby concentrated it within
the central ~ 1 kpc region. We find that SNe lead to accretion in the disk at a
rate of roughly 0.1 - 1 M_Sun per year and induce star formation at a rate of ~
10 - 100 M_Sun per year which contributes to the formation of a bulge; a part
of the stellar velocity dispersion is due to the speed of SNa shells from which
stars are formed and a part due to the repeated action of the stochastic
gravitational field of the network of SNa remnants on stars. The rate of SNe in
the inner kpc is shown to be self- regulating, and it cycles through phases of
low and high activity. The supernova-assisted accretion transports gas from
about one kpc to within a few pc of the center. If this accretion were to
continue down to the central black hole (BH) then the resulting ratio of BH
mass to the stellar mass in the bulge would be of order ~ 10^-2 - 10^-3, in
line with the observed Magorrian relation.
