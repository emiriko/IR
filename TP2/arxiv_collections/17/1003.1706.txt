We use ~88 arcmin**2 of deep (>~26.5 mag at 5 sigma) NICMOS data over the two
GOODS fields and the HDF South to conduct a search for bright z>~7 galaxy
candidates. This search takes advantage of an efficient preselection over 58
arcmin**2 of NICMOS H-band data where only plausible z>~7 candidates are
followed up with NICMOS J-band observations. ~248 arcmin**2 of deep
ground-based near-infrared data (>~25.5 mag, 5 sigma) is also considered in the
search. In total, we report 15 z-dropout candidates over this area -- 7 of
which are new to these search fields. Two possible z~9 J-dropout candidates are
also found, but seem unlikely to correspond to z~9 galaxies. The present z~9
search is used to set upper limits on the prevalence of such sources. Rigorous
testing is undertaken to establish the level of contamination of our selections
by photometric scatter, low mass stars, supernovae (SNe), and spurious sources.
The estimated contamination rate of our z~7 selection is ~24%. Through careful
simulations, the effective volume available to our z>~7 selections is estimated
and used to establish constraints on the volume density of luminous (L*(z=3),
or -21 mag) galaxies from these searches. We find that the volume density of
luminous star-forming galaxies at z~7 is 13_{-5}^{+8}x lower than at z~4 and
>25x lower (1 sigma) at z~9 than at z~4. This is the most stringent constraint
yet available on the volume density of >~L* galaxies at z~9. The present
wide-area, multi-field search limits cosmic variance to <20%. The evolution we
find at the bright end of the UV LF is similar to that found from recent Subaru
Suprime-Cam, HAWK-I or ERS WFC3/IR searches. The present paper also includes a
complete summary of our final z~7 z-dropout sample (18 candidates) identified
from all NICMOS observations to date (over the two GOODS fields, the HUDF,
galaxy clusters).
