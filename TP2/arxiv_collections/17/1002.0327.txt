Recently there has been growing interest in nanofluids and nanodroplet
engineering and applications. In this paper we derive a theory of Lennard-Jones
fluids in multiphase dynamics from the information theoretic approach in
analogy to the fully quantum mechanical theory of phase transitions. We derive
least biased distributions of the particles and some analytic solutions are
obtained.
