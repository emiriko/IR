We report on optical high-dispersion spectroscopic monitoring observations of
the Be/X-ray binary A0535+26/V725 Tau, carried out from November 2005 to March
2009. The main aim of these monitoring observations is to study spectral
variabilities in the Be disc, on both the short (a week or so) and long (more
than hundreds of days) timescales, by taking long-term frequent observations.
Our four-year spectroscopic observations indicate that the V/R ratio, i.e., the
relative intensity of the violet (V) peak to the red (R) one, of the
double-peaked H-alpha line profile varies with a period of 500 days. The H-beta
line profile also varies in phase with the H-alpha profile. With these
observations covering two full cycles of the V/R variability, we reconstruct
the 2-D structure of the Be disc by applying the Doppler tomography method to
the H-alpha and H-beta emission line profiles, using a rigidly rotating frame
with the V/R variability period. The resulting disc structure reveals
non-axisymmetric features, which can be explained by a one-armed perturbation
in the Be disc. It is the first time that an eccentric disc structure is
directly detected by using a method other than the interferometric one.
