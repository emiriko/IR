Aims: We reanalyse optical spectra of the z=6.7 gamma-ray burst GRB 080913,
adding hitherto unpublished spectra, in order to reassess the measurement of
the neutral fraction of the IGM at high redshifts.
  Methods: In the data reduction we take particular care to minimise systematic
errors in the sky subtraction, which are evident in the published spectrum, and
compromise the analysis. The final combined spectrum has a higher S/N than the
previously published spectrum by a factor of 1.3.
  Results: We find a single significant absorption line redward of the Ly-alpha
continuum break, which we identify with the SII+SiII blend (rest wavelength of
0.1260 micron), at z=6.733. The sharp spectral break at Ly-alpha implies a
comparatively low total column density of neutral hydrogen along the line of
sight, log [N(HI)/cm^-2] < 20. We model the absorption with a host-galaxy DLA,
surrounded by an ionised region of unknown size r, within the IGM of neutral
fraction, x(HI). Despite knowing the source redshift, and the improved S/N of
the spectrum, when fitting only over wavelengths redward of Ly-alpha, no useful
constraints on x(HI) can be obtained. We consider the possibility of including
the ionised region, blueward of Ly-alpha, in constraining the fit. For the
optimistic assumption that the ionised region is transparent, tau_{GP} << 1, we
find that the region is of small size r < 2 proper Mpc, and we obtain an upper
limit to the neutral fraction of the IGM at z=6.7 of x(HI) < 0.73.
