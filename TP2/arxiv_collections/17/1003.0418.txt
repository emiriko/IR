We have timed four millisecond pulses, PSRs J1721-2457, J1745-0952,
J1810-2005, and J1918-0642, for up to a total of 10.5 years each using multiple
telescopes in the European Pulsar Timing Array network: the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope in The Netherlands, the Nancay Radio Telescope in
France and the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank in the UK. The long time span
has enabled us to measure the proper motions of J1745-0952 and J1918-0642,
indicating that they have transverse velocities of 200(50) and 54(7) km/s
respectively. We have obtained upper limits on the proper motion of J1721-2457
and J1810-2005, which imply that they have transverse velocities less than 140
and 400 km/s respectively. In all cases, the velocities lie in the range
typical of millisecond pulsars. We present pulse profiles for each pulsar taken
from observations at multiple frequencies in the range of 350 to 2600 MHz, and
show that J1810-2005 shows significant profile evolution in this range. Using
our multi-frequency observations, we measured the spectral indices for all four
pulsars, and for J1810-2005 it appears to be very flat. The flux density of
J1918-0642 shows extensive modulation which we attribute to the combined
effects of refractive and diffractive scintillation. We discuss the possible
use of including J1721-2457 or J1918-0642 in a pulsar timing array, and find
that J1918-0642 will be useful to include when the timing precision of this
pulsar is improved over the next few years. We have searched archival optical
observations to detect companions of the binary pulsars, but none were
detected. However, we provide lower limits on the masses of the white dwarf
companions of PSRs J1745-0952 and J1918-0642.
