We have observed the J=3-2 transition of N2H+ and N2D+ to investigate the
trend of deuterium fractionation with evolutionary stage in three selected
regions in the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G28.34+0.06 with the Submillimeter
Telescope (SMT) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA). A comprehensible enhancement
of roughly 3 orders of magnitude in deuterium fractionation over the local
interstellar D/H ratio is observed in all sources. In particular, our sample of
massive star-forming cores in G28.34+0.06 shows a moderate decreasing trend
over a factor of 3 in the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) ratio with evolutionary stage, a
behavior resembling what previously found in low-mass protostellar cores. This
suggests a possible extension for the use of the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) ratio as an
evolutionary tracer to high-mass protostellar candidates. In the most evolved
core, MM1, the N2H+ (3-2) emission appears to avoid the warm region traced by
dust continuum emission and emission of 13CO sublimated from grain mantles,
indicating an instant release of gas-phase CO. The majority of the N2H+ and
N2D+ emission is associated with extended structures larger than 8" (~ 0.2 pc).
