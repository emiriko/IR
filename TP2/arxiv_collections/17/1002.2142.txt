In this article, we consider singular equivariant arithmetic schemes whose
generic fibres are smooth. For such schemes, we prove a relative fixed point
formula of Lefschetz type in the context of Arakelov geometry. This formula is
an analog, in the arithmetic case, of the Lefschetz formula proved by R. W.
Thomason. In particular, our result implies a fixed point formula which was
conjectured by V. Maillot and D. R\"{o}ssler.
