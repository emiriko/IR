We consider the dark matter scalar in the Randall Sundrum background and
study the annihilation cross section if the curvature-scalar mixing is switched
on. In this case, in addition to the radion, the standard model Higgs scalar
drives the annihilation and it leads to a considerable enhancement in the
annihilation cross section. Furthermore we take unparticle, having a non-zero
mass coming from the standard model Higgs-unparticle interaction in the low
energy level, as a dark matter candidate and analyze the annihilation cross
section by including the effect of the curvature-scalar mixing. We see that,
for both choices, the mixing process plays an essential role in obtaining the
dark matter annihilation cross section in the current range.
