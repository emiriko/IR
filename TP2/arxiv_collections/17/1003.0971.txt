For sampling multiple pathways in a rugged energy landscape, we propose a
novel action-based path sampling method using the Onsager-Machlup action
functional. Inspired by the Fourier-path integral simulation of a quantum
mechanical system, a path in Cartesian space is transformed into that in
Fourier space, and an overdamped Langevin equation is derived for the Fourier
components to achieve a canonical ensemble of the path at a finite temperature.
To avoid "path trapping" around an initially guessed path, the path sampling
method is further combined with a powerful sampling technique, the replica
exchange method. The principle and algorithm of our method is numerically
demonstrated for a model two-dimensional system with a bifurcated potential
landscape. The results are compared with those of conventional transition path
sampling and the equilibrium theory, and the error due to path discretization
is also discussed.
