We use the annealed formulation of complex networks to study the dynamical
behavior of disease spreading on both static and adaptive networked systems.
This unifying approach relies on the annealed adjacency matrix, representing
one network ensemble, and allows to solve the dynamical evolution of the whole
network ensemble all at once. Our results accurately reproduce those obtained
by extensive numerical simulations showing a large improvement with respect to
the usual heterogeneous mean-field formulation. Moreover, by means of the
annealed formulation we derive a new heterogeneous mean-field formulation that
correctly reproduces the epidemic dynamics.
