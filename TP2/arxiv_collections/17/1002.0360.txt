We have studied experimentally the low temperature conductivity of mesoscopic
size InAs/GaSb quantum well Hall bar devices in the inverted regime. Using a
pair of electrostatic gates we were able to move the Fermi level into the
electron-hole hybridization state, and observe a mini gap. Temperature
dependence of the conductivity in the gap shows residual conductivity, which
can be consistently explained by the contributions from the free as well as the
hybridized carriers in the presence of impurity scattering, as proposed by
Naveh and Laikhtman [Euro. Phys. Lett., 55, 545-551 (2001)]. Experimental
implications for the stability of proposed helical edge states will be
discussed.
