One-dimensional lattice model of SU(2)_{4} anyons containing a transition
into the topological ordered phase state is considered. An effective low-energy
Hamiltonian is found for half-integer and integer indices of the type of
strongly correlated non-Abelian anyons. The Hilbert state space properties in
the considered modular tensor category are studied.
