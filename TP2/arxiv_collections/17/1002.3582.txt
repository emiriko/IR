The T35 is a small telescope (14") equipped with a large format CCD camera
installed in the Sierra Nevada Observatory (SNO) in Southern Spain. This
telescope will be a useful tool for the detecting and studying pulsating stars,
particularly, in open clusters. In this paper, we describe the automation
process of the T35 and show also some images taken with the new
instrumentation.
