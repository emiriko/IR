We study a non-linear convective-diffusive equation, local in space and time,
which has its background in the dynamics of the thickness of a wetting film.
The presence of a non-linear diffusion predicts the existence of fronts as well
as shock fronts. Despite the absence of memory effects, solutions in the case
of pure non-linear diffusion exhibit an anomalous sub-diffusive scaling. Due to
a balance between non-linear diffusion and convection we, in particular, show
that solitary waves appear. For large times they merge into a single solitary
wave exhibiting a topological stability. Even though our results concern a
specific equation, numerical simulations supports the view that anomalous
diffusion and the solitary waves disclosed will be general features in such
non-linear convective-diffusive dynamics.
