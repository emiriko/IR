We consider the support varieties of Demazure modules, certain $B$-modules
important in the representation theory of reductive groups. In many cases we
are able to compute these support varieties over $B_1$, the first Frobenius
kernel of a Borel subgroup, and relate them to orbital varieties. We provide a
complete calculation of the support varieties when the underlying algebraic
group has type $A_1$ or $A_2$. We also consider the saturation ($G$ orbit of)
$B_1$ support varieties for Demazure modules and show that the inclusion
relations among these varieties are compatible with the Bruhat order.
