The full abstraction result for PCF using game semantics requires one to
identify all innocent strategies that are innocently indistinguishable. This
involves a quantification over all innocent tests, cf. quantification over all
innocent contexts. Here we present a representation of innocent strategies that
equates innocently indistinguishable ones, yielding a representation of PCF
terms that equates precisely those terms that are observational equivalent.
