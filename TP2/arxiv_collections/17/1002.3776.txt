We report on the measurement of inclusive electron scattering off a carbon
target performed with CLAS at Jefferson Laboratory. A combination of three
different beam energies 1.161, 2.261 and 4.461 GeV allowed us to reach an
invariant mass of the final-state hadronic system W~2.4 GeV with four-momentum
transfers Q2 ranging from 0.2 to 5 GeV2. These data, together with previous
measurements of the inclusive electron scattering off proton and deuteron,
which cover a similar continuous two-dimensional region of Q2 and Bjorken
variable x, permit the study of nuclear modifications of the nucleon structure.
By using these, as well as other world data, we evaluated the F2 structure
function and its moments. Using an OPE-based twist expansion, we studied the
Q2-evolution of the moments, obtaining a separation of the leading-twist and
the total higher-twist terms. The carbon-to-deuteron ratio of the leading-twist
contributions to the F2 moments exhibits the well known EMC effect, compatible
with that discovered previously in x-space. The total higher-twist term in the
carbon nucleus appears, although with large systematic uncertainites, to be
smaller with respect to the deuteron case for n<7, suggesting partial parton
deconfinement in nuclear matter. We speculate that the spatial extension of the
nucleon is changed when it is immersed in the nuclear medium.
