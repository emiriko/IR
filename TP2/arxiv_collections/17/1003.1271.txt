We employ a fast and accurate algorithm to treat dielectric interfaces within
molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrate the importance of dielectric
boundary forces (DBFs) in two systems of interests in soft-condensed matter
science. We investigate a salt solution confined to a slit pore, and a model of
a DNA fragment translocating thorugh a narrow pore.
