Various methods of helioseismology are used to study the subsurface
properties of the sunspot in NOAA Active Region 9787. This sunspot was chosen
because it is axisymmetric, shows little evolution during 20-28 January 2002,
and was observed continuously by the MDI/SOHO instrument. (...) Wave travel
times and mode frequencies are affected by the sunspot. In most cases, wave
packets that propagate through the sunspot have reduced travel times. At short
travel distances, however, the sign of the travel-time shifts appears to depend
sensitively on how the data are processed and, in particular, on filtering in
frequency-wavenumber space. We carry out two linear inversions for wave speed:
one using travel-times and phase-speed filters and the other one using mode
frequencies from ring analysis. These two inversions give subsurface wave-speed
profiles with opposite signs and different amplitudes. (...) From this study of
AR9787, we conclude that we are currently unable to provide a unified
description of the subsurface structure and dynamics of the sunspot.
