We calculate the Casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate, both
described by the plasma model, the Drude model, or generalizations of the two
models. We compare the results at both zero and finite temperatures. At
asymptotically large separations we obtain analytical results for the
interaction that reveal a non-universal, i.e., material dependent interaction
for the plasma model. The latter result contains the asymptotic interaction for
Drude metals and perfect reflectors as different but universal limiting cases.
This observation is related to the screening of a static magnetic field by a
London superconductor. For small separations we find corrections to the
proximity force approximation (PFA) that support correlations between geometry
and material properties that are not captured by the Lifshitz theory. Our
results at finite temperatures reveal for Drude metals a non-monotonic
temperature dependence of the Casimir free energy and a negative entropy over a
sizeable range of separations.
