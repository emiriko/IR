A potential quantum information processor is proposed using a fullerene
peapod, i.e., an array of the endohedral fullerenes 15N@C60 or 31P@C60
contained in a single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). The qubits are encoded in
the nuclear spins of the doped atoms, while the electronic spins are used for
initialization and readout, as well as for two-qubit operations.
