Local laser excitation and temperature readout from the intensity ratio of
Stokes to anti-Stokes Raman scattering signals are employed to study the
thermal properties of a large graphene membrane. The concluded value of the
heat conductivity coefficient \kappa ~ 600 W/m \cdot K is smaller than
previously reported but still validates the conclusion that graphene is a very
good thermal conductor.
