The multiphoton resonance transitions between ground hyperfine states are
used for the time modulation of the electron capture decay of hydrogen like
ions with the Gamow-Teller transition $1^+\to 0^+$. The proposed mechanism
offers a time oscillating decay with the frequency up to 0.1 Hz. The experiment
to observe the modulation is proposed for ions stored in a Penning trap. An
attempt to understand the GSI anomaly with multiple photon transitions is made.
