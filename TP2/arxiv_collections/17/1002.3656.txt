We made high-resolution spectroscopic observations of limb-spicules in
H-alpha using the Vertical Spectrograph of Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida
Observatory. While more than half of the observed spicules have Gaussian
line-profiles, some spicules have distinctly asymmetric profiles which can be
fitted with two Gaussian components. The faster of these components has radial
velocities of 10 - 40 km/s and Doppler-widths of about 0.4 A which suggest that
it is from a single spicule oriented nearly along the line-of-sight. Profiles
of the slower components and the single-Gaussian type show very similar
characteristics. Their radial velocities are less than 10 km/s and the
Doppler-widths are 0.6 - 0.9 A. Non-thermal "macroturbulent" velocities of
order 30 km/s are required to explain these width-values.
