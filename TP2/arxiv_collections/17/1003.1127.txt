Quark interaction with topologically non-trivial gluonic fields, instantons
and sphalerons, violates \P and \CP symmetry. In the strong magnetic field of a
non-central nuclear collision such interactions lead to the charge separation
along the magnetic field, the so called chiral magnetic effect, which manifests
local parity violations. An experimental observation of the chiral magnetic
effect would be a direct proof for the existence of such physics. Recent STAR
results on charge and the reaction plane dependent correlations are consistent
with theoretical expectations for the chiral magnetic effect. IIn this paper I
discuss different approaches to experimental study of the local parity
violation, and propose future measurements which can clarify the picture. In
particular I propose to use central body-body U+U collisions to disentangle
correlations due to chiral magnetic effect from possible background
correlations due to elliptic flow. Further more quantitative studies can be
performed with collision of isobaric beams.
