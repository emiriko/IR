We update our Standard Model predictions for g-2 of the muon and for the
hadronic contributions to the running of the QED coupling, Delta
alpha^5_had(M_Z^2). Particular emphasis is put on recent changes in the
hadronic contributions from new data in the 2pi channel and from the energy
region just below 2 GeV.
