We report the coherent manipulation of electron spins in a double quantum dot
integrated with a micro-magnet. We performed electric dipole spin resonance
experiments in the continuous wave (CW) and pump-and-probe modes. We observed
two resonant CW peaks and two Rabi oscillations of the quantum dot current by
sweeping an external magnetic field at a fixed frequency. Two peaks and
oscillations are measured at different resonant magnetic field, which reflects
the fact that the local magnetic fields at each quantum dot are modulated by
the stray field of a micro-magnet. As predicted with a density matrix approach,
the CW current is quadratic with respect to microwave (MW) voltage while the
Rabi frequency (\nu_Rabi) is linear. The difference between the \nu_Rabi values
of two Rabi oscillations directly reflects the MW electric field across the two
dots. These results show that the spins on each dot can be manipulated
coherently at will by tuning the micro-magnet alignment and MW electric field.
