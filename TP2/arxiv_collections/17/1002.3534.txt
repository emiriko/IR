We give new proofs for the hardness amplification of efficiently samplable
predicates and of weakly verifiable puzzles which generalize to new settings.
More concretely, in the first part of the paper, we give a new proof of Yao's
XOR-Lemma that additionally applies to related theorems in the cryptographic
setting. Our proof seems simpler than previous ones, yet immediately
generalizes to statements similar in spirit such as the extraction lemma used
to obtain pseudo-random generators from one-way functions [Hastad, Impagliazzo,
Levin, Luby, SIAM J. on Comp. 1999].
  In the second part of the paper, we give a new proof of hardness
amplification for weakly verifiable puzzles, which is more general than
previous ones in that it gives the right bound even for an arbitrary monotone
function applied to the checking circuit of the underlying puzzle.
  Both our proofs are applicable in many settings of interactive cryptographic
protocols because they satisfy a property that we call "non-rewinding". In
particular, we show that any weak cryptographic protocol whose security is
given by the unpredictability of single bits can be strengthened with a natural
information theoretic protocol. As an example, we show how these theorems solve
the main open question from [Halevi and Rabin, TCC2008] concerning bit
commitment.
