We consider a freely falling holographic screen for the Schwarzschild and
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes and evaluate the entropic force \`a la
Verlinde. When the screen crosses the event horizon, the temperature of the
screen agrees to the Hawking temperature and the entropic force gives rise to
the surface gravity for both of the black holes.
