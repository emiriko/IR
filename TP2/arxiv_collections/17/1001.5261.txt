We compare the collider phenomenology of mirage mediation and deflected
mirage mediation, which are two recently proposed "mixed" supersymmetry
breaking scenarios motivated from string compactifications. The scenarios
differ in that deflected mirage mediation includes contributions from gauge
mediation in addition to the contributions from gravity mediation and anomaly
mediation also present in mirage mediation. The threshold effects from gauge
mediation can drastically alter the low energy spectrum from that of pure
mirage mediation models, resulting in some cases in a squeezed gaugino spectrum
and a gluino that is much lighter than other colored superpartners. We provide
several benchmark deflected mirage mediation models and construct model lines
as a function of the gauge mediation contributions, and discuss their discovery
potential at the LHC.
