Using first principles many-body theory methods (GW+BSE) we demonstrate that
optical properties of graphane are dominated by localized charge-transfer
excitations governed by enhanced electron correlations in a two-dimensional
dielectric medium. Strong electron-hole interaction leads to the appearance of
small radius bound excitons with spatially separated electron and hole, which
are localized out-of-plane and in-plane, respectively. The presence of such
bound excitons opens the path on excitonic Bose-Einstein condensate in graphane
that can be observed experimentally.
