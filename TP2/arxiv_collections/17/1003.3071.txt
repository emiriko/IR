Recent work of Foda and his group on a connection between classical
integrable hierarchies (the KP and 2D Toda hierarchies) and some quantum
integrable systems (the 6-vertex model with DWBC, the finite XXZ chain of spin
1/2, the phase model on a finite chain, etc.) is reviewed. Some additional
information on this issue is also presented.
