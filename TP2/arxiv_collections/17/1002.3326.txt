Topological design of terrestrial networks for communication via satellites
is studied in the paper. Quantitative model of the network cost-analysis
minimizing the total transmission and switching cost is described. Several
algorithms solving combinatorial problem of the optimal topology design based
on binary partitioning, a minimax parametric search and dynamic programming are
developed by the author and demonstrated with a numeric example. Analysis of
average complexity of the minimax parametric search algorithm is also provided.
