In this paper we present a novel apparatus aimed at measuring very small
birefringences and anisotropies, based on frequency metrology and not on
polarimetry as usual. In our experiment, a very high finesse resonant cavity is
used to convert the phase difference into a resonance frequency difference,
which can then be measured with very high accuracy. We describe the set-up and
present the results of experimental tests which exhibited a sensitivity dn ~ 2
x 10?18, allowing for the measurement of long-predicted magneto-electro-optical
effects in gases. Since the shotnoise limited sensitivity of our apparatus lies
well below the state-of-the-art sensitivity, frequency metrology appears as a
promising technique for small birefringence measurements.
