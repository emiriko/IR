Abridged : The various IBIS/ISGRI catalogues contain a large population of
hard X-ray sources whose nature is still unknown. Even if the $>20$ keV
positional uncertainty provided by ISGRI is unprecedented, it is still too
large to pinpoint the counterpart at other wavelengths, which is the only
secure way of obtaining a source identification. We continue the work of trying
to reveal the nature of these hard X-ray sources, starting with analysis of
X-ray data collected via focusing X-ray telescopes, in order to obtain arcsec
accurate X-ray positions. We can then identify counterparts at infrared and
optical wavelengths and try to unveil the nature of the sources. We analysed
data from observations of 13 \integral\ sources made with the \swift\
satellite. The X-ray images obtained by the X-Ray Telescope instrument allowed
us to find possible counterparts to the IGR sources with a positional accuracy
of a few arcsec. We then browsed the online catalogues to search for
counterparts at other wavelengths. We also made use of the X-ray spectral
parameters in trying to identify the nature of those objects. For the 13
objects, we found possible counterparts at X-ray energies and identified the
IR/optical and/or UV counterparts as seen with \swift/UVOT. We also discuss the
likelihood of association of the X-ray and \integral\ source in each case.
