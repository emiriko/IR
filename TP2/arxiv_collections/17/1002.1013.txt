We analyzed a long duration flare observed in a serendipitous XMM-Newton
detection of the M star CD-39 7717B (TWA 11B), member of the young stellar
association TW Hya (~ 8 Myr). Only the rise phase (with a duration of ~ 35 ks)
and possibly the flare peak were observed. We took advantage of the high
count-rate of the X-ray source to carry out a detailed analysis of its spectrum
during the whole exposure. After a careful analysis, we interpreted the rise
phase as resulting from the ignition of a first group of loops (event A) which
triggered a subsequent two-ribbon flare (event B). Event A was analyzed using a
single-loop model, while a two-ribbon model was applied for event B. Loop
semi-lengths of ~ 4 R* were obtained. Such large structures had been previously
observed in very young stellar objects (~ 1 - 4 Myr). This is the first time
that they have been inferred in a slightly more evolved star. The fluorescent
iron emission line at 6.4 keV was detected during event B. Since TWA 11B seems
to have no disk, the most plausible explanation found for its presence in the
X-ray spectrum of this star is collisional - or photo- ionization. As far as we
are concerned, this is only the third clear detection of Fe photospheric
fluorescence in stars other than the Sun.
