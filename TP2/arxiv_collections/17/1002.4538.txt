We investigate the interaction of neutrinos and antineutrinos with nuclei. We
explore in particular the role played by the multinucleon excitations which can
contaminate the quasielastic cross section. For neutrinos the multinucleon term
produces a sizable increase of the quasielastic cross section. Part of the
effect arises from tensor correlations. For antineutrinos this influence is
smaller owing to the axial-vector interference which increases the relative
importance of the terms which are not affected by these multinucleon
excitations.
