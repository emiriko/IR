Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to compute the centrality dependence of
the collision zone eccentricities ($\epsilon_{2,4}$), for both spherical and
deformed ground state nuclei, for different model scenarios. Sizable model
dependent differences are observed. They indicate that measurements of the
$2^{\text{nd}}$ and $4^{\text{th}}$ order Fourier flow coefficients $v_{2,4}$,
expressed as the ratio $\frac{v_4}{(v_2)^2}$, can provide robust constraints
for distinguishing between different theoretical models for the initial-state
eccentricity. Such constraints could remove one of the largest impediments to a
more precise determination of the specific viscosity from precision $v_{2,4}$
measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).
