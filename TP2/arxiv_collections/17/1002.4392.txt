This paper presents the integration into the GIPSY of Lucx's context calculus
defined in Wan's PhD thesis. We start by defining different types of tag sets,
then we explain the concept of context, the types of context and the context
calculus operators. Finally, we present how context entities have been
abstracted into Java classes and embedded into the GIPSY system.
