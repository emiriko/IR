The physical conditions of the gas forming the narrow line regions (NLR) in
active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been extensively studied in the optical band.
We take advantage of the spectacular extension ($\sim$15") of the NLR in the
type II Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 and of the complementary characteristics of
$XMM$--$Newton$ and $Chandra$ to investigate the physical conditions of the gas
in this galaxy. The X-ray data from $XMM$--$Newton$ are used to define the
spectral properties of the ionising nuclear source. The $Chandra$ data are used
to trace the spatial characteristics of the soft X-ray emission. This
information is then compared to the HST characteristics. The X-ray spectrum of
the nucleus of NGC 5252 is intrinsically flat and absorbed by neutral gas with
a column density N~10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Below 1 keV a soft excess is detected.
The high-resolution spectrum obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS shows the
presence, in the 0.2-1.5 keV range, of emission lines which strongly indicate
that the soft X-ray component is due to ionised gas. Moreover, the soft X-ray
emission is spatially resolved around and well overlaps the images obtained in
narrow [OIII] optical band. The [OIII]/soft-X flux ratios along the ionisation
cones is basically constant. This indicates that the electron density does not
significantly deviates from the r$^{-2}$ law (constant ionisation parameter).
This result combined with previous optical studies suggest two plausible but
different scenarios in the reconstruction of the last 30000 years history of
the central AGN. The most promising one is that the source is indeed a "quasar
relic" with steady and inefficient energy release from the accretion of matter
onto the central super-massive black-hole. This scenario is suggested also by
the flat nuclear X-ray spectrum that suggests an advection dominate accretion
flow (ADAF) like emission mechanism.
