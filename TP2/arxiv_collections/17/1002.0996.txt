We show that Cannon-Thurston maps exist for degenerate free groups without
parabolics, i.e. for handlebody groups. Combining these techniques with earlier
work proving the existence of Cannon-Thurston maps for surface groups, we show
that Cannon-Thurston maps exist for arbitrary finitely generated Kleinian
groups without parabolics, proving conjectures of Thurston and McMullen. We
also show that point pre-images under Cannon-Thurston maps for degenerate free
groups without parabolics correspond to end-points of leaves of an ending
lamination in the Masur domain, whenever a point has more than one pre-image.
This proves a conjecture of Otal. We also prove a similar result for point
pre-images under Cannon-Thurston maps for arbitrary finitely generated Kleinian
groups without parabolics.
