Explicit applications of factorization theorems for processes at hadron
colliders near the hadronic endpoint have largely focused on simple final
states with either no jets (e.g., Drell-Yan) or one inclusive jet (e.g., deep
inelastic scattering and prompt photon production). Factorization for the
former type of process gives rise to a soft function that depends on timelike
momenta, whereas the soft function for the latter type depends on null momenta.
We derive in soft-collinear effective theory a factorization theorem that
allows for an arbitrary number of jets, where the jets are defined with respect
to a jet algorithm, together with any number of non-strongly interacting
particles. We find the soft function in general depends on the null components
of the soft momenta inside the jets and on a timelike component of the soft
momentum outside of the jets. This generalizes and interpolates between the
soft functions for the cases of no jets and one inclusive jet. We verify
consistency of our factorization theorem to order alpha_s for any number of
jets. While in this paper we demonstrate consistency only near the hadronic
endpoint, we keep the kinematics general enough (in particular allowing for
nonzero boost) to allow for an extension to partonic threshold resummation away
from the hadronic endpoint.
