Geometric programming is an important class of optimization problems that
enable practitioners to model a large variety of real-world applications,
mostly in the field of engineering design. In many real life optimization
problem multi-objective programming plays a vital role in socio-economical and
industrial optimizing problems. In this paper we have discussed the basic
concepts and principle of multiple objective optimization problems and
developed geometric programming (GP) technique to solve this optimization
problem using weighted method to obtain the non-inferior solutions.
