In this paper we classify Weingarten surfaces integrable in the sense of
soliton theory. The criterion is that the associated Gauss equation possesses
an sl(2)-valued zero curvature representation with a nonremovable parameter.
Under certain restrictions on the jet order, the answer is given by a third
order ordinary differential equation to govern the functional dependence of the
principal curvatures. Employing the scaling and translation (offsetting)
symmetry, we give a general solution of the governing equation in terms of
elliptic integrals. We show that the instances when the elliptic integrals
degenerate to elementary functions were known to nineteenth century geometers.
Finally, we characterize the associated normal congruences.
