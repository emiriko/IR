We study ultra-cold neutral fermion superfluids in the presence of fictitious
magnetic fields, as well as charged fermion superfluids in the presence of real
magnetic fields. Charged fermion superfluids undergo a phase transition from
type-I to type-II superfluidity, where the magnetic properties of the
superfluid change from being a perfect diamagnet without vortices to a partial
diamagnet with the emergence of the Abrikosov vortex lattice. The transition
from type-I to type-II superfluidity is tunned by changing the scattering
parameter (interaction) for fixed density. We also find that neutral fermion
superfluids such as $^6$Li and $^{40}$K are extreme type-II superfluids, and
that they are more robust to the penetration of a fictitious magnetic field in
the BCS-BEC crossover region near unitarity, where the critical fictitious
magnetic field reaches a maximum as a function of the scattering parameter
(interaction).
