Using nonequilibrium Green functions and several complementary many-body
approximations we calculate shot noise and spin dependent conductance in carbon
nanotube semiconducting quantum dot in spin-orbital Kondo regime. We point out
on the possibility of reaching giant values of tunnel magnetoresistance in this
range and discuss a prospect of its gate control. We also analyze the influence
of symmetry breaking perturbations on the shot noise with special emphasis on
spin dependent effects. The gate and bias dependencies of noise Fano factors
influenced by magnetic field, polarization of electrodes and spin-flip
processes are presented.
