C.H. Yang discovered a polynomial version of the classical Lagrange identity
expressing the product of two sums of four squares as another sum of four
squares. He used it to give short proofs of some important theorems on
composition of delta-codes (now known as T-sequences). We investigate the
possible new versions of his polynomial Lagrange identity. Our main result
shows that all such identities are equivalent to each other.
