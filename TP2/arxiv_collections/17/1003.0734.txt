The analysis of chaotic signals with time-frequency methods is considered.
For this purpose, two new transformations are presented which consist in the
decomposition of a signal onto an orthogonal set of respectively linear and
hyperbolic chirps. The linear chirp transformation is able to discriminate and
extract particular chaotic components in non-stationary square integrable
signals. This is demonstrated in an example studying the reflectometry measures
of a turbulent plasma. The hyperbolic chirp transformation is designed for the
detection and extraction of chaotic parts in self-similar processes such as
stochastic motions. Mathematical connections are made between these two methods
and other well-known transformations.
