Using the notion, developed in an earlier paper, of "representation" of
"position" by a vector in a vector space with an inner product, we show that
the Lorentz Transformation Equations relating positions in two different
reference frames can be put in a particularly simple form which could be said
to be "Galilean". We emphasize that two different reference frames can use a
common vector space for representation but with two different inner products.
The inner products are defined through the observational set-up of each frame.
