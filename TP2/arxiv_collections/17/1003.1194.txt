The effects of noncommutativity on the phase space of a dilatonic
cosmological model is investigated. The existence of such noncommutativity
results in a deformed Poisson algebra between the minisuperspace variables and
their momenta conjugate. For an exponential dilaton potential, the exact
solutions in the commutative and noncommutative cases, are presented and
compared. We use these solutions to address the late time acceleration issue of
cosmic evolution.
