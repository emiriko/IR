Conjectures of J. Igusa for p-adic local zeta functions and of J. Denef and
F. Loeser for topological local zeta functions assert that (the real part of)
the poles of these local zeta functions are roots of the Bernstein-Sato
polynomials (i.e. the b-functions). We prove these conjectures for certain
hyperplane arrangements, including the case of reduced hyperplane arrangements
in three-dimensional affine space.
