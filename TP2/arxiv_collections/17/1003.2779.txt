Stable vortices with topological charge of 3 and 4 are examined numerically
and analytically in photonic quasicrystals created by interference of 5 as well
as 8 beams, in the cases of cubic as well as saturable nonlinearities. These
structures are experimentally realizable, including a prototypical example of a
stable charge 4 vortex. Direct numerical simulations corroborate the analytical
and numerical linear stability analysis predictions.
