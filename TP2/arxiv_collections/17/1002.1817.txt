We start from a Hamiltonian describing non-interacting fermions and add
bosons to the model, with a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction between the bosons
and fermions. Because of the specific form of the interaction the model can be
solved exactly. In the ground state, part of the electrons form bound pairs
with opposite momentum and spin. The model also shows a gap in the kinetic
energy of the fermions, but not in the spectrum of the full Hamiltonian. This
gap is not of a mean-field nature, but is due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
