A simple extension of the Standard Model providing TeV scale seesaw mechanism
is presented. Beside the Standard Model particles and right-handed Majorana
neutrinos, the model contains a singly charged scalar, an extra Higgs doublet
and three vector like singly charged fermions. In our model, Dirac neutrino
mass matrix raises only at the loop level. Small but non-zero Majorana neutrino
masses come from integrating out heavy Majorana neutrinos, which can be at the
TeV scale. The phenomenologies of the model are investigated, including scalar
mass spectrum, neutrino masses and mixings, lepton flavor violations, heavy
neutrino magnetic moments as well as possible collider signatures of the model
at the LHC.
