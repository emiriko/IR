The Schr\"{o}dinger equation and ladder operators for the harmonic oscillator
are shown to simplify through the use of an isometric conformal transformation.
These results are discussed in relation to the Bargmann representation. It is
further demonstrated that harmonic interactions can be introduced into quantum
mechanics as an imaginary component of time equivalent to adding the oscillator
potential into the hamiltonian for the confined particle.
