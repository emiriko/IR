Researchers in many scientific fields make inferences from individuals to
larger groups. For many groups however, there is no list of members from which
to take a random sample. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new
sampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty by using the social
networks of the groups under study. The RDS method has been shown to provide
unbiased estimates of population proportions given certain conditions. The
method is now widely used in the study of HIV-related high-risk populations
globally. In this paper, we test the RDS methodology by simulating RDS studies
on the social networks of a large LGBT web community. The robustness of the RDS
method is tested by violating, one by one, the conditions under which the
method provides unbiased estimates. Results reveal that the risk of bias is
large if networks are directed, or respondents choose to invite persons based
on characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. If these two
problems are absent, the RDS method shows strong resistance to low response
rates and certain errors in the participants' reporting of their network sizes.
Other issues that might affect the RDS estimates, such as the method for
choosing initial participants, the maximum number of recruitments per
participant, sampling with or without replacement and variations in network
structures, are also simulated and discussed.
