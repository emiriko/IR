Detailed study of the LDOS associated with the surface-state-band near a
step-edge of the strong topological-insulator Bi2Te3, reveal a one-dimensional
bound state that runs parallel to the stepedge and is bound to it at some
characteristic distance. This bound state is clearly observed in the bulk gap
region, while it becomes entangled with the oscillations of the warped surface
band at high energy, and with the valence band states near the Dirac point.
Using the full effective Hamiltonian proposed by Zhang et al., we obtain a
closed formula for this bound state that fits the data and provide further
insight into the general topological properties of the electronic structure of
the surface band near strong structural defects.
