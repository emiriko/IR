When the financial information is difficult to produce, interpret, compare
and analyze, we are put in the situation to face inconvenient consequences with
negative repercussions, such as: the investor can give up the investment (with
negative consequences on the risk equity market), the banks may not give loans,
an auditor may not consider the financial statements as being credible etc.
These facts allow the introduction of this paper's main objective, the
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) which is an open standard,
independent and international for the treatments, opportunity, correctness,
efficiency and minor costs of the financial and economical information. The
XBRL will be analyzed in the second part of the paper, the history of this
electronic communication language will be described, as there will also be
described the promoting organizations, the base technology (the WEB and XML
architecture which will be the next stage of the internet programming), and the
role it has within the chain of reporting between the XBRL consortium and the
international accounting organizations IASB-CI. This taxonomy serves clearly
every accounting and extra- accounting information made by the company. This
information which is treated in present by resorting to various formats or
structures (most times incompatible between them and the owners) will be
standardized with the XBRL.
