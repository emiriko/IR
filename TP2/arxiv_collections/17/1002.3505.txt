We study the ground state pair-correlation properties of a weakly interacting
trapped Bose gas in three dimension by using a correlated many-body method. Use
of the van der Waals interaction potential and an external trapping potential
shows realistic features. We also test the validity of shape-independent
approximation in the calculation of correlation properties.
