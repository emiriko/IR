The multiple system V505 Sagittarii is composed of at least three stars: a
compact eclipsing pair and a distant component, which orbit is measured
directly using speckle interferometry. In order to explain the observed orbit
of the third body in V505 Sagittarii and also other observable quantities,
namely the minima timings of the eclipsing binary and two different radial
velocities in the spectrum, we thoroughly test a fourth-body hypothesis - a
perturbation by a dim, yet-unobserved object. We use an N-body numerical
integrator to simulate future and past orbital evolution of 3 or 4 components
in this system. We construct a suitable chi^2 metric from all available
speckle-interferometry, minima-timings and radial-velocity data and we scan a
part of a parameter space to get at least some of allowed solutions. In
principle, we are able to explain all observable quantities by a presence of a
fourth body, but the resulting likelihood of this hypothesis is very low. We
also discuss other theoretical explanations of the minima timings variations.
Further observations of the minima timings during the next decade or
high-resolution spectroscopic data can significantly constrain the model.
