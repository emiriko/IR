We suggest a method for creating bright matter solitons by loading a BEC of
atoms in a driven tilted optical lattice. It is shown that one can realize the
self-focussing regime for the wave-packet dynamics by properly adjusting the
phase of the driving field with respect to the phase of Bloch oscillations. If
atom-atom interactions are larger than some critical value $g_{min}$, this
self-focussing regime is followed by the formation of bright solitons.
Increasing the interactions above another critical value $g_{max}$ makes this
process unstable. Instead of soliton formation one now meets the phenomenon of
incoherent self-trapping. In this regime a fraction of atoms is trapped in
incoherent localized wave-packets, while the remaining atoms spread
ballistically.
