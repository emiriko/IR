We study inelastic gases in two dimensions using event-driven molecular
dynamics simulations. Our focus is the nature of the stationary state attained
by rare injection of large amounts of energy to balance the dissipation due to
collisions. We find that under such extreme driving, with the injection rate
much smaller than the collision rate, the velocity distribution has a power-law
high energy tail. The numerically measured exponent characterizing this tail is
in excellent agreement with predictions of kinetic theory over a wide range of
system parameters. We conclude that driving by rare but powerful energy
injection leads to a well-mixed gas and constitutes an alternative mechanism
for agitating granular matter. In this distinct nonequilibrium steady-state,
energy cascades from large to small scales. Our simulations also show that when
the injection rate is comparable with the collision rate, the velocity
distribution has a stretched exponential tail.
