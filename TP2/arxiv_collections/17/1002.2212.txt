Since solar-like oscillations were first detected in red-giant stars, the
presence of non-radial oscillation modes has been debated. Spectroscopic
line-profile analysis was used in the first attempt to perform mode
identification, which revealed that non-radial modes are observable. Despite
the fact that the presence of non-radial modes could be confirmed, the degree
or azimuthal order could not be uniquely identified. Here we present an
improvement to this first spectroscopic line-profile analysis. Aims: We aim to
study line-profile variations of stochastically excited solar-like oscillations
in four evolved stars to derive the azimuthal order of the observed mode and
the surface rotational frequency. Methods: Spectroscopic line-profile analysis
is applied to cross-correlation functions, using the Fourier Parameter Fit
method on the amplitude and phase distributions across the profiles. Results:
For four evolved stars, beta Hydri (G2IV), epsilon Ophiuchi (G9.5III), eta
Serpentis (K0III) and delta Eridani (K0IV) the line-profile variations reveal
the azimuthal order of the oscillations with an accuracy of ~1. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals the projected rotational velocity and the inclination
angle. From these parameters we obtain the surface rotational frequency.
Conclusions: We conclude that line-profile variations of cross-correlation
functions behave differently for different frequencies and that they provide
additional information in terms of the surface rotational frequency and
azimuthal order.
