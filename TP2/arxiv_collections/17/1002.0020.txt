Let $n$ be a positive integer and consider the Diophantine equation of
generalized Fermat type $x^2+y^{2n}=z^3$ in nonzero coprime integer unknowns
$x,y,z$. Using methods of modular forms and Galois representations for
approaching Diophantine equations, we show that for $n \in \{5, 31\}$ there are
no solutions to this equation. Combining this with previously known results,
this allows a complete description of all solutions to the Diophantine equation
above for $n \leq 10^7$. Finally, we show that there are also no solutions for
$n\equiv -1 \pmod{6}$.
