We study phase separation in mixed monolayers of neutral and highly
negatively charged lipids, induced by the addition of divalent positively
charged counterions. We find good agreement between experiments on mixtures of
pip2 and sopc and simulations of a simplified model in which only the essential
electrostatic interactions are retained. Thus, our results support an
interpretation of pip2 clustering as governed primarily by electrostatic
interactions, in which divalent ions such as calcium mediate an effective
attraction between like-charged lipids. Surprisingly, the mediated attractions
are strong enough to give nearly complete phase separation, so that clusters
can even form when the overall concentration of pip2 is low, as is the case in
the cell membrane.
