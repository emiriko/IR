A high-statistics sample of charged-current muon neutrino scattering events
collected with the MiniBooNE experiment is analyzed to extract the first
measurement of the double differential cross section ($\frac{d^2\sigma}{dT_\mu
d\cos\theta_\mu}$) for charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) scattering on
carbon. This result features minimal model dependence and provides the most
complete information on this process to date. With the assumption of CCQE
scattering, the absolute cross section as a function of neutrino energy
($\sigma[E_\nu]$) and the single differential cross section
($\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}$) are extracted to facilitate comparison with previous
measurements. These quantities may be used to characterize an effective
axial-vector form factor of the nucleon and to improve the modeling of
low-energy neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. The results are relevant
for experiments searching for neutrino oscillations.
