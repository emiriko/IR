The transport coefficients of causal relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics
are calculated both in a field-theoretical and a kinetic approach. We find that
the results from the traditional kinetic calculation by Israel and Stewart are
modified. The new expressions for the viscous transport coefficients agree with
the results obtained in the field-theoretical approach when the contributions
from pair creation and annihilation are neglected.
