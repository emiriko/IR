We use a Carleman type inequality of Koch and Tataru to obtain quantitative
estimates of unique continuation for solutions of second order elliptic
equations with singular lower order terms. First we prove a three sphere
inequality and then describe two methods of propagation of smallness from sets
of positive measure.
