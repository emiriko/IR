We report superconducting (SC) properties of stoichiometric LiFeAs (Tc = 17
K) studied by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and angle-resolved
photoemission (ARPES). Although the vortex lattice exhibits no long-range
order, well-defined SANS rocking curves indicate better ordering than in
chemically doped 122-compounds. The London penetration depth of 210 nm,
determined from the magnetic field dependence of the form factor, is compared
to that calculated from the ARPES band structure with no adjustable parameters.
Its temperature dependence is best described by a single isotropic SC gap of
3.0 meV, which agrees with the ARPES value of 3.1 meV and corresponds to the
ratio 2Delta/kTc = 4.1, approaching the weak-coupling limit predicted by the
BCS theory. This classifies LiFeAs as a weakly coupled single-gap
superconductor, similar to conventional metals.
