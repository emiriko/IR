Calculations of the relaxation energy, contact pair-correlation function, and
annihilating-pair momentum density for a single positron immersed in a
homogeneous electron gas are presented. We achieve an accurate description of
the electron-positron correlation effects by working in the reference frame in
which the positron is stationary and using a mean-field approach based on
single-component density functional theory. Our positron relaxation energies
and annihilation rates are similar to those from the best existing many-body
calculations. Our annihilating-pair momentum densities are significantly
different from previous data, and include a "tail" beyond the Fermi edge.
