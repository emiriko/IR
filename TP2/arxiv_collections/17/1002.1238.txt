A sailing simulator has been developed from a new point of view. It will
rather be for the sailor to use it than for the architect. One boat which
characteristics were already known has been chosen. The whole coupled mechanic
equations system has been solved. Heave and pitch equations, usually neglected,
have been introduced to evaluate each trim of the crew and provide an optimal
ride analysis tool. In this paper, efforts models and their determination's
method are briefly presented. A tack simulation is shown as a brief overview on
the simulator possibilities.
