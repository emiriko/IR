RFID is not a new technology and has passed through many decades of use in
military, airline, library, security, healthcare, sports, animal farms and
other areas. Industries use RFID for various applications such as
personal/vehicle access control, departmental store security, equipment
tracking, baggage, fast food establishments, logistics, etc. The enhancement in
RFID technology has brought advantages that are related to resource
optimization, increased efficiency within business processes, and enhanced
customer care, overall improvements in business operations and healthcare. Our
research is part of a big project; its aim is to produce a model for mobile
technology implementation of hospital patients' movement process. However, the
focus of this paper is to explore the main RFID components, i.e. the tag,
antenna and reader. The results of the investigations conducted on the three
RFID components will be used to develop our research model.
