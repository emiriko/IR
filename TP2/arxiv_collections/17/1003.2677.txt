The shift from an information society to a knowledge society require rapid
information harvesting, reliable search and instantaneous on demand delivery.
Information extraction agents are used to explore and collect data available
from Web, in order to effectively exploit such data for business purposes, such
as automatic news filtering, advertisement or product searching and price
comparing. In this paper, we develop a real-time automatic harvesting agent for
adverts posted on Servihoo web portal and an SMS-based notification system. It
uses the URL of the web portal and the object model, i.e., the fields of
interests and a set of rules written using the HTML parsing functions to
extract latest adverts information. The extraction engine executes the
extraction rules and stores the information in a database to be processed for
automatic notification. This intelligent system helps to tremendously save
time. It also enables users or potential product buyers to react more quickly
to changes and newly posted sales adverts, paving the way to real-time best buy
deals.
