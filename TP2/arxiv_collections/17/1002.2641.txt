We use the flat space limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence to derive a simple
relation between the 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of massless string states in
type IIB superstring theory on ten-dimensional Minkowski space and a scaling
limit of the N=4 super Yang-Mills four point functions. We conjecture that this
relation holds non-perturbatively and at arbitrarily high energy.
