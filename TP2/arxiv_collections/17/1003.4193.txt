In this paper we continue our study of the dual SL(2,C) symmetry of the BFKL
equation, analogous to the dual conformal symmetry of N=4 Super Yang Mills. We
find that the ordinary and dual SL(2,C) symmetries do not generate a Yangian,
in contrast to the ordinary and dual conformal symmetries in the
four-dimensional gauge theory. The algebraic structure is still reminiscent of
that of N=4 SYM, however, and one can extract a generator from the dual SL(2,C)
close to the bi-local form associated with Yangian algebras. We also discuss
the issue of whether the dual SL(2,C) symmetry, which in its original form is
broken by IR effects, is broken in a controlled way, similar to the way the
dual conformal symmetry of N=4 satisfies an anomalous Ward identity. At least
for the lowest orders it seems possible to recover the dual SL(2,C) by
deforming its representation, keeping open the possibility that it is an exact
symmetry of BFKL.
