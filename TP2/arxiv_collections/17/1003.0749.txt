The investigations on the flux relaxation phenomenon of a type-II
superconductor are important because they provide the information about the
flux pinning ability and current-carrying ability of the superconductor.
However, a unified theory of flux relaxation is currently unavailable. Here I
present a general mathematical model of the flux relaxation. In this model, I
proposed a series expansion to the activation energy and derived a general
formula for the current decay behavior. In the light of these formulas, I can
analyze the experimental data on the current decay behavior and then calculate
the activation energy of a vortex system without subjecting to any special
conditions. The results are accurate for the current decay measurements from a
$Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$ superconductor
