This paper is devoted to the description of the lack of compactness of
$H^1_{rad}(\R^2)$ in the Orlicz space. Our result is expressed in terms of the
concentration-type examples derived by P. -L. Lions. The approach that we adopt
to establish this characterization is completely different from the methods
used in the study of the lack of compactness of Sobolev embedding in Lebesgue
spaces and take into account the variational aspect of Orlicz spaces. We also
investigate the feature of the solutions of non linear wave equation with
exponential growth, where the Orlicz norm plays a decisive role.
