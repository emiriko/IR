We performed a photon generation experiment by laser-Compton scattering at
the KEK-ATF, aiming to develop a Compton based polarized positron source for
linear colliders. In the experiment, laser pulses with a 357 MHz repetition
rate were accumulated and their power was enhanced by up to 250 times in the
Fabry-Perot optical resonant cavity. We succeeded in synchronizing the laser
pulses and colliding them with the 1.3 GeV electron beam in the ATF ring while
maintaining the laser pulse accumulation in the cavity. As a result, we
observed 26.0 +/- 0.1 photons per electron-laser pulse crossing, which
corresponds to a yield of 10^8 photons in a second.
