Quantum strategies have been successfully applied to game theory for years.
However, as a reverse problem of game theory, the theory of mechanism design is
ignored by physicists. In this paper, the theory of mechanism design is
generalized to a quantum domain. The main result is that by virtue of a quantum
mechanism, agents who satisfy a certain condition can combat "bad" social
choice rules instead of being restricted by the traditional mechanism design
theory.
