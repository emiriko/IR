We study suitable parameters and relations in a numerical semigroup S. When S
is the Weierstrass semigroup at a rational point P of a projective curve C, we
evaluate the Feng-Rao order bound of the associated family of Goppa codes.
Further we conjecture that the order bound is always greater than a fixed value
easily deduced from the parameters of the semigroup: we also prove this
inequality in several cases.
