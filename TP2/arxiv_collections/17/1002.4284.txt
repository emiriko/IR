Thermal fluctuation of the cantilever position sets a fundamental limit for
the precision of any Scanning Force Microscope. In the present work we analyse
how these fluctuations limit the determination of the resonance frequency of
the tip-sample system. The basic principles of frequency detection in Dynamic
Scanning Force Microscopy are revised and the precise response of a typical
frequency detection unit to thermal fluctuation of the cantilever is analysed
in detail. A general relation for thermal frequency noise is found as a
function of measurement bandwidth and cantilever oscillation. For large
oscillation amplitude and low bandwidth, this relation converges to the result
known from the literature, while for low oscillation amplitude and large
bandwidth we find that the thermal frequency noise is equal to the width of the
resonance curve and therefore stays finite, contrary to what is predicted by
the relation known so far. The results presented in this work fundamentally
determine the ultimate limits of Dynamic Scanning Force Microscopy.
