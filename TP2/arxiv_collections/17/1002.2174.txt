Polymerization of proteins is a biochimical process involved in different
diseases. Mathematically, it is generally modeled by
aggregation-fragmentation-type equations. In this paper we consider a general
polymerization model and propose a high-order numerical scheme to investigate
the behavior of the solution. An important property of the equation is the mass
conservation. The fifth-order WENO scheme is built to preserve the total mass
of proteins along time.
