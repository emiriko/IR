We summarize the sensitivity achieved by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational
wave detectors for compact binary coalescence (CBC) searches during LIGO's
fifth science run and Virgo's first science run. We present noise spectral
density curves for each of the four detectors that operated during these
science runs which are representative of the typical performance achieved by
the detectors for CBC searches. These spectra are intended for release to the
public as a summary of detector performance for CBC searches during these
science runs.
