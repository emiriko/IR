We demonstrate that a single-photon field modulated with n different
pseudorandom phase sequences (PPSs) can constitute a 2^n-dimensional Hilbert
space that contains tensor product structure. By using the single photon field
modulated with PPSs, we discuss effective simulation of Bell states and GHZ
state, and apply both correlation analysis and von Neumann entropy to
characterize the simulation. We obtain similar results with the cases in
quantum mechanics and find that the conclusions can be easily generalized to n
quantum particles. The research on simulation of quantum entanglement may be
important, for it not only provides useful insights into fundamental features
of quantum entanglement, but also yields new insights into quantum computation.
