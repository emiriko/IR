The nuclear collective excitations are studied within Landau Fermi liquid
theory. By using the nucleon-nucleon interaction of the linear sigma-omega
model, the nuclear collective excitation energies of different values of $l$
are obtained, which are fitted with the centroid energies of the giant
resonances of spherical nuclei, respectively. In addition, it is pointed out
that the isovector giant resonances except l=1 correspond to the modes that
protons are in the creation state and neutrons are in the annihilation state,
and vice versa. Some mixtures of the nuclear collective excitation states with
different values of l are predicted.
