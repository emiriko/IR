The K-orbital electron capture in ions with one or two electrons is analized
for a general allowed nuclear transition. For ionic hyperfine states the
angular neutrino distribution and the electron capture rate are given in terms
of nuclear matrix elements. A possible application towards the determination of
neutrino parameters is outlined.
