We constrain the distribution of calcium across the surface of the white
dwarf star G29-38 by combining time series spectroscopy from Gemini-North with
global time series photometry from the Whole Earth Telescope. G29-38 is
actively accreting metals from a known debris disk. Since the metals sink
significantly faster than they mix across the surface, any inhomogeneity in the
accretion process will appear as an inhomogeneity of the metals on the surface
of the star. We measure the flux amplitudes and the calcium equivalent width
amplitudes for two large pulsations excited on G29-38 in 2008. The ratio of
these amplitudes best fits a model for polar accretion of calcium and rules out
equatorial accretion.
