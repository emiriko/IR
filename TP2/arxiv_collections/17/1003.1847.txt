We study expectation values of observables in three-dimensional spinfoam
quantum gravity coupled to Dirac fermions. We revisit the model introduced by
one of the authors and extend it to the case of massless fermionic fields. We
introduce observables, analyse their symmetries and the corresponding proper
gauge fixing. The Berezin integral over the fermionic fields is performed and
the fermionic observables are expanded in open paths and closed loops
associated to pure quantum gravity observables. We obtain the vertex amplitudes
for gauge-invariant observables, while the expectation values of gauge-variant
observables, such as the fermion propagator, are given by the evaluation of
particular spin networks.
