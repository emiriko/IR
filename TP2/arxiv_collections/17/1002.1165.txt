Within the picture of jet quenching induced by multiple parton scattering and
gluon bremsstrahlung, medium modification of parton fragmentation functions and
therefore the suppression of large transverse momentum hadron spectra are
controlled by both the value and the space-time profile of the jet transport
parameter along the jet propagation path. Experimental data on single hadron
suppression in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC energy are analyzed
within the higher-twist (HT) approach to the medium modified fragmentation
functions and the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) parton
model. Assuming that the jet transport parameter $\hat q$ is proportional to
the particle number density in both QGP and hadronic phase, experimental data
on jet quenching in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets can
provide guidance on $\hat q_{h}$ in the hot hadronic matter. One can then study
the dependence of extracted initial value of jet quenching parameter $\hat
q_{0}$ at initial time $\tau_{0}$ on the bulk medium evolution. Effects of
transverse expansion, radial flow, phase transition and non-equilibrium
evolution are examined. The extracted values are found to vary from $\hat
q_{0}\tau_{0}= 0.54$ GeV$^{2}$ in the (1+3)d ideal hydrodynamic model to 0.96
GeV$^{2}$ in a cascade model, with the main differences coming from the initial
non-equilibrium evolution and the later hadronic evolution. The overall
contribution to jet quenching from the hadronic phase, about 22-44%, is found
to be significant. Therefore, realistic description of the early
non-equilibrium parton evolution and later hadronic interaction will be
critical for accurate extraction of the jet transport parameter in the strongly
interacting QGP phase in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
