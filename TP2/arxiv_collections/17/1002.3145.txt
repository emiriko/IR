From various cosmological, astrophysical and terrestrial requirements, we
derive conservative upper bounds on the present-day fraction of the mass of the
Galactic dark matter (DM) halo in charged massive particles (CHAMPs). If dark
matter particles are neutral but decay lately into CHAMPs, the lack of
detection of heavy hydrogen in sea water and the vertical pressure equilibrium
in the Galactic disc turn out to put the most stringent bounds. Adopting very
conservative assumptions about the recoiling velocity of CHAMPs in the decay
and on the decay energy deposited in baryonic gas, we find that the lifetime
for decaying neutral DM must be > (0.9-3.4)x 10^3 Gyr. Even assuming the
gyroradii of CHAMPs in the Galactic magnetic field are too small for halo
CHAMPs to reach Earth, the present-day fraction of the mass of the Galactic
halo in CHAMPs should be < (0.4-1.4)x 10^{-2}. We show that redistributing the
DM through the coupling between CHAMPs and the ubiquitous magnetic fields
cannot be a solution to the cuspy halo problem in dwarf galaxies.
