This article describes the implementation in the software package NumGfun of
classical algorithms that operate on solutions of linear differential equations
or recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients, including what seems to
be the first general implementation of the fast high-precision numerical
evaluation algorithms of Chudnovsky & Chudnovsky. In some cases, our
descriptions contain improvements over existing algorithms. We also provide
references to relevant ideas not currently used in NumGfun.
