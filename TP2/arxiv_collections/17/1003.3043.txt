I discuss the inadequacy of the "projected density" prescription to be used
in density dependent forces/functionals when calculations beyond mean field are
pursued. The case of calculations aimed at the symmetry restoration of mean
fields obtained with effective realistic forces of the Skyrme or Gogny type is
considered in detail. It is shown that at least for the restoration of spatial
symmetries like rotations, translations or parity the above prescription yields
catastrophic results for the energy that drive the intrinsic wave function to
configurations with infinite deformation, preventing thereby its use both in
projection after and before variation.
