We consider the dimensionality-reduction problem (finding a subspace
approximation of observed data) for contaminated data in the high dimensional
regime, where the number of observations is of the same magnitude as the number
of variables of each observation, and the data set contains some (arbitrarily)
corrupted observations. We propose a High-dimensional Robust Principal
Component Analysis (HR-PCA) algorithm that is tractable, robust to contaminated
points, and easily kernelizable. The resulting subspace has a bounded deviation
from the desired one, achieves maximal robustness -- a breakdown point of 50%
while all existing algorithms have a breakdown point of zero, and unlike
ordinary PCA algorithms, achieves optimality in the limit case where the
proportion of corrupted points goes to zero.
