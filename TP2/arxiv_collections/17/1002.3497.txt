The advance in laser plasma acceleration techniques pushes the regime of the
resulting accelerated particles to higher energies and intensities. In
particular the upcoming experiments with the FLAME laser at LNF will enter the
GeV regime with almost 1pC of electrons. From the current status of
understanding of the acceleration mechanism, relatively large angular and
energy spreads are expected. There is therefore the need to develop a device
capable to measure the energy of electrons over three orders of magnitude (few
MeV to few GeV) under still unknown angular divergences. Within the PlasmonX
experiment at LNF a spectrometer is being constructed to perform these
measurements. It is made of an electro-magnet and a screen made of
scintillating fibers for the measurement of the trajectories of the particles.
The large range of operation, the huge number of particles and the need to
focus the divergence present unprecedented challenges in the design and
construction of such a device. We will present the design considerations for
this spectrometer and the first results from a prototype.
