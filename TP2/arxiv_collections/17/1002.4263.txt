We consider Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with
discrete input alphabets. We propose a non-diagonal precoder based on the
X-Codes in \cite{Xcodes_paper} to increase the mutual information. The MIMO
channel is transformed into a set of parallel subchannels using Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) and X-Codes are then used to pair the subchannels. X-Codes
are fully characterized by the pairings and a $2\times 2$ real rotation matrix
for each pair (parameterized with a single angle). This precoding structure
enables us to express the total mutual information as a sum of the mutual
information of all the pairs. The problem of finding the optimal precoder with
the above structure, which maximizes the total mutual information, is solved by
{\em i}) optimizing the rotation angle and the power allocation within each
pair and {\em ii}) finding the optimal pairing and power allocation among the
pairs. It is shown that the mutual information achieved with the proposed
pairing scheme is very close to that achieved with the optimal precoder by Cruz
{\em et al.}, and is significantly better than Mercury/waterfilling strategy by
Lozano {\em et al.}. Our approach greatly simplifies both the precoder
optimization and the detection complexity, making it suitable for practical
applications.
