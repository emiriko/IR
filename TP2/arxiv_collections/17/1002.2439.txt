Titles are denoted by the TITLE element within a web page. We queried the
title against the the Yahoo search engine to determine the page's status
(found, not found). We conducted several tests based on elements of the title.
These tests were used to discern whether we could predict a pages status based
on the title. Our results increase our ability to determine bad titles but not
our ability to determine good titles.
