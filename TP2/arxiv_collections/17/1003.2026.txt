The short range ordered magnetic correlations have been studied in half doped
La0.5Ca0.5-xSrxMnO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.4) compounds by polarized neutron
scattering technique. On doping Sr2+ for Ca2+ ion, these compounds with x =
0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 exhibit CE-type, mixture of CE-type and A-type, and A-type
antiferromagnetic ordering, respectively. Magnetic diffuse scattering is
observed in all the compounds above and below their respective magnetic
ordering temperatures and is attributed to magnetic polarons. The correlations
are primarily ferromagnetic in nature above T\_N, although a small
antiferromagnetic contribution is also evident. Additionally, in samples x =
0.1 and 0.3 with CE-type antiferromagnetic ordering, superlattice diffuse
reflections are observed indicating correlations between magnetic polarons. On
lowering temperature below T\_N the diffuse scattering corresponding to
ferromagnetic correlations is suppressed and the long range ordered
antiferromagnetic state is established. However, the short range ordered
correlations indicated by enhanced spin flip scattering at low Q coexist with
long range ordered state down to 3K. In x = 0.4 sample with A-type
antiferromagnetic ordering, superlattice diffuse reflections are absent.
Additionally, in comparison to x = 0.1 and 0.3 sample, the enhanced spin flip
scattering at low Q is reduced at 310K, and as temperature is reduced below
200K, it becomes negligibly low. The variation of radial correlation function,
g(r) with temperature indicates rapid suppression of ferromagnetic correlations
at the first nearest neighbor on approaching TN. Sample x = 0.4 exhibits growth
of ferromagnetic phase at intermediate temperatures (~ 200K). This has been
further explored using SANS and neutron depolarization techniques.
