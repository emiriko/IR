We report the results of our XMM-Newton monitoring of SN 1987A. The ongoing
propagation of the supernova blast wave through the inner circumstellar ring
caused a drastic increase in X-ray luminosity during the last years, enabling
detailed high resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer. The observations can be used to follow the detailed evolution of
the arising supernova remnant. The fluxes and broadening of the numerous
emission lines seen in the dispersed spectra provide information on the
evolution of the X-ray emitting plasma and its dynamics. These were analyzed in
combination with the EPIC-pn spectra, which allow a precise determination of
the higher temperature plasma. We modeled individual emission lines and fitted
plasma emission models. Especially from the observations between 2003 and 2007
we can see a significant evolution of the plasma parameters and a deceleration
of the radial velocity of the lower temperature plasma regions. We found an
indication (3-sigma-level) of an iron K feature in the co-added EPIC-pn
spectra. The comparison with Chandra grating observations in 2004 yields a
clear temporal coherence of the spectral evolution and the sudden deceleration
of the expansion velocity seen in X-ray images ~6100 days after the explosion.
