This paper summarizes the analysis of the consequences of the violation of
the Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI) on astrometric observations. We demonstrate
that from the point of view of the LLI astrometric observations represent an
experiment of Michelson-Morley type. The future high-accuracy astrometric
projects (e.g., Gaia) will be used to test the LLI.
