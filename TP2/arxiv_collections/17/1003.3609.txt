A measurement of the decay K+ -> pi0 mu+ nu_mu gamma has been performed with
the E787 detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Forty events were observed
in the signal region with the background expectation of (16.5 +- 2.7) events.
The branching ratio was measured to be (1.58 +- 0.46(stat.) +- 0.08(syst.)) x
10^{-5}} in the kinematic region Eg >30 MeV and theta_{mu gamma} > 20degree,
where Eg is the energy of the emitted photon and theta_{mu gamma} is the angle
between the muon and the photon in the K+ rest frame. The results were
consistent with theoretical predictions.
