The first quantum technology, which harnesses uniquely quantum mechanical
effects for its core operation, has arrived in the form of commercially
available quantum key distribution systems that achieve enhanced security by
encoding information in photons such that information gained by an eavesdropper
can be detected. Anticipated future quantum technologies include large-scale
secure networks, enhanced measurement and lithography, and quantum information
processors, promising exponentially greater computation power for particular
tasks. Photonics is destined for a central role in such technologies owing to
the need for high-speed transmission and the outstanding low-noise properties
of photons. These technologies may use single photons or quantum states of
bright laser beams, or both, and will undoubtably apply and drive
state-of-the-art developments in photonics.
