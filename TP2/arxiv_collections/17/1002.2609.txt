Atomic force calculations within the variational and diffusion quantum Monte
Carlo (VMC and DMC) methods are described. The advantages of calculating DMC
forces with the "pure" rather than the "mixed" probability distribution are
discussed. An accurate and practical method for calculating forces using the
pure distribution is presented and tested for the SiH molecule. The statistics
of force estimators are explored and violations of the Central Limit Theorem
are found in some cases.
