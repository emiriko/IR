Configuration interaction method is used to calculate transition amplitudes
and other properties of the low states of dysprosium which are used in cooling
and in study of the time variation of the fine structure constant and violation
of fundamental symmetries. The branching ratio for the cooling state to decay
to states other than ground state is found to be smaller than $10^{-4}$. The
matrix element of the weak interaction between degenerate states at
$E=19797.96$ cm$^{-1}$ is about 2 Hz which is consistent with the experimental
limit $|H_W| = |2.3 \pm 2.9({\rm statistical}) \pm 0.7({\rm systematic})|$ Hz
[A. T. Nguyen, D. Budker, D. DeMille, and M. Zolotorev, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 56},
3453 (1997)] and points to feasibility of its experimental measurement.
Applications include search for physics beyond the standard model using the PNC
isotopic chain approach.
