Correlations between the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy, the neutron
skins, and the percentage of energy-weighted sum rule (EWSR) exhausted by the
Pygmy Dipole Resonance (PDR) in 68Ni and 132Sn have been investigated by using
different Random Phase Approximation (RPA) models for the dipole response,
based on a representative set of Skyrme effective forces plus meson-exchange
effective Lagrangians. A comparison with the experimental data has allowed us
to constrain the value of the derivative of the symmetry energy at saturation.
The neutron skin radius is deduced under this constraint.
