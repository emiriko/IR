We study two-dimensional soliton-soliton vector pairs in media with
self-focusing nonlinearities and defocing cross-interactions. The general
properties of the stationary states and their stability are investigated. The
different scenarios of instability are observed using numerical simulations.
The quasi-stable propagation regime of the high-power vector solitons is
revealed.
