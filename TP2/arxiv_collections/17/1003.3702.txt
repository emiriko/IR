CoSeO$_4$ has a structure consisting of edge-sharing chains of Co$^{2+}$
octahedra which are held together by SeO$_4^{2-}$ tetrahedra via shared oxygen
atoms at the edges of the octahedra. DC magnetization measurements indicate a
transition to an ordered state below 30 K. Powder neutron diffraction
refinements suggest an ordered state with two unique antiferrromagnetic chains
within the unit cell. Isothermal magnetization measurements indicate a
temperature-dependent field-induced magnetic transition below the ordering
temperature. From neutron diffraction, we find this corresponds to a
realignment of spins from the canted configuration towards the c-axis. The
dielectric constant shows a change in slope at the magnetic ordering
temperature as well as a quadratic dependence on the external magnetic field.
