We present single-crystal neutron-diffraction data for the spin-chain
compound Ca3Co2O6. The intensity and line shapes of the two families of Bragg
peaks characterising both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic
components of the magnetic order present in this material have been measured as
a function of temperature and applied magnetic fields of up to 5 T. We have
studied the microscopic nature of the magnetic order at each step seen in the
bulk magnetisation and investigated the evolution of the long and short-range
components of the magnetic order in Ca3Co2O6.
