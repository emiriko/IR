PANDA, the detector to study AntiProton ANnihilations at DArmstadt, will be
installed at the future international Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research
(FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany. The PANDA physics program is oriented towards the
studies of the strong interaction and hadron structure performed with the
highest quality beam of anti-protons [1]. In the preparation for PANDA
experiments, large-scale simulation studies are being performed to validate the
performance of all individual detector components and to advice on detector
optimisation. The feasibility of the analysis strategies together with the
calibration methods are being studied. Simulations were carried out using the
framework called PandaROOT [2], based on ROOT and the Virtual Monte Carlo
concept [3].
