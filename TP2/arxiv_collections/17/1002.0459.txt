We develop an effective description of noise-induced oscillations based on
deterministic phase dynamics. The phase equation is constructed to exhibit
correct frequency and distribution density of noise-induced oscillations. In
the simplest one-dimensional case the effective phase equation is obtained
analytically, whereas for more complex situations a simple method of data
processing is suggested. As an application an effective coupling function is
constructed that quantitatively describes periodically forced noise-induced
oscillations.
