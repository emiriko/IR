We introduce a new Macaulay 2 package, SimplicialDecomposability, which works
in conjunction with the extant package SimplicialComplexes in order to compute
a shelling order, if one exists, of a specified simplicial complex. Further,
methods for determining vertex-decomposability are implemented, along with
methods for determining k-decomposability.
