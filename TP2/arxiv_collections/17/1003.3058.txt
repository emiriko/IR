The almost frictionless transport of the very-high temperature amorphous
matter which resembles the color glass condensate (possibly having much of
their origin in the RHIC heavy ion collisions) in a confined annular tube with
transversely corrugations is investigated by using the verified transition-rate
model and boundary perturbation method. We found that for certain activation
volume and energy there exist possible frictionless states which might be
associated with the perfect fluid formation during the early expansion stage in
RHIC Au+Au collisions. We also address the possible similar scenario in LHC
Pb+Pb collisions considering the possible perfect fluid formation in ultra-high
temperature transport of amorphous matter.
