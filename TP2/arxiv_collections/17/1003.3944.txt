Experiments with evanescent modes and tunneling particles have shown that i)
their signal velocity may be faster than light, ii) they are described by
virtual particles, iii) they are nonlocal and act at a distance, iv)
experimental tunneling data of phonons, photons, and electrons display a
universal scattering time at the tunneling barrier front, and v) the properties
of evanescent, i.e. tunneling modes is not compatible with the special theory
of relativity.
