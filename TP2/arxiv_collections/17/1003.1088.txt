We investigate the influence of the central two-body NN correlations on
several quantities observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It is
demonstrated with explicit Monte Carlo simulations, that the basic correlation
measures, such as the fluctuations of participant eccentricity, initial size
fluctuations, or the fluctuations of the number of sources producing particles,
are all sensitive to the inclusion of the two-body correlations. The effect is
at the level of about 10-20%. Moreover, the realistic (Gaussian) correlation
function gives indistinguishable results from the hard-core repulsion, with the
expulsion distance set to 0.9 fm. Thus, for investigations of the considered
correlation measures, it is sufficient to use the Monte Carlo generators
accounting for the hard-core repulsion.
