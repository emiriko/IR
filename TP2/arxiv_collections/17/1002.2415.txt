This paper addresses the methodology for achieving the user interface design
reusability of a qualitative software system and effort minimization by
applying the inference on the stored design documents. The pictorial design
documents are stored in a special format in the form of keyword text [DGML tag
based design]. The design document storage mechanism will expose the keywords
per design stored. This methodology is having an inference engine. Inference
mechanism search for the requirements and find the match for them in the
available design repository. A match found will success in reusing it after
checking the quality parameters of the found design module in the result set.
DGML notations produces qualitative designs which helps in minimizing the
efforts of software development life cycle.
