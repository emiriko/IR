We demonstrate analytically and numerically that a subwavelength-core
dielectric photonic nanowire embedded in a properly designed photonic crystal
fiber cladding shows evidence of a previously unknown kind of nonlinearity (the
magnitude of which is strongly dependent on the waveguide parameters) which
acts on solitons so as to considerably reduce their Raman self-frequency shift.
An explanation of the phenomenon in terms of indirect pulse negative chirping
and broadening is given by using the moment method. Our conclusions are
supported by detailed numerical simulations.
