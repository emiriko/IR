In Bell inequality tests, the evolution of the wavefunction is not covariant,
i.e. not invariant under velocity boost that change the time ordering of
events, but the laws that govern the probability distribution of possible
results are. In this note I investigate what this could mean and whether there
could be some covariant "real quantum stuff". This clarifies the implication of
the Free Will Theorem and of relativistic spontaneous localization models based
on the flash ontology (rGRWf). Some implications for the concept of time(s) are
spelled out.
