We report on the transverse laser cooling of a magnetically guided beam of
ultra cold chromium atoms. Radial compression by a tapering of the guide is
employed to adiabatically heat the beam. Inside the tapered section heat is
extracted from the atom beam by a two-dimensional optical molasses
perpendicular to it, resulting in a significant increase of atomic phase space
density. A magnetic offset field is applied to prevent optical pumping to
untrapped states. Our results demonstrate that by a suitable choice of the
magnetic offset field, the cooling beam intensity and detuning, atom losses and
longitudinal heating can be avoided. Final temperatures below 65 microkelvin
have been achieved, corresponding to an increase of phase space density in the
guided beam by more than a factor of 30.
