Surface (2D) acoustomagnetoelectric effect (SAME) and bulk (3D)
acoustomagnetoelectric effect (AME) have been studied in a degenerate
semiconductor with nonparabolic energy dispersion law. Expressions are obtained
for the acoustomagnetoelectric fields i.e. SAME E and AME E under weak wt <<1
and strong (wt >>1) magnetic fields. It is shown that SAME E and AME E depend
on the nonparabolicity parameter (h) in a complex manner. Unlike AME E which
changes sign when the magnetic field H is reversed for SAME E this phenomenon
occurs whenever q satisfies the condition p <q <p
