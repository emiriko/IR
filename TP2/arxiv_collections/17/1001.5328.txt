The decay channel $\psi^\prime\to\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi(J/\psi\to\gamma p\bar{p})$
is studied using a sample of $1.06\times 10^8$ $\psi^\prime$ events collected
by the BESIII experiment at BEPCII. A strong enhancement at threshold is
observed in the $p\bar{p}$ invariant mass spectrum. The enhancement can be fit
with an $S$-wave Breit-Wigner resonance function with a resulting peak mass of
$M=1861^{+6}_{-13} {\rm (stat)}^{+7}_{-26} {\rm (syst)} {\rm MeV/}c^2$ and a
narrow width that is $\Gamma<38 {\rm MeV/}c^2$ at the 90% confidence level.
These results are consistent with published BESII results. These mass and width
values do not match with those of any known meson resonance.
