We report a calculation of the fine structure splitting in light helium-like
atoms, which accounts for all quantum electrodynamical effects up to order
\alpha^5 Ry. For the helium atom, we resolve the previously reported
disagreement between theory and experiment and determine the fine structure
constant with an accuracy of 31 ppb. The calculational results are extensively
checked by comparison with the experimental data for different nuclear charges
and by evaluation of the hydrogenic limit of individual corrections.
