We demonstrate a close relationship between superconductivity and the
dimensions of the Fe-Se(Te) tetrahedron in FeSe0.5Te0.5. This is done by
exploiting thin film epitaxy, which provides controlled biaxial stress, both
compressive and tensile, to distort the tetrahedron. The Se/Te height within
the tetrahedron is found to be of crucial importance to superconductivity, in
agreement with the theoretical proposal that (pi,pi) spin fluctuations promote
superconductivity in Fe superconductors.
