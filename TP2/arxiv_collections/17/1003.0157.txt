We investigate the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of an atomic
population based on a heterodyne detection and show that the induced
back-action allows to prepare both spin-squeezed and Dicke states. We use a
wavevector formalism to describe the stochastic process of the measurement and
the associated atomic evolution. Analytical formulas of the atomic distribution
momenta are derived in the weak coupling regime both for short and long time
behavior, and they are in good agreement with those obtained by a Monte-Carlo
simulation. The experimental implementation of the proposed heterodyne
detection scheme is discussed. The role played in the squeezing process by the
spontaneous emission is considered.
