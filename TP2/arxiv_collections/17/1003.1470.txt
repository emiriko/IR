Digitization of analogue signals has opened up new avenues for information
hiding and the recent advancements in the telecommunication field has taken up
this desire even further. From copper wire to fiber optics, technology has
evolved and so are ways of covert channel communication. By "Covert" we mean
"anything not meant for the purpose for which it is being used". Investigation
and detection of existence of such cover channel communication has always
remained a serious concern of information security professionals which has now
been evolved into a motivating source of an adversary to communicate secretly
in "open" without being allegedly caught or noticed. This paper presents a
survey report on steganographic techniques which have been evolved over the
years to hide the existence of secret information inside some cover (Text)
object. The introduction of the subject is followed by the discussion which is
narrowed down to the area where digital ASCII Text documents are being used as
cover. Finally, the conclusion sums up the proceedings.
