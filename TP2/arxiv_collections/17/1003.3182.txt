The Khinchin theorem provides the condition that a stationary process is
ergodic, in terms of the behavior of the corresponding correlation function.
Many physical systems are governed by non-stationary processes in which
correlation functions exhibit aging. We classify the ergodic behavior of such
systems and provide a generalization of Khinchin's theorem. Our work quantifies
deviations from ergodicity in terms of aging correlation functions. Using the
framework of the fractional Fokker-Planck equation we obtain a simple
analytical expression for the two-time correlation function of the particle
displacement in a general binding potential, revealing universality in the
sense that the binding potential only enters into the prefactor through the
first two moments of the corresponding Boltzmann distribution. We discuss
applications to experimental data from systems exhibiting anomalous dynamics.
