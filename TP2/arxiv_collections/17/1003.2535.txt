We study theoretically phonon-assisted relaxation processes in a system
consisting of one or two electrons confined in two vertically stacked
self-assembled quantum dots. The calculation is based on a k.p approximation
for single particle wave functions in a strained self-assembled structure. From
these, two-particle states are calculated by including the Coulomb interaction
and the transition rates between the lowest energy eigenstates are derived. We
take into account phonon couplings via deformation potential and piezoelectric
interaction and show that they both can play a dominant role in different
parameter regimes. Within the Fermi golden rule approximation, we calculate the
relaxation rates between the lowest energy eigenstates which lead to
thermalization on a picosecond time scale in a narrow range of dot sizes.
