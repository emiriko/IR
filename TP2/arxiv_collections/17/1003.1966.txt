Synthesis, electrical and magnetic characterization of superconducting
FeSe0.85 compound is reported. An anomaly in the magnetization against
temperature around 90K is observed. Magnetic characterization of a commercial
compound with nominal FeSe stoichiometry is also presented. The overall
magnetic behaviors as well as the magnetic anomaly in both compounds are
discussed in terms of magnetic impurities and secondary phases. Keyword: A.
