A new azobenzene-thiophene molecular switch is designed, synthesized and used
to form self-assembled monolayers (SAM) on gold. An "on/off" conductance ratio
up to 7x1E3 (with an average value of 1.5x1E3) is reported. The "on"
conductance state is clearly identified to the cis isomer of the azobenzene
moiety. The high "on/off" ratio is explained in terms of photo-induced,
configuration-related, changes in the electrode-molecule interface energetics
(changes in the energy position of the molecular orbitals with respect to the
Fermi energy of electrodes) in addition to changes in the tunnel barrier length
(length of the molecules). First principles DFT calculations demonstrate a
better delocalization of the frontier orbitals, as well as a stronger
electronic coupling between the azobenzene moiety and the electrode for the cis
configuration over the trans one. Measured photoionization cross-sections for
the molecules in the SAM are close to the known values for azobenzene
derivatives in solution.
