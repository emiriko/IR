Context. The red supergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse is an irregular variable star.
Convection may play an important role in understanding this variability.
Interferometric observations can be interpreted using sophisticated simulations
of stellar convection. Aims. We compare the visibility curves and closure
phases obtained from our 3D simulation of RSG convection with CO5BOLD to
various interferometric observations of Betelgeuse from the optical to the H
band in order to characterize and measure the convection pattern on this star.
Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulation to compute
intensity maps in different filters and we thus derive interferometric
observables using the post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D. The
synthetic visibility curves and closure phases are compared to observations.
Results. We provide a robust detection of the granulation pattern on the
surface of Betelgeuse in the optical and in the H band based on excellent fits
to the observed visibility points and closure phases. Moreover, we determine
that the Betelgeuse surface in the H band is covered by small to medium scale
(5-15 mas) convection-related surface structures and a large (30 mas)
convective cell. In this spectral region, H2O molecules are the main absorbers
and contribute to the small structures and to the position of the first null of
the visibility curve (i.e. the apparent stellar radius).
