In view of recent discussions concerning the possibly limiting energy
resolution systematics on the measurement of the Z boson transverse momentum
distribution at hadron colliders, we propose a novel measurement method based
on the angular distributions of the decay leptons. We also introduce a
phenomenological parametrization of the transverse momentum distribution that
adapts well to all currently available predictions, a useful tool to quantify
their differences.
