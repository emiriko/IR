The ratio $R_{\tau\mu}(\Upsilon(1S)) =
\Gamma_{\Upsilon(1S)\to\tau^+\tau^-}/\Gamma_{\Upsilon(1S)\to\mu^+\mu^-}$ is
measured using a sample of $(121.8\pm1.2)\times10^6$ $\Upsilon(3S)$ events
recorded by the BABAR detector. This measurement is intended as a test of
lepton universality and as a search for a possible light pseudoscalar Higgs
boson. In the standard model (SM) this ratio is expected to be close to 1. Any
significant deviations would violate lepton universality and could be
introduced by the coupling to a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson. The analysis
studies the decays $\Upsilon(3S)\to\Upsilon(1S)\pi^+\pi^-$, $\Upsilon(1S)\to
l^+l^-$, where $l=\mu,\tau$. The result, $R_{\tau\mu}(\Upsilon(1S)) = 1.005 \pm
0.013(stat.) \pm 0.022(syst.)$, shows no deviation from the expected SM value,
while improving the precision with respect to previous measurements.
