In the human genomes, recombination frequency between homologous chromosomes
during meiosis is highly correlated with their physical length while it differs
significantly when their coding density is considered. Furthermore, it has been
observed that the recombination events are distributed unevenly along the
chromosomes. We have found that many of such recombination properties can be
predicted by computer simulations of population evolution based on the Monte
Carlo methods. For example, these simulations have shown that the probability
of acceptance of the recombination events by selection is higher at the ends of
chromosomes and lower in their middle parts. The regions of high coding density
are more prone to enter the strategy of haplotype complementation and to form
clusters of genes which are "recombination deserts". The phenomenon of
switching in-between the purifying selection and haplotype complementation has
a phase transition character, and many relations between the effective
population size, coding density, chromosome size and recombination frequency
are those of the power law type.
