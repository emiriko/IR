The Aharonov-Bohm effect is investigated in two-dimensional, single-terminal
quantum rings in magnetic fields by using time-dependent density-functional
theory. We find multiple transport loops leading to the oscillation periods of
h/(en), where n is the number of loops. We show that the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations are relatively weakly affected by the electron-electron
interactions, whereas the ring width has a strong effect on the characteristics
of the oscillations. Our results propose that in experimental quantum-ring
devices showing clear Aharonov-Bohm oscillations the electron current is
dominated by a few states along narrow conduction channels.
