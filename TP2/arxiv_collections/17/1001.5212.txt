Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a general principle, that constitutes the
underlying concept of a vast number of physical phenomena ranging from
ferromagnetism and superconductivity in condensed matter physics to the Higgs
mechanism in the standard model of elementary particles. I focus on
manifestations of spontaneously broken symmetries in systems that are not
Lorentz invariant, which include both, nonrelativistic systems as well as
relativistic systems at nonzero density, providing a self-contained review of
the properties of spontaneously broken symmetries specific to such theories.
Topics covered include: (i) Introduction to the mathematics of spontaneous
symmetry breaking and the Goldstone theorem. (ii) Minimization of Higgs-type
potentials for higher-dimensional representations. (iii) Counting rules for
Nambu-Goldstone bosons and their dispersion relations. (iv) Construction of
effective Lagrangians. Specific examples in both relativistic and
nonrelativistic physics are worked out in detail.
