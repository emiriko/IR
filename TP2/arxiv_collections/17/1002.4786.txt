Nowadays, the active filters represent a viable alternative for controlling
harmonic levels in industrial consumers electrical installations. It must be
noted the availability of many different types of filter configurations that
can be used but there is no standard method for rating the active filters. This
paper focuses on describing the shunt active filter structure and design. The
theoretical concepts underlying the design of shunt active filters are
presented. To validate and highlight the performance of shunt active filters a
Matlab-Simulink model was developed. Simulation results are also presented.
