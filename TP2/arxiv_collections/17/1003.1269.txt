Novel physical mechanism is proposed for explanation of
temperature-independent transition reactions in molecular systems. The
mechanism becomes effective in the case of conformation transitions between
quasi-isoenergetic molecular states. It is shown that at room temperatures,
stochastic broadening of molecular energy levels predominates the energy of low
frequency vibrations accompanying the transition. This leads to a cancellation
of temperature dependence in the stochastically averaged rate constants. As an
example, physical interpretation of temperature-independent onset of P2X_3
receptor desensitization in neuronal membranes is provided.
