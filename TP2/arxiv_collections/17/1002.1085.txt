The chemodynamical evolution of spherical multi-component self-gravitating
models for isolated dwarf galaxies is studied. We compare their evolution with
and without feedback effects from star formation processes. We find that
initially cuspy dark matter profiles flatten with time as a result of star
formation, without any special tuning conditions. Thus the seemingly flattened
profiles found in many dwarfs do not contradict the cuspy profiles predicted by
cosmological models. We also calculate the chemical evolution of stars and gas,
to permit comparisons with observational data.
