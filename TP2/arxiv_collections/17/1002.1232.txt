We reanalyze the supernovae data from the Union Compilation including the
weak lensing effects caused by inhomogeneities. We compute the lensing
probability distribution function for each background solution described by the
parameters Omega_M, Omega_L and w in the presence of inhomogeneities,
approximately modeled with a single-mass population of halos. We then perform a
likelihood analysis in the space of FLRW-parameters and compare our results
with the standard approach. We find that the inclusion of lensing can move the
best-fit model significantly towards the cosmic concordance of the flat LCDM
model, improving the agreement with the constraints coming from the cosmic
microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations.
