We present an observational study of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 7354
consisting of narrowband Halpha and [NII]6584 imaging as well as low- and
high-dispersion long-slit spectroscopy and VLA-D radio continuum. According to
our imaging and spectroscopic data, NGC 7354 has four main structures: a quite
round outer shell and an elliptical inner shell, a collection of low-excitation
bright knots roughly concentrated on the equatorial region of the nebula, and
two symmetrical jet-like features, not aligned either with the shells' axes, or
with each other. We have obtained physical parameters like electron temperature
and electron density as well as ionic and elemental abundances for these
different structures. Electron temperature and electron density slightly vary
throughout the nebula. The local extinction coefficient c_Hbeta shows an
increasing gradient from south to north and a decreasing gradient from east to
west consistent with the number of equatorial bright knots present in each
direction. Abundance values show slight internal variations but most of them
are within the estimated uncertainties. In general, abundance values are in
good agreement with the ones expected for PNe. Radio continuum data are
consistent with optically thin thermal emission. We have used the interactive
three-dimensional modeling tool SHAPE to reproduce the observed morphokinematic
structures in NGC 7354 with different geometrical components. Our SHAPE model
is in very good agreement with our imaging and spectroscopic observations.
Finally, after modeling NGC 7354 with SHAPE, we suggest a possible scenario for
the formation of the nebula.
