Models of the origin of young stars in the Galactic Centre are facing various
problems. The most promissing scenario of the star formation in a thin
self-gravitating disc naturally forms stars on coherently rotating orbits, but
it fails to explain origin of several tens of stars that evidently do not
belong to any of the disc-like structures in the GC. One possible solution lies
in rather complicated initial conditions, assuming at least two infalling and
interacting gas clouds. We present alternative solution showing that a single
thin stellar disc may have given birth to all young stars in the GC. The
outliers are explained as stars that have been stripped from the parent
structure due to the gravitational interaction with the gaseous circum-nuclear
disc.
