We show that particle species dependence of enhanced hadron production at
intermediate transverse momentum (p_{T}) for d+Au collisions at RHIC can be
understood in terms of the hadronic rescatterings in the final state. A
multiphase transport model (AMPT) with two different hadronization mechanisms:
string fragmentation or parton coalescence, is used in our study. When the
hadrons are formed from string fragmentation, the subsequent hadronic
rescatterings will result in particle mass dependence of nuclear modification
factor R_{CP}, which is consistent with the present experimental data. On the
other hand, in the framework of parton coalescence, the mass dependence
disappears and the strangeness plays an important role. Both mechanisms failed
to reproduce the p_{T} dependence of R_{CP} of pion, indicating that
initial-state effects might be also important in such collisions.
