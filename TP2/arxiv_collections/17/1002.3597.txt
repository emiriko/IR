We suggest that by virtue of the very early processes immediately following
the big bang incipient 1st generation particles are created forming periodic
strings to confine the quarks. These strings may be described either by the
Laplace equation, due to vanishing space charges, or by Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
equation, due to finite charges. We also propose that the supersymmetry created
by the big bang is broken through extended vibronic mixing at the end of the
0th generation giving rise to the diversity of atoms and molecules at the later
stages of the evolving universe. We choose quark confinement by electrostatic
strings supplied by 2D solutions of the PB equation.
