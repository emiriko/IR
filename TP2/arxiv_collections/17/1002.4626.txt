We have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned X-shooter
spectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped Lyman-alpha
absorbers (DLAs). The spectral coverage of X-shooter allows us to search for
not only Lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. We
have chosen DLAs where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([OII], [OIII],
Hbeta and Halpha) fall in the NIR atmospheric transmission bands. In this first
paper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxy
counterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 DLA towards the z=2.926 quasar Q2222$-0946.
This DLA is amongst the most metal-rich z>2 DLAs studied so far at comparable
redshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractory
elements onto dust grains. We measure metallicities from ZnII, SiII, NiII, MnII
and FeII of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and
-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. The galaxy is detected in the Lyman-alpha, [OIII]
lambda4959,5007 Halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8
arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). We infer a star-formation rate of 10 M_sun
yr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. Compared to
the recently determined Halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies the
DLA-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of L~0.1L^*_Halpha. The emission-line
ratios are 4.0 (Lyalpha/Halpha) and 1.2 ([OIII]/Halpha). The Lyalpha line shows
clear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,
redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weaker
blueshifted component. The fact that the blueshifted component is relatively
weak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. The properties of the galaxy
counterpart of this DLA is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich DLAs
are associated with the most luminous of the DLA-galaxy counterparts.
