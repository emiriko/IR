Nucleic acids and proteins are not only biologically important polymers: They
have recently been recognized as novel functional materials surpassing in many
aspects the conventional ones. Although Herculean efforts have been undertaken
to unravel fine functioning mechanisms of the biopolymers in question, there is
still much more to be done. This particular paper presents the topic of
biomolecular charge transport, with a particular focus on charge
transfer/transport in DNA and protein molecules. Here the experimentally
revealed details, as well as the presently available theories, of charge
transfer/transport along these biopolymers are critically reviewed and
analyzed. A summary of the active research in this field is also given, along
with a number of practical recommendations.
