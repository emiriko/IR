Using Google Earth, Google Maps and/or network visualization programs such as
Pajek, one can overlay the network of relations among addresses in scientific
publications on the geographic map. We discuss the pros en cons of the various
options, and provide software (freeware) for bridging existing gaps between the
Science Citation Indices and Scopus, on the one side, and these various
visualization tools, on the other. At the level of city names, the global map
can be drawn reliably on the basis of the available address information. At the
level of the names of organizations and institutes, there are problems of
unification both in the ISI-databases and Scopus. Pajek enables us to combine
the visualization with statistical analysis, whereas the Google Maps and its
derivates provide superior tools at the Internet.
