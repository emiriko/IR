The effect of the site potential in an imperfect layer is studied in a d-wave
layer superconductor on the basis of the electron correlation. The site
potential binds electrons to the imperfect layer, and then, the
superconductivity of the imperfect layer is independent of that of the bulk. We
found that the superconducting transition temperature of the imperfect layer
becomes higher than that of the bulk owing to the effect of the site potential.
In this situation, the Fermi surface of the imperfect layer has a strong
nesting feature leading to increases in both the antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuation and the density of states near the Fermi level, which are in favor
of d-wave pairing.
