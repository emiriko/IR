The Higgs Triplet Model contains two CP-even neutral scalar eigenstates, each
having components from an isospin doublet and an isospin triplet scalar field.
The mixing angle can be maximal if the masses of the scalar eigenstates are
close to degeneracy. We quantify the dependence of the mixing angle on the mass
splitting and on the vacuum expectation value of the neutral triplet scalar. We
determine the parameter space for maximal mixing, and study the observability
of both CP-even Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC
