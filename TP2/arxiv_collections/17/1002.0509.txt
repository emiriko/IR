We introduce the radio reconfigurability thanks to IRUWB mostly digital
architecture for MANET context. This particular context implies some
constraints on the radio interface such as low cost, low power, small
dimensions and simplicity. Here, we propose an implementation of dynamic
reconfigurable receiver on ASIC, and FPGA, after having explained the
advantages of mostly digital radio for reconfigurability. In this paper, by
studying our prototypes, we could prove that reconfigurability is on the
contrary with MANET constraints needs. The proposed solution allows data rate,
radio range, energy and spectrum occupation reconfigurability.
