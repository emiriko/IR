Aims: Out of a novel observing technique, we publish for the first time,
SoHO-SUMER observations of the true spectral line profile of hydrogen
Lyman-alpha in quiescent prominences. With SoHO not being in Earth orbit, our
high-quality data set is free from geocoronal absorption. We study the line
profile and compare it with earlier observations of the higher Lyman lines and
recent model predictions. Methods: We applied the reduced-aperture observing
mode to two prominence targets and started a statistical analysis of the line
profiles in both data sets. In particular, we investigated the shape of the
profile, the radiance distribution and the line shape-to-radiance
interrelation. We also compare Ly-a data to co-temporal 1206 Si III data.
Results: We find that the average profile of Ly-a has a blue-peak dominance and
is more reversed, if the line-of-sight is perpendicular to the field lines. The
contrast of Ly-a prominence emission rasters is very low and the radiance
distribution differs from the log-normal distribution of the disk. Features
seen in the Si III line are not always co-spatial with Ly-a emission.
Conclusions: Our empirical results support recent multi-thread models, which
predict that asymmetries and depths of the self-reversal depend on the
orientation of the prominence axis relative to the line-of-sight.
