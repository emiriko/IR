The ability to predict the existence and crystal type of ordered structures
of materials from their components is a major challenge of current materials
research. Empirical methods use experimental data to construct structure maps
and make predictions based on clustering of simple physical parameters. Their
usefulness depends on the availability of reliable data over the entire
parameter space. Recent development of high throughput methods opens the
possibility to enhance these empirical structure maps by {\it ab initio}
calculations in regions of the parameter space where the experimental evidence
is lacking or not well characterized. In this paper we construct enhanced maps
for the binary alloys of hcp metals, where the experimental data leaves large
regions of poorly characterized systems believed to be phase-separating. In
these enhanced maps, the clusters of non-compound forming systems are much
smaller than indicated by the empirical results alone.
