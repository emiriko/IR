We discuss monodromy relations between different color-ordered amplitudes in
gauge theories. We show that Jacobi-like relations of Bern, Carrasco and
Johansson can be introduced in a manner that is compatible with these monodromy
relations. The Jacobi-like relations are not the most general set of equations
that satisfy this criterion. Applications to supergravity amplitudes follow
straightforwardly through the KLT-relations. We explicitly show how the
tree-level relations give rise to non-trivial identities at loop level.
