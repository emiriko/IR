Image Compression plays a very important role in image processing especially
when we are to send the image on the internet. The threat to the information on
the internet increases and image is no exception. Generally the image is sent
on the internet as the compressed image to optimally use the bandwidth of the
network. But as we are on the network, at any intermediate level the image can
be changed intentionally or unintentionally. To make sure that the correct
image is being delivered at the other end we embed the water mark to the image.
The watermarked image is then compressed and sent on the network. When the
image is decompressed at the other end we can extract the watermark and make
sure that the image is the same that was sent by the other end. Though
watermarking the image increases the size of the uncompressed image but that
has to done to achieve the high degree of robustness i.e. how an image sustains
the attacks on it. The present paper is an attempt to make transmission of the
images secure from the intermediate attacks by applying the generally used
compression transforms.
