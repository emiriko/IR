In this talk we show that any spherically symmetric spacetime admits locally
a maximal spacelike slicing. The above condition is reduced to solve a
decoupled system of first order quasi-linear partial differential equations.
The solution may be accomplished analytical or numerically. We provide a
general procedure to construct such maximal slicings.
