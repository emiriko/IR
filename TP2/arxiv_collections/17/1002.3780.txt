Quantum state tomography, the ability to deduce the density matrix of a
quantum system from measured data, is of fundamental importance for the
verification of present and future quantum devices. It has been realized in
systems with few components but for larger systems it becomes rapidly
infeasible because the number of quantum measurements and computational
resources required to process them grow exponentially in the system size. Here
we show that we can gain an exponential advantage over direct state tomography
for quantum states typically realized in nature. Based on singular value
thresholding and matrix product state methods we introduce a state
reconstruction scheme that relies only on a linear number of measurements. The
computational resources for the postprocessing required to reconstruct the
state with high fidelity from these measurements is polynomial in the system
size.
