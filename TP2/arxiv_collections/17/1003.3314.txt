We have investigated the crystal structures and superconducting properties of
thin films of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ grown on eight different substrates.
Superconductivity is not correlated with the lattice mismatch; rather it is
correlated with the degree of in-plane orientation and with the lattice
parameter ratio $c/a$. The best superconducting properties were observed in
films on MgO and LaAlO$_3$ ($T_\mathrm{c}^\mathrm{zero}$ of 9.5 K). TEM
observation showed that the presence or absence of an amorphous-like layer at
the substrate surface plays a key role in determining the structural and
superconducting properties of the grown films.
