Although a lot of research has taken place in Object Oriented Design of
software for Real Time systems and mapping of design models to implementation
models, these methodologies are applicable to systems which are less complex
and small in source code size. However, in practice, the size of the software
for real time applications is growing. The run time architecture of real time
applications is becoming increasingly complex. In this paper, we present a
generic approach for mapping the design models to run time architectures
resulting in combination of processes and threads. This method is applied in
development of a communication subsystem of C4I complex and shall be presented
as a case study.
