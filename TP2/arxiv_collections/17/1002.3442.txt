This work is concerned with multi-dimensional integrals, which are making
their appearance in few-body atomic and nuclear physics. It is shown that the
relevant two- and three-dimensional integrals can be reduced to one-dimensional
form. This implies that the internal one- and two-dimensional integrals can be
evaluated in explicit analytic form in term of the familiar generalized
hypergeometric functions. Some of the integrals are presented here for the
first time.
