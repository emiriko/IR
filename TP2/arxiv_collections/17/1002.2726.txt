The problem of anomalous diffusion in momentum space is considered for
plasma-like systems on the basis of a new collision integral, which is
appropriate for consideration of the probability transition function (PTF) with
long tails in momentum space. The generalized Fokker-Planck equation for
description of diffusion (in momentum space) of particles (ions, grains etc.)
in a stochastic system of light particles (electrons, or electrons and ions,
respectively) is applied to the evolution of the momentum particle distribution
in a plasma. In a plasma the developed approach is also applicable to the
diffusion of particles with an arbitrary mass relation, due to the small
characteristic momentum transfer. The cases of an exponentially decreasing in
momentum space (including the Boltzmann-like) kernel in the PT-function, as
well as the more general kernels, which create the anomalous diffusion in
velocity space due to the long tail in the PT-function, are considered.
Effective friction and diffusion coefficients for plasma-like systems are
found.
