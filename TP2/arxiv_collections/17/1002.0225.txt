We propose a quantum interface protocol based on two quantum-non-demolition
interactions (QND) arranged either in sequence or in parallel. Since the QND
coupling arises naturally in interactions between light and a macroscopic
ensemble of atoms, or between light and a micro-mechanical oscillator, the
proposed interface is capable of transferring a state of light onto these
matter systems. The transfer itself is perfect and deterministic for any
quantum state, for arbitrarily small interaction strengths, and for arbitrarily
large noise of the target system. It requires an all-optical pre-processing,
requiring a coupling stronger than that between the light and the matter, and a
displacement feed-forward correction of the matter system. We also suggest a
probabilistic version of the interface, which eliminates the need for the
feed-forward correction at a cost of reduced success rate. An application of
the interface can be found in construction of a quantum memory, or in the state
preparation for quantum sensing.
