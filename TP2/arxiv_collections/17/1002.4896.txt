We summarize the results from numerical simulations of mass outflows from
AGN. We focus on simulations of outflows driven by radiation from large-scale
inflows. We discuss the properties of these outflows in the context of the
so-called AGN feedback problem. Our main conclusion is that this type of
outflows are efficient in removing matter but inefficient in removing energy.
