We shall consider the regularity problem of solutions for complex
Monge-Ampere equations. First we prove interior $C^2$ estimates of solutions in
a bounded domain for complex Monge-Ampere equation with assumption of certain
$L^p$ bound for Laplacian u, and of Lipschitz condition on right hand side.
Then we shall construct a family of Pogorelov-type examples for complex
Monge-Ampere equation. These examples give generalized entire solutions (as
well as viscosity solutions) of complex Monge-Ampere equation $\det(u_{i\bar
j})=1.
