Applying a theorem of Howard for a formula recently proved by Brassesco and
M\'endez, we derive new simple explicit formulas for the coefficients of the
asymptotic expansion to the sequence of factorials. To our knowledge no
explicit formula containing only the four basic operations was known until now.
