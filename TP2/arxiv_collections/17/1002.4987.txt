We define a q-deformation of the Dirac operator, inspired by the one
dimensional q-derivative. This implies a q-deformation of the partial
derivatives. By taking the square of this Dirac operator we find a
q-deformation of the Laplace operator. This allows to construct q-deformed
Schroedinger equations in higher dimensions. The equivalence of these
Schroedinger equations with those defined on q-Euclidean space in quantum
variables is shown. We also define the m-dimensional q-Clifford-Hermite
polynomials and show their connection with the q-Laguerre polynomials. These
polynomials are orthogonal with respect to an m-dimensional q-integration,
which is related to integration on q-Euclidean space. The q-Laguerre
polynomials are the eigenvectors of an su_q(1|1)-representation.
