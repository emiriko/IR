One of the fundamental properties of astrophysical magnetic fields is their
ability to change topology through reconnection and in doing so, to release
magnetic energy, sometimes violently. In this work, we review recent results on
the role of magnetic reconnection and associated heating and particle
acceleration in jet/accretion disk systems, namely young stellar objects
(YSOs), microquasars, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
