A concentration difference of particles across a membrane perforated by pores
will induce a diffusive flux. If the diffusing objects are of the same length
scale as the the pores, diffusion may not be simple, objects can move into the
pore in a configuration that requires them to back up in order to continue
forward. A configuration that blocks flow through the pore may be statistically
preferred, an attracting metastable state of the system. This effect is purely
kinetic, and not dependent on potentials, friction or dissipation. We discuss
several geometries which generate this effect, and introduce a heuristic model
which captures the qualitative features.
