We study the pricing of credit derivatives with asymmetric information. The
managers have complete information on the value process of the firm and on the
default threshold, while the investors on the market have only partial
observations, especially about the default threshold. Different information
structures are distinguished using the framework of enlargement of filtrations.
We specify risk neutral probabilities and we evaluate default sensitive
contingent claims in these cases.
