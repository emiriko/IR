The infrared behaviour of the n-point functions of a Yang-Mills theory with a
charged scalar field in the fundamental representation of SU(N) is studied in
the formalism of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Assuming a stable skeleton
expansion solutions in form of power laws for the Green functions are obtained.
For a massless scalar field the uniform limit is sufficient to describe the
infrared scaling behaviour of vertices. Not taking into account a possible
Higgs-phase it turns out that kinematic singularities play an important role
for the scaling solutions of massive scalars. On a qualitative level scalar
Yang-Mills theory yields similar scaling solutions as recently obtained for
QCD.
