In previously exhibited hidden variable models of quantum state preparation
and measurement, the number of continuous hidden variables describing the
actual state of a single realization is never smaller than the quantum state
manifold dimension. We introduce a simple model for a qubit whose hidden
variable space is one-dimensional, i.e., smaller than the two-dimensional Bloch
sphere. The hidden variable probability distributions associated with the
quantum states satisfy reasonable criteria of regularity. Possible
generalizations of this shrinking to a N-dimensional Hilbert space are
discussed.
