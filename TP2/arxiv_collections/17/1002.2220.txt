We calculate contained and upward muon flux and contained shower event rates
from neutrino interactions, when neutrinos are produced from annihilation of
the dark matter in the Galactic Center. We consider model-independent direct
neutrino production and secondary neutrino production from the decay of taus, W
bosons and bottom quarks produced in the annihilation of dark matter. We
illustrate how muon flux from dark matter annihilation has a very different
shape than the muon flux from atmospheric neutrinos. We also discuss the
dependence of the muon fluxes on the dark matter density profile and on the
dark matter mass and of the total muon rates on the detector threshold. We
consider both the upward muon flux, when muons are created in the rock below
the detector, and the contained flux when muons are created in the (ice)
detector. We also calculate the event rates for showers from neutrino
interactions in the detector and show that the signal dominates over the
background for $150 {\rm GeV} <m_\chi < 1$ TeV for $E_{sh}^{th} = 100$ GeV.
