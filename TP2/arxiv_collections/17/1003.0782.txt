We propose new models of an `affine' theory of gravity in $D$-dimensional
space-times with symmetric connections. They are based on ideas of Weyl,
Eddington and Einstein and, in particular, on Einstein's proposal to specify
the space - time geometry by use of the Hamilton principle. More specifically,
the connection coefficients are derived by varying a `geometric' Lagrangian
that is supposed to be an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric)
Ricci curvature tensor (and, possibly, of other fundamental tensors) expressed
in terms of the connection coefficients regarded as independent variables. In
addition to the standard Einstein gravity, such a theory predicts dark energy
(the cosmological constant, in the first approximation), a neutral massive (or,
tachyonic) vector field, and massive (or, tachyonic) scalar fields. These
fields couple only to gravity and may generate dark matter and/or inflation.
The masses (real or imaginary) have geometric origin and one cannot avoid their
appearance in any concrete model. Further details of the theory - such as the
nature of the vector and scalar fields that can describe massive particles,
tachyons, or even `phantoms' - depend on the concrete choice of the geometric
Lagrangian. In `natural' geometric theories, which are discussed here, dark
energy is also unavoidable. Main parameters - mass, cosmological constant,
possible dimensionless constants - cannot be predicted, but, in the framework
of modern `multiverse' ideology, this is rather a virtue than a drawback of the
theory. To better understand possible applications of the theory we discuss
some further extensions of the affine models and analyze in more detail
approximate (`physical') Lagrangians that can be applied to cosmology of the
early Universe.
