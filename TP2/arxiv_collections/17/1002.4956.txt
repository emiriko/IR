We prove the existence of cluster characters for Hom-infinite cluster
categories. For this purpose, we introduce a suitable mutation-invariant
subcategory of the cluster category. We sketch how to apply our results in
order to categorify any skew-symmetric cluster algebra. More applications and a
comparison to Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's results will be given in a future
paper.
