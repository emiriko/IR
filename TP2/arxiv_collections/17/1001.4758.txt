(Abridged) A simple six-parameter LCDM model provides a successful fit to
WMAP data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with other
cosmological data. Even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints of
deviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,
dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. The cosmological community
has subjected the WMAP data to extensive and varied analyses. While there is
widespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter LCDM model,
various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. In this paper we
examine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of their
significance. In most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posterior
selection of some aspect or subset of the data. Compared with sky simulations
based on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of the
WMAP data. Low probability features are expected, but it is not usually
straightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature is
the result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. We
examine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the LCDM
model. We examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the sky
maps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,
quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, and
quadrupole power asymmetry. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence
for deviations from the LCDM model, which is generally an acceptable
statistical fit to WMAP and other cosmological data.
