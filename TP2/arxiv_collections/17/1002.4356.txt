We use a model developed by Xu et al. (2010) to compute the 21 cm line
absorption signatures imprinted by star-forming dwarf galaxies (DGs) and
starless minihalos (MHs). The method, based on a statistical comparison of the
equivalent width (W_\nu) distribution and flux correlation function, allows us
to derive a simple selection criteria for candidate DGs at very high (z >= 8)
redshift. We find that ~ 18% of the total number of DGs along a line of sight
to a target radio source (GRB or quasar) can be identified by the condition
W_\nu < 0; these objects correspond to the high-mass tail of the DG
distribution at high redshift, and are embedded in large HII regions. The
criterion W_\nu > 0.37 kHz instead selects ~ 11% of MHs. Selected candidate DGs
could later be re-observed in the near-IR by the JWST with high efficiency,
thus providing a direct probe of the most likely reionization sources.
