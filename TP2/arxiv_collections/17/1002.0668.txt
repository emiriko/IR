We introduce a method to convert an ensemble of sequences of symbols into a
weighted directed network whose nodes are motifs, while the directed links and
their weights are defined from statistically significant co-occurences of two
motifs in the same sequence. The analysis of communities of networks of motifs
is shown to be able to correlate sequences with functions in the human proteome
database, to detect hot topics from online social dialogs, to characterize
trajectories of dynamical systems, and might find other useful applications to
process large amount of data in various fields.
