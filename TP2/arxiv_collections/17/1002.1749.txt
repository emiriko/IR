Let R be an equivalence relation on graphs. By the strengthening of R we mean
the relation R' such that graphs G and H are in the relation R' if for every
graph F, the union of the graphs G and F is in the relation R with the union of
the graphs H and F. We study strengthenings of equivalence relations on graphs.
The most important case that we consider concerns equivalence relations defined
by graph properties. We obtain results on the strengthening of equivalence
relations determined by the properties such as being a k-connected graph,
k-colorable, hamiltonian and planar.
