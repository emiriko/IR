We explore an ansatz for the QCD vacuum in the Coulomb gauge that describes
gauge field fluctuations in presence of a weakly interacting gas of abelian
monopoles. Such magnetic disorder leads to long-range correlations which are
manifested through the area law for the Wilson loop. In particular we focus on
the role of the residual monopole-monopole interactions in providing the
mechanism for suppression of the gluon propagator at low-momenta which also
leads to low momentum enhancement in the ghost propagator.
