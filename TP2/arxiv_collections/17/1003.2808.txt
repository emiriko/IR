We investigate the extent to which the uncertainties associated with the
propagation of Galactic cosmic rays impact upon estimates for the gamma-ray
flux from the mid-latitude region. We consider contributions from both standard
astrophysical background (SAB) processes as well as resolved point sources. We
have found that the uncertainties in the total gamma-ray flux from the
mid-latitude region relating to propagation parameter values consistent with
local B/C and Be10/Be9 data dominate by 1-2 orders of magnitude. These
uncertainties are reduced to less than an order of magnitude when the
normalisations of the SAB spectral components are fitted to the corresponding
Fermi LAT data. We have found that for many propagation parameter
configurations (PPCs) our fits improve when an extragalactic background (EGB)
component is simultaneously fitted to the data. We also investigate the
improvement in our fits when a flux contribution from neutralino dark matter
(DM), described by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, was
simultaneously fitted to the data. We consider three representative cases of
neutralino DM for both Burkert and Einasto DM density profiles, in each case
simultaneously fitting a boost factor of the DM contribution together with the
SAB and EGB components. We have found that for several PPCs there are
significant improvements in our fits, yielding both substantial EGB and DM
components, where for a few of these PPCs the best-fit EGB component is
consistent with recent estimates by the Fermi Collaboration.
