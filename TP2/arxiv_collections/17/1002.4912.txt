A superconducting ring with a pi junction made from
superconductor/ferromagnetic-metal/superconductor (S-FM-S) exhibits a
spontaneous current without an external magnetic field in the ground state.
Such pi ring provides so-called quiet qubit that can be efficiently decoupled
from the fluctuation of the external field. However, the usage of the FM gives
rise to strong Ohmic dissipation. Therefore, the realization of pi junctions
without FM is expected for qubit applications. We theoretically consider the
possibility of the pi coupling for S/Eu-chalcogenides/S junctions based on the
d-f Hamiltonian. By use of the Green's function method we found that pi
junction can be formed in the case of the finite d-f hybridization between the
conduction d and the localized f electrons.
