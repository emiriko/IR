The use of coherent transition radiation autocorrelation methods to determine
bunch length and profile information is examined with the compressed electron
beam at the BNL ATF. A bi-gaussian fit is applied to coherent transition
radiation auto-correlation data to extract the longitudinal current
distribution. The effects of large transverse beam sizes are studied in theory
and compared to experimental results. A suitable form of the correction factor
is derived for beams with large transverse-longitudinal aspect ratios.
