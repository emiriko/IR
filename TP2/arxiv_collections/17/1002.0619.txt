We announce a very general statement involving the rational quartic residue
symbol $(m/p)_4$ and, more generally, Legendre symbols of the type
${a+b\sqrt{m}/p$. We show how our main theorem can be used to produce many
older results such as Scholz's, Lehmer's or Burde's reciprocity laws and many
others. It is very likely that all existing reciprocity laws of this type can
be obtained from our result. This is a corrected and improved version of
version 2.
