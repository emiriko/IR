This paper considers a stochastic approximation algorithm, with decreasing
step size and martingale difference noise. Under very mild assumptions, we
prove the non convergence of this process toward a certain class of repulsive
sets for the associated ordinary differential equation (ODE). We then use this
result to derive the convergence of the process when the ODE is cooperative in
the sense of [Hirsch, 1985]. In particular, this allows us to extend
significantly the main result of [Hofbauer and Sandholm, 2002] on the
convergence of stochastic fictitious play in supermodular games.
