We consider a uniform dipolar Fermi gas in two-dimensions (2D) where the
dipole moments of fermions are aligned by an orientable external field. We
obtain the ground state of the gas in Hartree-Fock approximation and
investigate RPA stability against density fluctuations of finite momentum. It
is shown that the density wave instability takes place in a broad region where
the system is stable against collapse. We also find that the critical
temperature can be a significant fraction of Fermi temperature for a realistic
system of polar molecules.
