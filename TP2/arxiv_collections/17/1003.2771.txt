Based upon standard angular momentum theory, we develop a framework to
investigate polarization squeezing and multipartite entanglement of a quantum
light field. Both mean polarization and variances of the Stokes parameters are
obtained analytically, with which we study recent observation of triphoton
states [L. K. Shalm {\it et al}, Nature \textbf{457}, 67 (2009)]. Our results
show that the appearance of maximally entangled NOON states accompanies with a
flip of mean polarization and can be well understood in terms of quantum Fisher
information.
