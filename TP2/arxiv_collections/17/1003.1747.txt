The degeneracy among parity pairs systematically observed in the N and Delta
spectra is interpreted to hint on a possible conformal symmetry realization in
the light flavor baryon sector in line with AdS_5/CFT_4. The case is made by
showing that all the observed N and Delta resonances with masses below 2500 MeV
distribute fairly well each over the first levels of a unitary representation
of the conformal group, a representation that covers the spectrum of a
quark-diquark system, placed directly on the AdS_5 cone, conformally
compactified to R^1*S^3. The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is
described by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the
Klein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the "curved" Coulomb
potential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not
exact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal
centrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy
between P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states
belonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the
correct mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a
combined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and
a parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar
at higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is
illustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric
charge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),
and S11(1535) resonances. The scheme also allows for a prediction of the
dressing function of an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the
Fourier transform of the gauge potential. We find a dressing function that is
finite in the infrared and tends to zero at infinity.
