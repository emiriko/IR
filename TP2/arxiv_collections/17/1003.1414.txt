I have successfully prepared (110) trilayers of \LSMO-\YBCO-\LSMO.
Magnetization measurements on these samples reveal a stronger coupling between
the ferromagnetic layers. The coupling is an order of magnitude higher than
that seen in the case of (001) trilayers. Magnetoresistance measurements show a
first order transition in the data coinciding with the antiferromagnetic regime
deduced from the magnetization measurements. I have also measured the
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) of these samples revealing an unusually
high AMR ($\sim 72000%$). I attribute such a high AMR to the pair breaking
effects in these films.
