Aims. We gathered about 100 high-resolution spectra of three typical HgMn
(mercury-manganese) stars, HD 11753, HD 53244, and HD 221507, to search for
slowly pulsating B-like pulsations and surface inhomogeneous distribution of
various chemical elements. Methods. Classical frequency analysis methods were
used to detect line profile variability and to determine the variation period.
Doppler imaging reconstruction was performed to obtain abundance maps of
chemical elements on the stellar surface. Results. For HD 11753, which is the
star with the most pronounced variability, distinct spectral line profile
changes were detected for Ti, Sr, Y, Zr, and Hg, whereas for HD 53244 and HD
221507 the most variable line profiles belong to the elements Hg and Y,
respectively. We derived rotation periods for all three stars from the
variations of radial velocities and equivalent widths of spectral lines
belonging to inhomogeneously distributed elements: P_rot (HD 11753)=9.54 d,
P_rot (HD 53244)=6.16 d, and P_rot (HD 221507)=1.93 d. For HD 11753 the Doppler
imaging technique was applied to derive the distribution of the most variable
elements Ti, Sr, and Y using two datasets separated by ~65 days. Results of
Doppler imaging reconstruction revealed noticeable changes in the surface
distributions of TiII, SrII, and YII between the datasets, indicating the
hitherto not well understood physical processes in stars with radiative
envelopes that cause a rather fast dynamical chemical spot evolution.
