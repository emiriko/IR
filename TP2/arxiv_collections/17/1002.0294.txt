Theoretical analysis dealing with the interaction of electrons with the polar
long-wavelength transverse optical (TO) vibrations is presented. The theory is
based on the model of a polar crystal with classical potentials, which takes
into account the electronic polarizability effects. A significant enhancement
of the strength of the electron-TO-phonon interaction in ferroelectrics is
found. A microscopic justification of this effect is given. A bridge that
relates the interaction of electrons with the polar long-wavelength TO modes of
the lattice vibrations to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction is
established. As an application of our analysis, a new equation representing the
relationship between the electron-TO-phonon interaction constant and material
parameters is obtained.
