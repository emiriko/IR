We apply the statistical measure of complexity, introduced by L\'{o}pez-Ruiz,
Mancini and Calbet to a hard-sphere dilute Fermi gas whose particles interact
via a repulsive hard-core potential. We employ the momentum distribution of
this system to calculate the information entropy, the disequilibrium and the
statistical complexity. We examine possible connections between the particle
correlations and energy of the system with those information and complexity
measures. The hard-sphere model serves as a test bed for concepts about
complexity.
