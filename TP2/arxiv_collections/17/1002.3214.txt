In the present paper, some elementary test cases in laminar flow with
magnetic forcing terms are analyzed (Hartmann flow, Couette flow, Rayleigh
flow); equations of the coupled problem are exposed and analytical solutions
are derived in each case, highlighting the relevant non-dimensional number
which drives the physics of the problem. Several analytical calculations are
then proposed and discussed, in particular in the context of MHD propulsion by
a nozzle.
