This paper is a brief review of low energy soft hadronic physics, starting
from the invention of the low energy effective range theory in the late 40's
due to Bethe and Schwinger for nucleon-nucleon scattering, and its
generalization to the static Chew-Low model for pion nucleon scattering, to the
present development of the Lehmann and Weinberg Chiral Perturbation Theories.
It is pointed out that a consistent low energy calculation can be achieved with
the incorporation of the unitarity relation in the Chiral Perturbation Theory.
