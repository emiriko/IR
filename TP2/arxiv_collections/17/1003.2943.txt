We numerically study the aging properties of the dynamical heterogeneities in
the Ising spin glass. We find that a phase transition takes place during the
aging process. Statics-dynamics correspondence implies that systems of finite
size in equilibrium have static heterogeneities that obey Finite-Size Scaling,
thus signaling an analogous phase transition in the thermodynamical limit. We
compute the critical exponents and the transition point in the equilibrium
setting, and use them to show that aging in dynamic heterogeneities can be
described by a Finite-Time Scaling Ansatz, with potential implications for
experimental work.
