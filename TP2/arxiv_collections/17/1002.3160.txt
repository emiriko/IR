We study 5D gauge symmetries in the Randall-Sundrum geometry that are hidden
from the standard model through either small 5D gauge coupling, or through
vanishing quantum numbers for the standard model fields. Geometric warping of
5D gravity creates a TeV scale bridge from the standard model to the hidden
sector gauge fields. We apply these concepts to a revival of the electroweak
axion model, in which the dynamics of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking occur at
the TeV scale.
