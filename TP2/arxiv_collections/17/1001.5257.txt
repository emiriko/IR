We report on a first-principles study of the conductance through graphene
suspended between Al contacts as a function of junction length, width, and
orientation. The charge transfer at the leads and into the freestanding section
gives rise to an electron-hole asymmetry in the conductance and in sufficiently
long junctions induces two conductance minima at the energies of the Dirac
points for suspended and clamped regions, respectively. We obtain the potential
profile along a junction caused by doping and provide parameters for effective
model calculations of the junction conductance with weakly interacting metallic
leads.
