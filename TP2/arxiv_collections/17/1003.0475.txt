It is proved that the discriminant of $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices can
be written as a sum of squares, where the number of summands equals the
dimension of the space of $n$-variable spherical harmonics of degree $n$. The
representation theory of the orthogonal group is applied to express the
discriminant of three by three real symmetric matrices as a sum of five
squares, and to show that it can not be written as the sum of less than five
squares. It is proved that the discriminant of four by four real symmetric
matrices can be written as a sum of seven squares. These improve results of
Kummer from 1843 and Borchardt from 1846.
