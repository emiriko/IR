We study the production of same-sign W boson pairs at the LHC in double
parton interactions. Compared with simple factorised double parton
distributions (dPDFs), we show that the recently developed dPDFs, GS09, lead to
non-trivial kinematic correlations between the W bosons. A numerical study of
the prospects for observing this process using same-sign dilepton signatures,
including same-sign WWjj, di-boson and heavy flavour backgrounds, at 14 TeV
centre-of-mass energy is then performed. It is shown that a small excess of
same-sign dilepton events from double parton scattering over a background
dominated by single scattering WZ(gamma*) production could be observed at the
LHC.
