The main objective of this paper is to build and compare vector magnetic maps
obtained by two spectral polarimeters, i.e. THEMIS/MTR and Hinode SOT/SP, using
two inversion codes (UNNOFIT and MELANIE) based on the Milne-Eddington solar
atmosphere model. To this end, we used observations of a facular region within
active region NOAA 10996 on 23 May 2008, and found consistent results
concerning the field strength, azimuth and inclination distributions. Because
SOT/SP is free from the seeing effect and has better spatial resolution, we
were able to resolve small magnetic polarities with sizes of 1" to 2", and we
could detect strong horizontal magnetic fields, which converge or diverge in
negative or positive facular polarities. These findings support models which
suggest the existence of small vertical flux tube bundles in faculae. A new
method is proposed to get the relative formation heights of the multi-lines
observed by MTR assuming the validity of a flux tube model for the faculae. We
found that the Fe 1 6302.5 \AA line forms at a greater atmospheric height than
the Fe 1 5250.2 \AA line.
