Charge-odd correlation of the charged pair components produced at
electron-proton scattering can measure three current correlation averaged by
proton state. In general these type correlation can be described by 14
structure functions. We restrict here by consideration of inclusive
distributions of a pair components, which is the light-cone projection of the
relevant hadronic tensor. Besides we consider the point-like approximation for
proton and pion. Numerical estimations show that charge-odd effects can be
measured in exclusive ep -> 2 pi X experiments.
