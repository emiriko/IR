The main implications of noncommutativity over astrophysical objects are
examined. Noncommutativity is introduced through a deformed dispersion relation
$E^{2}=p^{2}c^{2}(1+\lambda E)^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$ and the relevant
thermodynamical quantities are calculated using the grand canonical ensemble
formalism. These results are applied to simple physical models describing
main-sequence stars, white-dwarfs and neutron stars. The stability of
main-sequence stars and white dwarfs is discussed.
