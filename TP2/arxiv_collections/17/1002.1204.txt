We study the response of optically trapped achiral and chiralised nematic
liquid crystal droplets to linear as well as circular polarised light. We find
that there is internal dissipation in rotating achiral nematic droplets trapped
in glycerine. We also demonstrate that some chiralised droplets rotate under
linearly polarised light. The best fit to our data on chiralised droplets
indicates that rotational frequency of these droplets with radius R is
approximately proportional to1/R^2, rather than to 1/R^3.
