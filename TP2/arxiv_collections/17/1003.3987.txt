Many computerized methods for RNA-RNA interaction structure prediction have
been developed. Recently, $O(N^6)$ time and $O(N^4)$ space dynamic programming
algorithms have become available that compute the partition function of RNA-RNA
interaction complexes. However, few of these methods incorporate the knowledge
concerning related sequences, thus relevant evolutionary information is often
neglected from the structure determination. Therefore, it is of considerable
practical interest to introduce a method taking into consideration both
thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation. We present the \emph{a
priori} folding algorithm \texttt{ripalign}, whose input consists of two
(given) multiple sequence alignments (MSA). \texttt{ripalign} outputs (1) the
partition function, (2) base-pairing probabilities, (3) hybrid probabilities
and (4) a set of Boltzmann-sampled suboptimal structures consisting of
canonical joint structures that are compatible to the alignments. Compared to
the single sequence-pair folding algorithm \texttt{rip}, \texttt{ripalign}
requires negligible additional memory resource. Furthermore, we incorporate
possible structure constraints as input parameters into our algorithm. The
algorithm described here is implemented in C as part of the \texttt{rip}
package. The supplemental material, source code and input/output files can
freely be downloaded from \url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/ripalign.html}.
