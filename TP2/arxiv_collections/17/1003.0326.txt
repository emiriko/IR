Space charge effects, being one of the most significant collective effects,
play an important role in high intensity cyclotrons. However, for cyclotrons
with small turn separation, other existing effects are of equal importance.
Interactions of radially neighboring bunches are also present, but their
combined effects has not yet been investigated in any great detail. In this
paper, a new particle in cell based self-consistent numerical simulation model
is presented for the first time. The model covers neighboring bunch effects and
is implemented in the three-dimensional object-oriented parallel code
OPAL-cycl, a flavor of the OPAL framework. We discuss this model together with
its implementation and validation. Simulation results are presented from the
PSI 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron in the context of the ongoing high intensity upgrade
program, which aims to provide a beam power of 1.8 MW (CW) at the target
destination.
