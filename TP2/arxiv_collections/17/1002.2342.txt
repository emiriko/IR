In the late seventies an increasing interest in the scaling theory of
Anderson localization led to new efforts to understand the conductance of
systems which scatter electrons elastically. The conductance and its relation
to the scattering matrix emerged as an important subject. This, coupled with
the desire to find explicit manifestations of single electron interference led
to the emergence of mesoscopic physics. We review electron transport phenomena
which can be expressed elegantly in terms of the scattering matrix. Of
particular interest are phenomena which depend not only on transmission
probabilities but on both amplitude and phase of scattering matrix elements.
