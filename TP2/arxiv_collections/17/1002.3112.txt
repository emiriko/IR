The electronic bandstructure and the Fermi surfaces of ferromagnetic CeRh3B2
are calculated by using FLAPW and LSDA+U method. As assuming several kinds of
the ground state to describe the 4f electronic state, we propose a fully
orbital- and spin-polarized state |lz=0, sx=1/2> as the ground state, instead
of the conventional LS-coupled CEF ground state, generally expected in typical
4f compounds. This is supported by the fact that both the observed magnetic
moment and the observed dHvA frequencies are well explained by the calculated
electronic structure and the Fermi surfaces. The unconventional ground state is
stabilized by the strong 4f-4f direct mixing between the neighbored Ce atoms
along the extremely small distance along the c-axis in the hexagonal crystal
cell.
