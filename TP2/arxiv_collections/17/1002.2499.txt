We present a theory for a complete reconstruction of non-local spin
correlations in ferromagnet-normal conductors. This quantum spin tomography is
based on cross correlation measurements of electric currents into ferromagnetic
terminals with controllable magnetization directions. For normal injectors,
non-local spin correlations are universal and strong. The correlations are
suppressed by spin-flip scattering and, for ferromagnetic injectors, by
increasing injector polarization.
