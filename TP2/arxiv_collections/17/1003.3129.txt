In the gauge-Higgs unification the 4D Higgs field becomes a part of the
extra-dimensional component of the gauge potentials. In the $SO(5) \times U(1)$
gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime the electroweak
symmetry is dynamically broken through the Hosotani mechanism. The Higgs bosons
become absolutely stable, and become the dark matter of the universe. The mass
of the Higgs boson is determined from the WMAP data to be about 70 GeV.
