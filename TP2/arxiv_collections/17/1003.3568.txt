Cryptography literally means "The art & science of secret writing & sending a
message between two parties in such a way that its contents cannot be
understood by someone other than the intended recipient". and Quantum word is
related with "Light". Thus, Quantum Cryptography is a way of descripting any
information in the form of quantum particles. There are no classical
cryptographic systems which are perfectly secure. In contrast to Classical
cryptography which depends upon Mathematics, Quantum Cryptography utilizes the
concepts of Quantum Physics which provides us the security against the
cleverest marauders of the present age. In the view of increasing need of
Network and Information Security, we do require methods to overcome the
Molecular Computing technologies (A future technology) and other techniques of
the various codebrakers. Both the parts i.e. Quantum Key distribution and
Information transference from Sender to Receiver are much efficient and secure.
It is based upon BB84 protocol. It can be of great use for Govt. agencies such
as Banks, Insurance, Brokerages firms, financial institutions, e-commerce and
most important is the Defense & security of any country. It is a Cryptographic
communication system in which the original users can detect unauthorized
eavesdropper and in addition it gives a guarantee of no eavesdropping. It
proves to be the ultra secure mode of communication b/w two intended parties.
