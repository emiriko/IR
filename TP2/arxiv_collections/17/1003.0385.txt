We investigate the nonuniform motion of a straight screw dislocation in
infinite media in the framework of the translational gauge theory of
dislocations. The equations of motion are derived for an arbitrary moving screw
dislocation. The fields of the elastic velocity, elastic distortion,
dislocation density and dislocation current surrounding the arbitrarily moving
screw dislocation are derived explicitely in the form of integral
representations. We calculate the radiation fields and the fields depending on
the dislocation velocities.
