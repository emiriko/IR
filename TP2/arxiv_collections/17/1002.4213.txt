The measurements of electrons from cosmic rays have begun a new era a few
years ago with high precision experiments like PAMELA and Fermi-LAT. The
positron fraction seems to indicate an unknown component above the standard
background described in the last 40 years, mostly by HEAT. In the last few
years, the PAMELA satellite has confirmed the positron fraction excess above 10
GeV, and studying Fermi-LAT data, the electron flux seems to be steeper than
expected. While these new measurements have not closed the debate, results from
AMS-02 are expected to reach the accuracy needed to determine a full
description of this excess and possibly give some evidence on the possible
source. We will present in this note, the AMS-02 capacity in the case of
positrons produced by pulsars.
