In this talk, results are presented of determinations of electromagnetic form
factors of hadrons (pion, proton, and $\Delta(1236)$) in the framework of
Dual-Large $N_c$ QCD (Dual-$QCD_\infty$). This framework improves considerably
tree-level VMD results by incorporating an infinite number of zero-width
resonances, with masses and couplings fixed by the dual-resonance
(Veneziano-type) model.
