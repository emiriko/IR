We analyze families of non-autonomous systems of first-order ordinary
differential equations admitting a common time-dependent superposition rule,
i.e., a time-dependent map expressing any solution of each of these systems in
terms of a generic set of particular solutions of the system and some
constants. We next study relations of these families, called Lie families, with
the theory of Lie and quasi-Lie systems and apply our theory to provide common
time-dependent superposition rules for certain Lie families.
