Using post-Galilean space and time derivatives transformations and quantum
mechanics, we have found a new particle-wave equation besides the Klein-Gordon
equation describing a spinless scalar particle. This new equation can also be
obtained from Dirac's equation if $\beta=\gamma(1\pm\frac{v}{c})$. Biot-Savart
law and additional continuity equations are obtained as a consequence of the
invariance of Dirac's equation and Maxwell's equations under these
transformations.
