The traditional web caching is currently limited to static documents only. A
page generated on the fly from a server side script may have different contents
on different accesses and hence cannot be cached. A number of proposals for
attacking the problem have emerged based on the observation that different
instances of a dynamic document are usually quite similar in most cases, i.e.
they have a lot of common HTML code. In this paper, we first review these
related techniques and show their inadequacy for practical use. We then present
a general and fully automatic technique called Vcache based on the
decomposition of dynamic documents into a hierarchy of templates and bindings.
The technique is designed keeping in mind languages like Perl and C etc that
generate the documents using low-level print like statements. These languages
together, account for the largest number of dynamic documents on the web.
