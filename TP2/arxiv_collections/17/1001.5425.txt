We report a breakthrough in the search for versatile diffractive elements for
cold neutrons. Nanoparticles are spatially arranged by holographical means in a
photopolymer. These grating structures show remarkably efficient diffraction of
cold neutrons up to about 50% for effective thicknesses of only 200 micron.
They open up a profound perspective for next generation neutron-optical devices
with the capability to tune or modulate the neutron diffraction efficiency.
