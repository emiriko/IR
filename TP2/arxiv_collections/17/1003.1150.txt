The breakthrough of quantum error correction brought with it the picture of
quantum information as a sort of combination of two complementary types of
classical information, "amplitude" and "phase". Here I show how this intuition
can be used to construct two new conditions for approximate quantum error
correction. The first states that entanglement is locally recoverable from a
bipartite state when one system can be used to approximately predict the
outcomes of two complementary observables on the other. The second, more in the
spirit of the recent decoupling approach, states that entanglement is locally
recoverable when the environment cannot reliably predict either.
