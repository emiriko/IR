We discuss a novel mechanism of dust acceleration which may dominate for
particles smaller than $\sim0.1~\mu$m. The acceleration is caused by their
direct electrostatic interactions arising from fluctuations of grain charges.
The energy source for the acceleration are the irreversible plasma processes
occurring on the grain surfaces. We show that this mechanism of
charge-fluctuation-induced acceleration likely affects the rate of grain
coagulation and shattering of the population of small grains.
