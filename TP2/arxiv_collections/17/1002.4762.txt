We consider Vlasov-type scaling for the Glauber dynamics in continuum with a
positive integrable potential, and construct rescaled and limiting evolutions
of correlation functions. Convergence to the limiting evolution for the
positive density system in infinite volume is shown. Chaos preservation
property of this evolution gives a possibility to derive a non-linear
Vlasov-type equation for the particle density of the limiting system.
