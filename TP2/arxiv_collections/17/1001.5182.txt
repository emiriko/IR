The existence of low frequency waveguide modes of ion acoustic waves is
demonstrated in magnetized plasmas for electron temperature striated along the
magnetic field lines. At higher frequencies, in a band between the ion
cyclotron and the ion plasma frequency, radiative modes develop and propagate
obliquely to the field away from the striation. Arguments for the subsequent
formation and propagation of electrostatic shock are presented and demonstrated
numerically. For such plasma conditions, the dissipation mechanism is the
"leakage" of the harmonics generated by the wave steepening.
