A new method is presented for calculation of the shell correction with the
inclusion of the continuum part of the spectrum. The smoothing function used
has a finite energy range in contrast to the Gaussian shape of the Strutinski
method. The new method is specially useful for light nuclei where the
generalized Strutinski procedure can not be applied.
