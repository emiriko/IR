A quaternionic wavefunction consisting of real and scalar functions is found
to satisfy the quaternionic momentum eigenvalue equation. Each of these
components are found to satisfy a generalized wave equation of the form
$\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2\psi_0}{\partial t^2} -
\nabla^2\psi_0+2(\frac{m_0}{\hbar})\frac{\partial\psi_0}{\partial
t}+(\frac{m_0c}{\hbar})^2\psi_0=0$. This reduces to the massless Klein-Gordon
equation, if we replace $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\to\frac{\partial}{\partial
t}+\frac{m_0c^2}{\hbar}$. For a plane wave solution the angular frequency is
complex and is given by $\vec{\omega}_\pm=i\frac{m_0c^2}{\hbar}\pm c\vec{k} $,
where $\vec{k}$ is the propagation constant vector. This equation is in
agreement with the Einstein energy-momentum formula. The spin of the particle
is obtained from the interaction of the particle with the photon field.
