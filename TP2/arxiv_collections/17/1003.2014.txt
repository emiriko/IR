We construct a framework within which a mathematically precise, fully
covariant, and exact averaging procedure for tensor fields on a manifold can be
formulated. In particular, we introduce the Weitzenb\"ock connection for
parallel transport and argue that, within the context of averaging, frames and
connections are the natural geometrical objects on the manifold.
