We introduce a measurement scheme that utilizes a single ion as a local field
probe. The ion is confined in a segmented Paul trap and shuttled around to
reach different probing sites. By the use of a single atom probe, it becomes
possible characterizing fields with spatial resolution of a few nm within an
extensive region of millimeters. We demonstrate the scheme by accurately
investigating the electric fields providing the confinement for the ion. For
this we present all theoretical and practical methods necessary to generate
these potentials. We find sub-percent agreement between measured and calculated
electric field values.
