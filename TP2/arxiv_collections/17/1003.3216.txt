We have realized multifacet Josephson junctions with periodically alternating
critical current density (MJJs) using
superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor heterostructures. We show
that anomalous features of critical current vs. applied magnetic field,
observed also for other types of MJJs, are caused by a non-uniform flux density
(parallel to the barrier) resulting from screening currents in the electrodes
in the presence of a (parasitic) off-plane field component.
