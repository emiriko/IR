Homogeneous isotropic models built in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge
theory of gravity (PGTG) based on general expression of gravitational
Lagrangian without cosmological constant are analyzed. It is shown that the
physical spacetime in the vacuum in the frame of PGTG can have the structure of
flat de Sitter spacetime with torsion. Some physical consequences of obtained
conclusion are discussed.
