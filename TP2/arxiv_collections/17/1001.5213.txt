We investigate the transport properties of double-gated bilayer graphene
nanoribbons at room temperature. The devices were fabricated using conventional
CMOS-compatible processes. By analyzing the dependence of the resistance at the
charge neutrality point as a function of the electric field applied
perpendicular to the graphene surface, we show that a band gap in the density
of states opens, reaching an effective value of ~sim50 meV. This demonstrates
the potential of bilayer graphene as FET channel material in a conventional
CMOS environment.
