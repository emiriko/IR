If dark matter (DM) simply consists in a scalar particle interacting
dominantly with the Higgs boson, the ratio of its annihilation cross section
---which is relevant both for the relic abundance and indirect detection--- and
its spin-independent scattering cross section on nuclei depends only on the DM
mass. It is an intriguing result that, fixing the mass and direct detection
rate to fit the annual modulation observed by the DAMA experiment, one obtains
a relic density in perfect agreement with its observed value. In this short
letter we update this result and confront the model to the recent CoGeNT data,
tentatively interpreting the excess of events in the recoil energy spectrum as
being due to DM. CoGeNT, as DAMA, points toward a light DM candidate, with
somewhat different (but not necessarily incompatible) masses and cross
sections. For the CoGeNT region too, we find an intriguing agreement between
the scalar DM relic density and direct detection constraints. We give the one
$\sigma$ region favoured by the CDMS-II events, and our exclusion limits for
the Xenon10 (2009) and Xenon100 data, which, depending on the scintillation
efficiency, may exclude CoGeNT and DAMA. Assuming CoGeNT and/or DAMA to be due
to scalar singlet DM leads to definite predictions regarding indirect detection
and at colliders. We specifically emphasize the limit on the model that might
be set by the current {\it Fermi}-LAT data on dwarf galaxies, and the
implications for the search for the Higgs at the LHC.
