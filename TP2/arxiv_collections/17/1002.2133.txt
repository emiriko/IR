We show here that the morphological pathway of spontaneous dewetting of
ultrathin Ag films on SiO2 under nanosecond laser melting is found to be film
thickness dependent. For films with thickness h between 2 <= h <= 9.5 nm, the
morphology during the intermediate stages of dewetting consisted of
bicontinuous structures. For films 11.5 <= h <= 20 nm, the intermediate stages
consisted of regularly-sized holes. Measurement of the characteristic length
scales for different stages of dewetting as a function of film thickness showed
a systematic increase, which is consistent with the spinodal dewetting
instability over the entire thickness range investigated. This change in
morphology with thickness is consistent with observations made previously for
polymer films [A. Sharma et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., v81, pp3463 (1998); R.
Seemann et al, J. Phys. Cond. Matt., v13, pp4925, (2001)]. Based on the
behavior of free energy curvature that incorporates intermolecular forces, we
have estimated the morphological transition thickness for the intermolecular
forces for Ag on SiO2 . The theory predictions agree well with observations for
Ag. These results show that it is possible to form a variety of complex Ag
nanomorphologies in a consistent manner, which could be useful in optical
applications of Ag surfaces, such as in surface enhanced Raman sensing.
