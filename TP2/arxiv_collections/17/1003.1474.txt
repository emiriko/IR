An aspect of fluid dynamics lies in the search of possible statistical models
for Navier-Stokes (NS) fluids described by classical solutions of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE). This refers in particular to
statistical models based on the so-called inverse kinetic theory (IKT) . This
approach allows the description of fluid systems by means a suitable 1-point
velocity probability density function (PDF) which determines, in terms of
suitable "moments", the complete set of fluid fields which define the fluid
state. A fundamental related issue lies in the problem of the unique
construction of the initial PDF. The goal of this paper is to propose a
solution holding for NS fluids. Our claim is that the initial PDF can be
uniquely determined by imposing a suitable set of physical realizability
constraints.
