The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect has a distinct spectral signature that
allows its separation from fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and foregrounds. Using CMB anisotropies measured in Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe's five-year maps, we constrain the SZ fluctuations at large,
degree angular scales corresponding to multipoles in the range from 10 to 400.
We provide upper bounds on SZ fluctuations at multipoles greater than 50, and
find evidence for a hemispherically asymmetric signal at ten degrees angular
scales. The amplitude of the detected signal cannot be easily explained with
the allowed number density and temperature of electrons in the Galactic halo.
We have failed to explain the excess signal as a residual from known Galactic
foregrounds or instrumental uncertainties such as 1/f-noise.
