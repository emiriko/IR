We investigate the maximum size of CP violating effects in $D$-mixing within
the Standard Model (SM), using Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) as theoretical
working tool. For this purpose we determine the leading HQE contributions and
also $\alpha_s$ corrections as well as subleading $1/m_c$ corrections to the
absorptive part of the mixing amplitude of neutral $D$ mesons. It turns out
that these contributions to $\Gamma_{12}$ do not vanish in the exact
SU$(3)_\mathrm{F}$ limit. Moreover, while the leading HQE terms give a result
for $\Gamma_{12}$ orders of magnitude lower than the current experimental
value, we do find a sizeable phase. In the literature it was suggested that
higher order terms in the HQE might be much less affected by the severe GIM
cancellations of the leading terms; it is even not excluded that these higher
order terms can reproduce the experimental value of $y$. If such an enhancement
is realized in nature, the phase discovered in the leading HQE terms can have a
sizeable effect. Therefore, we think that statements like: {\it "CP violating
effects in $D$-mixing of the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ are an unambigous
sign of new physics"}--given our limited knowlegde of the SM prediction--are
premature. Finally, we give an example of a new physics model that can enhance
the leading HQE terms to $\Gamma_{12}$ by one to two orders of magnitude.
