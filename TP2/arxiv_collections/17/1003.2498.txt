Several new aspects of the subtle interplay between electronic correlations
and disorder are reviewed. First, the dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT)together with the geometrically averaged ("typical") local density of
states is employed to compute the ground state phase diagram of the
Anderson-Hubbard model at half-filling. This non-perturbative approach is
sensitive to Anderson localization on the one-particle level and hence can
detect correlated metallic, Mott insulating and Anderson insulating phases and
can also describe the competition between Anderson localization and
antiferromagnetism. Second, we investigate the effect of binary alloy disorder
on ferromagnetism in materials with $f$-electrons described by the periodic
Anderson model. A drastic enhancement of the Curie temperature $T_c$ caused by
an increase of the local $f$-moments in the presence of disordered conduction
electrons is discovered and explained.
