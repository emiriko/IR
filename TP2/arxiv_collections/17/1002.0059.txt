The most general nonuniform reaction-diffusion models on a one-dimensional
lattice with boundaries, for which the time evolution equations of corre-
lation functions are closed, are considered. A transfer matrix method is used
to find the static solution. It is seen that this transfer matrix can be
obtained in a closed form, if the reaction rates satisfy certain conditions. We
call such models superautonomous. Possible static phase transitions of such
models are investigated. At the end, as an example of superau- tonomous models,
a nonuniform voter model is introduced, and solved explicitly.
