After almost half a century since the work of Anderson [Phys. Rev. {\bf 109},
1492 (1958)], at present there is no well established theoretical framework for
understanding the dynamics of interacting particles in the presence of
disorder. Here, we address this problem for interacting bosons near $T=0$, a
situation that has been realized in trapped atomic experiments with an optical
speckle disorder. We develop a theoretical model for understanding the
hydrodynamic transport of \emph{finite-size} Bose-Einstein condensates through
disorder potentials. The goal has been to set up a simple model that will
retain all the richness of the system, yet provide analytic expressions,
allowing deeper insight into the physical mechanism. Comparison of our
theoretical predictions with the experimental data on large-amplitude dipole
oscillations of a condensate in an optical-speckle disorder shows striking
agreement. We are able to quantify various dissipative regimes of slow and fast
damping. Our calculations provide a clear evidence of reduction in disorder
strength due to interactions. The analytic treatment presented here allows us
to predict the power law governing the interaction dependance of damping. The
corresponding exponents are found to depend sensitively on the dimensionality
and are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Thus, the
adeptness of our model, to correctly capture the essential physics of
dissipation in such transport experiments, is established.
