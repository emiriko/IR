This volume contains the papers presented at the 19th Workshop on Logic-
based methods in Programming Environments (WLPE'09), which was held in
Pasadena, USA, on July 14th, 2009.
  WLPE aims at providing an informal meeting for researchers working on
logic-based methods and tools which support program development and analy- sis.
This year, we have continued and consolidated the shift in focus from en-
vironmental tools for logic programming to logic-based environmental tools for
programming in general, so that this workshop can be possibly interesting for a
wider scientific community.
  All the papers submitted to WLPE'09 have gone through a careful process of
peer reviewing, with at least three reviews for each paper and a subsequent
in-depth discussion in the Program Committee.
