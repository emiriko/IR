We address the problems of estimating the computer efficiency and the
computer capacity. We define the computer efficiency and capacity and suggest a
method for their estimation, based on the analysis of processor instructions
and kinds of accessible memory. It is shown how the suggested method can be
applied to estimate the computer capacity. In particular, this consideration
gives a new look at the organization of the memory of a computer. Obtained
results can be of some interest for practical applications
