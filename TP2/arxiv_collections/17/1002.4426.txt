We prove, via an elementary variational method, 1d and 2d localization within
the band gaps of a periodic Schrodinger operator for any mostly negative or
mostly positive defect potential, V, whose depth is not too great compared to
the size of the gap. In a similar way, we also prove sufficient conditions for
1d and 2d localization below the ground state of such an operator. Furthermore,
we extend our results to 1d and 2d localization in d dimensions; for example, a
linear or planar defect in a 3d crystal. For the case of D-fold degenerate band
edges, we also give sufficient conditions for localization of up to D states.
