We study the rapidity spectra in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions in
the framework of the Landau hydrodynamical model. We find that thermal smearing
effects improve the agreement with experimental results on pion rapidity
spectra. We describe a simple model of the hadronization and discuss its
consequences regarding the pion multiplicity and the increasing entropy
condition.
