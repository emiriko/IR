We prove the existence of orbitally stable standing waves with prescribed
$L^2$-norm for the following Schr\"odinger-Poisson type equation \label{intro}
%{%{ll} i\psi_{t}+ \Delta \psi - (|x|^{-1}*|\psi|^{2}) \psi+|\psi|^{p-2}\psi=0
\text{in} \R^{3}, %-\Delta\phi= |\psi|^{2}& \text{in} \R^{3},%. when $p\in
\{8/3\}\cup (3,10/3)$. In the case $3<p<10/3$ we prove the existence and
stability only for sufficiently large $L^2$-norm. In case $p=8/3$ our approach
recovers the result of Sanchez and Soler \cite{SS} %concerning the existence
and stability for sufficiently small charges. The main point is the analysis of
the compactness of minimizing sequences for the related constrained
minimization problem. In a final section a further application to the
Schr\"odinger equation involving the biharmonic operator is given.
