The classical model of signaling games assumes that the receiver exactly know
the type space (private information) of the sender and be able to discriminate
each type of the sender distinctly. However, the justification of this
assumption is questionable. It is more reasonable to let the receiver recognize
the pattern of the sender. In this paper, we investigate what happens if the
assumption is relaxed. A framework of signaling games with pattern recognition
and an example are given.
