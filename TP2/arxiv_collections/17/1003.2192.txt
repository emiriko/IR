The aim of this paper is to classify order-preserving functions according to
their arity gap. Noteworthy examples of order-preserving functions are
so-called aggregation functions. We first explicitly classify the Lov\'asz
extensions of pseudo-Boolean functions according to their arity gap. Then we
consider the class of order-preserving functions between partially ordered
sets, and establish a similar explicit classification for this function class.
