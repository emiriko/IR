In a recent paper (Straus et al. 2008) we determined the energy flux of
internal gravity waves in the lower solar atmosphere using a combination of 3D
numerical simulations and observations obtained with the IBIS instrument
operated at the Dunn Solar Telescope and the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on
SOHO. In this paper we extend these studies using coordinated observations from
SOT/NFI and SOT/SP on Hinode and MDI. The new measurements confirm that gravity
waves are the dominant phenomenon in the quiet middle/upper photosphere and
that they transport more mechanical energy than the high-frequency (> 5mHz)
acoustic waves, even though we find an acoustic flux 3-5 times larger than the
upper limit estimate of Fossum & Carlsson (2005). It therefore appears
justified to reconsider the significance of (non-M)HD waves for the energy
balance of the solar chromosphere.
