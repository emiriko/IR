This article presents the results of the research carried out on the
development of a medical diagnostic system applied to the Acute Bacterial
Meningitis, using the Case Based Reasoning methodology. The research was
focused on the implementation of the adaptation stage, from the integration of
Case Based Reasoning and Rule Based Expert Systems. In this adaptation stage we
use a higher level RBC that stores and allows reutilizing change experiences,
combined with a classic rule-based inference engine. In order to take into
account the most evident clinical situation, a pre-diagnosis stage is
implemented using a rule engine that, given an evident situation, emits the
corresponding diagnosis and avoids the complete process.
