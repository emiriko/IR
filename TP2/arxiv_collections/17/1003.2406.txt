The Perseus galaxy cluster is known to present multiple and misaligned pairs
of cavities seen in X-rays, as well as twisted kiloparsec-scale jets at radio
wavelengths; both morphologies suggest that the AGN jet is subject to
precession. In this work we performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the
interaction between a precessing AGN jet and the warm intracluster medium
plasma, which dynamics is coupled to a NFW dark matter gravitational potential.
The AGN jet inflates cavities that become buoyantly unstable and rise up out of
the cluster core. We found that under certain circumstances precession can
originate multiple pairs of bubbles. For the physical conditions in the Perseus
cluster, multiple pairs of bubbles are obtained for a jet precession opening
angle > 40 degrees acting for at least three precession periods, reproducing
well both radio and X-ray maps. Based on such conditions, assuming that the
Bardeen-Peterson effect is dominant, we studied the evolution of the precession
opening angle of this system. We were able to constrain the ratio between the
accretion disc and black hole angular momenta as 0.7 - 1.4. We were also able
to constrain the present precession angle to 30 - 40 degrees, as well as the
approximate age of the inflated bubbles to 100 - 150 Myrs.
