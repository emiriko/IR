The distribution of temperature and emission measure in the stationary heated
solar atmosphere was obtained for the limiting cases of slow and fast heating,
when either the gas pressure or the concentration are constant throughout the
layer depth. Under these conditions the temperature distribution with depth is
determined by radiation loss and thermal conductivity. It is shown that both in
the case of slow heating and of impulsive heating, temperatures are distributed
in such a way that classical collisional heat conduction is valid in the
chromosphere-corona transition region of the solar atmosphere.
