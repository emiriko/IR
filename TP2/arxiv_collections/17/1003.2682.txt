In \cite{Spi}, we developed a category of databases in which the schema of a
database is represented as a simplicial set. Each simplex corresponds to a
table in the database. There, our main concern was to find a categorical
formulation of databases; the simplicial nature of the schemas was to some
degree unexpected and unexploited.
  In the present note, we show how to use this geometric formulation
effectively on a computer. If we think of each simplex as a polygonal tile, we
can imagine assembling custom databases by mixing and matching tiles. Queries
on this database can be performed by drawing paths through the resulting tile
formations, selecting records at the start-point of this path and retrieving
corresponding records at its end-point.
