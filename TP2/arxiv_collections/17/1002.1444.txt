Stereo data collected by the HiRes experiment over a six year period are
examined for large-scale anisotropy related to the inhomogeneous distribution
of matter in the nearby Universe. We consider the generic case of small
cosmic-ray deflections and a large number of sources tracing the matter
distribution. In this matter tracer model the expected cosmic ray flux depends
essentially on a single free parameter, the typical deflection angle theta. We
find that the HiRes data with threshold energies of 40 EeV and 57 EeV are
incompatible with the matter tracer model at a 95% confidence level unless
theta is larger than 10 degrees and are compatible with an isotropic flux. The
data set above 10 EeV is compatible with both the matter tracer model and an
isotropic flux.
