The cache replacement algorithm plays an important role in the overall
performance of Proxy-Server system. In this paper we have proposed VoD cache
memory replacement algorithm for a multimedia server system. We propose a Rank
based cache replacement policy to manage the cache space in individual proxy
server cache. Proposed replacement strategy incorporates in a simple way the
most important characteristics of the video and its accesses such as its size,
access frequency, recentness of the last access and the cost incurred while
transferring the requested video from the server to the proxy. We compare our
algorithm with some popular cache replacement algorithm using simulation. The
video objects are ranked based on the access trend by considering the factors
such as size, frequency and cost. Many studies have demonstrated that
Zipf's-like law can govern many features of the VoD and is used to describe the
popularity of the video. In this paper, we have designed a model, which ranks
the video on the basis of its popularity using the Zipf-like law. The video
with higher ranking is named "hot", while the video with lower ranking is named
"cold". The result show that the proposed rank based algorithm improves cache
hit ratio, cache byte ratio and average request latencies compared to other
algorithms. Our experimental results indicate that Rank based cache replacement
algorithm outperforms LRU, LFU and Greedy Dual.
