Chemically Peculiar (CP) stars have been subject of systematic research since
more than 50 years. With the discovery of pulsation of some of the cool CP
stars, the availability of advanced spectropolarimetric instrumentation and
high signal- to-noise, high resolution spectroscopy, a new era of CP star
research emerged about 20 years ago. Together with the success in ground-based
observations, new space projects are developed that will greatly benefit for
future investigations of these unique objects. In this contribution we will
give an overview of some interesting results obtained recently from
ground-based observations and discuss on future outstanding Gaia space mission
and its impact on CP star research.
