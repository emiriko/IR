We demonstrate behaviour of the momentum space screened Coulomb t-matrix,
obtained by a numerical solution of the three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger
equation. Examples are given for different types of screening. They prove that
it is possible to obtain numerically a reliable three-dimensional screened
Coulomb t-matrix, what is important in view of its application in few-body
calculations.
