This topical review describes the methodology of continuum variational and
diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations. These stochastic methods are based
on many-body wave functions and are capable of achieving very high accuracy.
The algorithms are intrinsically parallel and well-suited to petascale
computers, and the computational cost scales as a polynomial of the number of
particles. A guide to the systems and topics which have been investigated using
these methods is given. The bulk of the article is devoted to an overview of
the basic quantum Monte Carlo methods, the forms and optimisation of wave
functions, performing calculations within periodic boundary conditions, using
pseudopotentials, excited-state calculations, sources of calculational
inaccuracy, and calculating energy differences and forces.
