The operation principles of nanoscale devices are based upon both electronic
and mechanical properties of materials. Because these properties can be
coupled, they need to be investigated simultaneously. At this moment, however,
the electronic structure calculations with custom-made long-range mechanical
distortions are impossible, or expensive at best. Here we present a unified
formalism to solve exactly the electronic structures of nanomaterials with
versatile distortions. We illustrate the formalism by investigating twisted
armchair graphene nanoribbons with the least possible number of atoms. Apart
from enabling versatile material distortions, the formalism is capable of
reducing computational costs orders of magnitude in various areas of science
and engineering.
