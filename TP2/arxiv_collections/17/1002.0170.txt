In this paper, we study the dynamics of a viral spreading process in random
geometric graphs (RGG). The spreading of the viral process we consider in this
paper is closely related with the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the
graph. We deduce new explicit expressions for all the moments of the eigenvalue
distribution of the adjacency matrix as a function of the spatial density of
nodes and the radius of connection. We apply these expressions to study the
behavior of the viral infection in an RGG. Based on our results, we deduce an
analytical condition that can be used to design RGG's in order to tame an
initial viral infection. Numerical simulations are in accordance with our
analytical predictions.
