High-quality quantum sources are of paramount importance for the
implementation of quantum technologies. We present here a heralded
single-photon source based on commercial-grade polarization-maintaining optical
fiber. The heralded photons exhibit a purity of at least 0.84 and an
unprecedented heralding efficiency into single-mode fiber of 85%. The
birefringent phase-matching condition of the underlying four-wave mixing
process can be controlled mechanically to optimize the wavelength tuning needed
for interfacing multiple sources, as are required for large-scale entanglement
generation.
