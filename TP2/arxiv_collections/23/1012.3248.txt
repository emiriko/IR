We report testing of the new absolute method of photodetectors calibration
based on the difference-signal measurement for two-mode squeezed vacuum by
comparison with the traditional absolute method based on the coincidence
counting. Using low-gain parametric down conversion we have measured the
quantum efficiency of a counting detector by both methods. The
difference-signal method was adapted for the counting detectors by taking into
account the dead-time effect.
