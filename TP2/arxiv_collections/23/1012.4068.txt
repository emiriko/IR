The paper \cite{Dance0601} tentatively suggested a physical picture that
might underlie string theories. The string parameters $\tau $ and $\sigma_i $
were interpreted as spacetime dimensions which a simple quantum mechanical
observer can observe, while symmetries of the relevant observer states could
limit the observability of other dimensions. The present paper extends the
discussion by outlining how consideration of different observers, at least one
of which is quantum mechanical, might provide insights into the nature of the
AdS/CFT correspondence. It is suggested that such correspondences might arise
as different forms of theories about the world as perceived by different
observers.
