Operator precedence grammars define a classical Boolean and deterministic
context-free family (called Floyd languages or FLs). FLs have been shown to
strictly include the well-known visibly pushdown languages, and enjoy the same
nice closure properties. We introduce here Floyd automata, an equivalent
operational formalism for defining FLs. This also permits to extend the class
to deal with infinite strings to perform for instance model checking.
