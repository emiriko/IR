I continue the study of a renormalizable four-dimensional generally covariant
Yang-Mills-like action, which depends on the Lorentzian complex structure of
spacetime and not its metric. The field equations and their integrability
conditions are written down explicitly. The model is studied with the presence
of two static external sources in the trivial cylindrical complex structure.
The energy of two static "colored" sources is found to increase linearly with
respect to their distance, providing an explicit proof of their perturbative
confinement. In the present model, confinement is not a concequence of the
non-Abelian character of the gauge group, but it is implied by the complex
structure dependence of the model.
