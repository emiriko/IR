We used oxygen ion irradiation to transfer the nanoscale pattern of a porous
alumina mask into high- superconducting thin films. This causes a nanoscale
spatial modulation of superconductivity and strongly affects the
magneto-transport below, which shows a series of periodic oscillations
reminiscent of the Little-Parks effect in superconducting wire networks. This
irradiation technique could be extended to other oxide materials in order to
induce ordered nanoscale phase segregation.
