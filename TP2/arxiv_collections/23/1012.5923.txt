We define and count lattice points in the moduli space of stable genus g
curves with n labeled points. This extends a construction of the second author
for the uncompactified moduli space. The enumeration produces polynomials with
top degree coefficients tautological intersection numbers on the compactified
moduli space and constant term the orbifold Euler characteristic of the
compactified moduli space. We also prove a recursive formula which can be used
to effectively calculate these polynomials.
