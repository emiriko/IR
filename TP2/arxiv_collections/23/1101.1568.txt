Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. In this
paper, we obtain the structure theorems for semisimple Hopf algebras of
dimension $p^2q^2$ over $k$, where $p,q$ are prime numbers with $p^2<q$. As an
application, we also obtain the structure theorems for semisimple Hopf algebras
of dimension $9p^2$ and $25q^2$ for all primes $3\neq p$ and $5\neq q$.
