We propose observations of the molecular gas distribution during the era of
reionization. At $z \sim $ 6 to 8, $^{12}$CO$(J=1-0)$ line intensity results in
a mean brightness temperature of about 0.5 $\mu$K with rms fluctuations of 0.1
$\mu$K at 1 to 10 Mpc spatial scales, corresponding to 30 arcminute angular
scales. This intensity fluctuations can be mapped with an interferometer,
similar to existing and planned 21-cm background experiments, but operating at
$\sim$ 12 to 17 GHz. We discuss the feasibility of detecting the
cross-correlation between HI and CO molecular gas since such a
cross-correlation has the advantage that it will be independent of systematics
and most foregrounds in each of the 21-cm and CO$(1-0)$ line experiments.
Additional instruments tuned to higher-order transitions of the CO molecule or
an instrument operating with high spectral resolution at mm-wavelengths
targeting 158 $\mu$m CII could further improve the reionization studies with
molecular gas. The combined 21-cm and CO line observations has the potential to
establish the relative distribution of gas in the inter-galactic medium and
molecular gas that are clumped in individual first-light galaxies that are
closely connected to the formation of massive stars in these galaxies.
