We propose a laser cooling technique in which atoms are selectively excited
to a dressed metastable state whose light shift and decay rate are spatially
correlated for Sisyphus cooling. The case of cooling magnetically trapped
(anti)hydrogen with the 1S-2S-3P transitions using pulsed ultra violet and
continuous-wave visible lasers is numerically simulated. We find a number of
appealing features including rapid 3-dimensional cooling from ~1 K to
recoil-limited, millikelvin temperatures, as well as suppressed spin-flip loss
and manageable photoionization loss.
