Striped high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors such as
La$_{2-y-x}$Nd$_{y}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{2-x}$Ba$_{x}$CuO$_4$ near $x=1/8$
show a fascinating competition between spin and charge order and
superconductivity. A theory for these systems therefore has to capture both the
spin correlations of an antiferromagnet and the pair correlations of a
superconductor. For this purpose we present here an effective Hartree-Fock
theory incorporating both electron pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum
and antiferromagnetism. We show that this theory reproduces the key
experimental features such as the formation of the antiferromagnetic stripe
patterns at 7/8 band filling or the quasi one-dimensional electronic structure
observed by photoemission spectroscopy.
