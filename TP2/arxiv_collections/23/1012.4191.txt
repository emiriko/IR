Many cell functions are accomplished thanks to intracellular transport
mechanisms of macromolecules along filaments. Molecular motors such as dynein
or kinesin are proteins playing a primary role in these processes. The behavior
of such proteins is quite well understood when there is only one of them moving
a cargo particle. Indeed, numerous in vitro experiments have been performed to
derive accurate models for a single molecular motor. However, in vivo
macromolecules are often carried by multiple motors. The main focus of this
paper is to provide an analysis of the behavior of more molecular motors
interacting together in order to improve the understanding of their actual
physiological behavior. Previous studies provide analyses based on results
obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. Different from these studies, we derive
an equipollent probabilistic model to describe the dynamics of multiple
proteins coupled together and provide an exact theoretical analysis. We are
capable of obtaining the probability density function of the motor protein
configurations, thus enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior.
