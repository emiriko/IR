We design a probabilistic algorithm for computing endomorphism rings of
ordinary elliptic curves defined over finite fields that we prove has a
subexponential runtime in the size of the base field, assuming solely the
generalized Riemann hypothesis.
  Additionally, we improve the asymptotic complexity of previously known,
heuristic, subexponential methods by describing a faster isogeny-computing
routine.
