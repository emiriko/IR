The behavior of a scalar field theory near the event horizon in a rotating
black hole background can be effectively described by a two dimensional field
theory in a gauge field background. Based on this fact, we proposal that the
quantum tunneling from rotating black hole can be treated as "charged"
particle' s tunneling process in its effectively two dimensional metric. Using
this viewpoint and considering the corresponding "gauge charge" conservation,
we calculate the non-thermal tunneling rate of Kerr black hole and Myers-Perry
black hole, and results are consistent with Parikh-Wilczek's original result
for spherically symmetric black holes. Especially for Myers-Perry black hole
which has multi-rotation parameters, our calculation fills in the gap existing
in the literature applying Parikh-Wilczek's tunneling method to various types
black holes. Our derivation further illuminates the essential role of effective
gauge symmetry in Hawking radiation from rotating black holes.
