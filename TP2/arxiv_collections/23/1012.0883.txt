Recently, in a series of works by Liu and Li (L&L), they claimed that there
exists a timing asynchrony of $-25.6\,$ms between the spacecraft attitude and
radiometer output timestamps in the original raw WMAP time-ordered data (TOD).
L&L reprocessed the WMAP data while the aforementioned timing asynchrony has
been corrected, and they obtained an alternative CMB map in which the
quadrupole dropped to nearly zero. In the present work, we try to see the
implications to dark energy cosmology if L&L are right. While L&L claimed that
there is a bug in the WMAP pipeline which leads to significantly different
cosmological parameters, an interesting question naturally arises, namely, how
robust is the current dark energy cosmology with respect to systematic errors
and bugs? So, in this work, we adopt the alternative CMB data of L&L as a
strawman to study the robustness of dark energy predictions.
