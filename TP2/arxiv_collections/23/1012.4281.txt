We present new UVES spectra of a sample of 14 mostly cool unevolved stars
with planetary companions with the aim of studying possible differences in Be
abundance with respect to stars without detected planets. We determine Be
abundances for these stars that show an increase in Be depletion as we move to
lower temperatures. We carry out a differential analysis of spectra of analog
stars with and without planets to establish a possible difference in Be
content. While for hot stars no measurable difference is found in Be, for the
only cool (Teff ~ 5000 K) planet host star with several analogs in the sample
we find enhanced Be depletion by 0.25 dex. This is a first indication that the
extra-depletion of Li in solar-type stars with planets may also happen for Be,
but shifted towards lower temperatures (Teff < 5500 K) due to the depth of the
convective envelopes. The processes that take place in the formation of
planetary systems may affect the mixing of material inside their host stars and
hence the abundances of light elements.
