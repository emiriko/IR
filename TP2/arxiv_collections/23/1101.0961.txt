I published an interview of Leo Breiman in Statistical Science [Olshen
(2001)], and also the solution to a problem concerning almost sure convergence
of binary tree-structured estimators in regression [Olshen (2007)]. The former
summarized much of my thinking about Leo up to five years before his death. I
discussed the latter with Leo and dedicated that paper to his memory.
Therefore, this note is on other topics. In preparing it I am reminded how much
I miss this man of so many talents and interests. I miss him not because I
always agreed with him, but instead because his comments about statistics in
particular and life in general always elicited my substantial reflection.
