We consider a simple experimental setup, based on a harmonic confinement,
where a Bose-Einstein condensate and a thermal cloud of weakly interacting
alkali atoms are trapped in two different vessels connected by a narrow
channel. Using the classical field approximation, as described in J. Phys. B
40, R1 (2007) and optimized in Phys. Rev. A 81, 013629 (2010) for an arbitrary
trapping potential, we theoretically investigate the analog of the celebrated
superfluid helium fountain effect. We show that this thermo-mechanical effect
might indeed be observed in this system. By analyzing the dynamics of the
system, we are able to identify the superfluid and normal components of the
flow as well as to distinguish the condensate fraction from the superfluid
component. We show that the superfluid component can easily flow from the
colder vessel to the hotter one while the normal component is practically
blocked in the latter.
