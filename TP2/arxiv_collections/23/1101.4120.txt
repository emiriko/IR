The Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii have been calculated from the two
particle correlation functions with virtual photons produced in the collisions
of two nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies. We show that the variation of the
HBT radii with the invariant mass of the virtual photon can be used to
characterize and distinguish the hadronic as well as the partonic phase that
might have produced initially in the collisions. It has been illustrated that
the non-monotonic variation of the HBT radii with invariant mass provides an
access to the development of collective flow in the system.
