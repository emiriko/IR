We consider the spatial power spectra associated with fluctuations of
quadratic operators in field theory, such as quantum stress tensor components.
We show that the power spectrum can be negative, in contrast to most
fluctuation phenomena where the Wiener-Khinchine theorem requires a positive
power spectrum. We show why the usual argument for positivity fails in this
case, and discuss the physical interpretation of negative power spectra.
Possible applications to cosmology are discussed.
