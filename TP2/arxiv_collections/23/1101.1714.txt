We study theoretically interspecies Cooper pairing in a fermionic system with
SU(2)xSU(6) sym- metry. We show that, with suitable unitary transformations,
the order parameter for the ground state can be reduced to only two
non-vanishing complex components. The ground state has a large degeneracy. We
find that while some Goldstone modes have linear dispersions, others are
quadratic at low frequencies. We compare our results with the case of SU(N).
