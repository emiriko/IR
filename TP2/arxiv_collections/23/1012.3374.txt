After a review of the problems induced by the Lorentz signature of Minkowski
space-time, like the need of a clock synchronization convention for the
definition of 3-space and the complexity of the notion of relativistic center
of mass, there is the introduction of a new formulation of relativistic quantum
mechanics compatible with the theory of relativistic bound states. In it the
zeroth postulate of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is not valid and the
physics is described in the rest frame by a Hilbert space containing only
relative variables. The non-locality of the Poincare' generators imply a
kinematical non-locality and non-separability influencing the theory of
relativistic entanglement and not connected with the standard quantum
non-locality.
