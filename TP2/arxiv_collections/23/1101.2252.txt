We introduce a higher rank analog of the Joyce-Song theory of stable pairs.
Given a nonsingular projective Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, we define the higher
rank Joyce-Song pairs given by ${O}^{r}_{X}(-n)\rightarrow F$ where $F$ is a
pure coherent sheaf with one dimensional support, $r>1$ and $n\gg 0$ is a fixed
integer. We equip the higher rank pairs with a Joyce-Song stability condition
and compute their associated invariants using the wallcrossing techniques in
the category of weakly semistable objects.
