In this paper we analyze American style of floating strike Asian call options
belonging to the class of financial derivatives whose payoff diagram depends
not only on the underlying asset price but also on the path average of
underlying asset prices over some predetermined time interval. The mathematical
model for the option price leads to a free boundary problem for a parabolic
partial differential equation. Applying fixed domain transformation and
transformation of variables we develop an efficient numerical algorithm based
on a solution to a non-local parabolic partial differential equation for the
transformed variable representing the synthesized portfolio. For various types
of averaging methods we investigate the dependence of the early exercise
boundary on model parameters.
