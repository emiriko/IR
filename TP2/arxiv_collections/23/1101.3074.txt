Let $M_n$ denote a random symmetric $n$ by $n$ matrix, whose upper diagonal
entries are iid Bernoulli random variables (which take value -1 and 1 with
probability 1/2). Improving the earlier result by Costello, Tao and Vu, we show
that $M_n$ is non-singular with probability $1-O(n^{-C})$ for any positive
constant $C$. The proof uses an inverse Littlewood-Offord result for quadratic
forms, which is of interest of its own.
