We investigate the evolution of grains composed of an ice shell surrounding
an olivine core as they pass through a spiral shock in a protoplanetary disk.
We use published three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of
massive self-gravitating protoplanetary disks to extract the thermodynamics of
spiral shocks in the region between 10 and 20 AU from the central star. As the
density wave passes, it heats the grains, causing them to lose their ice shell
and resulting in a lowering of the grain opacity. In addition, since grains of
different sizes will have slightly different temperatures, there will be a
migration of ice from the hotter grains to the cooler ones. The rate of
migration depends on the temperature of the background gas, so a grain
distribution that is effectively stable for low temperatures, can undergo an
irreversible change in opacity if the gas is temporarily heated to above $\sim
150$\,K. We find that the opacity can drop more, and at a significantly faster
rate throughout the spiral shocks relative to the prediction of standard dust
grains models adopted in hydrodynamical calculations of protoplanetary disks.
This would lead to faster gas cooling within spiral arms. We discuss the
implications of our results on the susceptibility of disk fragmentation into
sub-stellar objects at distances of a few tens of astronomical units.
