For a nonzero ideal I of C[x_1,...,x_n], with 0 in supp I, a generalization
of a conjecture of Igusa - Denef - Loeser predicts that every pole of its
topological zeta function is a root of its Bernstein-Sato polynomial. However,
typically only a few roots are obtained this way. Following ideas of Veys, we
study the following question. Is it possible to find a collection G of
polynomials g in C[x_1,...,x_n], such that, for all g in G, every pole of the
topological zeta function associated to I and the volume form gdx on the affine
n-space, is a root of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of I, and such that all
roots are realized in this way. We obtain a negative answer to this question,
providing counterexamples for monomial and principal ideals in dimension two,
and give a partial positive result as well.
