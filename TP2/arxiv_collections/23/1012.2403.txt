Results from the measurement of dynamical $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ ratio
fluctuations are presented. Dynamical fluctuations in global conserved
quantities such as baryon number, strangeness, or charge may be observed near a
QCD critical point. The first measurement of results of $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$
fluctuations from Cu+Cu collisions at an energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 22.4 GeV are
shown. This energy range is close to the top SPS energy and has garnered
additional interest due to the proposed QCD critical point search at RHIC. The
new Cu+Cu data is compared to previous results from Au+Au collisions at the
energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV, and to measurements
from the NA49 experiment. The dynamical $K/\pi$ fluctuation results from Cu+Cu
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 22.4 GeV are in good agreement with previous measurements
from the STAR and NA49 experiments near that energy. Results are compared to
theoretical predictions from several models including the HIJING and UrQMD
models.
