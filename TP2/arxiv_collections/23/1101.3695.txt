Circumstellar disks and outflows play a fundamental role in star formation.
Infrared spectro-interferometry allows the inner accretion-ejection region to
be resolved. We measured interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differential
phases, and closure phases of MWC 297 with a spectral resolution of 12000. To
interpret our MWC 297 observations, we employed disk-wind models. The measured
continuum visibilities confirm previous results that the continuum-emitting
region of MWC 297 is remarkably compact. We derive a continuum ring-fit radius
of ~2.2 mas (~0.56 AU at a distance of 250 pc), which is ~5.4 times smaller
than the 3 AU dust sublimation radius expected for silicate grains (in the
absence of radiation-shielding material). The strongly wavelength-dependent and
asymmetric Br gamma-emitting region is more extended (~2.7 times) than the
continuum-emitting region. At the center of the Br gamma line, we derive a
Gaussian fit radius of ~6.3 mas HWHM (~1.6 AU). To interpret the observations,
we employ a magneto-centrifugally driven disk-wind model consisting of an
accretion disk, which emits the observed continuum radiation, and a disk wind,
which emits the Br gamma line. The calculated wavelength-dependent model
intensity distributions and Br gamma line profiles are compared with the
observations (i.e., K-band spectrum, visibilities, differential phases, and
closure phases). The closest fitting model predicts a continuum-emitting disk
with an inner radius of ~0.3 AU and a disk wind ejection region with an inner
radius of ~0.5 AU (~17.5 stellar radii). We obtain a disk-wind half-opening
angle (the angle between the rotation axis and the innermost streamline of the
disk wind) of ~80 degrees, which is larger than in T Tau models, and a disk
inclination angle of ~20 degrees (i.e., almost pole-on).
