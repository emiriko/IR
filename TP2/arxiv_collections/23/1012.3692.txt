We discuss a question whether the observed Weinberg angle and Higgs mass are
calculable in the formalism based on a construction in which the electroweak
gauge group $SU(2)\times U(1)_{Y}$ is embedded in the graded Lie group
$SU(2/1)$. Here we follow original works of Ne'eman and Fairlie believing that
bosonic fields take their values in the Lie superalgebra and fermionic fields
take their values in its representation space. At the same time, our approach
differs significantly. The main one is that while for them the gauge symmetry
group is $SU(2/1)$, here we consider only symmetries generated by its even
subgroup, i.e., symmetries of the standard electroweak model. The reason is
that such formalism fixes the quartic Higgs coupling and at the same time
removes the sign and statistics problems. The main result is that the presented
model predicts values of the Weinberg angle and the Higgs mass correctly up to
the two-loop level. Moreover, the model sets the unification scale coinciding
with the electroweak scale and automatically describes the fermions correctly
with the correct quark and lepton charges.
