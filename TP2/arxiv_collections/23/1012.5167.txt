In this article, we show that the spheres $S_R(o)=\{z\in\mathbb C^n: |z|=R\}$
are sets of injectivity for the weighted twisted spherical means (WTSM) for a
suitable class of functions on $\mathbb C^n$. The weights here are spherical
harmonics on $S^{2n-1}.$ In general, the question of set of injectivity for the
twisted spherical means (TSM) with real analytic weight is still open. We would
like to refer to \cite{NRR}, for some results on the sets of injectivity for
the spherical means with real analytic weights in the Euclidean setup.
