The recent discovery and analysis of a classical Cepheid in the well
detached, double-lined, eclipsing binary OGLE-LMC-CEP0227, has provided the
first determination of the dynamical mass of a classical Cepheid variable to an
unprecedented 1% accuracy. We show here that modern stellar evolution models
widely employed to study Galactic and extragalactic stellar systems, are able
to match simultaneously mass and radius (and effective temperature) of the two
components with a single value for the age of the system, without any specific
fine-tuning. Our conclusion is that there is no discrepancy between dynamical
and evolutionary masses for the Cepheid star in this system, contrary to
previous claims of an overestimate of the Cepheid mass by stellar evolution
theory.
