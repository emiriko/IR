We report results of initial work done on selected candidate Cepheids to be
observed with the Kepler space telescope. Prior to the launch 40 candidates
were selected from previous surveys and databases. The analysis of the first
322 days of Kepler photometry, and recent ground-based follow-up multicolour
photometry and spectroscopy allowed us to confirm that one of these stars,
V1154 Cyg (KIC 7548061), is indeed a 4.9-d Cepheid. Using the phase lag method
we show that this star pulsates in the fundamental mode. New radial velocity
data are consistent with previous measurements, suggesting that a long-period
binary component is unlikely. No evidence is seen in the ultra-precise, nearly
uninterrupted Kepler photometry for nonradial or stochastically excited modes
at the micromagnitude level. The other candidates are not Cepheids but an
interesting mix of possible spotted stars, eclipsing systems and flare stars.
