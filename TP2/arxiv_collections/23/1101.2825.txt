Optical vortices have been observed in a wide variety of optical systems.
They can be observed directly in the wavefront of optical beams, or in the
correlations between pairs of entangled photons. We present a novel optical
vortex which appears in a non-local plane of the two-photon phase space,
composed of a single degree of freedom of each photon of an entangled pair. The
preparation of this vortex can be viewed as a "non-local" or distributed mode
converter. We show how these novel optical vortices of arbitrary order can be
prepared in the spatial degrees of freedom of entangled photons.
