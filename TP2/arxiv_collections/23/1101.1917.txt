We examine the wavelength dependence of flux ratios for six gravitationally
lensed quasars using K and L' images obtained at the Gemini North 8m telescope.
We select lenses with source redshifts z_s < 2.8 so that K-band images probe
rest-frame optical emission from accretion disks, while L'-band images probe
rest-frame near-infrared flux emitted (in part) from the more extended
surrounding torus. Since the observations correspond to different source sizes,
the K and L' flux ratios are sensitive to structure on different scales and may
be useful for studying small-structure in the lens galaxies. Four of the six
lenses show differences between K and L' flux ratios. In HE 0435$-1223, SDSS
0246-0825, and HE 2149-2745 the differences may be attributable to known
microlensing and/or intrinsic variability. In SDSS 0806+2006 the wavelength
dependence is not easily attributed to known variations, and may indicate the
presence of substructure. By contrast, in Q0142-100 and SBS 0909+523 the K and
L' flux ratios are consistent within the uncertainties. We discuss the utility
of the current data for studying chromatic effects related to microlensing,
dust extinction, and dark matter substructure.
