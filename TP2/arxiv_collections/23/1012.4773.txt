The supersymmetric standard model (SSM) appears to be firmly grounded in
superspace. For example, it would be natural to assume that all the physically
important composite operators can be made by combining superfields and
superspace derivatives. But even for the simplest possible, free, massless and
unbroken SUSY theory in 3+1 dimensions, this is not true. This paper shows that
there is a large set of physically important composite operators in the SSM
that require explicit factors of the Grassmann odd `$\theta$' parameters of
superspace. These explicitly break superspace invariance. These composite
operators will be called `Outfields', because they are intrinsically `outside'
of superspace. It is not possible to write the Outfields using only superfields
and superspace derivatives. The Outfields can be found in the BRST cohomology
space of the theory. The calculation of the BRST cohomology space for these
theories is performed in this paper using a spectral sequence analysis,
starting with the free massless theory, and then adding interactions, and then
masses.
