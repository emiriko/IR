We study the Casimir-Lifshitz force and the radiative heat transfer occurring
between two arbitrary bodies, each one held at a given temperature, surrounded
by environmental radiation at a third temperature. The system, in stationary
configuration out of thermal equilibrium, is characterized by a force and a
heat transfer depending on the three temperatures, and explicitly expressed in
terms of the scattering operators of each body. We find a closed-form analytic
expression valid for bodies of any geometry and dielectric properties. As an
example, the force between two parallel slabs of finite thickness is
calculated, showing the importance of the environmental temperature as well as
the occurrence of a repulsive interaction. An analytic expression is also
provided for the force acting on an atom in front of a slab. Our predictions
can be relevant for experimental and technological purposes.
