QCD string is formed at the distances larger than the confinement scale and
can be described by the Polchinski--Strominger effective string theory with a
nonpolynomial action, which has nevertheless a well-defined semiclassical
expansion around a long-string ground state. We utilize modern ideas about the
Wilson-loop/scattering-amplitude duality to calculate scattering amplitudes and
show that the expansion parameter in the effective string theory is small in
the Regge kinematical regime. For the amplitudes we obtain the Regge behavior
with a linear trajectory of the intercept (d-2)/24 in d dimensions, which is
computed semiclassically as a momentum-space Luscher term, and discuss an
application to meson scattering amplitudes in QCD.
