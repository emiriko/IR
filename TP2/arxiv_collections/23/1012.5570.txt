In a realistic situation, the secret sharing of classical or quantum
information will involve the transmission of this information through noisy
channels. We consider a three qubit pure state. This state becomes a
mixed-state when the qubits are distributed over noisy channels. We focus on a
specific noisy channel, the phase-damping channel. We propose a protocol for
secret sharing of classical information with this and related noisy channels.
This protocol can also be thought of as cooperative superdense coding. We also
discuss other noisy channels to examine the possibility of secret sharing of
classical information.
