Experimental spectra and images of the supernova remnant SN1006 have been
reported for radio, X-ray and TeV gamma-ray bands. Several comparisons between
models and observations have been discussed in the literature, showing that the
broad-band spectrum from the whole remnant as well as a sharpest radial profile
of the X-ray brightness can be both fitted by adopting a model of SN1006 which
strongly depends on the non-linear effects of the accelerated cosmic rays;
these models predict post-shock magnetic field (MF) strengths of the order of
150 micro G. Here we present a new way to compare models and observations, in
order to put constraints on the physical parameters and mechanisms governing
the remnant. In particular, we show that a simple model based on the classic
MHD and cosmic rays acceleration theories allows us to investigate the
spatially distributed characteristics of SN1006 and to put observational
constraints on the kinetics and MF. Our method includes modelling and
comparison of the azimuthal and radial profiles of the surface brightness in
radio, hard X-rays and TeV gamma-rays as well as the azimuthal variations of
the electron maximum energy. In addition, this simple model also provides good
fits to the radio-to-gamma-ray spectrum of SN1006. We find that our best-fit
model predicts an effective MF strength inside SN1006 of 32 micro G, in good
agreement with the `leptonic' model suggested by the HESS Collaboration (2010).
Finally, some difficulties in both the `classic' and the non-linear models are
discussed. A number of evidences about non-uniformity of MF around SN1006 are
noted.
