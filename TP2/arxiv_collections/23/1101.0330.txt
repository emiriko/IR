The magnetic field which induced by the thermo-electric current in metals was
detected and measured using of a flux-gate magnetometer. It is shown that the
application of a temperature gradient on a metal rod gives rise to a
circulating current therein and induces a magnetic field in the vicinity of its
surface. If a temperature gradient on a metal rod exists, the "hot"\ electrons
flow from the heated region of a metal into a colder region and extrude "cold"
electrons that form a current in opposite direction. Since the oppositely
directed currents repel each other due to the interaction of magnetic fields, a
convective loop of electron current formes inside a metalic sample. The
magnetic field of this convection is directly proportional to the temperature
gradient, the metal conductivity and inversely proportional to the temperature
squared.
