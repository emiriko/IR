We demonstrate coupling of the zero-phonon line of individual
nitrogen-vacancy centers and the modes of microring resonators fabricated in
single-crystal diamond. A zero-phonon line enhancement exceeding ten-fold is
estimated from lifetime measurements at cryogenic temperatures. The devices are
fabricated using standard semiconductor techniques and off-the-shelf materials,
thus enabling integrated diamond photonics.
