We develop a mean-field model describing the Hamiltonian interaction of
ultracold atoms and the optical field in a cavity. The Bose-Einstein condensate
is properly defined by means of a grand-canonical approach. The model is
efficient because only the relevant excitation modes are taken into account.
However, the model goes beyond the two-mode subspace necessary to describe the
self-organization quantum phase transition observed recently. We calculate all
the second-order correlations of the coupled atom field and radiation field
hybrid bosonic system, including the entanglement between the two types of
fields.
