We review quantum phase transitions of spin systems in transverse magnetic
fields taking the examples of the spin-1/2 Ising and XY models in a transverse
field. Beginning with an overview of quantum phase transitions, we introduce a
number of model Hamiltonians. We provide exact solutions in one spatial
dimension connecting them to conformal field theoretical studies. We also
discuss Kitaev models and some other exactly solvable spin systems. Studies of
quantum phase transitions in the presence of quenched randomness and with
frustrating interactions are presented in detail. We discuss novel phenomena
like Griffiths-McCoy singularities. We then turn to more recent topics like
information theoretic measures of the quantum phase transitions in these models
such as concurrence, entanglement entropy, quantum discord and quantum
fidelity. We then focus on non-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of transverse
field systems across quantum critical points and lines. After mentioning rapid
quenching studies, we dwell on slow dynamics and discuss the Kibble-Zurek
scaling for the defect density following a quench across critical points and
its modifications for quenching across critical lines, gapless regions and
multicritical points. Topics like the role of different quenching schemes,
local quenching, quenching of models with random interactions and quenching of
a spin chain coupled to a heat bath are touched upon. The connection between
non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum information theoretic measures is
presented at some length. We indicate the connection between Kibble-Zurek
scaling and adiabatic evolution of a state as well as the application of
adiabatic dynamics as a tool of a quantum optimization technique known as
quantum annealing. The final section is dedicated to a detailed discussion on
recent experimental studies of transverse Ising-like systems.
