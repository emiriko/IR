Rapid advances are being made toward optically cooling a single mode of a
micro-mechanical system to its quantum ground state and observing quantum
behavior at macroscopic scales. Reaching this regime in room-temperature
environments requires a stringent condition on the mechanical quality factor
$Q_m$ and frequency $f_m$, $Q_{m}f_{m}{\gtrsim}k_{B}T_{{bath}}/h$, which so far
has been marginally satisfied only in a small number of systems. Here we
propose and analyze a new class of systems that should enable unprecedented
$Q_{m}f_m$ values. The technique is based upon using optical forces to "trap"
and stiffen the motion of a tethered mechanical structure, thereby freeing the
resultant mechanical frequencies and decoherence rates from underlying material
properties.
