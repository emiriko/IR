This paper considers population transfer between eigenstates of a finite
quantum ladder controlled by a classical electric field. Using an appropriate
change of variables, we show that this setting can be set in the framework of
adiabatic passage, which is known to facilitate ensemble control of quantum
systems. Building on this insight, we present a mathematical proof of
robustness for a control protocol -- chirped pulse -- practiced by
experimentalists to drive an ensemble of quantum systems from the ground state
to the most excited state. We then propose new adiabatic control protocols
using a single chirped and amplitude shaped pulse, to robustly perform any
permutation of eigenstate populations, on an ensemble of systems with badly
known coupling strengths. Such adiabatic control protocols are illustrated by
simulations achieving all 24 permutations for a 4-level ladder.
