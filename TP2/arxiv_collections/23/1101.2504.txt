Longitudinal electric field of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) drags vortex
structure of a superconductive film, deposited on a piezoelectric substrate,
and generates longitudinal DC component of an acoustoelectric field, which does
not depend on direction of an external magnetic field. The contra-directional
vortices are dragged by SAW in opposite directions. This phenomenon represents
an acoustic analog of Hall effect, where vortices are an analog of current
carriers, and the SAW Pointing vector acts as an impressed electric field. The
calculation of the acoustoelectric field for a YBCO film with niobate lithium
substrate coincides well with experimental data.
