We discuss about the antibacterial activities of Silver nanoparticles and
compare them on both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria in this
investigation. The activities of Silver nanoparticles synthesized by
electrolysis method are more in Gram (-) than Gram (+) bacteria. First time, we
increase its antibacterial activities by using electrical power while on
electrolysis synthesis and it is confirmed from its more antibacterial
activities (For Escherichia coli bacteria). We investigate the changes of inner
unit cell Lattice constant of Silver nanoparticles prepared in two different
methods and its effects on antibacterial activities. We note that slight change
of the lattice constant results in the enhancement of its antibacterial
activities.
