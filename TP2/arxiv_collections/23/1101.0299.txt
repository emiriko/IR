We calculate theoretically the disorder-limited conductivity of monolayer and
bilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates, comparing our
theoretical results with the recent experimental results. The comparison leads
to a direct quantitative estimate of the underlying disorder strength for both
short-range and long-range disorder in the graphene on h-BN system. We find
that the good interface quality between graphene and h-BN leads to strongly
suppressed charged impurity scattering compared with the corresponding SiO$_2$
substrate case, thus producing very high mobility for the graphene on h-BN
system.
