We study the semi-classical tunneling of scalar and fermion fields from the
horizon of a Constant Curvature Black Hole, which is locally AdS and whose
five-dimensional analogue is dual to ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills. In
particular, we highlight the strong reliance of the tunneling method for
Hawking radiation on near-horizon symmetries, a fact often hidden behind the
algorithmic procedure with which the tunneling approach tends to be used. We
ultimately calculate the emission rate of scalars and fermions, and hence the
black hole's Hawking temperature.
