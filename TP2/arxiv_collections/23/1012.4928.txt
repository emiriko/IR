We study the calibration process in circular ultrasound tomography devices
where the sensor positions deviate from the circumference of a perfect circle.
This problem arises in a variety of applications in signal processing ranging
from breast imaging to sensor network localization. We introduce a novel method
of calibration/localization based on the time-of-flight (ToF) measurements
between sensors when the enclosed medium is homogeneous. In the presence of all
the pairwise ToFs, one can easily estimate the sensor positions using
multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method. In practice however, due to the
transitional behaviour of the sensors and the beam form of the transducers, the
ToF measurements for close-by sensors are unavailable. Further, random
malfunctioning of the sensors leads to random missing ToF measurements. On top
of the missing entries, in practice an unknown time delay is also added to the
measurements. In this work, we incorporate the fact that a matrix defined from
all the ToF measurements is of rank at most four. In order to estimate the
missing ToFs, we apply a state-of-the-art low-rank matrix completion algorithm,
OPTSPACE . To find the correct positions of the sensors (our ultimate goal) we
then apply MDS. We show analytic bounds on the overall error of the whole
process in the presence of noise and hence deduce its robustness. Finally, we
confirm the functionality of our method in practice by simulations mimicking
the measurements of a circular ultrasound tomography device.
