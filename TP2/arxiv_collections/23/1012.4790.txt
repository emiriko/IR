Models like the Supersymmetric Standard Model (SSM) possess simple, but
well-hidden, `Outfields'. These Outfields are composite operators that violate
superspace invariance, but in a special way. A new mechanism for SUSY breaking
arises from the Outfields, for a special non-minimal version of the SSM, which
will be called the CSSM. The CSSM has right neutrinos and a Higgs singlet,
which we call J, in addition to the usual SSM. This breaking of SUSY cannot be
avoided, because it arises from the local BRST cohomology of the theory, which
is also the origin of the Outfields. It can also be seen that the Weak SU(2)
group, and the well-known remarkable set of doublets and singlets for the
Quarks, Leptons and Higgs, have a raison d'etre which relates to this
mechanism. The SUSY breaking here depends on only one parameter, which is the
VEV that breaks SU(2) X U(1) to U(1). SUSY itself is not spontaneously broken
here, so the vacuum energy remains zero after SUSY breaking. The resulting
predictions for SUSY breaking are very constrained by the model.
