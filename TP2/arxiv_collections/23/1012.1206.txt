The contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse gamma-ray background
could produce anisotropies in this emission on small angular scales. Recent
studies have considered the angular power spectrum and other anisotropy metrics
as tools for identifying contributions to diffuse emission from unresolved
source classes, such as extragalactic and Galactic dark matter as well as
various astrophysical gamma-ray source populations. We present preliminary
results of an anisotropy analysis of the diffuse emission measured by the
Fermi-LAT.
