The prototype of accreting, pulsating white dwarfs (GW Lib) underwent a large
amplitude dwarf nova outburst in 2007. We used ultraviolet data from GALEX and
ground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy to follow GW Lib for three
years following this outburst. Several variations are apparent during this
interval. The optical shows a superhump modulation in the months following
outburst while a 19 min quasi-periodic modulation lasting for several months is
apparent in the year after outburst. A long timescale (about 4 hr) modulation
first appears in the UV a year after outburst and increases in amplitude in the
following years. This variation also appears in the optical 2 years after
outburst but is not in phase with the UV. The pre-outburst pulsations are not
yet visible after 3 years, likely indicating the white dwarf has not returned
to its quiescent state.
