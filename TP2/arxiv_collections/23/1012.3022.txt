We investigate the inclusive photoproduction of J/Psi mesons at HERA within
the framework of the kt-factorization QCD approach. Our consideration is based
on the color singlet model supplemented with the relevant off-shell matrix
elements and the CCFM and KMR unintegrated gluon densities in a proton and in a
photon. Both the direct and resolved photon contributions are taken into
account. Our predictions are compared with the recent experimental data taken
by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations. Special attention is put on the J/Psi
polarization parameters lambda and nu which are sensitive to the production
dynamics.
