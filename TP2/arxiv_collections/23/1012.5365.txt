We study the nonstandard decays of the lightest Higgs state within the
Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E6SSM). We argued that the SM--like
Higgs boson can decay predominantly into dark matter particles while its
branching ratios into SM particles varies from 2% to 4%. This scenario also
implies the presence of other relatively light Inert chargino and neutralino
states in the particle spectrum with masses below 200 GeV. We argue that in
this case the decays of the lightest Higgs boson into l^{+} l^{-} + X may play
an essential role in the Higgs searches.
