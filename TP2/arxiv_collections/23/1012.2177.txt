Since the beginning of the Internet thirty years ago, we have witnessed a
number of changes in the application of communication technologies. Today, the
Internet can be described to a large extent as a ubiquitous infrastructure that
is always accessible. After the era of connecting places and connecting people,
the Internet of the future will also connect things. The idea behind the
resulting Internet of Things is to seamlessly gather and use information about
objects of the real world during their entire lifecycle. In this paper, we
consider different approaches to technological protection of user data privacy
in the world of Internet of Things. In particular,we consider what kind of
security problems are being faced and what level of protection can be provided
by applying approaches based on secure multi-party computations.
