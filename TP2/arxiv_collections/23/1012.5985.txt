A three-parameter model of neutrino oscillations based on a simple Lorentz-
and CPT-violating texture is presented. The model is consistent with
established data and naturally generates low-energy and neutrino-antineutrino
anomalies of the MiniBooNE type. A one-parameter extension incorporates the
MINOS anomaly, while a simple texture enhancement accommodates the LSND signal.
