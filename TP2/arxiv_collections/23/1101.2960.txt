Stars form in regions of the galaxy that are denser and cooler than the mean
interstellar medium. These regions are called Giant Molecular Clouds. At the
beginning of their life, up to $10^5-10^6$ years, stars accrete matter from
their rich surrounding environment and are origin of a peculiar phenomenon that
is the jet emission. Jets from Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are intensively
studied by the astrophysical community by observations at different
wavelengths, analytical and numerical modeling and laboratory experiments.
Indications about the jet propagation and its resulting morphologies are here
obtained by means of a combined study of hypersonic jets carried out both in
the laboratory and by numerical simulations.
