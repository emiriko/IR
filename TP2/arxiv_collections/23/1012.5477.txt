Assignment of weights to multiple authors of a paper is a challenging task
due to its dependence on the conventions that may be different among different
fields of research and research groups. In this paper, we describe a scheme for
assignment of weights to multiple authors of a paper. In our scheme, weights
are assigned in a linearly decreasing/increasing fashion depending upon the
weight decrement/increment parameter. We call our scheme Arithmetic: Type-2
scheme as the weights follow an arithmetic series. We analyze the proposed
weight assignment scheme and compare it with the existing schemes such as
equal, arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic. We argue that the a positional
weight assignment scheme, called arithmetic scheme, which we refer to
Arithmetic: Type-1 in this paper, and the equal weight assignment scheme can be
treated as special cases of the proposed Arithmetic: Type-2 scheme.
