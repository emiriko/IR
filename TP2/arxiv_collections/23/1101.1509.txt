Samples of inclusive photon+2 jet and photon+3 jet events collected by the D0
experiment with an integrated luminosity of about 1fb^-1 in ppbar collisions at
sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV are used to measure cross sections as a function of the angle
in the plane transverse to the beam direction between the transverse momentum
(pT) of the photon+leading jet system (jets are ordered in pT) and pT of the
other jet for photon+2 jet, or pT sum of the two other jets for photon+3 jet
events. The results are compared to different models of multiple parton
interactions (MPI) in the PYTHIA and SHERPA Monte Carlo (MC) generators. The
data indicate a contribution from events with double parton (DP) interactions
and are well described by predictions provided by the PYTHIA MPI models with
pT-ordered showers and by SHERPA with the default MPI model. The photon+2 jet
data are also used to determine the fraction of events with DP interactions as
a function of the azimuthal angle and as a function of the second jet pT.
