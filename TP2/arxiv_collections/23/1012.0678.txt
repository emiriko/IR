Filters are used in precision engineering and production measurement to
suppress unwanted components in measured data, to reconstruct the sampled
surface in case of tactile measurements, or to separate portions of different
scales. The application of such filters comprises a wide area, in essence,
coordinate measurement, form and contour measurement, as well as surface
texture measurement. So far, almost exclusively the Gaussian filter, as
standardised in ISO 11562, has been used in this area. But for some time past,
a new series of ISO documents (ISO/TS 16610) has been available which - besides
the Gaussian filter which is still available - specifies additional filters for
the field of geometrical product specification and verification. This
publication gives an overview of these new ISO filters.
