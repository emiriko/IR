The biaxially textured growth of superconducting Co-doped BaFe2As2 (Ba-122)
thin films has been realized on ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) MgO coated
conductor templates by employing an iron buffer architecture. The iron pnictide
coated conductor showed a superconducting transition temperature of 21.5 K,
which is slightly lower than that of Co-doped Ba-122 films on single
crystalline MgO substrates. A self-field critical current density of over 10^5
A/cm2 has already been achieved even at 8 K. The current experiment highlights
the potential of possible coated conductor applications of the iron-based
superconductors.
