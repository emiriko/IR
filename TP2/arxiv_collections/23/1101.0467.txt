We present bolometric light curves of Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P)
obtained using a newly developed, one-dimensional Lagrangian hydrodynamic code
with flux-limited radiation diffusion. Using our code we calculate the
bolometric light curve and photospheric velocities of SN1999em obtaining a
remarkably good agreement with observations despite the simplifications used in
our calculation. The physical parameters used in our calculation are E=1.25
foe, M= 19 M_\odot, R= 800 R_\odot and M_{Ni}=0.056 M_\odot. We find that an
extensive mixing of 56Ni is needed in order to reproduce a plateau as flat as
that shown by the observations. We also study the possibility to fit the
observations with lower values of the initial mass consistently with upper
limits that have been inferred from pre-supernova imaging of SN1999em in
connection with stellar evolution models. We cannot find a set of physical
parameters that reproduce well the observations for models with pre-supernova
mass of \leq 12 M_\odot, although models with 14 M_\odot cannot be fully
discarded.
