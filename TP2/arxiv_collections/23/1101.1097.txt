We present new radial velocities from Keck Observatory and both Newtonian and
Keplerian solutions for the triple-planet system orbiting HD 37124. The orbital
solution for this system has improved dramatically since the third planet was
first reported in Vogt et al. 2005 with an ambiguous orbital period. We have
resolved this ambiguity, and the outer two planets have an apparent period
commensurability of 2:1. A dynamical analysis finds both resonant and
non-resonant configurations consistent with the radial velocity data, and
constrains the mutual inclinations of the planets to be less than about 30
degrees. We discuss HD 37124 in the context of the other 19 exoplanetary
systems with apparent period commenserabilities, which we summarize in a table.
We show that roughly one in three well-characterized multiplanet systems has a
apparent low-order period commensuribility, which is more than would naively be
expected if the periods of exoplanets in known multiplanet systems were drawn
randomly from the observed distribution of planetary orbital periods.
