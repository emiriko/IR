We conduct a study of K to M type stars to investigate the activity and the
rotation limit in the Hyades. We use a sample of 40 stars in this
intermediate-age cluster (~625 Myr) to probe stellar rotation in the threshold
region where stellar activity becomes prevalent. Here we present projected
equatorial velocities (vsin i) and chromospheric activity measurements
(H{\alpha}) that indicate the existence of fast rotators in the Hyades at
spectral types where also the fraction of stars with H{\alpha} emission shows a
rapid increase ("H{\alpha} limit"). The locus of enhanced rotation (and
activity) thus seems to be shifted to earlier types in contrast to what is seen
as the rotation limit in field stars. The relation between activity and
rotation appears to be similar to the one observed in fields stars.
