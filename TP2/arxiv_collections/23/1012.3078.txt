We study the magnetic properties of small Mn ring shaped clusters on a
Pt(111) surface in the framework of density functional theory. We find that the
Mn atoms possess large magnetic moments, of the order of 4uB/atom, and have
dominating antiferromagnetic interatomic exchange interactions. A quantum
confinement effect within the ring like clusters was found, indicating that
even very small clusters can be seen as quantum corrals. The antiferromagnetic
exchange couplings lead to collinear magnetic arrangements in simple corrals,
as well as complex non-collinear ordering, as vortex-like structures, for the
case of corrals with particular geometry where antiferromagnetism becomes
frustrated.
