ATLAS exclusion and discovery potentials of Standard Model Higgs boson
searches at the LHC at 14 TeV, 10 TeV and 7 TeV center-of-mass energy are
reviewed. For a LHC center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and integrated luminosity of
1 fb$^{-1}$, contributions from the important decay channels $\Hboson
\rightarrow \Wboson\Wboson^{(*)} \rightarrow \ell\nu\ell\nu$, $\Hboson
\rightarrow \Zboson\Zboson^{(*)} \rightarrow \ell\ell\ell\ell$ and $\Hboson
\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ are considered, based on recent full Monte Carlo
simulations at 14 and 10 TeV and the cross-section rescaling for the 7 TeV
center-of-mass energy. First measurements of backgrounds to Standard Model
Higgs boson search are also presented.
