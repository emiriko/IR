We review the recently constructed `double field theory' which introduces in
addition to the conventional coordinates associated to momentum modes
coordinates associated to winding modes. Thereby, T-duality becomes a global
symmetry of the theory, which can be viewed as an `O(D,D) covariantization' of
the low-energy effective space-time action of closed string theory. We discuss
its symmetries with a special emphasis on the relation between global duality
symmetries and local gauge symmetries.
