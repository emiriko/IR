The theory of coalgebras, for an endofunctor on a category, has been proposed
as a general theory of transition systems. We investigate and relate four
generalizations of bisimulation to this setting, providing conditions under
which the four different generalizations coincide. We study transfinite
sequences whose limits are the greatest bisimulations.
