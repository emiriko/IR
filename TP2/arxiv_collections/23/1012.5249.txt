A concept named induced trapdoor one-way quantum transformation (OWQT) has
been introduced, and a theoretical framework of public-key encryption (PKE) of
quantum message is presented based on it. Then several kinds of quantum
public-key encryption (QPKE) protocols, such as quantum version PKE of RSA,
ElGamal, Goldwasser-Micali, elliptic curve, McEliece, Niederreiter and
Okamoto-Tanaka-Uchiyama, are given within this framework. Though all of these
protocols are only computationally secure, the last three are probably secure
in post-quantum era. Besides, theoretical frameworks for public-key
authentication and signature of quantum message are also given based on the
induced trapdoor OWQT. As examples, a public-key authentication protocol of
quantum message based on SN-S authentication scheme and two quantum digital
signature protocols based on RSA and McEliece algorithms respectively are
presented.
