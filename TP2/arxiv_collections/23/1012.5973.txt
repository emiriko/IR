We discuss the effects of strong magnetic fields through Landau quantization
of electrons on the structure and stability of nuclei in neutron star crust. In
strong magnetic fields, this leads to the enhancement of the electron number
density with respect to the zero field case. We obtain the sequence of
equilibrium nuclei of the outer crust in the presence of strong magnetic fields
adopting most recent versions of the experimental and theoretical nuclear mass
tables. For $B\sim 10^{16}$G, it is found that some new nuclei appear in the
sequence and some nuclei disappear from the sequence compared with the zero
field case.
  Further we investigate the stability of nuclei in the inner crust in the
presence of strong magnetic fields using the Thomas-Fermi model. The
coexistence of two phases of nuclear matter - liquid and gas, is considered in
this case. The proton number density is significantly enhanced in strong
magnetic fields $B\sim 10^{17}$G through the charge neutrality. We find nuclei
with larger mass number in the presence of strong magnetic fields than those of
the zero field. These results might have important implications for the
transport properties of the crust in magnetars.
