We mapped the MSX dark cloud G084.81-01.09 in the NH3 (1,1) - (4,4) lines and
in the J = 1-0 transitions of 12CO, 13CO, C18O and HCO+ in order to study the
physical properties of infrared dark clouds, and to better understand the
initial conditions for massive star formation. Six ammonia cores are identified
with masses ranging from 60 to 250 M_sun, a kinetic temperature of 12 K, and a
molecular hydrogen number density n(H2) ~ 10^5 cm^-3. In our high mass cores,
the ammonia line width of 1 km/s is larger than those found in lower mass cores
but narrower than the more evolved massive ones. We detected self-reversed
profiles in HCO+ across the northern part of our cloud and velocity gradients
in different molecules. These indicate an expanding motion in the outer layer
and more complex motions of the clumps more inside our cloud. We also discuss
the millimeter wave continuum from the dust. These properties indicate that our
cloud is a potential site of massive star formation but is still in a very
early evolutionary stage.
