We propose a two-pulse excitation to efficiently photoinduced a novel
$sp^3$-bonded nano-domain with a frozen shear in a graphite crystal. This
$sp^3$ structure is known to be well stabilized by shear displacement between
neighboring two graphite layers. This shear motion is generated only as a
transient and unfrozen one by the first visible laser pulse, shone over the
graphite crystal. While, the second pulse is proved to freeze it before it
disappears, resulting in an efficient interlayer $\sigma$ ($sp^3$) bond
formation.
