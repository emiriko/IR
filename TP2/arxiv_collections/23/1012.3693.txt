We present a new model of large-scale multilayer convection in solar type
stars. This model allows us to understand such self-similar structures observed
at solar surface as granulation, supergranulation and giant cells. We study the
slow-rotated hydrogen star without magnetic field with the
spherically-symmetric convective zone. The photon's flux comes to the
convective zone from the central thermonuclear zone of the star. The
interaction of these photons with the fully ionized hydrogen plasma with
$T>10^5K$ is carried out by the Tomson scattering of photon flux on protons and
electrons. Under these conditions plasma is optically thick relative to the
Tomson scattering. This fact is the fundamental one for the multilayer
convection formation. We find the stationary solution of the convective zone
structure. This solution describes the convective layers responsible to the
formation of the structures on the star's surface.
