We study an extension of the voter model in which each agent is endowed with
an innate preference for one of two states that we term as "truth" or
"falsehood". Due to interactions with neighbors, an agent that innately prefers
truth can be persuaded to adopt a false opinion (and thus be discordant with
its innate preference) or the agent can possess an internally concordant "true"
opinion. Parallel states exist for agents that inherently prefer falsehood. We
determine the conditions under which a population of such agents can ultimately
reach a consensus for the truth, a consensus for falsehood, or reach an impasse
where an agent tends to adopt the opinion that is in internal concordance with
its innate preference so that consensus is never achieved.
