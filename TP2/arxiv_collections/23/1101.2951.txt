Let s(n) be the number of representations of n as the sum of three squares.
We prove a remarkable new identity for s(p^2n)- ps(n) with p being an odd
prime. This identity makes nontrivial use of ternary quadratic forms with
discriminants p^2 and 16p^2. These forms are related by Watson's
transformations. To prove this identity we employ the Siegel--Weil and the
Smith--Minkowski product formulas.
