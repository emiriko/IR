A method to derive homogeneous effective constitutive equations for
periodically layered elastic media is proposed. The crucial and novel idea
underlying the procedure is that the coefficients of the dynamic effective
medium can be associated with the matrix logarithm of the propagator over a
unit period. The effective homogeneous equations are shown to have the
structure of a Willis material, characterized by anisotropic inertia and
coupling between momentum and strain, in addition to effective elastic
constants. Expressions are presented for the Willis material parameters which
are formally valid at any frequency and horizontal wavenumber as long as the
matrix logarithm is well defined. The general theory is illustrated using the
example of scalar SH motion. Low frequency, long wavelength expansions of the
effective material parameters are also developed using a Magnus series and
explicit estimates for the rate of convergence are derived.
