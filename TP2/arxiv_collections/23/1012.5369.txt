We study the effect of flavor changing charged current(FCCC) of lepton sector
in the hadronic tau decays, tau \to nu_X K^- pi^0 (X=e,mu). In general two
Higgs doublet model, the lepton flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) arises
in the charged lepton sector and contributes to the process such as tau \to mu
mu^+ mu^- and tau \to mu(e) P^0 where P^0=pi^0,eta, eta'. We derive a relation
between the FCCC in charged Higgs boson and the FCNC due to the neutral Higgs
boson. Then by using the recent experimental upper bound on FCNC of tau \to l_X
eta (pi^0) (l_X=e,mu) processes, we study how large the effect of FCCC could be
in the process tau \to nu_X K pi decays. We also report the preliminary result
on the form factor calculations of tau \to K pi nu decays and the hadronic
invariant mass distribution.
