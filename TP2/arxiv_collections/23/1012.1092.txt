Over cosmic time, galaxies grow through the hierarchical merging of smaller
galaxies. However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity function is
incompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical merging, and it is
believed that feedback from the central black hole in the host galaxies reduces
the number of bright galaxies and regulates the co-evolution of black hole and
host galaxy. Numerous simulations of galaxy evolution have attempted to include
the physical effects of such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a
kiloparsec. However, interactions between jets and the interstellar medium
involve processes occurring on less than kiloparsec scales. In order to further
the understanding of processes occurring on such scales, we present a suite of
simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two-phase
interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale of one
kiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the interstellar medium is
considerable, and we find that jets with powers in the range of 10^43-10^46 erg
s^-1 can inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the
galaxy core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of
the ratio of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, the
pressure of the interstellar medium and the porosity of the dense gas.
