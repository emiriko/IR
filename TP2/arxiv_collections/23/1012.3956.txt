In the last years an increasing demand for Grid Infrastructures has resulted
in several international collaborations. This is the case of the EELA Project,
which has brought together collaborating groups of Latin America and Europe.
One year ago we presented this e-infrastructure used, among others, by the
Biomedical groups for the studies of oncological analysis, neglected diseases,
sequence alignments and computation phylogenetics. After this period, the
achieved advances are summarised in this paper.
