The distribution of SDSS quasars is described. The dependence of
observational number of quasars within distances to an observer less than r on
distance r is found to be the power law with correlation dimension value equal
2,71 in redshift range 0,35 < z < 2,30 for the flat Universe filled with cold
dust. The quasar distribution on the celestial sphere is characterized by power
laws as well with correlation dimension value equal from 1,49 to 1,58 for
different redshift layers in the same range. These properties are evidences of
fractality.
