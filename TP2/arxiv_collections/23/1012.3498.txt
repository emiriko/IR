We propose a simple schematic model for two-neutron halo nuclei. In this
model, the two valence neutrons move in a one-dimensional mean field,
interacting with each other via a density-dependent contact interaction. We
first investigate the ground state properties, and demonstrate that the
dineutron correlation can be realized with this simple model due to the
admixture of even- and odd-parity single-particle states. We then solve the
time-dependent two-particle Schr\"odinger equation under the influence of a
time-dependent one-body external field, in order to discuss the effect of
dineutron correlation on nuclear breakup processes. The time evolution of
two-particle density shows that the dineutron correlation enhances the total
breakup probability, especially for the two-neutron breakup process, in which
both the valence neutrons are promoted to continuum scattering states. We find
that the interaction between the two particles definitely favours a spatial
correlation of the two outgoing particles, which are mainly emitted in the same
direction.
