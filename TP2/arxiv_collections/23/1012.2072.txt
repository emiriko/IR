I investigate the phenomenology of supersymmetric models with extra
vector-like supermultiplets that couple to the Standard Model gauge fields and
transform as the fundamental representation of a new confining non-Abelian
gauge interaction. If perturbative gauge coupling unification is to be
maintained, the new group can be SU(2), SU(3), or SO(3). The impact on the
sparticle mass spectrum is explored, with particular attention to the gaugino
mass dominated limit in which the supersymmetric flavor problem is naturally
solved. The new confinement length scale is astronomical for SO(3), so the new
particles are essentially free. For the SU(2) and SU(3) cases, the new
vector-like fermions are quirks; pair production at colliders yields
quirk-antiquirk states bound by stable flux tubes that are microscopic but long
compared to the new confinement scale. I study the reach of the Tevatron and
LHC for the optimistic case that in a significant fraction of events the
quirk-antiquirk bound state will lose most of its energy before annihilating as
quirkonium.
