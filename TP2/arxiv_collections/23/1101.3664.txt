aims: We present VRi photometric observations of the quadruply imaged quasar
HE 0435-1223, carried out with the Danish 1.54m telescope at the La Silla
Observatory. Our aim was to monitor and study the magnitudes and colors of each
lensed component as a function of time. methods: We monitored the object during
two seasons (2008 and 2009) in the VRi spectral bands, and reduced the data
with two independent techniques: difference imaging and PSF (Point Spread
Function) fitting.results: Between these two seasons, our results show an
evident decrease in flux by ~0.2-0.4 magnitudes of the four lensed components
in the three filters. We also found a significant increase (~0.05-0.015) in
their V-R and R-i color indices. conclusions: These flux and color variations
are very likely caused by intrinsic variations of the quasar between the
observed epochs. Microlensing effects probably also affect the brightest "A"
lensed component.
