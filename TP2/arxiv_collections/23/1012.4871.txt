Citation analysis does not generally take the quality of citations into
account: all citations are weighted equally irrespective of source. However, a
scholar may be highly cited but not highly regarded: popularity and prestige
are not identical measures of esteem. In this study we define popularity as the
number of times an author is cited and prestige as the number of times an
author is cited by highly cited papers. Information Retrieval (IR) is the test
field. We compare the 40 leading researchers in terms of their popularity and
prestige over time. Some authors are ranked high on prestige but not on
popularity, while others are ranked high on popularity but not on prestige. We
also relate measures of popularity and prestige to date of Ph.D. award, number
of key publications, organizational affiliation, receipt of prizes/honors, and
gender.
