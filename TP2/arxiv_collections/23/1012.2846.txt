We discuss subtle points of the momentum balance for radiating particles in
flat and curved space-time. An instantaneous balance is obscured by the
presence of the Schott term which is a finite part of the bound field momentum.
To establish the balance one has to take into account the initial and final
conditions for acceleration, or to apply averaging. In curved space-time an
additional contribution arises from the tidal deformation of the bound field.
This force is shown to be the finite remnant from the mass renormalization and
it is different both form the radiation recoil force and the Schott force. For
radiation of non-gravitational nature from point particles in curved space-time
the reaction force can be computed substituting the retarded field directly to
the equations of motion. Similar procedure is applicable to gravitational
radiation in vacuum space-time, but fails in the non-vacuum case. The existence
of the gravitational quasilocal reaction force in this general case seems
implausible, though it still exists in the non-relativistic approximation. We
also explain the putative antidamping effect for gravitational radiation under
non-geodesic motion and derive the non-relativistic gravitational quadrupole
Schott term. Radiation reaction in curved space of dimension other than four is
also discussed
