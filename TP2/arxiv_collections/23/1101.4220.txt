The Fermi-contact interaction that characterizes collisional spin exchange of
a noble gas with an alkali-metal vapor also gives rise to NMR and EPR frequency
shifts of the noble-gas nucleus and the alkali-metal atom, respectively. We
have measured the enhancement factor $\kappa_{0}$ that characterizes these
shifts for Rb-$^{129}$Xe in the high-pressure limit to be 493$\pm$31, making
use of the previously measured value of $\kappa_{0}$ for Rb-$^{3}$He. This
result allows accurate $^{129}$Xe polarimetry with no need to reference a
thermal-equilibrium NMR signal.
