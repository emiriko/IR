I clarify some recent confusion regarding the holographic description of
finite-density systems in two dimensions. Notably, the chiral anomaly for
symmetry currents in 2d conformal field theories (CFT) completely determines
their correlators. The important exception is a CFT with a gauge theory to
which we may couple an external current, as in the probe D3/D3 system or the
putative dual to the charged BTZ black hole. These systems are analyzed with an
eye for potential condensed matter applications.
