NiBi3 polycrystals were synthesized via a solid state method. X-ray
diffraction analysis shows that the main phase present in the sample
corresponds to NiBi3 in a weight fraction of 96.82 % according to the
refinement of the crystalline structure. SEM - EDS and XPS analysis reveal a
homogeneous composition of NiBi3, without Ni traces. The powder superconducting
samples were studied by performing magnetic measurements. The superconducting
transition temperature and critical magnetic fields were determinated as Tc =
4.05 K, Hc1 = 110 Oe and Hc2 = 3,620 Oe. The superconducting parameters were GL
coherence length= 301.5 A, Ginzburg Landau Penetration depth= 1549 A, and k =
5.136. Isothermal measurements below the transition temperature show an
anomalous behavior. Above the superconducting transition the compound presents
ferromagnetic characteristics up to 750 K, well above the Ni Curie temperature.
