We examine the potential of using colliders to distinguish models with parity
(Z_2) stabilized dark matter (DM) from models in which the DM is stabilized by
other symmetries, taking the latter to be a Z_3 symmetry for illustration. The
key observation is that a heavier mother particle charged under a Z_3
stabilization symmetry can decay into one or two DM particles along with
Standard Model (SM) particles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a
mother particle charged under a parity symmetry; typically, only one DM
particle appears in the decay chain. In arXiv:1003.0899, some of us studied the
distributions of visible invariant mass from the decay of a single such mother
particle in order to highlight the resulting distinctive signatures of Z_3
symmetry versus parity symmetry stabilized dark matter candidates. We now
describe a complementary study which focuses on decay chains of the two mother
particles which are necessarily present in these events. We also include in our
analyss the missing energy/momentum in the event. For the Z_3 symmetry
stabilized mothers, the resulting inclusive final state can have two, three or
four DM particles. In contrast, models with Z_2 symmetry can have only two. We
show that the shapes and edges of the distribution of M_T2-type variables,
along with ratio of the visible momentum/energy on the two sides of the event,
are powerful in distinguishing these different scenarios.
