We compute important ratios between decay widths of some exclusive two-body
nonleptonic and semileptonic B decays, which could be test of factorization hy-
pothesis. We also present a summary of the expressions of the decay widths and
differential decay rates of these decays, at tree level, including l = 0
(ground state), l = 1 (orbitally excited) and n = 2 (radially excited) mesons
in the fi- nal state. From a general point of view, we consider eight
transitions, namely H \rightarrow P, V, S, A, A, T, P (2S), V (2S). Our
analysis is carried out assuming factorization hypothesis and using the WSB,
ISGW and CLFA quark models.
