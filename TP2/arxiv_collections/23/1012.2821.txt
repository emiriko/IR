Excluded-volume effects can play an important role in determining transport
properties in diffusion of particles. Here, the diffusion of finite-sized
hard-core interacting particles in two or three dimensions is considered
systematically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The result is
a nonlinear diffusion equation for the one-particle distribution function, with
excluded-volume effects enhancing the overall collective diffusion rate. An
expression for the effective (collective) diffusion coefficient is obtained.
Stochastic simulations of the full particle system are shown to compare well
with the solution of this equation for two examples.
