In a recent note (arXiv:1012.5069), the investigation performed by the
present authors on the evolution of density fluctuations in an accelerated
universe including matter creation was criticized. The criticism is based on
the fact that the Newtonian background is not "accelerating", invalidating the
conclusions of the linear analysis. We show that our linear equations describe
adequately an accelerating universe in which the pressure associated to the
creation process is constant, a model equivalent to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Thus, our previous conclusions remain unchanged.
