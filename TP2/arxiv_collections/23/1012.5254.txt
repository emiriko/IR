We report on the identification of a near-infrared counterpart to the massive
(>11 Msun) binary companion of pulsar J1740-3052. An accurate celestial
position of PSR J1740-3052 is determined from interferometric radio
observations. Adaptive optics corrected near-infrared imaging observations show
a counterpart at the interferometric position of the pulsar. The counterpart
has Ks=15.87+-0.10 and J-Ks>0.83. Based on distance and absorption estimates
from models of the Galactic electron and dust distributions these observed
magnitudes are consistent with those of a main-sequence star as the binary
companion. We argue that this counterpart is the binary companion to PSR
J1740-3052 and thus rule out a stellar mass black hole as the pulsar companion.
