The dynamics of the state of polarization in single mode and multimode fiber
amplifiers are presented. The experimental results reveal that although the
state of polarizations at the output can vary over a large range when changing
the temperatures of the fiber amplifiers, the variations are significantly
reduced when resorting to the principal states of polarization in single mode
fiber amplifiers and principal modes in multimode fiber amplifiers.
