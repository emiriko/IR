We consider electrons in a quantum wire interacting via a long-range Coulomb
potential screened by a nearby gate. We focus on the quantum phase transition
from a strictly one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional electron liquid,
that is controlled by the dimensionless parameter $n x_0$, where $n$ is the
electron density and $x_0$ is the characteristic length of the transverse
confining potential. If this transition occurs in the low-density limit, it can
be understood as the deformation of the one-dimensional Wigner crystal to a
zigzag arrangement of the electrons described by an Ising order parameter. The
critical properties are governed by the charge degrees of freedom and the spin
sector remains essentially decoupled. At large densities, on the other hand,
the transition is triggered by the filling of a second one-dimensional subband
of transverse quantization. Electrons at the bottom of the second subband
interact strongly due to the diverging density of states and become
impenetrable. We argue that this stabilizes the electron liquid as it
suppresses pair-tunneling processes between the subbands that would otherwise
lead to an instability. However, the impenetrable electrons in the second band
are screened by the excitations of the first subband, so that the transition is
identified as a Lifshitz transition of impenetrable polarons. We discuss the
resulting phase diagram as a function of $n x_0$.
