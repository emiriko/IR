Unlike the ferropnictide superconductors, which crystallize in a tetragonal
crystal structure, binary FeAs forms in an orthorhombic crystal structure,
where the local atomic environment resembles a highly distorted variant of the
FeAs4 tetrahdedral building block of the ferropnictide superconductors.
However, like the parent compounds of the ferropnictide superconductors, FeAs
undergoes magnetic ordering at low temperatures, with no evidence favoring a
superconducting ground state at ambient pressure. We employ pressure-dependent
electrical transport and x-ray diffraction measurements using diamond anvil
cells to characterize the magnetic state and the structure as a function of
pressure. While the MnP-type structure of FeAs persists up to 25 GPa,
compressing continuously with no evidence of structural transformations under
pressure, features in the magnetotransport measurements associated with
magnetism are not observed for pressures in excess of 11 GPa. Where observable,
the features associated with magnetic order at ambient pressure show remarkably
little pressure dependence, and transport measurements suggest that a dynamical
structural instability coupled to the Fermi surface via a strong
electron-phonon interaction may play an important role in enabling magnetism in
FeAs.
