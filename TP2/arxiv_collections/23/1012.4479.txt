A heavy fourth generation with a mass of the order of 400 GeV or more could
trigger dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by forming condensates through
the exchange of a fundamental Higgs scalar doublet. The dynamics leading to
these condensates is studied within the framework of the Schwinger-Dyson
equation. This scenario leads to the presence of {\em three} (two composite and
one fundamental) Higgs doublets, with interesting phenomenological
implications. In addition, this dynamical phenomenon occurs in the vicinity of
the energy scale where the restoration of scale symmetry might happen.
