We report our discovery of NLTT 20346 as an M5+M6 companion system to the
tight binary (or triple) L dwarf 2MASS J0850359+105716. This nearby (~31 pc),
widely separated (~7700 AU) quadruple system was identified through a
cross-match of proper motion catalogs. Follow-up imaging and spectroscopy of
NLTT 20346 revealed it to be a magnetically active M5+M6 binary with components
separated by ~2" (50-80 AU). Optical spectroscopy of the components show only
moderate Halpha emission corresponding to a statistical age of ~5 - 7 Gyr for
both M dwarfs. However NLTT 20346 is associated with the XMM-Newton source
J085018.9+105644, and based on X-ray activity the age of NLTT 20346 is between
250-450 Myr. Strong Li absorption in the optical spectrum of 2MASS J0850+1057
indicates an upper age limit of 0.8 - 1.5 Gyr favoring the younger age for the
primary. Using evolutionary models in combination with an adopted system age of
0.25-1.5 Gyr indicates a total mass for 2MASS J0850+1057 of 0.07+/-0.02 Msun if
it is a binary. NLTT 20346/2MASS J0850+1057 joins a growing list of
hierarchical systems containing brown dwarf binaries and is among the lowest
binding energy associations found in the field. Formation simulations via
gravitational fragmentation of massive extended disks have successfully
produced a specific analog to this system.
