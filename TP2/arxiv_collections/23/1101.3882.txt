The Shack-Hartman wavefront sensor designed for final acceptance of 2.5m SAI
telescope allows to measure the shape of the wavefront on exit pupil of the
telescope using a bright star. The reference laser source on wavelength 532 nm
is used for measurements. During testing the device at different telescopes it
was found out what it's probable to estimate some properties of air streams in
the dome. Such estimations have been made for three domes: 1.5 m AZT-22 and 1.0
m Zeiss telescope of Maidanak Observatory, Uzbekistan and for 2.6 m telescope
ZTSh of Crimean observatory, Ukraine. The following results were obtained for
the slowest streams in domes: {\beta}=0.34" for AZT-22, {\beta}=0.67" for
Zeiss-1000, and {\beta}=0.69" for ZTSh.
