As we approach solar convection simulations that seek to model the
interaction of small-scale granulation and supergranulation and even larger
scales of convection within the near-surface shear layer (NSSL), the treatment
of the boundary conditions and minimization of sub-grid scale diffusive
processes become increasingly crucial. We here assess changes in the dynamics
and the energy flux balance of the flows established in rotating spherical
shell segments that capture much of the NSSL with the Curved Spherical Segment
(CSS) code using two different diffusion schemes. The CSS code is a new
massively parallel modeling tool capable of simulating 3-D compressible MHD
convection with a realistic solar stratification in rotating spherical shell
segments.
