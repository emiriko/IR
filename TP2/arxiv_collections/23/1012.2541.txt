A 1.5 um synchronous heralded single photon source (HSPS) is experimentally
demonstrated based on dispersion shifted fiber and commercial fiber components
in the paper. Experimental results show that both the preparation efficiency
and the conditional second order correlation function g2(0) increase with the
pump light level. Between the two important parameters, tradeoff should be
taken in order to obtain a high quality fiber-based synchronous HSPS. A
synchronous HSPS with a prepare efficiency of >60% and g2(0)<0.06 is achieved,
the multi-photon probability of which is reduced by a factor of more than 16
compared with the Poissonian light sources. The experimental results show a
great potential of the fiber-based synchronous HSPS for quantum information
applications.
