Ultraviolet emission from the first generation of stars in the Universe
ionized the intergalactic medium in a process which was completed by z~6; the
wavelength of these photons has been redshifted by (1+z) into the near infrared
today and can be measured using instruments situated above the Earth's
atmosphere. First flying in February 2009, the Cosmic Infrared Background
Experiment (CIBER) comprises four instruments housed in a single reusable
sounding rocket borne payload. CIBER will measure spatial anisotropies in the
extragalactic IR background caused by cosmological structure from the epoch of
reionization using two broadband imaging instruments, make a detailed
characterization of the spectral shape of the IR background using a low
resolution spectrometer, and measure the absolute brightness of the Zodical
light foreground with a high resolution spectrometer in each of our six science
fields. This paper presents the scientific motivation for CIBER and details of
its first two flights, including a review of the published scientific results
from the first flight and an outlook for future reionization science with CIBER
data.
