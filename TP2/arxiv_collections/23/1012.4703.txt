We discuss several possible caveats which arise with the interpretation of
measurements of fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We especially focus on
the ratios of particle yields, which has been advocated as a possible signature
of a critical point in the QCD phase diagram. We conclude that current
experimental observables are not well-defined and are without a proper
quantitative meaning.
