We performed numerical simulations of mergers between gas-rich disc galaxies,
which result in the formation of late-type galaxies. Stars formed during the
merger end up in a thick disc that is partially supported by velocity
dispersion and has high [alpha/Fe] ratios at all metallicities. Stars formed
later end up in a thin, rotationally supported disc which has lower [alpha/Fe]
ratios. While the structural and kinematical properties of the merger remnants
depend strongly upon the orbital parameters of the mergers, we find a clear
chemical signature of gas-rich mergers.
