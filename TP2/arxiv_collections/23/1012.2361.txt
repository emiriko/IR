A long-lived quantum memory was developed based on light-compensated cold
$^{87}$Rb atoms in a dipole trap. The lifetime of the quantum memory was
improved by 40 folds, from 0.67 ms to 28 ms with the help of a compensation
laser beam. Oscillations of the memory efficiency due to the transverse mode
breathing of the singly-excited spin wave have been clearly observed and
clarified with a Monte-Carlo simulation procedure. With detailed analysis of
the decoherence processes of the spin wave in cold atomic ensembles, this
experiment provides a benchmark for the further development of high-quality
quantum memories.
