The present naming convention for extrasolar planets used by the vast
majority of researchers in the field is based upon an interpretation of the
provisional I.A.U. standard for multiple star systems. With the existence of
hundreds of exoplanets around single stars named by this convention and a
handful of exoplanets around binary stars -- circumbinary planets -- it has
become necessary to find a uniform and useful naming convention for the latter
which is maximally compatible with the single host-star convention and which
captures as much of the dynamical information about the planet as possible. We
propose a simple and generic naming convention for all exoplanets which follows
the provisional I.A.U. standard but more clearly indicates their dynamical
status. The proposed convention is compatible with present usage and easily
extendible to exoplanets around stars in systems of arbitrary multiplicity. We
invite comments and discussion on the proposed convention, in the hope of a
timely adoption by the I.A.U. Commissions 5, 8+24, 26, 42, 45 and 53.
