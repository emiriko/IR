Recent chiral EFT calculations of nucleon polarizabilities reveal a problem
in the current empirical determination of proton's electromagnetic
polarizabilities. We also report on the progress in the empirical determination
of the $\Delta$(1232)-resonance magnetic moment in the process of $\gamma p \to
p \pi^0 \gamma'$ measured at MAMI.
