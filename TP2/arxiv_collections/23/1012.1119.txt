We address the lattice instability of 1T-TiSe2 in the framework of the
exciton condensate phase. We show that, at low temperature, condensed excitons
influence the lattice through electron-phonon interaction. It is found that at
zero temperature, in the exciton condensate phase of 1T-TiSe2, this exciton
condensate exerts a force on the lattice generating ionic displacements
comparable in amplitude to what is measured in experiment. This is thus the
first quantitative estimation of the amplitude of the periodic lattice
distortion observed in 1T-TiSe2 as a consequence of the exciton condensate
phase.
