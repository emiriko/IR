A spatially resolved electroluminescence (EL) imaging experiment is developed
to measure the local sheet resistance of the window layer, directly on the
completed CIGS cell. Our method can be applied to the EL imaging studies that
are made in fundamental studies as well as in in-line process inspection (1-3).
The EL experiment consists in using solar cell as a light emitting device : a
voltage is applied to the cell and its luminescence is detected. We develop an
analytical and quantitative model to simulate the behavior of CIGS solar cells
based on the spread sheet resistance effect in the window layer. We determine
the repartition of the electric potential on the ZnO, for given cell's
characteristics such as sheet resistance and contact geometries. Knowing the
repartition of the potential, the EL intensity is estimated and the
experimental EL signal is fitted, which allows the determination of the window
layer sheet resistance.
