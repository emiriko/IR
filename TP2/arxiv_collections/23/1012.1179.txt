We study the formation dynamics of a spontaneous ferromagnetic order in
single self-assembled CdMnTe quantum dots. By measuring time-resolved
photoluminescence, we determine the formation times for QDs with Mn ion
contents x varying from 0.01 to 0.2. At low x these times are orders of
magnitude longer than exciton spin relaxation times evaluated from the decay of
photoluminescence circular polarization. This allows us to conclude that the
direction of the spontaneous magnetization is determined by a momentary Mn spin
fluctuation rather than resulting from an optical orientation. At higher x, the
formation times are of the same order of magnitude as found in previous studies
on higher dimensional systems. We also find that the exciton spin relaxation
accelerates with increasing Mn concentration.
