We show that very long range repulsive interactions of a generalized
Coulomb-like form $V(R)\sim R^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha<d$ ($d$-dimensionality),
typically introduce very strong frustration, resulting in extreme fragility of
the charge-ordered state. An \textquotedbl{}almost frozen\textquotedbl{} liquid
then survives in a broad dynamical range above the (very low) melting
temperature $T_{c}$ which is proportional to $\alpha$. This
\textquotedbl{}pseudogap\textquotedbl{} phase is characterized by unusual
insulating-like, but very weakly temperature dependent transport, similar to
experimental findings in certain low carrier density systems.
