We give an easy algorithm which calculates the generating function of the
cocharacter sequence of the T-ideal of the polynomial identities of the algebra
of upper triangular matrices over a field of characteristic zero. Applying this
algorithm we have found the explicit form of the multiplicities in two cases:
(i) for the "largest" partitions; (ii) for matrices of small size and for all
partitions.
