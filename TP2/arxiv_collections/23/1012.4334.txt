We present a study of the extended radio emission in a sample of 8434 low
redshift (z < 0.35) broad line active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To calculate the jet and lobe contributions to the
total radio luminosity, we have taken the 846 radio core sources detected in
our previous study of this sample and performed a systematic search in the
Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) database for
extended radio emission that is likely associated with the optical
counterparts. We found 51 out of 846 radio core sources have extended emission
(> 4" from the optical AGN) that is positively associated with the AGN, and we
have identified an additional 12 AGN with extended radio emission but no
detectable radio core emission. Among these 63 AGN, we found 6 giant radio
galaxies (GRGs), with projected emission exceeding 750 kpc in length, and
several other AGN with unusual radio morphologies also seen in higher redshift
surveys. The optical spectra of many of the extended sources are similar to
that of typical broad line radio galaxy spectra, having broad H$\alpha$
emission lines with boxy profiles and large M_BH. With extended emission taken
into account, we find strong evidence for a bimodal distribution in the
radio-loudness parameter R, where the lower radio luminosity core-only sources
appear as a population separate from the extended sources, with a dividing line
at log(R) $\approx 1.75$. This dividing line ensures that these are indeed the
most radio-loud AGN, which may have different or extreme physical conditions in
their central engines when compared to the more numerous radio quiet AGN.
