We show that the zero field normal-state resistivity above Tc for various
levels of electron doping - both for LaO1-xFxFeAs (La-1111) and SmO1-xFxFeAs
(Sm-1111) members of the 1111-iron-pnictide superconductor family - can be
scaled in a broad temperature range from 20 to 300 K onto single curves for
underdoped La-1111 (x=0.05-0.075), for optimally and overdoped La-1111
(x=0.1-0.2) and for underdoped Sm-1111 (x=0.06-0.1) compounds. The scaling was
performed using the energy scale {\Delta}, the resistivity {\rho}_{\Delta} and
the residual resistivity {\rho}_0 as scaling parameters as well as by applying
a recently proposed model-independent scaling method (H. G. Luo, Y. H. Su, and
T. Xiang, Phys. Rev. B 77, 014529 (2008)). The scaling parameters have been
calculated and the compositional variation of {\Delta} has been determined. The
observed scaling behaviour for {\rho}(T) is interpreted as an indication of a
common mechanism which dominates the scattering of the charge carriers in
underdoped La-1111, in optimally and overdoped La-1111 and in underdoped
Sm-1111 compounds..
