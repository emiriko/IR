HR 7409 (7 Vul) is a newly identified Be star possibly part of the Gould Belt
and is the massive component of a 69-day spectroscopic binary. The binary
parameters and properties of the Be star measured using high-dispersion spectra
obtained at Ondrejov Observatory and at Rozhen Observatory imply the presence
of a low mass companion (~ 0.5-0.8 M_sun). If the pair is relatively young
(<50-80 Myr), then the companion is a K V star, but, following another, older
evolutionary scenario, the companion is a horizontal-branch star or possibly a
white dwarf star. In the latter scenario, a past episode of mass transfer from
an evolved star onto a less massive dwarf star would be responsible for the
peculiar nature of the present-day, fast-rotating Be star.
