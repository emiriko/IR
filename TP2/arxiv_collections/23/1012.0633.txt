Thin-film-like high temperature superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x single
crystals (TSB) with a typical thickness of 20-200 nm is produced by mechanical
exfoliation. The TSB, which shows excellent superconductivity, can adhere
firmly to the substrate by van der Waals force. The TSB may find important
applications in fabricating high temperature superconducting devices. Intrinsic
Josephson junctions made of the TSB are demonstrated. A very interesting
finding is that the TSB can follow exactly the topology of the substrate,
making it possible to fabricate superconducting devices with artificial
structures by using substrate template, for instance, step-edge Josephson
junctions.
