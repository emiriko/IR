The Dirac's chord method may be suitable in different areas of physics for
the representation of certain six-dimensional integrals for a convex body using
the probability density of the chord length distribution. For a homogeneous
model with a nonconvex body inside a medium with identical properties an
analogue of the Dirac's chord method may be obtained, if to use so-called
generalized chord distribution. The function is defined as normalized second
derivative of the autocorrelation function. For nonconvex bodies this second
derivative may have negative values and could not be directly related with a
probability density. An interpretation of such a function using alternating
sums of probability densities is considered. Such quasi-probability
distributions may be used for Monte Carlo calculations of some integrals for a
single body of arbitrary shape and for systems with two or more objects and
such applications are also discussed in this work.
