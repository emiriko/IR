We report on the measurement of the static potential and the scale r_0 from
HYP-smeared Wilson loops in two flavour QCD. We analyse the quark mass
dependence of the potential and r_0 at three lattice spacings. We also compare
the QCD static potential around distance r_0 with the static potential obtained
from potential models.
