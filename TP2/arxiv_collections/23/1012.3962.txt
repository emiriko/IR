The quotient complexity, also known as state complexity, of a regular
language is the number of distinct left quotients of the language. The quotient
complexity of an operation is the maximal quotient complexity of the language
resulting from the operation, as a function of the quotient complexities of the
operands. The class of star-free languages is the smallest class containing the
finite languages and closed under boolean operations and concatenation. We
prove that the tight bounds on the quotient complexities of union,
intersection, difference, symmetric difference, concatenation, and star for
star-free languages are the same as those for regular languages, with some
small exceptions, whereas the bound for reversal is 2^n-1.
