We discuss a new type of reactions of a phi meson production on hyperons, pi
Y--> phi Y and anti-kaons bar-K N --> phi Y. These reactions are not suppressed
according to Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule and can be a new efficient source of phi
mesons in a nucleus-nucleus collision. We discuss how these reactions can
affect the centrality dependence and the rapidity distributions of the phi
yield.
