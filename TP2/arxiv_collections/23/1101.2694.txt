In our recent paper entitled "Pairing mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity: Experimental constraints" (to be published in Physica
Scripta, arXiv:1012.2368), we review some crucial experiments that place strong
constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. In particular, we show that phonons rather than
spin-fluctuation play a predominant role in the microscopic pairing mechanism.
We further show that the intrinsic pairing symmetry in the bulk is not d-wave,
but extended s-wave (having eight line nodes) in hole-doped cuprates and
nodeless s-wave in electron-doped cuprates. In contrast, the author of the
Comment (to be published in Physica Scripta) argues that our conclusions are
unconvincing and even misleading. In response to the criticisms in the Comment,
we further show that our conclusions are well supported by experiments and his
criticisms are lack of scientific ground.
