The analytical algorithm previously proposed by the author for matching the
Volkov-Akulov (VA) and Komargodski-Seiberg (KS) actions describing the
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermion, is discussed. The essence of the algotithm is
explained, its consistency is proved and the recent results obtained with
computer assistance are reproduced, when the proper Fierz rearrangements for
Majorana bispinors are taken into account. We reveal a linear space of
composite spinorial monomials $\Delta_{m}$ which are the solutions of the
scalar constraint $(\partial^{m}\bar\psi\Delta_{m})=0$. This space is used to
clarify relations between the KS and VA realizations of the NG fermionic field
$\psi$.
