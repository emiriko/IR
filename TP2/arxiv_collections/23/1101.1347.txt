Preparing graphene and its derivatives on functional substrates may open
enormous opportunities for exploring the intrinsic electronic properties and
new functionalities of graphene. However, efforts in replacing SiO$_{2}$ have
been greatly hampered by a very low sample yield of the exfoliation and related
transferring methods. Here, we report a new route in exploring new graphene
physics and functionalities by transferring large-scale chemical vapor
deposition single-layer and bilayer graphene to functional substrates. Using
ferroelectric Pb(Zr$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$)O$_{3}$ (PZT), we demonstrate ultra-low
voltage operation of graphene field effect transistors within $\pm1$ V with
maximum doping exceeding $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and on-off ratios larger
than 10 times. After polarizing PZT, switching of graphene field effect
transistors are characterized by pronounced resistance hysteresis, suitable for
ultra-fast non-volatile electronics.
