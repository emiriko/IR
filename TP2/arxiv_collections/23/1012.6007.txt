This work aims at illustrating that, for a class of leading-twist hard
exclusive reactions involving two heavy quarkonia, the light-cone approach,
when equipped with the strategy of refactorization of the light-cone
distribution amplitude of quarkonium, can be employed to elegantly reproduce
the corresponding predictions made in the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD)
factorization approach, order by order in perturbative expansion. Taking the
electromagnetic form factor of the $B_c$ meson at large momentum transfer,
$Q^2$, as a concrete example, we compare the results obtained from both
NRQCD-based and light-cone-based calculations through the next-to-leading order
(NLO) in $\alpha_s$, while at the leading order (LO) in both velocity and
$1/Q^2$ expansion, and explicitly confirm their mutual agreement. As a
byproduct, we apply our NLO result to explore certain features about the
asymptotic behavior of the heavy-light meson form factor. We also address the
major theoretical obstacles that prevent us from establishing an analogous
equivalence between these two approaches for the double charmonium production
process of phenomenological interest, $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$.
