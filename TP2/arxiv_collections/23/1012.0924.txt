I review recent developments in theoretical spin physics. Topics include pion
production in nucleon-nucleon collisions, the implications of heavy quark spin
symmetry for heavy hadron molecules, the nucleon electric dipole form factors
and ab initio calculations of the width of hadron resonances. A few spin
physics high-lights from experiments at the COSY accelerator are also
discussed.
