We simulate direct photon production in evolution of viscous QGP medium.
Photons from Compton and annihilation processes are considered. Viscous effect
on photon production is very strong and reliable simulation is possible only in
a limited $p_T$ range. For minimally viscous fluid $\eta/s$=0.08), direct
photons can be reliably computed only up to $p_T \leq$ 1.3 GeV. With reduced
viscosity ($\eta/s$=0.04), the limit increases to $p_T \leq $2GeV.
