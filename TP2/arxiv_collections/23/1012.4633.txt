We discuss recent results of hadron spectroscopy and hadron-hadron
interaction within a quark model framework. New experimental data could point
to the important role played by higher order Fock space components on
low-energy observables. Our aim is to obtain a coherent description of the
low-energy hadron phenomenology to constrain QCD phenomenological models and
try to learn about low-energy realizations of the theory. This long-range
effort is based in adapting few-body techniques to study many-quark systems.
