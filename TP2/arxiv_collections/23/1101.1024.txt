In these mostly expository lectures, we give an elementary introduction to
conformal field theory in the context of probability theory and complex
analysis. We consider statistical fields, and define Ward functionals in terms
of their Lie derivatives. Based on this approach, we explain some equations of
conformal field theory and outline their relation to SLE theory.
