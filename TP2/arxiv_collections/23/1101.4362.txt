We consider the possibility to combine inflection point inflation and growing
neutrino dark energy in a particular setup of bimodal/schizophrenic neutrino
model in the framework of MSSM$\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$. In order to obtain a
varying neutrino mass, we make an assumption that a soft mass of
$\tilde{Z'}_{BL}$ depends on a scalar field which plays the role of a cosmon
field. We also investigate the possible effects of the cosmon field in the
early universe such as modulated reheating and found that the induced density
perturbation is negligible.
