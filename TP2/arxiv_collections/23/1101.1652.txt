The status of Monte Carlo system for the simulation of tau-lepton production
and decay in high-energy accelerator experiments is reviewed. Since previous
tau-lepton conference in 2008 some practical modifications have been
introduced: (i) For the TAUOLA Monte Carlo generator of tau-lepton decays,
automated and simultaneous use of many versions of form-factors for the
calculation of optional weights for fits was developped and checked to work in
Belle and BaBar software environment. Work on alternative paramterizations of
hadronic decays is advanced. (ii) the TAUOLA universal interface based on HepMC
(the C++ event record) is now public. A similar interface for PHOTOS is now
also public. (iii) Extension of PHOTOS Monte Carlo for QED bremsstrahlung in
decays featuring kernels based on complete first order matrix element are
gradually becoming widely available thanks to properites of the new, HepMC
based interface. (iv) Tests of the programs systematized with the help of
MC-TESTER are now available for FORTRAN and C++ users. Presented here results
illustrate the status of the projects performed in collaboration with Nadia
Davidson, Piotr Golonka, Gizo Nanava, Tomasz Przedzinski, Olga Shekhovtsova, El
zbieta Richter-Was, Pablo Roig, Qingjun Xu and others.
