We present a series of numerical experiments that model the evolution of
magnetic flux tubes with a different amount of initial twist. As a result of
calculations, tightly twisted tubes reveal a rapid two-step emergence to the
atmosphere with a slight slowdown at the surface, while weakly twisted tubes
show a slow two-step emergence waiting longer the secondary instability to be
triggered. This picture of the two-step emergence is highly consistent with
recent observations. These tubes show multiple magnetic domes above the
surface, indicating that the secondary emergence is caused by interchange mode
of magnetic buoyancy instability. As for the weakest twist case, the tube
exhibits an elongated photospheric structure and never rises into the corona.
The formation of the photospheric structure is due to inward magnetic tension
force of the azimuthal field component of the rising flux tube (i.e., tube's
twist). When the twist is weak, azimuthal field cannot hold the tube's
coherency, and the tube extends laterally at the subadiabatic surface. In
addition, we newly find that the total magnetic energy measured above the
surface depends on the initial twist. Strong twist tubes follow the initial
relation between the twist and the magnetic energy, while weak twist tubes
deviates from this relation, because these tubes store their magnetic energy in
the photospheric structures.
