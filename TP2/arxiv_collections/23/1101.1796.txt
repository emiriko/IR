In this paper we explore the life expectancy limits by based on the
stochastic modeling of mortality and applying the first exit or hitting time
theory of a stochastic process. The main assumption is that the health state or
the "vitality", according to Strehler and Mildvan, of an individual is a
stochastic variable and thus it was introduced and applied a first exit time
density function to mortality data. The model is used to estimate the
development of mortality rates in the late stages of the human life span, to
make better fitting to population mortality data including the infant
mortality, to compare it with the classical Gompertz curve, and to make
comparisons between the Carey med-fly data and the population mortality data
estimating the health state or "vitality" functions. Furthermore, we apply the
model to the life table data of Italy, France, USA, Canada, Sweden, Norway and
Japan, and we analyze the characteristic parameters of the model and make
forecasts.
