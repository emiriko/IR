Described is an experiment in which a smartphone was caused to move at steady
state in a vertical plane, on a path that was nearly circular. During a time
interval of data acquisition that encompassed multiple orbits, the acceleration
of the phone was measured by means of its internal accelerometer. A subsequent
analysis of the data that was collected shows reasonable agreement between
experiment and a simple theory of the motion.
