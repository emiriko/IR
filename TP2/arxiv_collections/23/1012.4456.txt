Infinitesimal supersymmetries over classical Lie groups that do not
necessarily integrate to Lie supergroups are described. They yield a notion of
supersymmetry that is less rigid than the assumption of a Lie supergroup action
but still implies an underlying action of a Lie group. In contrast to Lie
supergroups, the arising representation-theoretical Lie supergroups (RTLSG)
occur as families associated to Harish-Chandra superpairs. However morphisms of
RTLSGs directly correspond to morphisms of Harish-Chandra superpairs.
Particular RTLSGs can be derived from the explicit constructions of Lie
supergroups given by Berezin and Kostant. The Lie superalgebras
$\mathfrak{gl}(1,1)$ or $\mathfrak{sl}(1,1)$ appearing also in higher
dimensional classical Lie superalgebras, provide interesting first examples of
RTLSGs. A classification of RTLSGs associated to real and complex
$\mathfrak{gl}(1,1)$- and $\mathfrak{sl}(1,1)$-Harish-Chandra superpairs is
given by parameter spaces and complete sets of invariants. The underlying Lie
group is assumed to be connected but possibly not simply connected.
