In this paper, a multiplicity preserving triangular set decomposition
algorithm is proposed for a system of two polynomials. The algorithm decomposes
the variety defined by the polynomial system into unmixed components
represented by triangular sets, which may have negative multiplicities. In the
bivariate case, we give a complete algorithm to decompose the system into
multiplicity preserving triangular sets with positive multiplicities. We also
analyze the complexity of the algorithm in the bivariate case. We implement our
algorithm and show the effectiveness of the method with extensive experiments.
