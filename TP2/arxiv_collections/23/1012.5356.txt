Basic properties of the unified entropies are examined. The consideration is
mainly restricted to the finite-dimensional quantum case. Bounds in terms of
ensembles of quantum states are given. Both the continuity in Fannes' sense and
stability in Lesche's sense are shown for wide ranges of parameters. In
particular, uniform estimates are obtained for the quantum R\'{e}nyi entropies.
Stability properties in the thermodynamic limit are discussed as well. It is
shown that the unified entropies enjoy both the subadditivity and triangle
inequality for a certain range of parameters. Non-decreasing of all the unified
entropies under projective measurement is proved.
