We summarize the main features of the spectroscopy, production and decays of
the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ tetraquarks in the $b\bar{b}$ sector, concentrating on the
lowest state called $Y_b(10890)$. The tetraquark framework is used to analyze
the BaBar data on the $e^+ e^- \to b\bar{b}$ cross section ($R_b$ energy scan)
between $\sqrt{s}= 10.54$ and 11.20 GeV and the Belle data on the processes
$e^+e^- \to \Upsilon(1S) \pi^+\pi^-,\Upsilon(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ near the peak of
the $\Upsilon(5S)$ resonance. The BaBar $R_b$ energy scan is consistent with an
additional state at a mass of 10.90 GeV and a width of about 28 MeV, in broad
agreement with the state $Y_b(10890)$ GeV seen by Belle in the exclusive final
states. We argue that the decay widths and the dipion invariant mass
distributions measured by Belle are naturally explained by the tetraquark
interpretation of $Y_b(10890)$.
