In this paper we present a method for conducting a coherent search for single
spin compact binary coalescences in gravitational wave data and compare this
search to the existing coincidence method for single spin searches. We propose
a method to characterize the regions of the parameter space where the single
spin search, both coincident and coherent, will increase detection efficiency
over the existing non-precessing search. We also show example results of the
coherent search on a stretch of data from LIGO's fourth science run but note
that a set of signal based vetoes will be needed before this search can be run
to try to make detections.
