We report the discovery of HAT-P-27b, an exoplanet transiting the moderately
bright G8 dwarf star GSC 0333-00351 (V=12.214). The orbital period is 3.039586
+/- 0.000012 d, the reference epoch of transit is 2455186.01879 +/- 0.00054
(BJD), and the transit duration is 0.0705 +/- 0.0019 d. The host star with its
effective temperature 5300 +/- 90 K is somewhat cooler than the Sun, and is
more metal-rich with a metallicity of +0.29 +/- 0.10. Its mass is 0.94 +/- 0.04
Msun and radius is 0.90 +/- 0.04 Rsun. For the planetary companion we determine
a mass of 0.660 +/- 0.033 MJ and radius of 1.038 +0.077 -0.058 RJ. For the 30
known transiting exoplanets between 0.3 MJ and 0.8 MJ, a negative correlation
between host star metallicity and planetary radius, and an additional
dependence of planetary radius on equilibrium temperature are confirmed at a
high level of statistical significance.
