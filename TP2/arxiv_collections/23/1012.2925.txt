The Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) Project is a consensus collaboration
among many of the foremost international researchers of the physics of hot,
massive stars, with the basic aim of understanding the origin, evolution and
impact of magnetic fields in these objects. At the time of writing, MiMeS Large
Programs have acquired over 1250 high-resolution polarised spectra of about 150
individual stars with spectral types from B5-O4, discovering new magnetic
fields in over a dozen hot, massive stars. Notable results include the
detection of magnetic fields in the two most rapidly-rotating known magnetic
stars, and in the most massive known magnetic star. In this paper we review the
structure of the MiMeS observing programs and report the status of
observations, data modeling and development of related theory, and review
important results obtained so far.
