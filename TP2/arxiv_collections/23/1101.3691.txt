A second-order supersymmetric transformation is presented, for the
two-channel Schr\"odinger equation with equal thresholds. It adds a
Breit-Wigner term to the mixing parameter, without modifying the eigenphase
shifts, and modifies the potential matrix analytically. The iteration of a few
such transformations allows a precise fit of realistic mixing parameters in
terms of a Pade expansion of both the scattering matrix and the effective-range
function. The method is applied to build an exactly-solvable potential for the
neutron-proton $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ case.
