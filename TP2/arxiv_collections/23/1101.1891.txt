We discuss the three-body properties of identical bosons exhibiting large
scattering length in two spatial dimensions. Within an effective field theory
for resonant interactions, we calculate the leading non-universal corrections
from the two-body effective range to bound-state and scattering observables. In
particular, we compute the three-body binding energies, the boson-dimer
scattering properties, and the three-body recombination rate for finite
energies. We find significant effective range effects in the vicinity of the
unitary limit. The implications of this result for future experiments are
briefly discussed.
