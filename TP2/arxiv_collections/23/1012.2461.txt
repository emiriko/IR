Significant influence of aerogel surface heterogeneity on the processes of
3He nuclear magnetic relaxation at temperatures 1.5 - 4.2 K is discovered. This
influence appears, for instance, in differences of 3He T1 relaxation times for
small portion of 3He, adsorbed at different temperatures. Binding energy data
of 3He on the surface of powder silica aerogel obtained experimentally and
binding energy lies in the wide range. Adsorbed 3He molecules with binding
energies 60-250 K play supreme role in processes of nuclear magnetic relaxation
of gaseous and liquid 3He in aerogel.
