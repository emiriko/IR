We introduce the cluster algebraic formulation of the integrable difference
equations, the discrete Lotka-Volterra equation and the discrete Liouville
equation, from the view point of the general T-system and Y-system. We also
study the Poisson structure for the cluster algebra, and give the associated
Poisson bracket for the two difference equations.
