A novel nanobeam design with a triangular cross-section is proposed. This
design makes possible implementing nanocavities with improved optical
properties. The dependence of a diamond-based cavity quality factor Q and mode
volume Vm on geometry parameter space are studied via 3D FDTD computations. An
ultra-high-Q cavity with Q\aprox 2.51 \times 10^6 and Vm=1.06 \times
({\lambda}/n)^3 is predicted. The mode preferential radiation is upward. The
implications on the potential applications are discussed. The proposed nanobeam
enables fabrication of the cavity without relying on a pre-existing
free-standing diamond membrane as required in most previous approaches.
