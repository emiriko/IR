Using first principles calculations as based on density functional theory, we
propose a class of so far unexplored diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors and
half-metals. Here, we study the electronic properties of recently synthesized $
4d $ and $ 5d $ transition metal dinitrides. In particular, we address Mn- and
Fe-substitution in PtN$_2$ and PdN$_2$. Structural relaxation shows that the
resulting ordered compounds, Pt$_{0.75}$(Mn,Fe)$_{0.25}$N$_2$ and
Pd$_{0.75}$(Mn,Fe)$_{0.25}$N$_2$, maintain the cubic crystal symmetry of the
parent compounds. On substitution, all compounds exhibit long-range
ferromagnetic order. While both Pt$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$N$_2$ and
Pd$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$N$_2$ are semiconducting, Fe-substitution causes
half-metallic behavior for both parent materials.
