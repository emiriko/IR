We observe the coherence of an interacting two-component Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) surviving for seconds in a trapped Ramsey interferometer.
Mean-field driven collective oscillations of two components lead to periodic
dephasing and rephasing of condensate wave functions with a slow decay of the
interference fringe visibility. We apply spin echo synchronous with the
self-rephasing of the condensate to reduce the influence of state-dependent
atom losses, significantly enhancing the visibility up to 0.75 at the evolution
time of 1.5s. Mean-field theory consistently predicts higher visibility than
experimentally observed values. We quantify the effects of classical and
quantum noise and infer a coherence time of 2.8 s for a trapped condensate of
5.5e4 interacting atoms.
