A relationship between the ridge distribution in $\Delta\eta$ and the
single-particle distribution in $\eta$ is proposed. It is then verified by use
of the data from PHOBOS on both distributions. The implication seems to point
to the possibility that there is no long-range longitudinal correlation. An
interpretation of the phenomenological observation along that possibility is
developed.
