We analyze the production and freeze-out of the isomer 180Tam in the
neutrino-process. We consider the influence of a possible low-lying
intermediate (J = 5) state at 592 keV using a transition width estimated from
the measured half-life. This more realistic width is much smaller than the
previous estimate.We find that the 592-keV state leads only to a small
reduction of the residual isomer population ratio from the previous result;
that is, considering this better estimate for the transition width, the isomer
population ratio changes from R = 0.39 to R = 0.38, whereas previously it was
estimated that this transition could reduce the ratio to R = 0.18. This finding
strengthens the evidence that 138La and 180Ta are coproduced by neutrino
nucleosynthesis with an electron neutrino temperature of kT~4 MeV.
