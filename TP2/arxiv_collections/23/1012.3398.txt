We present a general, model independent argument demonstrating that gluons
produced in high energy hadronic collision are necessarily correlated in
rapidity and also in the emission angle. The strength of the correlation
depends on the process and on the structure/model of the colliding particles.
In particular we argue that it is strongly affected (and underestimated) by
factorized approximations frequently used to quantify the effect.
