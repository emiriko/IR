Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source. Newly proposed
experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron
Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes. For example, the
annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons is expected to yield world-leading
sensitivities to hyperon rare decays and CP violation. It could also provide
the world's most intense source of tagged D^0 mesons, and thus the best
near-term opportunity to study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search
for new physics. Other precision measurements that could be made include
properties of the X(3872) and the charmonium system. An experiment using a
Penning trap and an atom interferometer could make the world's first
measurement of the gravitational force on antimatter. These and other potential
measurements using antiprotons could lead to a broad physics program at
Fermilab in the post-Tevatron era.
