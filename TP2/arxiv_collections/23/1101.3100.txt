We argue that existing models of the ideal pulsar magnetosphere are incorrect
because of the improper treatment of the singular current layer outside the
light cylinder. We simulated the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere in the
Force-Free limit of Strong-Field Electrodynamics. It turns out that even in the
Force-Free limit, some field lines enter the singular current layer which lies
beyond the light cylinder in the equatorial plane. As a result: (i) about 10%
of the Poynting flux is dissipated between 1 and 1.5 light cylinder radii, (ii)
there is no singular current layer within the light cylinder.
