Assuming that the relativistic universe is homogeneous and isotropic, we can
unambiguously determine its model and physical properties, which correspond
with the Einstein general theory of relativity (and with its two special
partial solutions: Einstein special theory of relativity and Newton gravitation
theory), quantum mechanics, and observations, too.
