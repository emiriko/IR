We present new mid-infrared (MIR) imaging data for three Type-1 Seyfert
galaxies obtained with T-ReCS on the Gemini-South Telescope at subarcsecond
resolution. Our aim is to enlarge the sample studied in a previous work to
compare the properties of Type-1 and Type-2 Seyfert tori using clumpy torus
models and a Bayesian approach to fit the infrared nuclear spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). Thus, the sample considered here comprises 7 Type-1, 11
Type-2, and 3 intermediate-type Seyferts. The unresolved IR emission of the
Seyfert 1 galaxies can be reproduced by a combination of dust heated by the
central engine and direct AGN emission, while for the Seyfert 2 nuclei only
dust emission is considered. These dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than
6 pc radius, as derived from our fits. Unification schemes of AGN account for a
variety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. However, we
find evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediate
dusty surroundings of Type-1 and Type-2 Seyfert nuclei are intrinsically
different. The Type-2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and
these clumps have lower optical depths than those of Type-1 tori. The larger
the covering factor of the torus, the smaller the probability of having direct
view of the AGN, and vice-versa. In our sample, Seyfert 2 tori have larger
covering factors and smaller escape probabilities than those of Seyfert 1. All
the previous differences are significant according to the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. Thus, on the basis of the results presented here, the
classification of a Seyfert galaxy as a Type-1 or Type-2 depends more on the
intrinsic properties of the torus rather than on its mere inclination towards
us, in contradiction with the simplest unification model.
