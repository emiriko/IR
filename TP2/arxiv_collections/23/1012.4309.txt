The turbulence in magnetically confined fusion plasmas has important and
non-trivial effects on the quality of the energy confinement. These effects are
hard to make a quantitative assessment of analytically. The problem
investigated in this article is the transport of energy and particles, in
particular impurities, in a Tokamak plasma. Impurities from the walls of the
plasma vessel cause energy losses if they reach the plasma core. It is
therefore important to understand the transport mechanisms to prevent impurity
accumulation and minimize losses. This is an area of research where turbulence
plays a major role and is intimately associated with the performance of future
fusion reactors, such as ITER.
