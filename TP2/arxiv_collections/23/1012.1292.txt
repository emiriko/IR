Experimental configuration for investigating the dynamics and the statistics
of the phase locking level of coupled lasers that have no common frequency is
presented. The results reveal that the probability distribution of the phase
locking level of such coupled lasers fits a Gumbel distribution that describes
the extreme value statistic of Gaussian processes. A simple model, based on the
spectral response of the coupled lasers, is also described, and the calculated
results are in good agreement with the experimental results.
