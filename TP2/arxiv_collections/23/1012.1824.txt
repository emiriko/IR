Using efficient point-to-point communication channels is critical for
implementing fine grained parallel program on modern shared cache multi-core
architectures.
  This report discusses in detail several implementations of wait-free
Single-Producer/Single-Consumer queue (SPSC), and presents a novel and
efficient algorithm for the implementation of an unbounded wait-free SPSC queue
(uSPSC). The correctness proof of the new algorithm, and several performance
measurements based on simple synthetic benchmark and microbenchmark, are also
discussed.
