We have studied current-voltage characteristics of Andreev contacts in
polycrystalline GdO$_{0.88}$F$_{0.12}$FeAs samples with bulk critical
temperature ${T_c}$ = (52.5 \pm 1)K using break-junction technique. The data
obtained cannot be described within the single-gap approach and suggests the
existence of a multi-gap superconductivity in this compound. The large and
small superconducting gap values estimated at T = 4.2K are {\Delta}L = 10.5 \pm
2 meV and {\Delta}S = 2.3 \pm 0.4 meV, respectively.
