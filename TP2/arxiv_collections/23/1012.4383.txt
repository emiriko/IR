A finite-temperature density functional approach to describe the properties
of parahydrogen in the liquid-vapor coexistence region is presented. The first
proposed functional is zero-range, where the density-gradient term is adjusted
so as to reproduce the surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface at low
temperature. The second functional is finite-range and, while it is fitted to
reproduce bulk pH2 properties only, it is shown to yield surface properties in
good agreement with experiments. These functionals are used to study the
surface thickness of the liquid-vapor interface, the wetting transition of
parahydrogen on a planar Rb model surface, and homogeneous cavitation in bulk
liquid pH2.
