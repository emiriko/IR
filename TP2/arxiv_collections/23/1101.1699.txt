Structural evolution in neutron-rich Os and W isotopes is investigated in
terms of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) Hamiltonian determined by
(constrained) Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with the Gogny-D1S
Energy Density Functional (EDF). The interaction strengths of the IBM
Hamiltonian are produced by mapping the potential energy surface (PES) of the
Gogny-EDF with quadrupole degrees of freedom onto the corresponding PES of the
IBM system. We examine the prolate-to-oblate shape/phase transition which is
predicted to take place in this region as a function of neutron number $N$
within the considered Os and W isotopic chains. The onset of this transition is
found to be more rapid compared to the neighboring Pt isotopes. The
calculations also allow prediction of spectroscopic variables (excited state
energies and reduced transition probabilities) which are presented for the
neutron-rich $^{192,194,196}$W nuclei, for which there is only very limited
experimental data available to date.
