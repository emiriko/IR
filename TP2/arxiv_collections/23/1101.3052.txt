This paper develops a game-theoretic framework for the design and analysis of
a new class of incentive schemes called intervention schemes. We formulate
intervention games, propose a solution concept of intervention equilibrium, and
prove its existence in a finite intervention game. We apply our framework to
resource sharing scenarios in wireless communications, whose non-cooperative
outcomes without intervention yield suboptimal performance. We derive
analytical results and analyze illustrative examples in the cases of imperfect
and perfect monitoring. In the case of imperfect monitoring, intervention
schemes can improve the suboptimal performance of non-cooperative equilibrium
when the intervention device has a sufficiently accurate monitoring technology,
although it may not be possible to achieve the best feasible performance. In
the case of perfect monitoring, the best feasible performance can be obtained
with an intervention scheme when the intervention device has a sufficiently
strong intervention capability.
