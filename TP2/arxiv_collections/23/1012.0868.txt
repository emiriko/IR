We present the current status of the MILC collaboration's calculations of the
properties of the light pseudoscalar meson sector. We use asqtad staggered
ensembles with 2+1 dynamical flavors down to $a \approx 0.045$ fm and light
quark mass down to 0.05 $m_s$. Here we describe fits to the data using chiral
forms from SU(3) chiral perturbation theory, including all staggered taste
violations at NLO and the continuum NNLO chiral logarithms. We emphasize issues
of convergence of the chiral expansion.
