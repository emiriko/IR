Using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, a general comparison theorem is
established for an eigenvalue equation of the form $(T+V)|\psi> = E|\psi>$,
where $T$ is a kinetic part which depends only on momentums and $V$ is a
potential which depends only on positions. We assume that $H^{(1)}=T+V^{(1)}$
and $H^{(2)}=T+V^{(2)}$ ($H^{(1)}=T^{(1)}+V$ and $H^{(2)}=T^{(2)}+V$) support
both discrete eigenvalues $E^{(1)}_{\{\alpha\}}$ and $E^{(2)}_{\{\alpha\}}$,
where ${\{\alpha\}}$ represents a set of quantum numbers. We prove that, if
$V^{(1)} \le V^{(2)}$ ($T^{(1)} \le T^{(2)}$) for all position (momentum)
variables, then the corresponding eigenvalues are ordered $E^{(1)}_{\{\alpha\}}
\le E^{(2)}_{\{\alpha\}}$. Some analytical applications are given.
