Parton luminosities are convenient for estimating how the physics potential
of Large Hadron Collider experiments depends on the energy of the proton beams.
I quantify the advantage of increasing the beam energy from 3.5 TeV to 4 TeV. I
present parton luminosities, ratios of parton luminosities, and contours of
fixed parton luminosity for $gg$, $u\bar{d}$, $qq$, and $gq$ interactions over
the energy range relevant to the Large Hadron Collider, along with example
analyses for specific processes. This note extends the analysis presented in
arXiv:0908.3660. Full-size figures are available as pdf files at
