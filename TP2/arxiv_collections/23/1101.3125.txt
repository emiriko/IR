We have investigated the isoscalar giant monopole resonances (ISGMR) in
$^{112-124}$Sn and $^{106-116}$Cd nuclei using inelastic scattering of 386-MeV
$\alpha$-particles at extremely forward angles, including 0$^\circ$. The
strength distributions for various multipoles were extracted by a multipole
decomposition analysis based on the expected angular distributions of the
respective multipoles. From the ISGMR results, a value of $K_{\tau} \sim -500$
MeV is obtained for the asymmetry term in the nuclear incompressibility.
