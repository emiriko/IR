Carbon-based materials like nanotubes and graphene are heavily investigated
as future CMOS-like devices and in interconnect applications. While much of the
interest has been devoted to the device aspects in competition to conventional
CMOS transistors, the paper here will focus on some less known applications of
carbon. Proposed and demonstrated are interconnect applications like highly
conductive electrodes for capacitors, gate material or through-silicon vias
(TSV), novel non-volatile memories, carbon-silicon Schottky diodes or superior
sensors.
