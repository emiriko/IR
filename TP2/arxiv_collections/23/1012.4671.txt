We provide a theoretical update of the calculations of the pi0-gamma*-gamma
form factor in the LCSR framework, including up to six polynomials in the
conformal expansion of the pion distribution amplitude and taking into account
twist-six corrections related to the photon emission at large distances. The
results are compared with the calculations of the B-> pi l nu decay and pion
electromagnetic form factors in the same framework. Our conclusion is that the
recent BaBar measurements of the pi0-gamma*-gamma form factor at large momentum
transfers are consistent with QCD, although they do suggest that the pion DA
may have more structure than usually assumed.
