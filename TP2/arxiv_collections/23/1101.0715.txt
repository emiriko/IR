We systematically study dijet production in various processes in the
small-$x$ limit and establish an effective $k_t$-factorization for hard
processes in a system with dilute probes scattering on a dense target. We find
that the well-known Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams gluon distribution can be directly
probed in the quark-antiquark jet correlation in deep inelastic scattering and
the dipole gluon distribution can be directly measured in the direct photon-jet
correlation in $pA$ collisions. In the large-$N_c$ limit, the unintegrated
gluon distributions involved in other different dijet channels in pA collisions
are shown to be related to two widely proposed ones: the
Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams gluon distribution and the dipole gluon distribution.
