The cross-Kerr effect is studied for two pulses propagating in an atomic
medium in a tripod configuration, dressed by a strong standing wave coupling
beam. Nonlinear phase shifts for both transmitted and reflected beams are
calculated taking into account the redistribution of the population among the
atomic levels which allows one to study the phase shifts in a wide range of
pulse detunings. The influence of other parameters, e.g., the intensity of the
control field and the relaxation rates, on the cross-Kerr effect is also
examined in detail.
