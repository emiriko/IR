This Mathematica 7.0/8.0 package upgrades and extends the quantum computer
simulation code called QDENSITY. Use of the density matrix was emphasized in
QDENSITY, although that code was also applicable to a quantum state
description. In the present version, the quantum state version is stressed and
made amenable to future extensions to parallel computer simulations. The add-on
QCWAVE extends QDENSITY in several ways. The first way is to describe the
action of one, two and three- qubit quantum gates as a set of small ($2 \times
2, 4\times 4$ or $8\times 8$) matrices acting on the $2^{n_q}$ amplitudes for a
system of $n_q$ qubits. This procedure was described in our parallel computer
simulation QCMPI and is reviewed here. The advantage is that smaller storage
demands are made, without loss of speed, and that the procedure can take
advantage of message passing interface (MPI) techniques, which will hopefully
be generally available in future Mathematica versions.
  Another extension of QDENSITY provided here is a multiverse approach, as
described in our QCMPI paper. This multiverse approach involves using the
present slave-master parallel processing capabilities of Mathematica 7.0/8.0 to
simulate errors and error correction. The basic idea is that parallel versions
of QCWAVE run simultaneously with random errors introduced on some of the
processors, with an ensemble average used to represent the real world
situation. Within this approach, error correction steps can be simulated and
their efficacy tested. This capability allows one to examine the detrimental
effects of errors and the benefits of error correction on particular quantum
algorithms.
