We present a method for incorporating the information contained in new
datasets into an existing set of parton distribution functions without the need
for refitting. The method involves reweighting the ensemble of parton densities
through the computation of the chi-square to the new dataset. We explain how
reweighting may be used to assess the impact of any new data or pseudodata on
parton densities and thus on their predictions. We show that the method works
by considering the addition of inclusive jet data to a DIS+DY fit, and
comparing to the refitted distribution. We then use reweighting to determine
the impact of recent high statistics lepton asymmetry data from the D0
experiment on the NNPDF2.0 parton set. We find that the D0 inclusive muon and
electron data are perfectly compatible with the rest of the data included in
the NNPDF2.0 analysis and impose additional constraints on the large-x d/u
ratio. The more exclusive D0 electron datasets are however inconsistent both
with the other datasets and among themselves, suggesting that here the
experimental uncertainties have been underestimated.
