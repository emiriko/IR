The motion of a small compact object in a background spacetime is
investigated in the context of a model nonlinear scalar field theory. This
model is constructed to have a perturbative structure analogous to the General
Relativistic description of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We apply the
effective field theory approach to this model and calculate the finite part of
the self force on the small compact object through third order in the ratio of
the size of the compact object to the curvature scale of the background (e.g.,
black hole) spacetime. We use well-known renormalization methods and
demonstrate the consistency of the formalism in rendering the self force finite
at higher orders within a point particle prescription for the small compact
object. This nonlinear scalar model should be useful for studying various
aspects of higher-order self force effects in EMRIs but within a comparatively
simpler context than the full gravitational case. These aspects include
developing practical schemes for higher order self force numerical
computations, quantifying the effects of transient resonances on EMRI waveforms
and accurately modeling the small compact object's motion for precise
determinations of the parameters of detected EMRI sources.
