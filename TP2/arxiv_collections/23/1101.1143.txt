The principal Hugoniot for liquid hydrogen was obtained up to 55 GPa under
laser-driven shock loading. Pressure and density of compressed hydrogen were
determined by impedance-matching to a quartz standard. The shock temperature
was independently measured from the brightness of the shock front. Hugoniot
data of hydrogen provide a good benchmark to modern theories of condensed
matter. The initial number density of liquid hydrogen is lower than that for
liquid deuterium, and this results in shock compressed hydrogen having a higher
compression and higher temperature than deuterium at the same shock pressure.
