We obtain within the statistical hadronization model the hadron yields
$dh/dy$ in heavy ion reactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV. We discuss the
dependence both on hadronization temperature $T$, and on critical hadronization
pressure $P$. We consider observables distinguishing the hadronization models
and conditions.
