It is known that the $\gamma_{5}$ scheme of Breitenlohner and Maison (BM) in
dimensional regularization requires finite counter-term renormalization to
restore gauge symmetry and implementing this finite renormalization in
practical calculation is a daunting task even at 1-loop order. In this paper,
we show that there is a simple and straightforward method to obtain these
finite counter terms by using the rightmost $\gamma_{5}$ scheme in which we
move all the $\gamma_{5}$ matrices to the rightmost position before
analytically continuing the dimension. For any 1-loop Feynman diagram, the
difference between the amplitude regularized in the rightmost $\gamma_{5}$
scheme and the amplitude regularized in the BM scheme can be easily calculated.
The differences for all 1-loop diagrams in the chiral Abelian-Higgs gauge
theory and in the chiral non-Abelian gauge theory are shown to be the same as
the amplitudes due to the finite counter terms that are required to restore
gauge symmetry.
