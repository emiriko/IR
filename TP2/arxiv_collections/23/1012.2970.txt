We calculate finite quantum corrections to the tribimaximal neutrino mixing
pattern V_TB in three generic classes of neutrino mass models. We show that
three flavor mixing angles can all depart from their tree-level results
described by V_TB, among which \theta_12 is most sensitive to such quantum
effects, and the Dirac CP-violating phase can radiatively arise from two
Majorana CP-violating phases. This theoretical scheme offers a new way to
understand why \theta_13 is naturally small and how three CP-violating phases
are presumably correlated.
