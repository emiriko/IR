We argue that soft-collinear effective theory, as is currently formulated,
lacks an ingredient which is essential for obtaining a gauge invariant
definitions of certain non-perturbative matrix elements relevant for
semi-inclusive high-energy processes. Those processes and the companion
cross-sections are to be analyzed and measured at the Large Hadron Collider.
The missing feature is a gauge link constructed only from the transverse
component of the gluon field denoted by the "$T$-Wilson line"'. It is neither
soft nor collinear. As such it is a new feature of the theory.
