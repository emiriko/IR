We study mesoscopic transport in the Q1D wires and rings made of a 2D
conductor of width W and length L >> W. Our aim is to compare an impurity-free
conductor with grain boundaries with a grain-free conductor with impurity
disorder. A single grain boundary is modeled as a set of the
2D-$\delta$-function-like barriers positioned equidistantly on a straight line
and disorder is emulated by a large number of such straight lines, intersecting
the conductor with random orientation in random positions. The impurity
disorder is modeled by the 2D $\delta$-barriers with the randomly chosen
positions and signs. The electron transmission through the wires is calculated
by the scattering-matrix method, and the Landauer conductance is obtained. We
calculate the persistent current in the rings threaded by magnetic flux: We
incorporate into the scattering-matrix method the flux-dependent cyclic
boundary conditions and we introduce a trick allowing to study the persistent
currents in rings of almost realistic size. We mainly focus on the numerical
results for L much larger than the electron mean-free path, when the transport
is diffusive. If the grain boundaries are weakly reflecting, the systems with
grain boundaries show the same (mean) conductance and the same (typical)
persistent current as the systems with impurities, and the results also agree
with the single-particle theories treating disorder as a white-noise-like
potential. If the grain boundaries are strongly reflecting, the typical
persistent currents can be about three times larger than the results of the
white-noise-based theory, thus resembling the experimental results of Jariwala
et al. (PRL 2001). We extend our study to the 3D conductors with columnar
grains. We find that the persistent current exceeds the white-noise-based
result by another one order of magnitude, similarly as in the experiment of
Chandrasekhar et al. (PRL 1991).
