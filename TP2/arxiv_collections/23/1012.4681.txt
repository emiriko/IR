Although the Higgs particle is at the centre-stage of the Standard Model of
particle physics and in many other related models, it has not been
experimentally found so far. One of the major objectives of the Large Hadron
Collider experiments is to detect the Higgs. In this article, we highlight the
problems encountered in the Higgs sector of particle physics and their possible
solutions, with particular emphasis on the Little Higgs Model. We also indicate
the reaction channels by which the Higgs can possibly be found in high energy
accelerator experiments.
