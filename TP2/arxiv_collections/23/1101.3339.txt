We propose a novel algorithm, called REGGAE, for the generation of momenta of
a given sample of particle masses, evenly distributed in Lorentz invariant
phase space and obeying energy and momentum conservation. In comparison to
other existing algorithms, REGGAE is designed for the use in multiparticle
production in hadronic and nuclear collisions where many hadrons are produced
and a large part of the available energy is stored in the form of their masses.
The algorithm uses a loop simulating multiple collisions which lead to
production of configurations with reasonably large weights.
