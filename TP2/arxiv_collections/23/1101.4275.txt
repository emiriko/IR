A graph is k-choosable if it can be colored whenever every vertex has a list
of at least k available colors. We prove that if cycles of length at most four
in a planar graph G are pairwise far apart, then G is 3-choosable. This is
analogous to the problem of Havel regarding 3-colorability of planar graphs
with triangles far apart.
