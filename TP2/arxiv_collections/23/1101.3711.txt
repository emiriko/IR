Using the Lindblad approach we develop a general formalism for theoretical
description of a spatially inhomogeneous bosonic system with dissipation
provided by the interaction of bosons with a phonon bath. We apply our results
to model the dynamics of an interacting one-dimensional polariton system in
real space and time, analyzing in detail the role of polariton-polariton and
polariton-phonon interactions.
