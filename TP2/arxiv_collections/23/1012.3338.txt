Lightning activity on a global scale has been studied season wise using
satellite data for the period from 1998 to 2009. Lightning activity shows an
increasing trend during the period of study which is highly correlated with
atmospheric warming. A similar increasing trend of lightning activity is
observed in the Indian region during the pre-monsoon season which is correlated
with global lightning trends and warming trends of surface temperature in
India.
  Key words: Global warming, lightning activity, Solar cycle changes
