We use scanning SQUID microscopy to investigate the behavior of vortices in
the presence of twin boundaries in the pnictide superconductor
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. We show that the vortices avoid pinning on twin boundaries.
Individual vortices move in a preferential way when manipulated with the SQUID:
they tend to not cross a twin boundary, but rather to move parallel to it. This
behavior can be explained by the observation of enhanced superfluid density on
twin boundaries in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2. The observed repulsion from twin
boundaries may be a mechanism for enhanced critical currents observed in
twinned samples in pnictides and other superconductors.
