We present the current status of two new fully automated reduction and
analysis pipelines, built for the Euler telescope and the CORALIE spectrograph.
Both pipelines have been designed and built independently at the Universidad de
Chile and Universidad Catolica by the two authors. Each pipeline has also been
written on two different platforms, IDL and Python, and both can run fully
automatically through full reduction and analysis of CORALIE datasets. The
reduction goes through all standard steps from bias subtraction, flat-fielding,
scattered light removal, optimal extraction and full wavelength calibration of
the data using well exposed ThAr arc lamps. The reduced data are then
cross-correlated with a binary template matched to the spectral type of each
star and the cross-correlation functions are fit with a Gaussian to extract
precision radial-velocities. For error analysis we are currently testing
bootstrap, jackknifing and cross validation methods to properly determine
uncertainties directly from the data. Our pipelines currently show long term
stability at the 12-15m/s level, measured by observations of two known
radial-velocity standard stars. In the near future we plan to get the stability
down to the 5-6m/s level and also transfer these pipelines to other instruments
like HARPS.
