Portfolio turnpikes state that, as the investment horizon increases, optimal
portfolios for generic utilities converge to those of isoelastic utilities.
This paper proves three kinds of turnpikes. In a general semimartingale
setting, the abstract turnpike states that optimal final payoffs and portfolios
converge under their myopic probabilities. In diffusion models with several
assets and a single state variable, the classic turnpike demonstrates that
optimal portfolios converge under the physical probability; meanwhile the
explicit turnpike identifies the limit of finite-horizon optimal portfolios as
a long-run myopic portfolio defined in terms of the solution of an ergodic HJB
equation.
