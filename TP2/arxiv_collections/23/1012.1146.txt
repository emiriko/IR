High-resolution observations by visible and near-infrared interferometers of
both single stars and binaries have made significant contributions to the
foundations that underpin many aspects of our knowledge of stellar structure
and evolution for cool stars. The CS16 splinter on this topic reviewed
contributions of optical interferometry to date, examined highlights of current
research, and identified areas for contributions with new observational
constraints in the near future.
