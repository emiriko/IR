We examine the visualization of quantum mechanics in phase space by means of
the Wigner function and the Wigner function flow as a complementary approach to
illustrating quantum mechanics in configuration space by wave functions. The
Wigner function formalism resembles the mathematical language of classical
mechanics of non-interacting particles. Thus, it allows a more direct
comparison between classical and quantum dynamical features.
