In this article, we consider for the first time the operations of insertion
and deletion working in a matrix controlled manner. We show that, similarly as
in the case of context-free productions, the computational power is strictly
increased when using a matrix control: computational completeness can be
obtained by systems with insertion or deletion rules involving at most two
symbols in a contextual or in a context-free manner and using only binary
matrices.
