Using ab initio methods we have investigated the fluorination of graphene and
find that different stoichiometric phases can be formed without a nucleation
barrier, with the complete "2D-Teflon" CF phase being thermodynamically most
stable. The fluorinated graphene is an insulator and turns out to be a perfect
matrix-host for patterning nanoroads and quantum dots of pristine graphene. The
electronic and magnetic properties of the nanoroads can be tuned by varying the
edge orientation and width. The energy gaps between the highest occupied and
lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) of quantum dots are
size-dependent and show a confinement typical of Dirac fermions. Furthermore,
we study the effect of different basic coverage of F on graphene (with
stoichiometries CF and C$_{4}$F) on the band gaps, and show the suitability of
these materials to host quantum dots of graphene with unique electronic
properties.
