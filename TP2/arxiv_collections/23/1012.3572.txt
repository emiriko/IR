We fabricated the c axis and ab-plane biaxially aligned Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2
superconductor using a two-step magnetic field procedure. The effect of
magnetic fields on the structure and superconducting properties of
Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 has been investigated by using X-ray diffraction and magnetic
measurements. The degree of orientation of the samples was about 0.39 for the c
axis and 0.51 for ab-plane orientation, as evaluated from the Lotgering factor
of X-ray diffraction. This technology might be useful in a variety of potential
applications, including preparing iron based superconducting bulks and wires
with high critical currents.
