The 2D semimetal consisting of heavy holes and light electrons is studied.
The consideration is based on assumption that electrons are quantized by
magnetic field while holes remain classical. We assume also that the
interaction between components is weak and the conversion between components is
absent. The kinetic equation for holes colliding with quantized electrons is
utilized. It has been stated that the inter-component friction and
corresponding correction to the dissipative conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ {\it do
not vanish at zero temperature} due to degeneracy of the Landau levels. This
correction arises when the Fermi level crosses the Landau level.
  The limits of kinetic equation applicability were found. We also study the
situation of kinetic memory when particles repeatedly return to the points of
their meeting.
