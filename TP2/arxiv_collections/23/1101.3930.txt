We evaluate the electronic transmission and conductance in bilayer graphene
through a finite number of potential barriers. Further, we evaluate the
dispersion relation in a bilayer graphene superlattice with a periodic
potential applied to both layers. As a model we use the tight-binding
Hamiltonian in the continuum approxi- mation. For zero bias the dispersion
relation shows a finite gap for carriers with zero momentum in the direction
parallel to the barriers. This is in contrast to single-layer graphene where no
such gap was found. A gap also appears for a finite bias. Numerical results for
the energy spectrum, conductance, and the density of states are presented and
contrasted with those pertaining to single-layer graphene.
