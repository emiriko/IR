The quasi-periodic doubling cascade is shown to occur in the transition from
regular to weakly turbulent behaviour in simulations of incompressible
Navier-Stokes flow on a three-periodic domain. Special symmetries are imposed
on the flow field in order to reduce the computational effort. Thus we can
apply tools from dynamical systems theory such as continuation of periodic
orbits and computation of Lyapunov exponents. We propose a model ODE for the
quasi-period doubling cascade which, in a limit of a perturbation parameter to
zero, avoids resonance related problems. The cascade we observe in the
simulations is then compared to the perturbed case, in which resonances
complicate the bifurcation scenario. In particular, we compare the frequency
spectrum and the Lyapunov exponents. The perturbed model ODE is shown to be in
good agreement with the simulations of weak turbulence. The scaling of the
observed cascade is shown to resemble the unperturbed case, which is directly
related to the well known doubling cascade of periodic orbits.
