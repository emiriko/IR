Transport process in molecular chain in nonequilibrium stationary state is
theoretically investigated. The molecule is interacting at its both ends with
thermal baths which has different temperatures, while no dissipation mechanism
is contained inside the molecular chain. We have first obtained the
nonequilibrium stationary state outside the Hilbert space in terms of the
complex spectral representation of Liouvillian. The nonequilibrium stationary
state is obtained as an eigenstate of the Liouvillian which is constructed
through the collision invariant of the kinetic equation. The eigenstate of the
Liouvillian contains an information of spatial correlation between the
molecular chain and the thermal baths. While energy flow in the nonequilibrium
state which is due to the first order correlation can be described by Landauer
formula, the particle current due to the second order correlation cannot be
described by the Landauer formula. The present method provides a simple and
perspective way to evaluate the energy transport of molecular chain under the
nonequilibrium situation.
