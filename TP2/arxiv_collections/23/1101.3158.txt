Halo phenomenon in deformed nuclei is studied by using a fully
self-consistent deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model in a spherical
Woods-Saxon basis with the proper asymptotic behavior at large distance from
the nuclear center. Taking a deformed neutron-rich and weakly bound nucleus
$^{44}$Mg as an example and by examining contributions of the halo, deformation
effects, and large spatial extensions, we show a decoupling of the halo
orbitals from the deformation of the core.
