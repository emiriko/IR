We study the zero-temperature properties of the Kondo lattice model within
the dynamical mean-field theory. As impurity solver we use the numerical
renormalization group. We present results for the paramagnetic case showing the
anticipated heavy Fermion physics, including direct evidence for the appearance
of a large Fermi surface for antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Allowing
for the formation of a Neel state, we observe at finite doping an
antiferromagnetic metal below a critical exchange interaction, which shows a
crossover from a local-moment antiferromagnet with a small Fermi surface for
weak exchange coupling to a heavy-fermion antiferromagnet with a large Fermi
surface for increasing exchange. Including lattice degrees of freedom via an
additional Holstein term we observe a significant suppression of the Kondo
effect, leading to strongly reduced lowenergy scale. For too large
electron-phonon coupling we find a complete collaps of the heavy Fermi liquid
and the formation of polarons.
