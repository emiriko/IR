In solid-state circuit QED system, we extend the previous study of generating
and stabilizing two-qubit Bell state [Phys. Rev. A 82, 032335 (2010)], to
three-qubit GHZ state. In dispersive regime, we employ the homodyne joint
readout for multiple qubits to infer the state for further processing, and in
particular use it to stabilize the state directly by means of an
alternate-flip-interrupted Zeno (AFIZ) scheme. Moreover, the state-of-the-art
feedback action based on the filtered current enables not only a deterministic
generation of the pre-GHZ state in the initial stage, but also a fast recovery
from the environment-caused degradation in the later stabilization process. We
show that the proposed scheme can maintain the state with high fidelity if the
efficient quantum measurement and rapid single-qubit rotations are available.
