In this review, I provide an overview of theoretical aspects related to the
evolution of galaxies as a function of environment. I discuss the main physical
processes at play, their characteristic time-scales and environmental
dependency, and comment on their treatment in the framework of hierarchical
galaxy formation models. I briefly summarize recent results and the main open
issues.
