We study a time-reversal invariant non-abelian spin-liquid state in an $SU
(2)$ symmetric spin $S = 1$ quantum magnet on a triangular lattice. The
spin-liquid is obtained by quantum disordering a non-collinear nematic state.
We show that such a spin-liquid cannot be obtained by the standard projective
construction for spin-liquids. We also study phase transition between the
spin-liquid and the non-collinear nematic state and show that it cannot be
described within Landau-Ginzburg- Wilson paradigm.
