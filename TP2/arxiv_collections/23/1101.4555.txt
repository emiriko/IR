We study the communication complexity of symmetric XOR functions, namely
functions $f: \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that can be
formulated as $f(x,y)=D(|x\oplus y|)$ for some predicate $D: \{0,1,...,n\}
\rightarrow \{0,1\}$, where $|x\oplus y|$ is the Hamming weight of the bitwise
XOR of $x$ and $y$. We give a public-coin randomized protocol in the
Simultaneous Message Passing (SMP) model, with the communication cost matching
the known lower bound for the \emph{quantum} and \emph{two-way} model up to a
logarithm factor. As a corollary, this closes a quadratic gap between quantum
lower bound and randomized upper bound for the one-way model, answering an open
question raised in Shi and Zhang \cite{SZ09}.
