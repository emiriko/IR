We study the orbital behavior at the neighborhood of complex unstable
periodic orbits in a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system of galactic type. At a
transition of a family of periodic orbits from stability to complex instability
(also known as Hamiltonian Hopf Bifurcation) the four eigenvalues of the stable
periodic orbits move out of the unit circle. Then the periodic orbits become
complex unstable. In this paper we first integrate initial conditions close to
the ones of a complex unstable periodic orbit, which is close to the transition
point. Then, we plot the consequents of the corresponding orbit in a 4D surface
of section. To visualize this surface of section we use the method of color and
rotation [Patsis and Zachilas 1994]. We find that the consequents are contained
in 2D "confined tori". Then, we investigate the structure of the phase space in
the neighborhood of complex unstable periodic orbits, which are further away
from the transition point. In these cases we observe clouds of points in the 4D
surfaces of section. The transition between the two types of orbital behavior
is abrupt.
