We show how in multi-band materials, the Hund's coupling plays a crucial role
in tuning the degree of electronic correlation. While in half-filled systems it
enhances the correlations, in all other cases it pushes the boundary for the
Mott transition at very high critical couplings. Moreover in weakly-hybridized
non-degenerate systems the Hund's coupling plays the role of band-decoupler,
causing a change from a collective to an individual band behavior, due to the
freezing of orbital fluctuations. In this situation the physics is strongly
dependent on individual filling and electronic structure of each band, and
orbital-selective Mott transitions (or even a cascade of such transitions) are
to be expected. More generally a heavy differentiation in the actual degree of
correlation of different bands arises and the system can show both weakly and
strongly correlated electrons.
