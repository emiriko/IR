Diffusion in the quenched trap model is investigated with an approach we call
weak subordination breaking. We map the problem onto Brownian motion and show
that the operational time is ${\cal S}_\alpha = \sum_{x=-\infty} ^\infty
(n_x)^\alpha$ where $n_x$ is the visitation number at site $x$ . In the limit
of zero temperature we recover the renormalization group (RG) solution found by
Monthus. Our approach is an alternative to RG capable of dealing with any
disorder strength.
