A simple one-dimensional spring-block chain with asymmetric interactions is
considered to model an idealized single-lane highway traffic. The main elements
of the system are blocks (modeling cars), springs with unidirectional
interactions (modeling distance keeping interactions between neighbors), static
and kinetic friction (modeling inertia of drivers and cars) and spatiotemporal
disorder in the values of these friction forces (modeling differences in the
driving attitudes). The traveling chain of cars correspond to the dragged
spring-block system. Our statistical analysis for the spring-block chain
predicts a non-trivial and rich complex behavior. As a function of the disorder
level in the system a dynamic phase-transition is observed. For low disorder
levels uncorrelated slidings of blocks are revealed while for high disorder
levels correlated avalanches dominates.
