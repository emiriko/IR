We study the effect of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction on pairwise
quantum discord, entanglement, and classical correlation in the anisotropic XY
spin-half chain. Analytical expressions for both quantum and classical
correlations are obtained from the spin-spin correlation functions. We show
that these pairwise quantities exhibit various behaviors in relation to the
relative strengths of the DM interaction, the anisotropy and the magnetic
intensity. We observe non-analyticities of the derivatives of both quantum and
classical correlations with respect to the magnetic intensity at the critical
point, with consideration of the DM interaction.
