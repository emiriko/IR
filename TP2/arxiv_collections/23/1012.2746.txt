The injection of a fluid into another of larger viscosity in a Hele-Shaw cell
usually results in the formation of highly branched patterns. Despite the
richness of these structures, in many practical situations such convoluted
shapes are quite undesirable. In this letter we propose an efficient and easily
reproducible way to restrain these instabilities based on a simple piecewise
constant pumping protocol. It results in a reduction in the size of the viscous
fingers by one order of magnitude.
