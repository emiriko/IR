We present boundary-integral simulations of the evolution of critically
charged droplets. For such droplets, small ellipsoidal perturbations are
unstable and eventually lead to the formation of a "lemon"-shaped drop with
very sharp tips. For perfectly conducting drops, the tip forms a self-similar
cone shape with a subtended angle identical to that of a Taylor cone. At the
tip, quantities such and pressure and fluid velocity diverge in time with
power-law scaling. In contrast, when charge transport is described by a finite
conductivity, we find that small progeny drops are formed at the tips whose
size decreases as the conductivity is increased. These small progeny drops are
of nearly critical charge, and are precursors to the emission of a sustained
flow of liquid from the tips as observed in experiments of isolated charged
drops.
