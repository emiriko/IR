In this paper, in the first we give definitions of some classes of division
rings which strictly contain the class of centrally finite division rings. One
of our main purpose is to construct non-trivial examples of rings of new
defined classes. Further, we study linear groups over division rings of these
classes. Our new obtained results generalize precedent results for centrally
finite division rings.
