A potential experimental system, based on the Silicon Nitride (SiN) material,
is proposed to generate steady-state room-temperature optomechanical
entanglement. In the proposed structure, the nanostring interacts dispersively
and reactively with the microdisk cavity via the evanescent field. We study the
role of both dispersive and reactive coupling in generating optomechanical
entanglement, and show that the room-temperature entanglement can be
effectively obtained through the dispersive couplings within the reasonable
experimental parameters. In particular, we find, in the high Temperature ($T$)
and high mechanical qualify factor ($Q_{m}$) limit, the logarithmic
entanglement depends only on the ratio $T/Q_{m}$. This means that improvements
in the material quantity and structure design may lead to more efficient
generation of stationary high-temperature entanglement.
