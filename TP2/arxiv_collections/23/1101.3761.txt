We introduce collaborative tagging and faceted search on structured P2P
systems. Since a trivial and brute force mapping of an entire folksonomy over a
DHT-based system may reduce scalability, we propose an approximated graph
maintenance approach. Evaluations on real data coming from Last.fm prove that
such strategies reduce vocabulary noise (i.e., representation's overfitting
phenomena) and hotspots issues.
