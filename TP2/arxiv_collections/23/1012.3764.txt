We believe the following three ingredients are enough to explain the mystery
of the arrow of time: (1). equations of dynamics of gas molecules, (2). chaotic
instabilities of the equations of dynamics, (3). unavoidable perturbations to
the gas molecules. The level of physical rigor or mathematical rigor that can
be reached for such a theory is unclear.
