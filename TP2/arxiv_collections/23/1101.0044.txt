The Alcubierre spacetime was simulated by means of a Tamm medium which is
asymptotically identical to vacuum and has constitutive parameters which are
ontinuous functions of the spatial coordinates. Accordingly, the Tamm medium is
amenable to physical realization as a nanostructured metamaterial. A
comprehensive characterization of ray trajectories in the Tamm medium was
undertaken, within the geometric-optics regime. Propagation directions
corresponding to evanescent waves were identified: these occur in the region of
the Tamm medium which corresponds to the warp bubble of the Alcubierre
spacetime, especially for directions perpendicular to the velocity of the warp
bubble at high speeds of that bubble. Ray trajectories are acutely sensitive to
the magnitude and direction of the warp bubble's velocity, but rather less
sensitive to the thickness of the transition zone between the warp bubble and
its background. In particular, for rays which travel in the same direction as
the warp bubble, the latter acts as a focusing lens, most notably at high
speeds.
