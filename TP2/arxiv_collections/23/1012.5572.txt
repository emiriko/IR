We propose the multi-state complete-active-space second-order perturbation
theory spin-orbit method (MS-CASPT2-SO) for electronic structure calculations.
It is a two-step spin-orbit coupling method that does not make use of energy
shifts and that intrinsically guarantees the correct characters of the small
space wave functions that are used to calculate the spin-orbit couplings, in
contrast with previous two-step methods.
