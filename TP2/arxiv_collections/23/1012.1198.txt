Several recent measurements of charmed hadron production in deep inelastic
scattering at HERA are reviewed. Cross sections for the production of D mesons
were measured and compared to NLO QCD predictions. The charm contribution to
the inclusive structure function F_{2} was extracted and compared to previous
measurements and theoretical predictions. The reconstruction of decays with a
neutral strange hadron in the final state allowed the measurement of charm
production to be extended into the low transverse momentum region. The fraction
of c quarks hadronising into Lambda_{c}^{+} baryons was extracted using two
different decay modes.
