We calculate the single particle spectral density of a normal
(non-superfluid) two component gas of fermions in the BCS-BEC crossover within
a T-matrix approximation. We review how non-condensed pairs lead to a spectral
density reminiscent of the ordered state, and explore how a gap-like feature in
the spectrum evolves as one changes the polarization of the gas. As the gas is
polarized we find that this pseudogap becomes more diffuse and moves away from
the Fermi level, reflecting the fact that fewer pairs are present but that they
still play an important role in the excitations.
