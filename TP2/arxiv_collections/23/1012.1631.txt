We report on a laser system at a wavelength of 495 nm which is suitable for
the excitations of low lying Rydberg states of rubidium atoms. The system is
based on frequency doubling of a seeded diode laser in a periodically poled
waveguide crystal. We achieve an output power of up to 35 mW and prove the
single frequency performance by direct two photon laser spectroscopy of the
rubidium 14D_5/2 and 14D_3/2 states. The measured fine structure splitting is
consistent with quantum defect theory calculations.
