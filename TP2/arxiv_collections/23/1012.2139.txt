We describe a simple yet rigorous theoretical model capable of analytical
estimation of plasmonic field enhancement in complex metal structures. We show
that one can treat the complex structures as coupled multi-pole modes with
highest enhancements obtained due to superposition of high order modes in small
particles. The model allows one to optimize the structures for the largest
possible field enhancements, which depends on the quality factor Q of the metal
and can be as high as Q^2 for two spherical particles. The "hot spot" can occur
either in the nano-gaps between the particles or near the smaller particles. We
trace the optimum field enhancement mechanism to the fact that the extended
dipole modes of larger particles act as the efficient antennas while the modes
in the gaps or near the smaller particles act as the compact sub-wavelength
cavities. We also show how easily our approach can be extended to incorporate
large numbers of particles in intricate arrangements.
