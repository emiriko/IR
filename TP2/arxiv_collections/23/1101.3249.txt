We consider two classical ensembles of the random matrix theory: the Wigner
matrices and sample covariance matrices, and prove Central Limit Theorem for
linear eigenvalue statistics under rather weak (comparing with results known
before) conditions on the number of derivatives of the test functions and also
on the number of the entries moments. Moreover, we develop a universal method
which allows one to obtain automatically the bounds for the variance of
differentiable test functions, if there is a bound for the variance of the
trace of the resolvent of random matrix. The method is applicable not only to
the Wigner and sample covariance matrices, but to any ensemble of random
matrices.
