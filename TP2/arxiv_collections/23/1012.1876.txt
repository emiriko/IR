We have computed the fate of exoplanet companions around main sequence stars
to explore the frequency of planet ingestion by their host stars during the red
giant branch evolution. Using published properties of exoplanetary systems
combined with stellar evolution models and Zahn's theory of tidal friction, we
modeled the tidal decay of the planets' orbits as their host stars evolve. Most
planets currently orbiting within 2 AU of their star are expected to be
ingested by the end of their stars' red giant branch ascent. Our models confirm
that many transiting planets are sufficiently close to their parent star that
they will be accreted during the main sequence lifetime of the star. We also
find that planet accretion may play an important role in explaining the
mysterious red giant rapid rotators, although appropriate planetary systems do
not seem to be plentiful enough to account for all such rapid rotators. We
compare our modeled rapid rotators and surviving planetary systems to their
real-life counterparts and discuss the implications of this work to the broader
field of exoplanets.
