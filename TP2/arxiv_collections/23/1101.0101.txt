We study the elastic theory of amorphous solids made of particles with finite
range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. For the elastic theory to exist
one requires all the elastic coefficients, linear and nonlinear, to attain a
finite thermodynamic limit. We show that for such systems the existence of
non-affine mechanical responses results in anomalous fluctuations of all the
nonlinear coefficients of the elastic theory. While the shear modulus exists,
the first nonlinear coefficient B_2 has anomalous fluctuations and the second
nonlinear coefficient B_3 and all the higher order coefficients (which are
non-zero by symmetry) diverge in the thermodynamic limit. These results put a
question mark on the existence of elasticity (or solidity) of amorphous solids
at finite strains, even at zero temperature. We discuss the physical meaning of
these results and propose that in these systems elasticity can never be
decoupled from plasticity: the nonlinear response must be very substantially
plastic.
