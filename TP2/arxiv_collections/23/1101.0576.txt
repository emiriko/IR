In a recent paper, Junge and Palazuelos presented two two-player games
exhibiting interesting properties. In their first game, entangled players can
perform notably better than classical players. The quantitative gap between the
two cases is remarkably large, especially as a function of the number of inputs
to the players. In their second game, entangled players can perform notably
better than players that are restricted to using a maximally entangled state
(of arbitrary dimension). This was the first game exhibiting such a behavior.
The analysis of both games is heavily based on non-trivial results from Banach
space theory and operator space theory. Here we present two games exhibiting a
similar behavior, but with proofs that are arguably simpler, using elementary
probabilistic techniques and standard quantum information arguments. Our games
also give better quantitative bounds.
