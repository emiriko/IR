We consider the coupling-strength growth of the Rabi model from the point of
the view of SUSYQM. We show that the Rabi model takes the supersymmetric system
to the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking as its coupling strength g grows
lager from the case g=0 to the case g\approx\infty. We study a kind of
chirality quantum phase transition in this process.
