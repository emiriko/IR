Recent empirical research has indicated that human graph reading performance
improves when crossing angles increase. However, crossing angle has not been
used as an aesthetic criterion for graph drawing algorithms so far. In this
paper, we introduce a force-directed method that aims to construct graph
drawings with large crossing angles. Experiments indicate that our method
significantly increases crossing angles. Surprisingly, the experimental results
further demonstrate that the resulting drawings produced by our method have
fewer edge crossings, a shorter total edge length and more uniform edge
lengths, compared to classical spring algorithms.
