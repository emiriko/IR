Magneto-optical traps on atom chips are usually restricted to small atomic
samples due to a limited capture volume caused primarily by distorted field
configurations. Here we present a magneto-optical trap with minimized
distortions based on a mesoscopic wire structure which provides a loading rate
of 8.4 10^10 atoms/s and a maximum number of 8.7 10^9 captured atoms. The wire
structure is placed outside of the vacuum to enable a further adaptation to new
scientific objectives. Since all magnetic fields are applied locally without
the need for external bias fields, the presented setup will facilitate parallel
generation of Bose-Einstein condensates on a conveyor belt with a cycle rate
above 1 Hz.
