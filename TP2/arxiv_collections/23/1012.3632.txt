The discrete Boltzmann equation for both the ideal and a non-ideal fluid is
extended by adding Langevin noise terms in order to incorporate the effects of
thermal fluctuations. After casting the fluctuating discrete Boltzmann equation
in a form appropriate to the Onsager-Machlup theory of linear fluctuations, the
statistical properties of the noise are determined by invoking a
fluctuation-dissipation theorem at the kinetic level. By integrating the
fluctuating discrete Boltzmann equation, the fluctuating lattice Boltzmann
equation is obtained, which provides an efficient way to solve the equations of
fluctuating hydrodynamics for ideal and non-ideal fluids. Application of the
framework to a generic force-based non-ideal fluid model leads to ideal
gas-type thermal noise. Simulation results indicate proper thermalization of
all degrees of freedom.
