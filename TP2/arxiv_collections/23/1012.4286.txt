The nanocrystallite have the finite number of the oscillation modes. Their
number increases proportionally to a cube of the characteristic size. Thus the
oscillation spectrum of nanocrystal becomes discrete, and the separate modes of
oscillations does not interact with each other, that considerably strengthens
all phonon modulated processes in a crystal. Covering of such a nanocrystallite
with the shielding surface of a material with the higher nuclear weight will
allow to create the phonon resonators whose oscillation modes will represent
the standing waves and, will be amplified by the resonant manner. The
composites made of phonon resonators will allow to produce a perspective
functional material for the electronics with adjustable structure and
properties. Some new mechanism of HTS based on phonon resonators is proposed.
