A review on the two-pion Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry in the
granular source model of quark-gluon plasma droplets is presented. The
characteristic quantities of the granular source extracted by imaging analysis
are presented and compared with the HBT radii obtained by the usual Gaussian
formula fit. The signals of granular sources are presented.
