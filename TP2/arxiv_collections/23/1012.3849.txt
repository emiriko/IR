We propose a model to describe diffractive events in hadron-hadron collisions
where a rapidity gap is surrounded by two jets. The hard color-singlet object
exchanged in the t-channel and responsible for the rapidity gap is described by
the pQCD Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov Pomeron, including corrections due to
next-to-leading logarithms. We allow the rapidity gap to be smaller than the
inter-jet rapidity interval, and the corresponding soft radiation is modeled
using the HERWIG Monte Carlo. Our model is able to reproduce all Tevatron data,
and allows to estimate the jet-gap-jet cross section at the LHC.
