It is of central importance to probe the \emph{local} spectral function
$A(\mathbf{k},\omega)$ of a strongly interacting Fermi gas in a trap. Momentum
resolved rf spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be able to probe the trap
averaged $A(\mathbf{k},\omega)$. However, the usefulness of this technique was
limited by the trap inhomogeneity. Independent of a specific theory, here we
propose that by studying the momentum resolved rf spectra of the minority
fermions of a phase separated, population imbalanced Fermi gas at low
temperature, one can effectively extract $A(\mathbf{k},\omega)$ of a
homogeneous superfluid Fermi gas (at the trap center). In support, we present
calculated spectral functions and spectral intensity maps for various cases
from BCS through BEC regimes using different theories.
