Time-resolved databases with large spatial coverage are quickly becoming a
standard tool for all types of astronomical studies. We report preliminary
results from our search for stellar flares in the 2MASS calibration fields. A
sample of 4343 M dwarfs, spatially matched between the SDSS and the 2MASS
calibration fields, each with hundreds to thousands of epochs in near infrared
bandpasses, is analyzed using a modified Welch-Stetson index to characterize
the variability. A Monte Carlo model was used to assess the noise of the
variability index. We find significnat residuals above the noise with power-law
slopes of -3.37 and -4.05 for our JH and HKs distributions respectively. This
is evidence for flares being observed from M dwarfs in infrared photometry.
