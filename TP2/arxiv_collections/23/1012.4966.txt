A brief review of the status of neutrino oscillations is given. The
phenomenology of neutrino mixing and the standard seesaw mechanism of neutrino
mass generation is discussed. Different approaches to neutrino oscillations are
considered and compared. The role of the Heisenberg space-momentum uncertainty
relation and the Mandelstam-Tamm time-energy uncertainty relation in neutrino
oscillations is discussed in some detail.
