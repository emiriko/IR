We investigate decoherence induced by a quantum channel in terms of minimal
output entropy and of map entropy. The latter is the von Neumann entropy of the
Jamiolkowski state of the channel. Both quantities admit q-Renyi versions. We
prove additivity of the map entropy for all q. For the case q = 2, we show that
the depolarizing channel has the smallest map entropy among all channels with a
given minimal output Renyi entropy of order two. This allows us to characterize
pairs of channels such that the output entropy of their tensor product acting
on a maximally entangled input state is larger than the sum of the minimal
output entropies of the individual channels. We conjecture that for any channel
{\Phi}1 acting on a finite dimensional system there exists a class of channels
{\Phi}2 sufficiently close to a unitary map such that additivity of minimal
output entropy for {\Psi}1 x {\Psi}2 holds.
