We report measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power
spectrum from the complete 2008 South Pole Telescope (SPT) data set. We analyze
twice as much data as the first SPT power spectrum analysis, using an improved
cosmological parameter estimator which fits multi-frequency models to the SPT
150 and $220\,$GHz bandpowers. We find an excellent fit to the measured
bandpowers with a model that includes lensed primary CMB anisotropy, secondary
thermal (tSZ) and kinetic (kSZ) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich anisotropies, unclustered
synchrotron point sources, and clustered dusty point sources. In addition to
measuring the power spectrum of dusty galaxies at high signal-to-noise, the
data primarily constrain a linear combination of the kSZ and tSZ anisotropy
contributions at $150\,$GHz and $\ell=3000$: $D^{tSZ}_{3000} +
0.5\,D^{kSZ}_{3000} = 4.5\pm 1.0 \,\mu{\rm K}^2$. The 95% confidence upper
limits on secondary anisotropy power are $D^{tSZ}_{3000} < 5.3\,\mu{\rm K}^2$
and $D^{kSZ}_{3000} < 6.5\,\mu{\rm K}^2$. We also consider the potential
correlation of dusty and tSZ sources, and find it incapable of relaxing the tSZ
upper limit. These results increase the significance of the lower than expected
tSZ amplitude previously determined from SPT power spectrum measurements. We
find that models including non-thermal pressure support in groups and clusters
predict tSZ power in better agreement with the SPT data. Combining the tSZ
power measurement with primary CMB data halves the statistical uncertainty on
$\sigma_8$. However, the preferred value of $\sigma_8$ varies significantly
between tSZ models. Improved constraints on cosmological parameters from tSZ
power spectrum measurements require continued progress in the modeling of the
tSZ power.
