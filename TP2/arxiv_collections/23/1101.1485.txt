We present two recent results obtained by the CDF collaboration at the
Tevatron collider. New Cabibbo suppresed B_s decay modes have been observed
using 5.9 inverse fb of data: B_s-> J/psi Ks and B_s->J/psi K*0. We report also
on masurement of the ratios of the branching ratios (BR) of the new modes to
those of the B^0-meson to the same final states:
  BR(B_s->J/psi K*0)/BR(B^0->J/psi K*0) = 0.062 \pm 0.009 (stat.) \pm 0.025
(sys.) \pm 0.008 (frag.)
  and
  BR(B_s->J/psi Ks)/BR(B^0->J/psi Ks) = 0.041 \pm 0.007 (stat.) \pm 0.004
(sys.) \pm 0.005 (frag.).
  Then we discuss the first polarization measurement in a charmless B_s decay
in two light vector mesons, B_s->phi phi, using 2.9 \inverse fb of data. An
angular analysis of the final state particles allows CDF to determine a
longitudinal polarization fraction f_L = 0.348 \pm 0.041 (stat.) \pm 0.021
(syst.), which is inconsistent with na\"{\i}ve expectations based on the V-A
nature of weak currents and confirms the pattern of lower than expected
longitudinal polarization fraction in b to s penguin dominated B->VV decays.
Finally, an updated measurement of the ratio of B_s->phi phi BR to that of the
reference B_s->J/psi phi mode is also presented:
  BR (B_s->phi phi)/BR(B_s->J/psi phi) = [1.78 \pm 0.14 (stat.) \pm 0.20 (
syst.)] \cdot 10 ^ {-2}.
