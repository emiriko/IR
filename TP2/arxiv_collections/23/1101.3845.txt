We propose a new method to study mixed symmetric multiplets of baryons in the
context of the $1/N_c$ expansion approach. The simplicity of the method allows
to better understand the role of various operators acting on spin and flavour
degrees of freedom. The method is tested on two and three flavours. It is shown
that the spin and flavour operators proportional to the quadratic invariants of
SU$_S$(2) and SU$_F$(3) respectively are dominant in the mass formula.
