We present a new model for distributed shared memory systems, based on remote
data accesses. Such features are offered by network interface cards that allow
one-sided operations, remote direct memory access and OS bypass. This model
leads to new interpretations of distributed algorithms allowing us to propose
an innovative detection technique of race conditions only based on logical
clocks. Indeed, the presence of (data) races in a parallel program makes it
hard to reason about and is usually considered as a bug.
