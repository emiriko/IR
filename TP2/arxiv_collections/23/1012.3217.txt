Electrostatic properties of two-dimensional nanosystems can be described by
their geometry resonances. In this paper we prove that these modes as well as
the corresponding eigenvalues are invariant under any conformal transformation.
This invariance further leads to a new way to studying the transformed
structures. Namely, transforming a geometry is equivalent to modifying the
strengths of these invariant eigenmodes excited by the external excitations.
