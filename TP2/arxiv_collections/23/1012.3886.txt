We determine the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon using the framework of Dyson-Schwinger
and Bethe-Salpeter equations of QCD. Our result for the pseudoscalar ($\pi^0,
\eta, \eta'$) meson exchange diagram is commensurate with previous
calculations. In our calculation of the quark loop contribution we improve
previous approaches by implementing constraints due to gauge invariance. As a
consequence, our value $a_\mu^{\textrm{LBL;quarkloop}} = (136 \pm 59)\times
10^{-11}$ is significantly larger. Taken at face value, this then leads to a
revised estimate of the total $a_\mu=116\,591\,891.0(105.0)\times 10^{-11}$.
