The Use Case Maps (UCM) scenario notation is applicable to many requirements
engineering activities. However, other scenario notations, such as Message
Sequence Charts (MSC) and UML Sequence Diagrams (SD), have shown to be better
suited for detailed design. In order to use the notation that is best
appropriate for each phase in an efficient manner, a mechanism has to be
devised to automatically transfer the knowledge acquired during the
requirements analysis phase (using UCM) to the design phase (using MSC or SD).
This paper introduces UCMEXPORTER, a new tool that implements such a mechanism
and reduces the gap between high-level requirements and detailed design.
UCMEXPORTER automatically transforms individual UCM scenarios to UML Sequence
Diagrams, MSC scenarios, and even TTCN-3 test skeletons. We highlight the
current capabilities of the tool as well as architectural solutions addressing
the main challenges faced during such transformation, including the handling of
concurrent scenario paths, the generation of customized messages, and tool
interoperability.
