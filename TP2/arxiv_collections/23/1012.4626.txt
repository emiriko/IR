In this paper, a new chaotic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is
proposed. It combines the well-known ISAAC and XORshift generators with chaotic
iterations. This PRNG possesses important properties of topological chaos and
can successfully pass NIST and TestU01 batteries of tests. This makes our
generator suitable for information security applications like cryptography. As
an illustrative example, an application in the field of watermarking is
presented.
