A recent Letter attempted to reconcile the disagreement between neutron
resonance data and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, a new formula was
derived for transforming measured ({\Gamma}_{{\lambda}n}) to reduced
({\Gamma}_{{\lambda}n}^0) neutron widths for s-wave resonances
({\lambda}=1,2,...) in nuclides near peaks of the s-wave neutron strength
function. In this Comment, we show that such a rescaling would not, in general,
be expected to reconcile the type of disagreement observed, and demonstrate
that indeed it does not for the specific cases in question. Hence, the
disagreements between RMT and these data remain.
