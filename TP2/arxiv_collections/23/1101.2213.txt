The synchronization of loosely coupled chaotic oscillators, a phenomenon
investigated intensively for the last two decades, may realize the
philosophical notion of synchronicity. Effectively unpredictable chaotic
systems, coupled through only a few variables, commonly exhibit a predictable
relationship that can be highly intermittent. We argue that the phenomenon
closely resembles the notion of meaningful synchronicity put forward by Jung
and Pauli if one identifies "meaningfulness" with internal synchronization,
since the latter seems necessary for synchronizability with an external system.
Jungian synchronization of mind and matter is realized if mind is analogized to
a computer model, synchronizing with a sporadically observed system as in
meteorological data assimilation. Internal synchronization provides a recipe
for combining different models of the same objective process, a configuration
that may also describe the functioning of conscious brains. In contrast to
Pauli's view, recent developments suggest a materialist picture of
semi-autonomous mind, existing alongside the observed world, with both
exhibiting a synchronistic order. Basic physical synchronicity is manifest in
the non-local quantum connections implied by Bell's theorem. The quantum world
resides on a generalized synchronization "manifold", a view that provides a
bridge between nonlocal realist interpretations and local realist
interpretations that constrain observer choice .
