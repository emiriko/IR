Porous sediments in geological systems are exposed to stress by the
above-laying mass and consequent compaction, which may be significantly
nonuniform across the massif. We derive scaling laws for the compaction of
sediments of similar geological origin. With these laws, we evaluate the
dependence of the transport properties of a fluid-saturated porous medium
(permeability, effective molecular diffusivity, hydrodynamic dispersion,
electrical and thermal conductivities) on its porosity. In particular, we
demonstrate that the assumption of a uniform geothermal gradient is not
adequate for systems with nonuniform compaction and show the importance of the
derived scaling laws for mathematical modelling of methane hydrate deposits;
these deposits are believed to have potential for impact on global climate
change and Glacial-Interglacial cycles.
