Rewriting systems are often defined as binary relations over a given set of
objects. This simple definition is used to describe various properties of
rewriting such as termination, confluence, normal forms etc. In this paper, we
introduce a new notion of abstract rewriting in the framework of categories.
Then, we define the functoriality property of rewriting systems. This property
is sometimes called vertical composition. We show that most of graph
transformation systems are functorial and provide a counter-example of graph
transformation systems which is not functorial.
