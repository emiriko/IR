We report results for the ground-state energy and structural properties of
small $^4$He-T$\downarrow$ clusters consisting of up to 4 T$\downarrow$ and 8
$^4$He atoms. These results have been obtained using very well-known
$^4$He-$^4$He and T$\downarrow$-T$\downarrow$ interaction potentials and
several models for the $^4$He-T$\downarrow$ interatomic potential. All the
calculations have been performed with variational and diffusion Monte Carlo
methods. It takes at least three atoms to form a mixed bound state. In
particular, for small clusters the binding energies are significantly affected
by the precise form of the $^4$He-T$\downarrow$ interatomic potential but the
stability limits remain unchanged. The only exception is the
$^4$He$_2$T$\downarrow$ trimer whose stability in the case of the weakest
$^4$He-T$\downarrow$ interaction potential is uncertain, while it seems stable
for other potentials. The mixed trimer $^4$He(T$\downarrow$)$_2$, a candidate
for Borromean state, is not bound. All other studied clusters are stable. Some
of the weakest bound clusters can be classified as quantum halos, as a
consequence of having high probability of being in a classically forbidden
region.
