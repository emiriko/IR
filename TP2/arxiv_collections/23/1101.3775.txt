Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth is reported experimentally as the growth mode
that is responsible for the transition to three dimensional islands in
heteroepitaxial growth. A kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model is proposed that can
replicate many of the experimentally observed features of this growth mode.
Simulations reveal that this model effectively captures the SK transition and
subsequent growth. Annealing simulations demonstrate that the wetting layer
formed during SK growth is stable, with entropy playing a key role in its
stability. It is shown that this model also captures the apparent critical
thickness that tends to occur at higher deposition rates and for alloy films
(where intermixing is significant). This work shows that the wetting layer
thickness increases with increasing temperature, whereas the apparent critical
thickness decreases with increasing temperature. Both of which are in agreement
with experiments.
