We investigate theoretically the electron spin relaxation in single-electron
nanowire-based semiconductor double quantum dots induced by confined phonons
and find that the electron spin relaxation rate can be efficiently manipulated
by external electric fields in such system. An anti-crossing, due to the
coaction of the electric field, the magnetic field and the spin-orbit coupling,
exists between the lowest two excited states. Both energies and spins of the
electron states can be efficiently tuned by the electric field around the
anti-crossing point. Multiple sharp peaks exist in the electric-field
dependence of the spin relaxation rate induced by the confined phonons, which
can be ascribed to the large density of states of the confined phonons at the
van Hove singularities. This feature suggests that the nanowire-based double
quantum dots can be used as electric tunable on-and-off spin switches, which
are more sensitive and flexible than the ones based on quantum-well based
double quantum dots. The temperature dependence of the spin relaxation rate at
the anti-crossing point are calculated and a smooth peak, indicating the
importance of the contribution of the off-diagonal elements of the density
matrix to the spin relaxation, is observed.
