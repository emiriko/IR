We calculate the differential cross section for the unpolarized
semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process $e^-+N \to e^-+q+X$
in leading order (LO) of perturbative QCD and up to twist-4 in power
corrections and study in particular the azimuthal asymmetry $<cos2\phi>$. The
final results are expressed in terms of transverse momentum dependent (TMD)
parton matrix elements of the target nucleon up to twist-4. %Under the maximal
two-gluon correlation approximation, these TMD parton matrix elements in a
nucleus %can be expressed terms of a Gaussian convolution of that in a nucleon
with the width given by the jet transport %parameter inside cold nuclei. We
also apply it to $e^-+A \to e^-+q+X$ and illustrate numerically the nuclear
dependence of the azimuthal asymmetry $<cos2\phi>$ by using a Gaussian ansatz
for the TMD parton matrix elements.
