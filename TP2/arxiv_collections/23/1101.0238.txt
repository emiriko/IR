The occupation of d-orbitals controls the magnitude and anisotropy of the
inter-atomic electron transfer in transition metal oxides and hence exerts a
key influence on their chemical bonding and physical properties. Atomic-scale
modulations of the orbital occupation at surfaces and interfaces are believed
to be responsible for massive variations of the magnetic and transport
properties, but could thus far not be probed in a quantitative manner. Here we
show that it is possible to derive quantitative, spatially resolved orbital
polarization profiles from soft x-ray reflectivity data, without resorting to
model calculations. We demonstrate that the method is sensitive enough to
resolve differences of 3 % in the occupation of Ni e_g orbitals in adjacent
atomic layers of a LaNiO3-LaAlO3 superlattice, in good agreement with ab-initio
electronic-structure calculations. The possibility to quantitatively correlate
theory and experiment on the atomic scale opens up many new perspectives for
orbital physics in d-electron materials.
