The features of superfluid-Mott insulator phase transition in the array of
dissipative cavities is analyzed. Employing a kind of quasi-boson and a
mean-filed approach, we show analytically how dissipation and decoherence
influence the critical behaviors and the time evolution of the system. We find
that there is a localized tendency, which could lead to the break of
superfluidity for a superfluid state and suppress the appearance of the
long-range order form a Mott state. Eventually, a collection of mixture states
localized on each site will arise.
