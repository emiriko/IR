The dynamics of a one dimensional Ising spin system is investigated using
three families of local update rules, the Galam majority rules, Glauber inflow
influences and Sznadj outflow drives. Given an initial density p of up spins
the probability to reach a final state with all spins up is calculated exactly
for each choice. The various formulas are compared to a series of previous
calculations obtained analytically using the Kirkwood approximation. They turn
out to be identical. The apparent discrepancy with the Galam unifying frame is
addressed. The difference in the results seems to stem directly from the
implementation of the local update rule used to perform the associated
numerical simulations. The findings lead to view the non stepwise exit
probability as an artifact of the one dimensional finite size system with fixed
spins. The suitability and the significance to perform numerical simulations to
model social behavior without solid constraints is discussed and the question
of what it means to have a mean field result in this context is addressed.
