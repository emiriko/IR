We discuss extension of soliton theories and integrable systems into
noncommutative spaces. In the framework of noncommutative integrable hierarchy,
we give infinite conserved quantities and exact soliton solutions for many
noncommutative integrable equations, which are represented in terms of
Strachan's products and quasi-determinants, respectively. We also present a
relation to an noncommutative anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation, and make
comments on how "integrability" should be considered in noncommutative spaces.
