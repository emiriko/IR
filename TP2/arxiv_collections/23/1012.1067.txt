It is well-known that the speed $c_u=1/\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}$ is obtained in
the process of defining SI units via action-at-a-distance forces, like the
force between two static charges and the force between two long and parallel
currents. The speed $c_u$ is then physically different from the observed speed
of propagation $c$ associated with electromagnetic waves in vacuum. However,
repeated experiments have led to the numerical equality $c_u=c,$ which we have
called the $c$ equivalence principle. In this paper we point out that
$\nabla\times{\bf E}=-[1/(\epsilon_0\mu_0 c^2)]\partial{\bf B}/\partial t$ is
the correct form of writing Faraday's law when the $c$ equivalence principle is
not assumed. We also discuss the covariant form of Maxwell's equations without
assuming the $c$ equivalence principle.
