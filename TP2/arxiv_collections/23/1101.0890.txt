To suppress decoherence of solid-state qubits which are coupled to the
non-Markovian noises, we propose a strategy to couple the qubit with a chaotic
device, of which the broad power distribution in the high-frequency domain can
be used to freeze the noises just like the dynamical decoupling control (DDC)
method. Compared with the DDC, high-frequency components can be generated by
the chaotic device even driven by a low-frequency field and we do not need to
optimize the control fields to generate complex control pulses. As an
application to superconducting circuits, we find that various noises in a wide
frequency domain, including low-frequency $1/f$, high-frequency Ohmic,
sub-Ohmic, and super-Ohmic noises, can be efficiently suppressed by coupling
the qubit to a Duffing oscillator, and the decoherence rate of the qubit is
efficiently decreased for about 100 times in magnitude.
