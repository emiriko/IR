Results of Co and Ni substituted AlN in the zinc blende phase are presented.
For spin up states the hybridized N-2p and Co/Ni-3d states form the valance
bands with a bandgap around the Fermi level for both materials, while in the
case of the spin down states the hybridized states cross the Fermi level and
hence show metallic nature. It is found that, Al0.75Co0.25N and Al0.75Ni0.25N
are ferromagnetic materials with magnetic moments of 4 {\mu}B and 3 {\mu}B
respectively. The integer magnetic moments and the full spin polarization at
the Fermi level make these compounds half-metallic semiconductors. Furthermore
it is also found that the interaction with the N-2p state splits the 5-fold
degenerate Co/Ni-3d states into t2g and eg states. The t2g states are located
at higher energies than the eg states caused by the tetrahedral symmetry of
these compounds.
