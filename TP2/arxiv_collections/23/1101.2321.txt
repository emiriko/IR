This paper describes research on the technological evolution of glazed
ceramics with a metallic lustre decoration starting from their emergence in the
Near East until the Hispano-Moresque productions. That research covers the main
known Islamic production sites and periods: Abbasid (Mesopotamia); Fatimid
(Egypt); Timurid, Mongol, and Safavid (Iran); Ayyubid and Mamluk (Syria);
Nasrid and Hispano-Moresque (Spain). It was allowed by the access to more than
hundred full preserved objects or fragments supplied by French national museums
(Mus\'ee du Louvre DAI, Mus\'ee national du Moyen Age, Mus\'ee national de
C\'eramique). The characterisation of the composition and structure of the
ceramics and of their decoration is mostly done through non-destructive
analyses methods. The thickness and metal content of the surface lustre layers
are quantified thanks to ion beam analyses performed on a particle accelerator:
PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission) for the terracotta and glazes
composition and RBS (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry) for the thickness
and metal content of the lustre surface layers. The preliminary results show
that the features of the decorated ceramics have undergone dramatic variations
when transmitted from a production to another, not only, as expected, in the
composition of terracotta and glazes, but also in the thickness, the structure
and the composition distribution of the lustre layers.
