We present high angular resolution Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Combined
Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) observations of two
GLIMPSE Extended Green Objects (EGOs)--massive young stellar object (MYSO)
outflow candidates identified based on their extended 4.5 micron emission in
Spitzer images. The mm observations reveal bipolar molecular outflows, traced
by high-velocity 12CO(2-1) and HCO+(1-0) emission, coincident with the 4.5
micron lobes in both sources. SiO(2-1) emission confirms that the extended 4.5
micron emission traces active outflows. A single dominant outflow is identified
in each EGO, with tentative evidence for multiple flows in one source
(G11.92-0.61). The outflow driving sources are compact millimeter continuum
cores, which exhibit hot-core spectral line emission and are associated with
6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers. G11.92-0.61 is associated with at least three
compact cores: the outflow driving source, and two cores that are largely
devoid of line emission. In contrast, G19.01-0.03 appears as a single MYSO. The
difference in multiplicity, the comparative weakness of its hot core emission,
and the dominance of its extended envelope of molecular gas all suggest that
G19.01-0.03 may be in an earlier evolutionary stage than G11.92-0.61. Modeling
of the G19.01-0.03 spectral energy distribution suggests that a central
(proto)star (M ~10 Msun) has formed in the compact mm core (Mgas ~ 12-16 Msun),
and that accretion is ongoing at a rate of ~10^-3 solar masses per year. Our
observations confirm that these EGOs are young MYSOs driving massive bipolar
molecular outflows, and demonstrate that considerable chemical and evolutionary
diversity are present within the EGO sample.
