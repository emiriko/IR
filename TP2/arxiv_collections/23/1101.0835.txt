We consider two classes of supersymmetric flipped SU(5) models with gravity
mediated supersymmetry breaking such that the thermal neutralino relic
abundance provides the observed dark matter density in the universe. We
estimate the muon flux induced by neutrinos that arise from neutralino
annihilations in the Sun and discuss prospects for detecting this flux in the
IceCube/Deep Core experiment. We also provide comparisons with the
corresponding fluxes in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model
and non-universal Higgs models. Regions in the parameter space that can be
explored by the IceCube/DeepCore experiment are identified.
