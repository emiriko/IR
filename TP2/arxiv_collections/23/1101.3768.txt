We investigate the possibility of correcting errors occurring on a
multipartite system through a feedback mechanism that acquires information from
partial access to the environment. A partial control scheme of this kind might
be useful when dealing with correlated errors. In fact, in such a case, it
could be enough to gather local information to decide what kind of global
recovery to perform. Then, we apply this scheme to the depolarizing and
correlated errors, and quantify its performance by means of the entanglement
fidelity.
