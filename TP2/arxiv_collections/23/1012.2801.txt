We give a list of finite groups containing all finite groups $G$ such that
the group of units $\Z G^*$ of the integral group ring $\Z G$ is subgroup
separable. There are only two types of these groups $G$ for which we cannot
decide wether $ZG^*$ is subgroup separable, namely the central product $Q_8 Y
D_8$ and $Q_8\times C_p{with} p \text{prime and} p\equiv -1 \mod (8)$.
