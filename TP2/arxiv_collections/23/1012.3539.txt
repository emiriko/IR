Comparing K+ spectra at low transverse momenta for different symmetric
collision systems at beam energies around 1 AGeV allows for a direct
determination of both the strength of the K+ nucleus potential as well as of
the K+N rescattering cross section in a hadronic environment. Other little
known or unknown quantities which enter the K+ dynamics, like the production
cross sections of K+ mesons or the hadronic equation of state, do not spoil
this signal as they cancel by using ratios of spectra. This procedure is based
on transport model calculations using the Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics
(IQMD) model which describes the available data quantitatively.
