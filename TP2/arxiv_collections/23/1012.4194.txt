The surveillance, analysis and ultimately the efficient long-term prediction
and control of epidemic dynamics appear to be one of the major challenges
nowadays. Detailed atomistic mathematical models play an important role towards
this aim. In this work it is shown how one can exploit the Equation Free
approach and optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing to bridge
detailed individual-based epidemic simulation with coarse-grained,
systems-level, analysis. The methodology provides a systematic approach for
analyzing the parametric behavior of complex/ multi-scale epidemic simulators
much more efficiently than simply simulating forward in time. It is shown how
steady state and (if required) time-dependent computations, stability
computations, as well as continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis can be
performed in a straightforward manner. The approach is illustrated through a
simple individual-based epidemic model deploying on a random regular connected
graph. Using the individual-based microscopic simulator as a black box
coarse-grained timestepper and with the aid of Simulated Annealing I compute
the coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of
the stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures
at the macroscopic level under a pairwise representation perspective.
