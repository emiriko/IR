We develop a theoretical description of interaction-induced phenomena in an
electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer formed by integer quantum Hall edge
states (with \nu =1 and 2 channels) out of equilibrium. Using the
non-equilibrium functional bosonization framework, we derive an effective
action which contains all the physics of the problem. We apply the theory to
the model of a short-range interaction and to a more realistic case of
long-range Coulomb interaction. The theory takes into account
interaction-induced effects of dispersion of plasmons, charging, and
decoherence. In the case of long-range interaction we find a good agreement
between our theoretical results for the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations and experimental data.
