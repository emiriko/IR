Probably the most famous of Grothendieck's contributions to Banach space
theory is the result that he himself described as "the fundamental theorem in
the metric theory of tensor products". That is now commonly referred to as
"Grothendieck's theorem" (GT in short), or sometimes as "Grothendieck's
inequality". This had a major impact first in Banach space theory (roughly
after 1968), then, later on, in $C^*$-algebra theory, (roughly after 1978).
More recently, in this millennium, a new version of GT has been successfully
developed in the framework of "operator spaces" or non-commutative Banach
spaces. In addition, GT independently surfaced in several quite unrelated
fields:\ in connection with Bell's inequality in quantum mechanics, in graph
theory where the Grothendieck constant of a graph has been introduced and in
computer science where the Grothendieck inequality is invoked to replace
certain NP hard problems by others that can be treated by "semidefinite
programming" and hence solved in polynomial time. In this expository paper, we
present a review of all these topics, starting from the original GT. We
concentrate on the more recent developments and merely outline those of the
first Banach space period since detailed accounts of that are already
available, for instance the author's 1986 CBMS notes.
