By identifying a bosonic consistent truncation from the 1/4-BPS wrapped
M5-brane geometry of Maldacena, Strominger and Witten in D = 11 supergravity
and finding a supersymmetric extension, we recover an N = 2 D = 3 supergravity
theory. Reductions of a large class of supersymmetric solutions corresponding
to wrapped M2 and M5-branes lead to black strings and warped AdS3 solutions
preserving supersymmetry. With a view to AdS/CMT applications, we also
construct a numerical hairy BTZ black hole and, as a preliminary step in this
direction, determine the conductivity of the dual CFT.
