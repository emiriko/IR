The suitable interpolation between classical percolation and a special
variant of explosive percolation enables the explicit realization of a
tricritical percolation point. With high-precision simulations of the order
parameter and the second moment of the cluster size distribution a fully
consistent tricritical scaling scenario emerges yielding the tricritical
crossover exponent $1/\phi_t=1.8\pm0.1$.
