We investigate the photon emission in coupled quantum dots based on symmetry
considerations. With the help of a new theorem we proved, we reveal the origin
of the various emission patterns, which is the combinative symmetry in the time
domain and spectrum domain. We are able to tailor the emission patterns and
obtain emission spectra with odd harmonics only, even harmonics only, both odd
and even harmonic components, or even the quenching of all components. These
interesting emission patterns can be obtained in experiments by careful design
of the nanostructures, which are of many applications in optical-electric
nanodevices.
