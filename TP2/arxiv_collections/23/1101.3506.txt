A recent reanalysis of world proton and deuteron structure function
measurements showed that a significant amount of the apparent model dependence
in the extraction of the neutron structure function was related to
inconsistencies between the kinematics of the data and those assumed for the
calculation, suggesting that the true model dependence is smaller than commonly
believed. We present a detailed comparison of the neutron structure function as
extracted using different models, with care taken to ensure that all other
aspects of the comparison are done consistently. The neutron structure function
is extracted using a fit to these data evaluated at fixed Q^2_0=16 GeV^2. We
compare the results obtained using a variety of N--N potentials and deuteron
binding models to determine the model dependence of the extraction. As in the
recent extraction, F_{2n}/F_{2p} falls with x with no sign of plateau and
follows the low edge of the wide range of earlier F_{2n} extractions. The
model-dependent uncertainty in F_{2n}/F_{2p} is shown to be considerably
smaller than previously believed, particularly at large-x.
