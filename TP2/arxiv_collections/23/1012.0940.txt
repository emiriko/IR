The heliosphere is predominantly a partially ionized plasma that consists of
electrons, ions and significant neutral atoms. Nonlinear interactions amongst
these species take place through direct collision or charge exchange processes.
These interactions modify linear and non linear properties of the plasma. In
this work, we develop a one dimensional linear theory to investigate linear
instabilities in such system. In our model, the electrons and ions are
described by a single fluid compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and
are coupled self-consistently to the neutral fluid via compressible
hydrodynamic equations. The coupling is mediated by the charge exchange
process. Based on our self-consistent analysis, we find that the charge
exchange coupling is more effective at larger length scales, and Alfv\'en waves
are not affected by the charge exchange coupling. By contrast, the fast and
slow waves are driven linearly unstable.
