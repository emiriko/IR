LHCb has started its charm physics programme using the data taken at the LHC.
The first measurements of open charm production cross-sections for proton
proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7 \tev$ are presented. The cross-sections of the
\PDzero, $\PDstar^+$, \PDplus, and \PDsplus mesons are found to be in broad
agreement with theory predictions. The prospects for measurements of charm
mixing, CP and T violation in decays of neutral \PD mesons at LHCb are
discussed. Furthermore, plans for CP violation measurements using charged \PD
mesons are presented. Most analyses are expected to yield results improving the
current world averages based on the data expected to be taken in 2011.
