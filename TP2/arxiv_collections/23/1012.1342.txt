Event-by-event hydrodynamics, with fluctuating initial conditions, has shown
to nicely reproduce several features of experimentally observed quantities in
high-energy nuclear collisions. Here we discuss how it may help to understand,
in a unified way, the various structures observed in the long-range
two-particle correlations, both in nucleus-nucleus and p-p collisions.
Suggestions of how experimentally this description could be tested are also
discussed.
