We study the geometry and topology of Riemannian 3-orbifolds which are
locally volume collapsed with respect to a curvature scale. We show that a
sufficiently collapsed closed 3-orbifold without bad 2-suborbifolds either
admits a metric of nonnegative sectional curvature or satisfies Thurston's
Geometrization Conjecture. We also prove a version with boundary. Kleiner and
Lott independently proved similar results.
