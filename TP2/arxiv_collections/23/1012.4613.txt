In this paper, we analyze, by using a matrix approach, the dynamics of a
non-relativistic particle in presence of a quaternionic potential barrier. The
matrix method used to solve the quaternionic Schrodinger equation allows to
obtain a closed formula for the transmission coefficient. Up to now, in
quaternionic quantum mechanics, almost every discussion on the dynamics of
non-relativistic particle was motived by or evolved from numerical studies. A
closed formula for the transmission coefficient stimulates an analysis of
qualitative differences between complex and quaternionic quantum mechanics,
and, by using the stationary phase method, gives the possibility to discuss
transmission times.
