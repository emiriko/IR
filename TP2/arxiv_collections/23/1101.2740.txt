Arbitrary amplitude ion-acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) are studied using
Sagdeev-Potential approach in electron-positron-ion plasma with
ultra-relativistic or non-relativistic degenerate electrons and positrons and
the matching criteria of existence of such solitary waves are numerically
investigated. It has been shown that the relativistic degeneracy of electrons
and positrons has significant effects on the amplitude and the Mach-number
range of IASWs. Also it is remarked that only compressive IASWs can propagate
in both non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic degenerate plasmas.
