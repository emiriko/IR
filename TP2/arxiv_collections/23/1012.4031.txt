A search for pair production of first-generation scalar leptoquarks is
performed in the final state containing two electrons and two jets using
proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s)=7 TeV. The data sample used corresponds
to an integrated luminosity of 33 inverse picobarns collected with the CMS
detector at the CERN LHC. The number of observed events is in good agreement
with the predictions for the standard model background processes, and an upper
limit is set on the leptoquark pair production cross section times beta^2 as a
function of the leptoquark mass, where beta is the branching fraction of the
leptoquark decay to an electron and a quark. A 95% confidence level lower limit
is set on the mass of a first-generation scalar leptoquark at 384 GeV for
beta=1, which is the most stringent direct limit to date.
