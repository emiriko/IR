We establish a Large Deviations Principle for stochastic processes with
Lipschitz continuous oblique reflections on regular domains. The rate
functional is given as the value function of a control problem and is proved to
be good. The proof is based on an original viscosity solution approach. The
idea consists in interpreting the probabilities as the solutions of some PDEs,
make the logarithmic transform, pass to the limit, and then identify the action
functional as the solution of the limiting equation.
