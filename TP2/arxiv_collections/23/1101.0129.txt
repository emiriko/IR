It remains an open question whether the apparent additional power of quantum
computation derives inherently from quantum mechanics, or merely from the
flexibility obtained by "lifting" Boolean functions to linear operators and
evaluating their composition cleverly. Holographic algorithms provide a useful
avenue for exploring this question. We describe a new, simplified construction
of holographic algorithms in terms of Pfaffian circuits. Novel proofs of some
key results are provided, and we extend the approach of [34] to nonsymmetric,
odd, and homogenized signatures, circuits, and various models of execution
flow. This shows our approach is as powerful as the matchgate approach.
Holographic algorithms provide in general $O(n^{\omega_p})$ time algorithms,
where $\omega_p$ is the order of Pfaffian evaluation in the ring of interest
(with $1.19 \leq \omega_p \leq 3$ depending on the ring) and $n$ is the number
of inclusions of variables into clauses. Our approach often requires just the
evaluation of an $n \times n$ Pfaffian, and at most needs an additional two
rows per gate, whereas the matchgate approach is quartic in the arity of the
largest gate. We give examples (even before any change of basis) including
efficient algorithms for certain lattice path problems and an $O(n^{\omega_p})$
algorithm for evaluation of Tutte polynomials of lattice path matroids. Finally
we comment on some of the geometric considerations in analyzing Pfaffian
circuits under arbitrary basis change. Connections are made to the sum-product
algorithm, classical simulation of quantum computation, and SLOCC equivalent
entangled states.
