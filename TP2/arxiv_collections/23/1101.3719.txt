We propose new probabilistic models for the spatial distribution of supply
and demand and use the models to determine how the trip length distribution is
affected by the relative shortage or excess of supply, the spatial clustering
of supply and demand, and the degree of attraction or repulsion between supply
and demand at different spatial scales. The models have a multiplicative
structure and in certain cases possess scale invariance properties. Using
detailed population data in metropolitan US regions validates the demand model.
The trip length distribution, evaluated under destination choice models of the
intervening opportunities type, has quasi-analytic form.We take advantage of
this feature to study the sensitivity of the trip length distribution to
parameters of the demand, supply and destination choice models. We find that
trip length is affected in important but different ways by the spatial density
of potential destinations, the dependence among their attractiveness levels,
and the correlation between supply and demand at different spatial scales.
