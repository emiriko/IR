A nonlocal theory of optical real image formation is developed from the basic
quantum physics linked to an optical real image formation apparatus. Optical
real images are formed by photons. Photons are nonlocal quantum objects that
exhibit wave-like properties and particle-like properties. Optical real image
formation is nonlocal because at least two separated object points illuminated
by a single photon are required for real image formation. When the distance
between the illuminated points exceeds twice the wavelength of the light used
two equi-amplitude plane waves propagate independently away from the object
plane toward the imaging system. Propagation of photons away from a single
point in the aperture plane does not occur. Photons with spatial frequencies
that are within the passband of the imaging system pass through the imaging
system. Each plane wave pair that propagates through the imaging system
ultimately arrives at the image plane. At the image plane each plane wave pair
overlaps to form an image of its associated pair of initial points on the
object plane and thus contributes to real image formation. Object and image
field depths are treated and found to be very different than they are
ordinarily thought to be. Resolution limits related to real image formation are
investigated. Reference distribution real image formation (RIF) is introduced.
Real image formation with no fundamental resolution limit is predicted to be
achievable by means of RIF.
