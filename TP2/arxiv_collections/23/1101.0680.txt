Today, professional instrumentation is dominated by heavily oversubscribed
telescopes which focus mainly on a limited number of "fashionable" research
topics. As a result, time acquisition for massive star research, including
extended observation campaigns, becomes more difficult. On the other hand,
massive star investigations by amateur astronomers performing spectroscopic
measurements are on a level which can fulfil professional needs. I describe the
instrumentation available to the amateur, their observational skills and the
potential contribution they can make to the professional community.
