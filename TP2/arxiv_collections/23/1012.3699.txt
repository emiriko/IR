The frustrated Ising model on a two-dimensional lattice with open boundary
conditions is revisited. A hidden Z2 gauge symmetry relates models with
different frustrations which, however, share the same partition function. By
means of a duality transformation, it is shown that the partition function only
depends on the distribution of gauge invariant vortices on the lattice. We
finally show that the exact ground state energy can be calculated in polynomial
time using Edmonds' algorithm.
