We review three main results of our recent study: * We show that a proper
treatment of the tidal interaction prior to the onset of the common envelope
(CE) leads to an enhance mass loss. This might increase the survivability of
planets and brown dwarfs that enter a CE phase. * From the distribution of
planets around main sequence stars, we conclude that around many sdB/sdO stars
more than one planet might be present. One of these might have a close orbit
and the others at about orbital periods of years or more. * We show that the
intense ionizing flux of the extreme horizontal branch star might evaporate
large quantities of a very close surviving substellar object. Balmer emission
lines from the evaporated gas can be detected via their Doppler shifts.
