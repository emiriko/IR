Some consequences of a Modified Mass Concept (MMC) are discussed. According
to MMC the inertial mass is not only determined by its energy, but also by a
scalar field f depending on other masses. The concept consistently describes
the galactic rotation curves, the inflation of the universe and its accelerated
expansion, all without the necessity of Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE).
Instead, the effects attributed to DM are caused by a reduction of inertia
acting as an enhancement of gravity. These results of MMC are similar to that
of MOND. The effects usually attributed to DE in MMC stem from a new equation
of state for baryonic matter, which always causes a negative pressure. In this
respect the results are similar to those of the two component LCDM. In
particular, according to MMC the late universe will pass into a state of
constant energy density. Furthermore, the MMC can provide an explanation of the
very high peculiar velocities found at large scales.
