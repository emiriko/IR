Recent experimental work on spherical colloidal particles decorated with two
hydrophobic poles separated by an electrically-charged middle band (triblock
Janus particles) has documented self-assembly into a Kagome two-dimensional
lattice, when particles are confined by gravity at the bottom of the sample
holder [Q. Chen {\em et. al.}, Nature, in press]. Here we assess the ability of
a previously proposed simple two-patch effective potential to reproduce the
experimental findings. We show that the effective potential is able to
reproduce the observed crystallization pathway in the Kagome structure. Based
on free energy calculations, we also show that the Kagome lattice is stable at
low temperatures and low pressure, but that it transforms into a hexagonal
lattice with alternating attractive and repulsive bands on increasing pressure.
