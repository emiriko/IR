The transport of energy in heated plasmas requires the knowledge of the
radiation coefficients. These coefficients consist of contribution of
bremsstrahlung, photoionisation, bound-bound transmissions and scattering.
Scattering of photons on electrons is taken into account by the model of
Thomson, Klein-Nishina and the first order angular momentum of Klein-Nishina.
It is shown that radiative scattering becomes an important part of energy
transport in high temperature plasmas. Moreover, the contribution of transport
correction to scattering is taken into account. The physics is discussed on the
example of a heated plutonium plasma at different particle densities and
temperatures in radiative equilibrium.
