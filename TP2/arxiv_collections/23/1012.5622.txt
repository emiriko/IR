We analytically compute the orbital effects induced on the motion of a
spinning particle geodesically traveling around a central rotating body by the
general relativistic two-body spin-spin and spin-orbit interactions. We use the
weak-field and slow-motion leading-order approximation. Neither assumptions on
the eccentricity nor the inclination of the orbit of the particle have been
assumed. No specific orientations of the spins involved have been chosen.
