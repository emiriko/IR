Neutrinos are allowed to mix and to oscillate among their flavor. Muon and
tau in particular oscillate at largest values.Last Minos experiment claimed
possible difference among their matter and anti-matter masses, leading to a
first violation of the most believed CPT symmetry.Isotropically born
atmospheric muon neutrino at 20-80 GeV, while up-going, they might be partially
suppressed by mixing in analogy to historical SuperKamiokande muon neutrino
disappearance into tau, leading to large scale anisotropy signals. Here we show
an independent muon rate foreseen in Deep Core based on observed SK signals
extrapolated to DeepCore mass and its surrounding. Our rate prediction
partially differ from previous ones. The neutrino muon disappearance into tau
is leading to an anisotropy in vertical up-going muon track: in particular
along channel 3-5 we expect a huge rate (tens of thousand of events) of neutral
current events, charged current electron and inclined crossing muons. Moreover
at channel 6-9 we expect a severe suppression of the rate due to muon
disappearance (in CPT conserved frame). Such an anisotropy might be partially
tested by more than one string detection at E> 45 GeV energy. A CPT violation
may induce a more remarkable suppression of vertical up-going tracks because of
larger anti-neutrino muon reduction for E> 35 GeV.
