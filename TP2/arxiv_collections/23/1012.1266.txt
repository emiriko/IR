In this article a detailed characterization of a magnetization motion in a
single sub-micrometer and multi-terminal ferromagnetic structure in lateral
geometry is performed in a GHz regime using direct DC characterization
technique. We have shown applicability of the Stoner-Wohlfarth model to the
magnetic nano-structure with large length to with ratio. Applying the model to
experimental data we are able to extract relevant magnetization motion
parameters and show a correlation between high frequency inductive currents and
local magnetization. Additionally, DC voltage generated over the structure at
the resonance, with external magnetic field under an angle to the shape
anisotropy axis, is explained by the model.
