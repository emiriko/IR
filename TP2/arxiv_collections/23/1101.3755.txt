Approximating adequate number of clusters in multidimensional data is an open
area of research, given a level of compromise made on the quality of acceptable
results. The manuscript addresses the issue by formulating a transductive
inductive learning algorithm which uses multivariate Chebyshev inequality.
Considering clustering problem in imaging, theoretical proofs for a particular
level of compromise are derived to show the convergence of the reconstruction
error to a finite value with increasing (a) number of unseen examples and (b)
the number of clusters, respectively. Upper bounds for these error rates are
also proved. Non-parametric estimates of these error from a random sample of
sequences empirically point to a stable number of clusters. Lastly, the
generalization of algorithm can be applied to multidimensional data sets from
different fields.
