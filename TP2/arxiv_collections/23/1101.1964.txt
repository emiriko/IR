We study the properties of self-shielding intergalactic absorption systems
and their implications for the ionizing background. We find that cosmological
simulations post-processed with detailed radiative transfer calculations
generally are able to reproduce the observed abundance of Lyman-limit systems,
and we highlight possible discrepancies between the observations and
simulations. This comparison tests cosmological simulations at overdensities of
~100. Furthermore, we show that the properties of Lyman-limit systems in these
simulations, in simple semi-analytic arguments, and as suggested by recent
observations indicate that a small change in the ionizing emissivity of the
sources would have resulted in a much larger change in the amplitude of the
intergalactic HI-ionizing background (with this scaling strengthening with
increasing redshift). This strong scaling could explain the rapid evolution in
the Lyman-alpha forest transmission observed at z = 6. Our calculations agree
with the suggestion of simpler models that the comoving ionizing emissivity was
constant or even increasing from z = 3 to 6. Our calculations also provide a
more rigorous estimate than in previous studies for the clumping factor of
intergalactic gas after reionization, which we estimate was 2 - 3 at z = 6.
