The breakup cross sections in the reaction $^6$He+$^{12}$C are calculated at
about 40 MeV/nucleon using the high-energy approximation (HEA) and with the
help of microscopic optical potentials (OP) of interaction with the target
nucleus $^{12}$C of the projectile nucleus fragments $^4$He and 2n. Considering
the di-neutron $h$=2n as a single particle the relative motion $h\alpha$ wave
function is estimated so that to explain both the separation energy of $h$ in
$^6$He and the rms radius of the latter. The stripping and absorbtion total
cross sections are calculated and their sum is compared with the total reaction
cross section obtained within a double-folding microscopic OP for the
$^6$He+$^{12}$C scattering. It is concluded that the breakup cross sections
contribute in about 50% of the total reaction cross section.
