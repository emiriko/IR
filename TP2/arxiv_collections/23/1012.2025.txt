We are interested in modeling theoretical immunology within a statistical
mechanics flavor: focusing on the antigen-independent maturation process of
B-cells, in this paper we try to revise the problem of self vs non-self
discrimination by mature B lymphocytes. We consider only B lymphocytes: despite
this is of course an oversimplification, however such a toy model may help to
highlight features of their interactions otherwise shadowed by main driven
mechanisms due to i.e. helper T-cell signalling. By analyzing possible
influences of the ontogenesis of the immune system on the final behavior of B
lymphocytes, we try to merge over the purely negative selection mechanism at
their birth with the adult self-regulation process. The final goal is a
"thermodynamical picture" by which both the scenarios can exist and, actually,
be synergically complementary: Trough numerical simulations we impose on a
recent scheme for B-cell interactions, that part of self-reactive lymphocytes
are killed during the ontogenesis by which two observations stem: At first the
so built system is able to show anergy with respect to the previously
encountered self even in its mature life, then this naturally leads to an
increasing variance (and average) in the connectivity distribution of the
resulting idiotypic network. As a consequence, following Varela perspective,
this shift may contribute to push to anergy those self-directed cells which are
free to explore the body: identifying the latter as the highly connected ones,
anergy is imposed even via the B-network regulation, and its strength is
influenced by the negative selection.
