The magic "Harry Potter's cloak" has been the dream of human beings for
really long time. Recently, transformation optics inspired from the advent of
metamaterials offers great versatility for manipulating wave propagation at
will to create amazing illusion effects. In the present work, we proposed a
novel transformation recipe, in which the cloaking shell somehow behaves like a
"cloaking lens", to provide almost all desired features one can expect for a
real magic cloak. The most exciting feature of the current recipe is that an
object with arbitrary characteristics (e.g., size, shape or material
properties) can be invisibilized perfectly with positive-index materials, which
significantly benefits the practical realization of a broad-band cloaking
device fabricated with existing materials. Moreover, the one concealed in the
hidden region is able to undistortedly communicate with the surrounding world,
while the lens-like cloaking shell will protect the cloaked source/sensor from
being traced back by outside detectors by creating a virtual image.
