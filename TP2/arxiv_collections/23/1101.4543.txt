Two large northern polar crown prominences that erupted on 2010 April 13 and
2010 August 1 were analysed using images obtained from the Extreme UltraViolet
Imager on the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft. Several
features along the prominence legs were reconstructed using a stereoscopic
reconstruction technique developed by us. The three-dimensional changes
exhibited by the prominences can be explained as an interplay between two
different motions, namely helical twist in the prominence spine, and overall
non-radial equatorward motion of the entire prominence structure. The sense of
twist in both the prominences is determined from the changes in latitudes and
longitudes of the reconstructed features. The prominences are observed starting
from a few hours before the eruption. Increase in height before and during the
eruption allowed us to study kinematics of the prominences in the two phases of
eruption, the slow rise and the fast eruptive phase. A constant value of
acceleration was found for each reconstructed feature in each phase, but it
showed significant change from one leg to the other in both the prominences.
The magnitude of acceleration during the eruptive phase is found to be
commensurate with the net effect of the two motions stated above.
