We introduce here in the current research the revisiting of approach to the
dynamics of Sun center relative to barycenter of Solar system by using
self-resulting photo-gravitational force of the Sun as the main reason of such
motion. In case of slowly moving in the direction outwards with respect to the
initial position of barycenter of Solar system (together with the current
position of Solar system barycenter, of course) with average established
velocity not less than 1050 Km/day, we should especially note that hierarchical
configuration of Solar system will be preferably the same during this motion.
As the main findings, we have suggested algorithm how to move towards stars
using Solar self-resulting photo-gravitational force. The obvious physically
reasonable assumption is that the Solar system will have been increasing its
size during the evolution in a future (due to losses of the total angular
momentum taking into account the tidal phenomena).
