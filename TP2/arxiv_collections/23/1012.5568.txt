We survey research that studies the connection between the computational
complexity of optimization problems on the one hand, and the duality gap
between the primal and dual optimization problems on the other. To our
knowledge, this is the first survey that connects the two very important areas.
We further look at a similar phenomenon in finite model theory relating to
complexity and optimization.
