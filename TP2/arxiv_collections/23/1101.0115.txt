We consider fragments of first-order logic and as models we allow finite and
infinite words simultaneously. The only binary relations apart from equality
are order comparison < and the successor predicate +1. We give
characterizations of the fragments Sigma2 = Sigma2[<,+1] and FO2 = FO2[<,+1] in
terms of algebraic and topological properties. To this end we introduce the
factor topology over infinite words. It turns out that a language L is in the
intersection of FO2 and Sigma2 if and only if L is the interior of an FO2
language. Symmetrically, a language is in the intersection of FO2 and Pi2 if
and only if it is the topological closure of an FO2 language. The fragment
Delta2, which by definition is the intersection of Sigma2 and Pi2 contains
exactly the clopen languages in FO2. In particular, over infinite words Delta2
is a strict subclass of FO2. Our characterizations yield decidability of the
membership problem for all these fragments over finite and infinite words; and
as a corollary we also obtain decidability for infinite words. Moreover, we
give a new decidable algebraic characterization of dot-depth 3/2 over finite
words. Decidability of dot-depth 3/2 over finite words was first shown by
Gla{\ss}er and Schmitz in STACS 2000, and decidability of the membership
problem for FO2 over infinite words was shown 1998 by Wilke in his habilitation
thesis whereas decidability of Sigma2 over infinite words was not known before.
