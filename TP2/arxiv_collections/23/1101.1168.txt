Micropatterned surfaces composed of concentric circular defects having a
smooth trench-like profile are formed using a photoresist (SU-8). When an
evaporating droplet encounters the micropatterned surface an evaporation phase
is observed consisting of distinct discontinuities and steps in the droplet
wetting contact angle and base radius respectively. The addition of gaps into
the circular defects enables tuning of the contact angle hysteresis; the
receding contact angle of fluorocarbon coated SU-8 can be tuned between
34.6{\deg} and 89.1{\deg} and that of SU-8 surfaces from 5.6{\deg} to
43.3{\deg} depending on the gap length. In addition, a model is developed which
accurately predicts the observed behavior.
