Cosmic-rays with energies exceeding 10^{19} eV are referred to as Ultra High
Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). The sources of these particles and their
acceleration mechanism are unknown, and for many years have been the issue of
much debate. The first part of this review describes the main constraints, that
are implied by UHECR observations on the properties of candidate UHECR sources,
the candidate sources, and the related main open questions.
  In order to address the challenges of identifying the UHECR sources and of
probing the physical mechanisms driving them, a "multi-messenger" approach will
most likely be required, combining electromagnetic, cosmic-ray and neutrino
observations. The second part of the review is devoted to a discussion of high
energy neutrino astronomy. It is shown that detectors, which are currently
under construction, are expected to reach the effective mass required for the
detection of high energy extra-Galactic neutrino sources, and may therefore
play a key role in the near future in resolving the main open questions. The
detection of high energy neutrinos from extra-Galactic sources will not only
provide constraints on the identity and underlying physics of UHECR sources,
but may furthermore provide information on fundamental neutrino properties.
