A criterion that should be satisfied in the inflation and quintessence models
is motivated from the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by Huang. However, it is
found that the criterion is inconsistent with the Holographic dark energy (HDE)
and new agegraphic dark energy (NADE) models. In the note, we firstly show that
in the HDE and NADE models the criterion should be be replaced respectively by
two new criterions. Secondly, we apply the new criterions indicated by WGC to
survey the two models. We find that the contradiction between WGC and the NADE
model is removed when the new criterion is used. In the HDE model, we find the
effects of the spatial curvature and the interaction should be considered in
order to match the new criterion.
