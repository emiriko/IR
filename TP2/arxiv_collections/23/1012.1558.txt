I review recent work on holographic superconductivity with
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and show how the critical temperature of the
superconductor depends on both gravitational backreaction and the Gauss-Bonnet
parameter, using both analytic and numerical arguments. I also review
computations of the conductivity, finding the energy gap, and demonstrating
that there is no universal gap ratio, $\omega_g/T_c$, for these
superconductors.
