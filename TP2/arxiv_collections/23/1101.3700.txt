We propose a scheme for multiparty hierarchical quantum-information splitting
(QIS) with a multipartite entangled state, where a boss distributes a secret
quantum state to two grades of agents asymmetrically. The agents who belong to
different grades have different authorities for recovering boss's secret.
Except for boss's Bell-state measurement, no nonlocal operation is involved.
The presented scheme is also shown to be secure against eavesdropping. Such a
hierarchical QIS is expected to find useful applications in the field of modern
multipartite quantum cryptography.
