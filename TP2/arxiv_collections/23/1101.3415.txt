Little is known about the physical properties of cometary nuclei. Apart from
space mission targets, measuring the thermal emission of a nucleus is one of
the few means to derive its size, independently of its albedo, and to constrain
some of its thermal properties. This emission is difficult to detect from Earth
but space telescopes (Infrared Space Observatory, Spitzer Space Telescope,
Herschel Space Observatory) allow reliable measurements in the infrared and the
sub-millimetre domains. We aim at better characterizing the thermal properties
of the nucleus of comet 8P/Tuttle using multi-wavelentgh space- and
ground-based observations, in the visible, infrared, and millimetre range. We
used the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to measure the millimetre thermal
emission of comet 8P/Tuttle at 240 GHz (1.25 mm) and analysed the observations
with the shape model derived from Hubble Space Telescope observations and the
nucleus size derived from Spitzer Space Telescope observations. We report on
the first detection of the millimetre thermal emission of a cometary nucleus
since comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp in 1997. Using the two contact spheres shape
model derived from Hubble Space Telescope observations, we constrained the
thermal properties of the nucleus. Our millimetre observations are best match
with: i) a thermal inertia lower than ~10 J K-1 m-2 s-1/2, ii) an emissivity
lower than 0.8, indicating a non-negligible contribution of the colder
sub-surface layers to the outcoming millimetre flux.
