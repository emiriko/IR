Genome-wide association studies have become increasingly common due to
advances in technology and have permitted the identification of differences in
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles that are associated with diseases.
However, while typical GWAS analysis techniques treat markers individually,
complex diseases are unlikely to have a single causative gene. There is thus a
pressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level
differences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS
analysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses
GWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways
that permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is
based upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases
will appear more similar to other cases than to controls for the SNPs
associated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all
pathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis
holds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit
greater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves
on existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses in that it does not
require the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits
PoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drives risk. In this
paper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWA studies: one of breast
cancer, and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest
that there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease
susceptibility. PoDA thus provides an analytical tool that is complementary to
existing techniques and has the power to enrich our understanding of disease
genomics at the systems-level.
