Using explicit perturbations of isotropic cosmological models which describe
simple gravitational waves, an isotropic tensor having the algebraic symmetries
of the Bel-Robinson tensor is derived as a model of cosmic background
gravitational radiation and this is used to provide an answer to the question:
in what sense can an energy-momentum-stress tensor similar to that describing
the cosmic microwave background radiation (neglecting anisotropies) be
associated with an isotropic background of gravitational radiation?
