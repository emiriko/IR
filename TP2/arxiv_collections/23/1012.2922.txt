Significant excitonic effects were observed in graphene by measuring its
optical conductivity in a broad spectral range including the two-dimensional
{\pi}-band saddle-point singularities in the electronic structure. The strong
electron-hole interactions manifest themselves in an asymmetric resonance
peaked at 4.62 eV, which is red-shifted by nearly 600 meV from the value
predicted by ab-initio GW calculations for the band-to-band transitions. The
observed excitonic resonance is explained within a phenomenological model as a
Fano interference of a strongly coupled excitonic state and a band continuum.
Our experiment also showed a weak dependence of the excitonic resonance in
few-layer graphene on layer thickness. This result reflects the effective
cancellation of the increasingly screened repulsive electron-electron (e-e) and
attractive electron-hole (e-h) interactions.
