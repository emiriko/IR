We study the low energy effective action for the collective modes of the
color flavor locked phase of QCD. This phase of matter has long been known to
be a superfluid because by picking a phase its order parameter breaks the
quark-number $U(1)_B$ symmetry spontaneously. We consider the modes describing
fluctuations in the magnitude of the condensate, namely the Higgs mode, and in
the phase of the condensate, namely the Nambu-Goldstone (or
Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode associated with the breaking of $U(1)_B$. By
employing as microscopic theory the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model, we reproduce
known results for the Lagrangian of the Nambu-Goldstone field to the leading
order in the chemical potential and extend such results evaluating corrections
due to the gap parameter. Moreover, we determine the interaction terms between
the Higgs and the Nambu-Goldstone field. This study paves the way for a more
reliable study of various dissipative processes in rotating compact stars with
a quark matter core in the color flavor locked phase.
