We investigate new physics that could be discovered with very little LHC
data, beyond the expected sensitivity of the Tevatron. We construct
"supermodels", for which the LHC sensitivity with 10 pb-1 luminosity is already
greater than that of the Tevatron with 10 fb-1. The simplest supermodels
involve s-channel resonances in the quark-antiquark and especially in the
quark-quark channels. In the latter case, the LHC sensitivity with 0.1 pb-1 can
already be greater than that of the Tevatron with 10 fb-1. We concentrate on
easily visible final states with small standard model backgrounds, and find
that there are simple searches, besides those for Z' states, which could
discover new physics in early LHC data. Many of these are well-suited to test
searches for "conventional" models, often discussed for larger data sets.
