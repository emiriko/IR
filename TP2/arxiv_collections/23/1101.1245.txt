Purpose: Monte Carlo methods are considered the gold standard for dosimetric
computations in radiotherapy. Their execution time is however still an obstacle
to the routine use of Monte Carlo packages in a clinical setting. To address
this problem, a completely new, and designed from the ground up for the GPU,
Monte Carlo dose calculation package for voxelized geometries is proposed:
GPUMCD. Method : GPUMCD implements a coupled photon-electron Monte Carlo
simulation for energies in the range 0.01 MeV to 20 MeV. An analogue simulation
of photon interactions is used and a Class II condensed history method has been
implemented for the simulation of electrons. A new GPU random number generator,
some divergence reduction methods as well as other optimization strategies are
also described. GPUMCD was run on a NVIDIA GTX480 while single threaded
implementations of EGSnrc and DPM were run on an Intel Core i7 860. Results :
Dosimetric results obtained with GPUMCD were compared to EGSnrc. In all but one
test case, 98% or more of all significant voxels passed a gamma criteria of
2%-2mm. In terms of execution speed and efficiency, GPUMCD is more than 900
times faster than EGSnrc and more than 200 times faster than DPM, a Monte Carlo
package aiming fast executions. Absolute execution times of less than 0.3 s are
found for the simulation of 1M electrons and 4M photons in water for
monoenergetic beams of 15 MeV, including GPU-CPU memory transfers. Conclusion :
GPUMCD, a new GPU-oriented Monte Carlo dose calculation platform, has been
compared to EGSnrc and DPM in terms of dosimetric results and execution speed.
Its accuracy and speed make it an interesting solution for full Monte Carlo
dose calculation in radiation oncology.
