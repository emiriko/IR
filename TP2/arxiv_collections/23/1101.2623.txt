A technique of dynamically defined measures is developed and its relation to
the theory of equilibrium states is shown. The technique uses Caratheodory's
method and the outer measure introduced in (I. Werner, Math. Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc. 140 (2) (2006) 333-347). As an application, equilibrium states for
contractive Markov systems (I. Werner, J. London Math. Soc. 71 (2005), no. 1,
236-258) are obtained.
