In a recent paper Belgiorno {\em et al} claimed to have observed the analog
of the Hawking effect because of the detection of radiation in a frequency
range in which what they called "phase horizons" existed. They created rapidly
moving pulses of light in a silica glass whose Kerr effect altered the
refractive index to create those horizons. Unfortunately, while the
observations are very interesting, the cause of the radiation is not
understood, and we feel it is not justified to call this a detection of the
Hawking effect in an analog system.
