We produce examples in the cohomology of algebraic groups which answer two
questions of Parshall and Scott. Specifically, if $G=SL_2$, then we show: (a)
$\dim \Ext_G^2(L,L)$ can be arbitrarily large for a simple module $L$; and (b)
the sequence $\max_{L-\text{irred}}\dim H^k(G,L)$ grows exponentially fast with
$k$.
