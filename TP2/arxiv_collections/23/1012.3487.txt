We review motivation for a light charged Higgs scenario that occurs in a
class of models with a light CP-odd Higgs boson. If the light CP-odd Higgs is
doublet-like the charged Higgs is typically lighter than the top quark and it
dominantly decays into $W^\pm A$ with $B(H^+ \to W^+ A) > 70%$. We summarize
experimental constraints from direct searches and discuss search strategies
based on subleading decay modes of the CP-odd Higgs. A search for $t \to H^+ b,
\;\;\;\; H^+ \to W^+ A, \;\;\;\; A \to \mu^+ \mu^- $ could provide an evidence
for the charged Higgs or a discovery already with 1 fb$^{-1}$ of data at the
LHC.
