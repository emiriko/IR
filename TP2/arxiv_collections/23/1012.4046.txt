Product take-back legislation forces manufacturers to bear the costs of
collection and disposal of products that have reached the end of their useful
lives. In order to reduce these costs, manufacturers can consider reuse,
remanufacturing and/or recycling of components as an alternative to disposal.
The implementation of such alternatives usually requires an appropriate reverse
supply chain management. With the concepts of reverse supply chain are gaining
popularity in practice, the use of artificial intelligence approaches in these
areas is also becoming popular. As a result, the purpose of this paper is to
give an overview of the recent publications concerning the application of
artificial intelligence techniques to reverse supply chain with emphasis on
certain types of product returns.
