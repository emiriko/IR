The calorimeter, range detector and active target elements of the T2K near
detectors rely on the Hamamatsu Photonics Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs)
to detect scintillation light produced by charged particles. Detailed
measurements of the MPPC gain, afterpulsing, crosstalk, dark noise, and photon
detection efficiency for low light levels are reported. In order to account for
the impact of the MPPC behavior on T2K physics observables, a simulation
program has been developed based on these measurements. The simulation is used
to predict the energy resolution of the detector.
