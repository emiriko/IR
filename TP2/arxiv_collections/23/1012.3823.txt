We introduce a new class of multipartite entangled mixed states with pure
state decompositions of generalized W states, similar to Schmidt-correlated
states having generalized GHZ states in the pure state decomposition. The
entanglement and separability properties are studied according to PPT
operations. Monogamy relations linked to these states are also investigated.
