In spontaneous emission an atom in an excited state undergoes a transition to
the ground state and emits a single photon. Associated with the emission is a
change of the atomic momentum due to photon recoil. Photon emission can be
modified close to surfaces and in cavities. For an ion, localized in front of a
mirror, coherence of the emitted resonance fluorescence has been reported. In
free space experiments demonstrated that spontaneous emission destroys motional
coherence. Here we report on motional coherence created by a single spontaneous
emission event close to a mirror surface. The coherence in the free atomic
motion is verified by atom interferometry. The photon can be regarded as a
beamsplitter for an atomic matterwave and consequently our experiment extends
the original recoiling slit Gedanken experiment by Einstein to the case where
the slit is in a robust coherent superposition of the two recoils associated
with the two paths of the quanta.
