We study the effect of quantum memory in non-inertial frames under the
influence of amplitude damping, depolarizing, phase flip and bit-phase flip
channels. It is shown that the entanglement of initial state is heavily
influenced by quantum correlations. It is seen that quantum memory compensates
the loss of entanglement generated caused by the Unruh effect. It is
interesting to note that the sudden death of entanglement disappears for any
acceleration for higher values of memory. Therefore, it is possible to avoid
ESD in non-inertial frames due to the presence of quantum memory. Furthermore,
the degree of entanglement is enhanced as we increase the degree of memory and
it maximizes for maximum correlations.
