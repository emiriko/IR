We present the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of light nuclei at mid-rapidity in
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results are measured in the
STAR experiment at RHIC. The $v_{2}$ measurement for light nuclei as a function
of transverse momentum $p_{T}$ is found to follow an approximate atomic mass
number ($A$) scaling. We compare the measured nuclei $v_{2}$ to results from a
dynamical coalescence model calculation. The $v_{2}$ values for light nuclei
are further scaled to the number of constituent quarks (NCQ) of their
constituent nucleons and are consistent with NCQ scaled $v_{2}$ for baryons and
mesons. The dominance of partonic collectivity in the transverse expansion
dynamics in these collisions naturally produces such a consistent picture.
Similar to other hadrons, an increase of $p_{T}$-integrated $v_{2}$ scaled by
the participant eccentricity as a function of collision centrality has been
observed.
