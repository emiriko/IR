We present a summary of gamma-ray millisecond pulsar (MSP) observations with
the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The radio and gamma-ray light curves of these
MSPs have been modeled in the framework of the retarded vacuum dipole magnetic
field. Likelihood fitting of the radio and gamma-ray light curves with
geometric emission models allows us to give model-dependent confidence contours
for the viewing geometry in these systems which are complementary to those from
polarization measurements.
