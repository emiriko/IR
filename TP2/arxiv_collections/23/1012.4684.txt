We discuss recent findings about properties of quantum nonequilibrium steady
states. In particular we focus on transport properties. It is shown that the
time dependent density matrix renormalization method can be used successfully
to find a stationary solution of Lindblad master equation. Furthermore, for a
specific model an exact solution is presented.
