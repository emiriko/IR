We analyze the analog of the Rayleigh instability in the field of gravity for
the superfluid-crystal 4He interface provided that the heavier 4He crystal
phase occupies the half-space over the lighter superfluid phase. The conditions
and the onset of the gravitational instability are different in kind above and
below the roughening transition temperature when the crystal 4He surface is in
the rough or in the smooth faceted state, respectively. In the rough state of
the surface the gravitational instability is similar to the classical case of
the fluid-fluid interface. In contrast, in the case of the crystal faceted
surface the onset of the gravitational instability is associated with
surmounting some potential barrier. The potential barrier results from nonzero
magnitude of the linear facet step energy. The size and the tilting angle of
the crystal facet are also important parameters for developing the instability.
The initial stage of the instability can be described as a generation of
crystallization waves at the superfluid-crystal interface. The experiments
which may concern the gravitational instability of the superfluid-crystal 4He
interface are discussed.
