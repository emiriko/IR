We analyze the phase equilibria of systems of polydisperse hydrocarbons by
means of the recently introduced moment method. Hydrocarbons are modelled with
the Soave-Redlick-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of states. Numerical
results show no particular qualitative difference between the two equations of
states. Furthermore, in general the moment method proves to be an excellent
method for solving phase equilibria of polydisperse systems, showing excellent
agreement with previous results and allowing a great improvement in generality
of the numerical scheme and speed of computation.
