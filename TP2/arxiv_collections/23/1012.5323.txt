Simulations of the moon-forming impact suggest that most of the lunar
material derives from the impactor rather than the Earth. Measurements of lunar
samples, however, reveal an oxygen isotope composition that is
indistinguishable from terrestrial samples, and clearly distinct from
meteorites coming from Mars and Vesta. Here we explore the possibility that the
silicate Earth and impactor were compositionally distinct with respect to
oxygen isotopes, and that the terrestrial magma ocean and lunar-forming
material underwent turbulent mixing and equilibration in the energetic
aftermath of the giant impact. This mixing may arise in the molten disk epoch
between the impact and lunar accretion, lasting perhaps 10^2-10^3 yr. The
implications of this idea for the geochemistry of the Moon, the origin of water
on Earth, and constraints on the giant impact are discussed.
