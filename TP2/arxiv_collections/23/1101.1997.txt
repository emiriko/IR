The formation and evolution of a circumstellar disk in magnetized cloud cores
is investigated from prestellar core stage until sim 10^4 yr after protostar
formation. In the circumstellar disk, fragmentation first occurs due to
gravitational instability in a magnetically inactive region, and
substellar-mass objects appear. The substellar-mass objects lose their orbital
angular momenta by gravitational interaction with the massive circumstellar
disk and finally fall onto the protostar. After this fall, the circumstellar
disk increases its mass by mass accretion and again induces fragmentation. The
formation and falling of substellar-mass objects are repeated in the
circumstellar disk until the end of the main accretion phase. In this process,
the mass of fragments remain small, because the circumstellar disk loses its
mass by fragmentation and subsequent falling of fragments before it becomes
very massive. In addition, when fragments orbit near the protostar, they
disturb the inner disk region and promote mass accretion onto the protostar.
The orbital motion of substellar-mass objects clearly synchronizes with the
time variation of the accretion luminosity of the protostar. Moreover, as the
objects fall, the protostar shows a strong brightening for a short duration.
The intermittent protostellar outflows are also driven by the circumstellar
disk whose magnetic field lines are highly tangled owing to the orbital motion
of fragments. The time-variable protostellar luminosity and intermittent
outflows may be a clue for detecting planetary-mass objects in the
circumstellar disk.
