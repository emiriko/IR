We study local moment formation for adatoms on bilayer graphene (BLG) within
a mean-field theory of the Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions of the
BLG electrons induce strong particle-hole asymmetry and band dependence of the
hybridization, which is shown to result in unusual features in the impurity
model phase diagram. We also study the effect of varying the chemical
potential, as well as varying an electric field perpendicular to the bilayer;
the latter modifies the density of states of electrons in BLG and, more
significantly, shifts the impurity energy. We show that this leads to regimes
in the impurity phase diagram where local moments can be turned on or off by
applying modest external electric fields. Finally, we show that the RKKY
interaction between local moments can be varied by tuning the chemical
potential (as has also been suggested in monolayer graphene) or, more
interestingly, by tuning the electric field so that it induces changes in the
band structure of BLG.
