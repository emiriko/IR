The field of exoplanets is quickly expanding from just the detection of new
planets and the measurement of their most basic parameters, such as mass,
radius and orbital configuration, to the first measurements of their
atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, chemical composition, albedo,
dynamics and structure. Here I will overview some of the main findings on
exoplanet atmospheres until September 2010, first from space and just in the
past two years also from the ground.
