We have investigated the stellar population properties in the central regions
of a sample of lenticular galaxies with bars and single-exponential outer
stellar disks using the data from the SAURON integral-field spectrograph
retrieved from the open Isaac Newton Group Archive. We have detected chemically
decoupled compact stellar nuclei with a metallicity twice that of the stellar
population in the bulges in seven of the eight galaxies. A starburst is
currently going on at the center of the eighth galaxy and we have failed to
determine the stellar population properties from its spectrum. The mean stellar
ages in the chemically decoupled nuclei found range from 1 to 11 Gyr. The
scenarios for the origin of both decoupled nuclei and lenticular galaxies as a
whole are discussed.
