All biological processes are controlled by complex systems of enzymatic
chemical reactions. Although the majority of enzymatic networks have very
elaborate structures, there are many experimental observations indicating that
some turnover rates still follow a simple Michaelis-Menten relation with a
hyperbolic dependence on a substrate concentration. The original
Michaelis-Menten mechanism has been derived as a steady-state approximation for
a single-pathway enzymatic chain. The validity of this mechanism for many
complex enzymatic systems is surprising. To determine general conditions when
this relation might be observed in experiments, enzymatic networks consisting
of coupled parallel pathways are investigated theoretically. It is found that
the Michaelis-Menten equation is satisfied for specific relations between
chemical rates, and it also corresponds to the situation with no fluxes between
parallel pathways. Our results are illustrated for simple models. The
importance of the Michaelis-Menten relationship and derived criteria for
single-molecule experimental studies of enzymatic processes are discussed.
