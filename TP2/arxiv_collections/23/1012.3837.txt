Co2MnSi (CMS) films of different thicknesses (20, 50 and 100 nm) were grown
by radio frequency (RF) sputtering on a-plane sapphire substrates. Our X-rays
diffraction study shows that, in all the samples, the cubic <110> CSM axis is
normal to the substrate and that there exist well defined preferential in-plane
orientations. Static and dynamic magnetic properties were investigated using
vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and micro-strip line ferromagnetic
resonance (MS-FMR), respectively. From the resonance measurements versus the
direction and the amplitude of an applied magnetic field we derive most of the
magnetic parameters: magnetization, gyromagnetic factor, exchange stiffness
coefficient and magnetic anisotropy terms. The in-plane anisotropy can be
described as resulting from the superposition of two terms showing a two-fold
and a four-fold symmetry without necessarily identical principal axes. The
observed behavior of the hysteresis loops is in agreement with this complex
form of the in-plane anisotropy
