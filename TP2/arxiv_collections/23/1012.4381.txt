The motion of a large, neutrally buoyant, particle, freely advected by a
turbulent flow is determined experimentally. We demonstrate that both the
translational and angular accelerations exhibit very wide probability
distributions, a manifestation of intermittency. The orientation of the angular
velocity with respect to the trajectory, as well as the translational
acceleration conditioned on the spinning velocity provide evidence of a lift
force acting on the particle.
