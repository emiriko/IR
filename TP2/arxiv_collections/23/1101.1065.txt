Instantaneous measurements of non-local observables between space-like
separated regions can be performed without violating causality. This feat
relies on the use of entanglement. Here we propose novel protocols for this
task and the related problem of multipartite quantum computation with local
operations and a single round of classical communication. Compared to
previously known techniques, our protocols reduce the entanglement consumption
by an exponential amount. We also prove a linear lower bound on the amount of
entanglement required for the implementation of a certain non-local
measurement.
  These results relate to position-based cryptography: an amount of
entanglement scaling exponentially in the number of communicated qubits is
sufficient to render any such scheme insecure. Furthermore, we show that
certain schemes are secure under the assumption that the adversary has less
entanglement than a given linear bound and is restricted to classical
communication.
