Motivated by a recent conjecture concerning the expressiveness of declarative
networking, we propose a formal computation model for "eventually consistent"
distributed querying, based on relational transducers. A tight link has been
conjectured between coordination-freeness of computations, and monotonicity of
the queries expressed by such computations. Indeed, we propose a formal
definition of coordination-freeness and confirm that the class of monotone
queries is captured by coordination-free transducer networks.
Coordination-freeness is a semantic property, but the syntactic class that we
define of "oblivious" transducers also captures the same class of monotone
queries. Transducer networks that are not coordination-free are much more
powerful.
