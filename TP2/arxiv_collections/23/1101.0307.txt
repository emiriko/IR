Recent years have seen rapid developments in our knowledge and understanding
of meson spectroscopy, especially in the charm quark sectors. In my invited
overview I discussed some of these recent new developments, including
theoretical developments, new production mechanisms such as B decays and double
charmonium production, and the discovery of several of the many new candidates
for excited charmonia, charm meson molecules, and hybrid (excited glue) mesons,
in both charmonium and light quark sectors. In this writeup, due to length
constraints I will restrict my discussion to a few examples of these new
states, some of their broader theoretical implications, and future prospects.
