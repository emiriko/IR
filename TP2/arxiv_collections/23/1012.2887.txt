The open charm effects via intermediate hadron loop transitions seem to play
a crucial role in the understanding of several existing "puzzles" in charmonium
exclusive decays, such as the $\psi(3770)$ non-$D\bar{D}$ decays, and
"$\rho\pi$ puzzle" etc. In the charmonium energy region, non-perturbative
mechanisms could be still sizeable, and as a consequence the intermediate
hadron loop transitions also provide a mechanism for the
helicity-selection-rule (HSR) violation. We report our recent progress on those
existing puzzles.
