We study spin susceptibility and magnetic order at the edges/surfaces of
two-dimensional and three-dimensional topological insulators when the Fermi
surface is nested. We find that due to spin-momentum locking as well as
time-reversal symmetry, spin susceptibility at the nesting wavevector has a
strong {\em helical} feature. It follows then, a {\em helical} spin density
wave (SDW) state emerges at low temperature due to Fermi surface nesting. The
helical feature of spin susceptibility also has profound impact on the magnetic
order in magnetically doped surface of three dimensional topological
insulators. In such system, from the mean field Zener theory, we predict a {\em
helical} magnetic order.
