Measurements of inclusive W and Z boson production cross sections in pp
collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV are presented, based on 2.9 inverse picobarns of
data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurements, performed in
the electron and muon decay channels, are combined to give sigma(pp to WX)
times B(W to muon or electron + neutrino) = 9.95 \pm 0.07(stat.) \pm
0.28(syst.) \pm 1.09(lumi.) nb and sigma(pp to ZX) times B(Z to oppositely
charged muon or electron pairs) = 0.931 \pm 0.026(stat.) \pm 0.023(syst.) \pm
0.102(lumi.) nb. Theoretical predictions, calculated at the
next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD using recent parton distribution
functions, are in agreement with the measured cross sections. Ratios of cross
sections, which incur an experimental systematic uncertainty of less than 4%,
are also reported.
