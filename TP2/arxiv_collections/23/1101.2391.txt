We study collective scattering with Bose-Einstein condensates interacting
with a high-finesse ring cavity. The condensate scatters the light of a
transverse pump beam superradiantly into modes which, in contrast to previous
experiments, are not determined by the geometrical shape of the condensate, but
specified by a resonant cavity mode. Moreover, since the recoil-shifted
frequency of the scattered light depends on the initial momentum of the
scattered fraction of the condensate, we show that it is possible to employ the
good resolution of the cavity as a filter selecting particular quantized
momentum states.
