We derive expressions for the electromagnetic Green's function for a layered
system using a transfer matrix technique. The expressions we arrive at makes it
possible to study symmetry properties of the Green's function, such as
reciprocity symmetry, and the long-range properties of the Green's function
which involves plasmon waves as well as boundary waves, also known as Norton
waves. We apply the method by calculating the light scattering cross section
off a chain of nanoholes in a thin Au film. The results highlight the
importance of nanohole interactions mediated by surface plasmon propagating
along the chain of holes.
