The low-temperature properties of the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in 2+1
space-time dimensions are analyzed within the framework of effective
Lagrangians. It is shown that the magnon-magnon interaction is very weak and
repulsive, manifesting itself through a term proportional to five powers of the
temperature in the pressure. The structure of the low-temperature series for
antiferromagnets in 2+1 dimensions is compared with the structure of the
analogous series for antiferromagnets in 3+1 dimensions. The model-independent
and systematic effective field theory approach clearly proves to be superior to
conventional condensed matter methods such as spin-wave theory.
