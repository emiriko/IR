Analogous to the extension of laser cooling techniques from two-level to
three-level atoms, Doppler cooling of molecules with an intermediate electronic
state is considered. In particular, we use a rate-equation approach to simulate
cooling of SiO+, in which population buildup in the intermediate state is
prevented by its short lifetime. We determine that Doppler cooling of SiO+ can
be accomplished without optically repumping from the intermediate state, at the
cost of causing undesirable parity flips and rotational diffusion. Since the
necessary repumping would require a large number of continuous-wave lasers,
optical pulse shaping of a femtosecond laser is proposed as an attractive
alternative. Other candidate three-electron-level molecules are also discussed.
