With a sample of (225.2\pm2.8)*10^{6} J/psi events registered in the BESIII
detector, J/psi->gamma pi^+ pi^- eta' is studied using two eta' decay modes:
eta'->pi^+ pi^- eta and eta' -> gamma rho^0. The X(1835), which was previously
observed by BESII, is confirmed with a statistical significance that is larger
than 20\sigma. In addition, in the pi^+pi^-eta' invariant mass spectrum, the
X(2120) and the X(2370), are observed with statistical significances larger
than 7.2\sigma and 6.4\sigma, respectively. For the X(1835), the angular
distribution of the radiative photon is consistent with expectations for a
pseudoscalar.
