The population of debris discs on the main sequence is well constrained,
however very little is known about debris discs around evolved stars. In this
work we provide a theoretical framework that considers the effects of stellar
evolution on debris discs; firstly considering the evolution of an individual
disc from the main sequence through to the white dwarf phase, then extending
this to the known population of debris discs around main sequence A stars. It
is found that discs around evolved stars are harder to detect than on the main
sequence. In the context of our models discs should be detectable with Herschel
or Alma on the giant branch, subject to the uncertain effect of sublimation on
the discs. The best chances are for hot young white dwarfs, fitting nicely with
the observations e.g the helix nebula (Su et al. 2007) and 9 systems presented
by Chu & Bilikova.
