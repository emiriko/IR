We derive an expression for the macroscopic force density that a narrow-band
electromagnetic field imposes on a dissipative isotropic medium. The result is
obtained by averaging the microscopic form for Lorentz force density. The
derived expression allows us to calculate realistic electromagnetic forces in a
wide range of materials that are described by complex-valued electric
permittivity and magnetic permeability. The three-dimensional energy-momentum
tensor in our expression reduces for lossless media to the so-called Helmholtz
tensor that has not been contradicted in any experiment so far. The momentum
density of the field does not coincide with any well-known expression, but for
non-magnetic materials it matches the Abraham expression.
