By using variational calculus and exterior derivative formalism, we proposed
in two previous joint papers with S. Siparov a new geometric approach for
electromagnetism in pseudo-Finsler spaces. In the present paper, we provide
more details, especially regarding generalized currents, the domain of
integration and gauge invariance. Also, for flat pseudo-Finsler spaces, we
define a generalized energy-momentum tensor (consisting of two blocks), as the
symmetrized Noether current corresponding to the invariance of the field
Lagrangian with respect to spacetime translations. In curved spaces, one of the
blocks of the generalized energy-momentum tensor is obtained by varying the
field Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor and the other one, by
varying the same Lagrangian with respect to the nonlinear connection.
