We present an \emph{ab initio} calculation of spectroscopic factors for
neutron and proton removal from $^{24}$O using the coupled-cluster method and a
state-of-the-art chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction at
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. In order to account for the coupling to
the scattering continuum we use a Berggren single-particle basis that treats
bound, resonant, and continuum states on an equal footing. We report neutron
removal spectroscopic factors for the $^{23}$O states $J^{\pi} = 1/2^+$,
$5/2^+$, $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$, and proton removal spectroscopic factors for the
$^{23}$N states $1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$. Our calculations support the accumulated
experimental evidence that $^{24}$O is a closed-shell nucleus.
