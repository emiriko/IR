Imaging observations of IRAS 17527-2439 are obtained in the near-IR JHK
photometric bands and in a narrow-band filter centred at the wavelength of the
H_2 1-0 S(1) line. The continuum-subtracted H_2 image is used to identify
outflows. The data obtained in this study are used in conjunction with Spitzer,
AKARI, and IRAS data. A parsec-scale bipolar outflow is discovered in our H_2
line image, which is supported by the detection in the archival Spitzer images.
The H_2 image exhibits signs of precession of the main jet and shows tentative
evidence for a second outflow. These suggest the possibility of a companion to
the outflow source. There is a strong component of continuum emission in the
direction of the outflow, which supports the idea that the outflow cavity
provides a path for radiation to escape, thereby reducing the radiation
pressure on the accreted matter. The bulk of the emission observed close to the
outflow in the WFCAM and Spitzer bands is rotated counter clockwise with
respect to the outflow traced in H_2, which may be due to precession. The YSO
driving the outflow is identified in the Spitzer images. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the YSO is studied using available radiative transfer
models. A model fit to the SED of the central source tells us that the YSO has
a mass of 12.23 M_sun and that it is in an early stage of evolution.
