In recent experiments by Richardson et al. ((2010), PLoS ONE 5(3): e9621.
doi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0009621) ant motion out of the nest is shown to be a
non-stationary process intriguingly similar to the dynamics encountered in
\emph{physical aging} of glassy systems. Specifically, exit events can be
described as a Poisson process in logarithmic time, or, for short, a
log-Poisson process. Nouvellet et al.(J. Theor. Biol. 266, 573. (2010))
criticized these conclusions and performed new experiments where the exit
process could more simply be described by standard Poisson statistics. In their
reply, (J Theor. Biol. 269, 356-358 (2011)) Richardson et al. stressed that the
two sets of experiments were performed under very different conditions and
claimed that this was the likely source of the discrepancy. The focal point of
this work is whether log-Poisson and Poisson statistics both are possible under
different external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where
interacting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring
site on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the
ensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions
between ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are
defined and on a control parameter dubbed 'degree of stochasticity' (DS), the
dynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a
standard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can
be described as suggested by Richardson et al.
