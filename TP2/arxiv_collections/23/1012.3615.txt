We present a parameter-free Wilson-type lattice Dirac operator with an
81-point stencil for the covariant derivative and the Laplacian which attempts
to minimize the breaking of rotational symmetry near the boundary of the
Brillouin zone. The usefulness of this "Brillouin operator" in practical
applications is explored by studying the scaling of pseudoscalar decay
constants in quenched QCD, with rather good results in the physical charm
region. We also investigate the suitability of this operator as a kernel to the
overlap procedure. Here, the resulting overlap operator is found to be cheaper
to construct and significantly better localized than the variety with the
standard Wilson kernel.
