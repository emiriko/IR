An odd-odd nucleus is treated as the core-particle-hole system. The core is
described by the Bohr Hamiltonian. Different collective potentials of the core
are investigated. The odd particle and hole are assumed to be in the symmetric
[proton h11/2]x[neutron hole h11/2] configuration. Signatures of chirality in
the odd-odd nucleus spectra are observed. The sufficient condition for the
appearance of signatures of chirality in the core-particle-hole system is the
alpha-symmetry of the core provided the particle-hole configuration of the odd
valence particles is symmetric.
