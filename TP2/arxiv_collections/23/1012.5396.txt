It is popular nowadays to bring techniques from bibliometrics and
scientometrics into the world of digital libraries to analyze the collaboration
patterns and explore mechanisms which underlie community development. In this
paper we use the DBLP data to investigate the author's scientific career and
provide an in-depth exploration of some of the computer science communities. We
compare them in terms of productivity, population stability and collaboration
trends.Besides we use these features to compare the sets of topranked
conferences with their lower ranked counterparts.
