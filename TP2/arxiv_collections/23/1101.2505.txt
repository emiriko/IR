In a previous paper, we pointed out how a dimensional analysis of the
stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field allows to derive the field
equation of General Relativity. In this note, we comment an analogous reasoning
in presence of a 2-form, that allows to characterize the so called
electromagnetic stress-energy tensor.
