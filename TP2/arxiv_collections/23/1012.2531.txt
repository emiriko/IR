We make an extensive use of BLM approach to study details of predicting
higher order corrections based on the approach. This way we are able to test
two procedures to improve the prediction process. Beside the main line of the
two procedures it is found out that overall normalization could change BLM
patterns effectively. Finally we try to find out whether a BLM pattern is
sufficient for a prediction or not, and how one should use such a pattern.
