Pulsars are unique astrophysical laboratories because of their clock-like
timing precision, providing new ways to test general relativity and detect
gravitational waves. One impediment to high-precision pulsar timing experiments
is timing noise. Recently Lyne et al. (2010) showed that the timing noise in a
number of pulsars is due to quasi-periodic fluctuations in the pulsars'
spin-down rates and that some of the pulsars have associated changes in pulse
profile shapes. Here we show that a non-radial oscillation model based on
asteroseismological theory can explain these quasi-periodic fluctuations.
Application of this model to neutron stars will increase our knowledge of
neutron star emission and neutron star interiors and may improve pulsar timing
precision.
