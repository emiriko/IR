Diffractive excitation is usually described by the Good--Walker formalism for
low masses, and by the triple-Regge formalism for high masses. In the
Good-Walker formalism the cross section is determined by the fluctuations in
the interaction. By taking the fluctuations in the BFKL ladder into account, it
is possible to describe both low and high mass excitation in the Good-Walker
formalism. In high energy pp collisions the fluctuations are strongly
suppressed by saturation, which implies that pomeron exchange does not
factorise between DIS and pp collisions. The Dipole Cascade Model reproduces
the expected triple-Regge form for the bare pomeron, and the triple-pomeron
coupling is estimated.
