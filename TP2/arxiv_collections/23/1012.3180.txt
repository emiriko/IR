We shall prove that a moduli space of flat irreducible Lie algebroid
connections over a compact manifold has locally a natural structure of a smooth
differentiable space. This is a generalization of some well known results for
the moduli space of holomorphic structures on a complex vector bundle over a
compact complex manifold.
