Let $\langle K,\nu \rangle$ be a real closed valued field, and let
$S\subseteq K^n$ be an open semi-algebraic set. Using tools from model theory,
we find an algebraic characterization of rational functions which admit, on
$S$, only values in the valuation ring. We use this result to deduce a
criterion for a rational function to be bounded on an open semi algebraic
subset of some irreducible variety over a real closed field or over an ordered
field which is dense in its real closure.
