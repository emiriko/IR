The correlated oxide SmNiO3 (SNO) exhibits an insulator to metal transition
(MIT) at 130 {\deg}C in bulk form. We report on synthesis and electron
transport in SNO films deposited on LaAlO3 (LAO) and Si single crystals. X-ray
diffraction studies show that compressively strained single-phase SNO grows
epitaxially on LAO while on Si, mixed oxide phases are observed. MIT is
observed in resistance-temperature measurements in films grown on both
substrates, with charge transport in-plane for LAO/SNO films and out-of-plane
for Si/SNO films. Electrically-driven memristive behavior is realized in
LAO/SNO films, suggesting that SNO may be relevant for neuromorphic devices.
