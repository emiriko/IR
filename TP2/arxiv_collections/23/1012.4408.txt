We present a global analysis of available data on inclusive structure
functions and reduced cross sections measured in electron-proton scattering at
small values of Bjorken-x, x<0.01, including the latest data from HERA on
reduced cross sections. Our approach relies on the dipole formulation of DIS
together with the use of the non-linear running coupling BK equation for the
description of the small-x dynamics. We improve our previous studies by
including the heavy quark (charm and beauty) contribution to the reduced cross
sections, and also by considering a variable flavor scheme for the running of
the coupling. We obtain a good description of data, the fit parameters
remaining stable with respect to our previous analyses where only light quarks
were considered. The inclusion of the heavy quark contributions resulted in a
good description of available experimental data for the charm component of the
structure function and reduced cross section provide the initial transverse
distribution of heavy quarks was allowed to differ (more specifically, to have
a smaller radius) from that of the light flavors.
