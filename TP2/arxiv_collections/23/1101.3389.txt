We calculate mass shift of the $J/\Psi$ meson in nuclear matter arising from
the modification of $DD, DD^*$ and $D^*D^*$ meson loop contributions to the
$J/\Psi$ self-energy. The estimate includes the in-medium $D$ and $D^*$ meson
masses consistently. The $J/\Psi$ mass shift (scalar potential) calculated is
negative (attractive), and complementary to the attractive potential obtained
from the QCD color van der Waals forces. Some results for the $J/\Psi$-nuclear
bound state energies are also presented.
