We report our measurement on longitudinal spin transfer, D_LL, from high
energy polarized protons to $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons in
proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200 GeV$ with the STAR detector at
RHIC. The current measurements cover $\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda$ pseudorapidity
$|\eta| < 1.2$ and transverse momenta $p_T$ up to $4GeV/c$ using the data taken
in 2005. The longitudinal spin transfer is found to be D_LL= -0.03\pm 0.13
(stat) \pm 0.04(syst)$ for inclusive $\Lambda$ and $D_{LL} = -0.12 \pm
0.08(stat) \pm 0.03(syst)$ for inclusive $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons with $<eta> =
0.5$ and $<p_T> = 3.7 GeV/c$. The prospects with 2009 data and the future
measurements are also given.
