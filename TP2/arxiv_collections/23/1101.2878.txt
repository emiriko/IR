Recent LHC results concerning full jet-quenching in PbPb collisions have been
presented in terms of a jet asymmetry parameter, measuring the imbalance
between the transverse momenta of leading and subleading jets. We examine the
potential sensitivity of this distribution to fluctuations from the heavy-ion
background. Our results suggest that a detailed estimate of the true
fluctuations would be of benefit in extracting quantitative information about
jet quenching. We also find that the apparent impact of fluctuations on the jet
asymmetry distribution can depend significantly on the choice of low-pt
threshold used for the simulation of the hard pp events.
