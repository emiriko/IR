Modified Gravity (MOG) has been used successfully to explain the rotation
curves of galaxies, the motion of galaxy clusters, the Bullet Cluster, and
cosmological observations without the use of dark matter or Einstein's
cosmological constant. We review the main theoretical ideas and applications of
the theory to astrophysical and cosmological data.
