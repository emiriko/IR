We present quasi-stationary simulations of three-dimensional models with a
single absorbing configuration, namely the contact process (CP), the
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the contact replication
process (CRP). The moment ratios of the order parameters for the DP class in
three dimensions were set up using the well established SIS and CP models. We
also show that the mean-field exponent for d = 3 reported previously for the
CRP (Ferreira 2005 Phys. Rev. E 71 017104) is a transient observed in the
spreading analysis.
