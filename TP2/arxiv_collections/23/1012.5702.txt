Hadron structure advances provided by the Coulomb gauge model are summarized.
Highlights include a realistic description of the vacuum and meson spectrum
with chiral symmetry and dynamical flavor mixing, accurate hyperfine splittings
for light and heavy systems, glueball and hybrid meson predictions in agreement
with lattice QCD, and tetraquark results providing an understanding of the
observed pi_1(1400) having unconventional quantum numbers.
