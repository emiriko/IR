We investigate the stability of growing vesicles using the formalism of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The vesicles are growing due to the accretion of
lipids to the bilayer which forms the vesicle membrane. The thermodynamic
description is based on the hydrodynamics of a water{/}lipid mixture together
with a model of the vesicle as a discontinuous system in the sense of linear
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. This formulation allows the forces and fluxes
relevant to the dynamic stability of the vesicle to be identified. The method
is used to analyze the stability of a spherical vesicle against arbitrary
axisymmetric perturbations. It is found that there are generically two critical
radii at which changes of stability occur. In the case where the perturbation
takes the form of a single zonal harmonic, only one of these radii is physical
and is given by the ratio $2 L_p / L_\gamma$, where $L_p$ is the hydraulic
conductivity and $L_\gamma$ is the Onsager coefficient related to changes in
membrane area due to lipid accretion. The stability of such perturbations is
related to the value of $l$ corresponding to the particular zonal harmonic:
those with lower $l$ are more unstable than those with higher $l$. Possible
extensions of the current work and the need for experimental input are
discussed.
