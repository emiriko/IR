The problem of identifiability of model parameters for open quantum systems
is considered by investigating two-level dephasing systems. We discuss under
which conditions full information about the Hamiltonian and dephasing
parameters can be obtained. Using simulated experiments several different
strategies for extracting model parameters from limited and noisy data are
compared.
