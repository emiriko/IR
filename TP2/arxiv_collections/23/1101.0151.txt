We report magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and heat capacity measurements
on single crystals of the Sr(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and Sr1-yEuy(Fe0.88Co0.12)2As2
series. The optimal Co concentration for superconductivity in Sr(Fe1-xCox)2As2
is determined to be x ~ 0.12. Based on this we grew members of the
Sr1-yEuy(Fe0.88Co0.12)2As2 series so as to examine the effects of well defined,
local magnetic moments, on the superconducting state. We show that
superconductivity is gradually suppressed by paramagnetic Eu2+ doping and
coexists with antiferromagnetic ordering of Eu2+ as long as Tc > TN. For y >=
0.65, TN crosses Tc and the superconducting ground state (as manifested by zero
resistivity) abruptly disappears with evidence for competition between
superconductivity and local moment antiferromagnetism for y up to 0.72. It is
speculated that the suppression of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations of Fe
sublattice by coupling to the long range order of Eu2+ sublattice destroys bulk
superconductivity when TN > Tc.
