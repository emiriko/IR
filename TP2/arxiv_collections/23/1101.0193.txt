With extensive variational Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the uniform
resonating valence bond state(U-RVB) on square lattice is actually
antiferromagnetic long range ordered. The ordered moment is estimated to be
$m\approx 0.17$. Finite size scaling analysis on lattice up to lattice size of
$50\times 50$ shows that the spin structure factor at the antiferromagnetic
ordering wave vector follows perfectly the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{q}=(\pi,\pi)}
\simeq S_{0}+\alpha (1/L)^{5/4}$ behavior, where $L$ is linear scale of the
lattice. Such a behavior is quite unexpected from the slave Boson mean field
treatment or the Gutzwiller approximation of the uniform RVB state.
