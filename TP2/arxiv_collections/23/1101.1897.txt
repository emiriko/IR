Observations of quasar pairs represent a powerful tool in the study of the
intergalactic medium, providing in particular information on the quasar
radiative feedback not only along the line of sight, but also in the transverse
direction. In this paper, we present the spectra of the four quasar pairs we
observed so far with X-shooter, and we discuss two individual spectra affected
by the presence of a close quasar in the foreground.
