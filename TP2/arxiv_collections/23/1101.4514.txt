Cluster radioactivity in $^{114}$Ba is described as a spontaneous fission
with a large mass asymmetry within the self-consistent HFB theory. A new
fission valley with large octupole deformation is found in the potential energy
surface. The fragment mass asymmetry of this fission mode corresponds to the
expected one in cluster radioactivity with the emission of $^{16}$O predicted
with a very long half-life.
