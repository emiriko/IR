Electro-magnetic probes such as dileptons and photons are strong probes to
investigate the thermodynamical state of the early stages of collisions since
they leave the system unscathed. The PHENIX experiment has measured both
photons and dileptons in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions. An excess of dilepton
yield over the expected hadronic contribution is seen in 0.2-0.8\,GeV/$c^2$ in
Au+Au collisions, which is prominent in lower $p_T$ and most central. Direct
photons are measured through their internal conversion to electron pairs. We
saw a large enhancement in Au+Au collisions over p+p yield scaled by the number
of binary collisions. It turned out from the latest results on d+Au collisions
that this enhancement is not explainable by a nuclear effect.
