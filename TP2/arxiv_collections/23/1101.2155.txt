Mildly mixed coupled models include massive neutrinos and CDM--DE coupling.
We present new tests of their likelihood vs. recent data including WMAP7,
confirming it to exceed LCDM, although at ~2\sigma's. We then show the impact
on the physics of the dark components of neutrino mass detection in tritium
beta decay or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.
