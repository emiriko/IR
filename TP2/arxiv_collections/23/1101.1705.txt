We discuss natural connections between three objects: quadratic forms with
values in line bundles, conic bundles and quaternion orders. We use the even
Clifford algebra, and the Brauer-Severi Variety, and other constructions to
give natural bijections between these objects under appropriate hypothesis. We
then restrict to a surface base and we express the second Chern class of the
order in terms $K^3$ and other invariants of the corresponding conic bundle. We
find the conic bundles corresponding to minimal del Pezzo quaterion orders and
we discuss problems concerning their moduli.
