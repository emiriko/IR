A concentration property of the functional ${-}\log f(X)$ is demonstrated,
when a random vector X has a log-concave density f on $\mathbb{R}^n$. This
concentration property implies in particular an extension of the
Shannon-McMillan-Breiman strong ergodic theorem to the class of discrete-time
stochastic processes with log-concave marginals.
