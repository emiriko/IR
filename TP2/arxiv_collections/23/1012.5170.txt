We introduce version 2.0.0 of the computer program HiggsBounds. The program
tests neutral and charged Higgs sectors of new models against the current
exclusion bounds from LEP and the Tevatron. As input, it requires a selection
of model predictions, such as Higgs masses, branching ratios, effective
couplings and total decay widths. The program then uses the expected and
observed topological cross section limits from the Higgs searches to determine
whether a given parameter scenario of a model is excluded at the 95% C.L. by
those searches. Version 2.0.0 includes 39/53 LEP/Tevatron Higgs search
analyses, compared to 13/36 in the previous release (1.2.0). Among the newly
included analyses are LEP searches for neutral Higgs bosons (H) decaying
invisibly or into hadrons, LEP searches via the production modes (tau+ tau- H)
and (b b-bar H), Tevatron searches via (t t-bar H), and LEP and Tevatron
searches for charged Higgs bosons. Also, all Tevatron results presented at the
ICHEP'10 are included in version 2.0.0. In this talk, we explain the basic
ideas behind the implementation of HiggsBounds and provide a list of search
topologies implemented in version 2.0.0. Furthermore, we apply HiggsBounds
2.0.0 to (a) determine the allowed Higgs mass range for a simple 4th generation
model, (b) update/reproduce LEP/Tevatron Higgs exclusion plots for the MSSM
m_h-max benchmark scenario, and (c) show exclusion results for the scalar
sector of the Randall-Sundrum model.
