Zirconium (Zr), together with strontium and yttrium, is an important element
in the understanding of the Galactic nucleosynthesis. In fact, the triad
Sr-Y-Zr constitutes the first peak of s-process elements. Despite its general
relevance not many studies of the solar abundance of Zr were conducted. We
derive the zirconium abundance in the solar photosphere with the same CO5BOLD
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere that we previously used to
investigate the abundances of C-N-O. We review the zirconium lines available in
the observed solar spectra and select a sample of lines to determine the
zirconium abundance, considering lines of neutral and singly ionised zirconium.
We apply different line profile fitting strategies for a reliable analysis of
Zr lines that are blended by lines of other elements. The abundance obtained
from lines of neutral zirconium is very uncertain because these lines are
commonly blended and weak in the solar spectrum. However, we believe that some
lines of ionised zirconium are reliable abundance indicators. Restricting the
set to Zr II lines, from the CO5BOLD 3D model atmosphere we derive
A(Zr)=2.62+/-0.06, where the quoted error is the RMS line-to-line scatter.
