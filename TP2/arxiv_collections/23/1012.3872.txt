Comparing models and data of pulsating stars is a powerful way to understand
the stellar structure better.\beta Hyi is an evolved solar-type pulsator with
mixed modes in its frequency spectrum, making it very interesting for
asteroseismic studies.The goal of this work is to search for the best model of
the solar-type star \beta Hyi, based on up-to-date non-seismic and seismic
data.We present a revised list of frequencies for 33 modes, which we produced
by analysing the power spectrum of the published observations again using a new
weighting scheme that minimises the daily sidelobes.We ran several grids of
evolutionary models with different input parameters and different physics,
using the stellar evolutionary code ASTEC.For the models that are inside the
observed error box of \beta Hyi, we computed their frequencies with the
pulsation code ADIPLS.We used two approaches to find the model that oscillates
with the frequencies that are closest to the observed frequencies of \beta
Hyi:(i)we assume that the best model is the one that reproduces the star's
interior based on the radial oscillation frequencies alone, to which we have
applied the correction for the near-surface effects;(ii)we assume that the best
model is the one that produces the lowest value of the chi-square (\chi2), i.e.
that minimises the difference between the observed frequencies of all available
modes and the model predictions, after all model frequencies are corrected for
near-surface effects.We show that after applying this correction to the
frequencies of the best models, we can reproduce the observed modes well,
including the mixed modes.The model that gives the lowest value of the \chi2 is
a post-main-sequence model with a mass of 1.04 MSun and a metallicity slightly
lower than that of the Sun.Our results underscore the importance of having
individual frequencies to constrain the properties of the stellar model.
