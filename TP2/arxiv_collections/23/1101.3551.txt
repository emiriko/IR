Fibrils are thin elongated features visible in the solar chromosphere in and
around magnetized regions. Because of their visual appearance, they have been
traditionally considered a tracer of the magnetic field lines. For the first
time, we challenge that notion, by comparing their orientation to that of the
magnetic field, obtained via high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations
of Ca ii lines. The short answer to the question posed in the title is that
mostly yes, but not always.
