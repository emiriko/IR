We calculate the probability distribution of the Andreev reflection
eigenvalues R_n at the Fermi level in the circular ensemble of random-matrix
theory. Without spin-rotation symmetry, the statistics of the electrical
conductance G depends on the topological quantum number Q of the
superconductor. We show that this dependence is nonperturbative in the number N
of scattering channels, by proving that the p-th cumulant of G is independent
of Q for p<N/d (with d=2 or d=1 in the presence or in the absence of
time-reversal symmetry). A large-N effect such as weak localization cannot,
therefore, probe the topological quantum number. For small N we calculate the
full distribution P(G) of the conductance and find qualitative differences in
the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases.
