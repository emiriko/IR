Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold on which a trace-free and
divergence-free $\sigma \in W^{1,p}$ and a positive function $\tau \in
W^{1,p}$, $p > n$, are fixed. In this paper, we study the vacuum Einstein
constraint equations using the well known conformal method with data $\sigma$
and $\tau$. We show that if no solution exists then there is a non-trivial
solution of another non-linear limit equation on $1$-forms. This last equation
can be shown to be without solutions no solution in many situations. As a
corollary, we get existence of solutions of the vacuum Einstein constraint
equation under explicit assumptions which in particular hold on a dense set of
metrics $g$ for the $C^0$-topology.
