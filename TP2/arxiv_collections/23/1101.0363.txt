When speaking about molecular electronics, the obvious question which occurs
is how does one study it theoretically. The simplest theoretical model suitable
for application in molecular electronics is the two dimensional Hubbard model.
The aim of the present paper is to introduce this model, and give some examples
of the systems which it can describe. After a short mathematically oriented
discussion, it will be shown how to calculate the electrical conductivity of a
particular planar system: a rectangular lattice with mutually independent
conductivities along the two axes,but without using the 2D Hamiltonian. This
system could find applications in high Tc studies. It will finally be shown
that the electrical conductivity of graphene can be determined not by using the
full formalism of the $2D$ Hubbard model, but by a slight reformulation of the
Hamiltonian of the 1D Hubbard model
