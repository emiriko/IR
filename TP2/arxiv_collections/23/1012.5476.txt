In this article we consider two $m1$-branes at angle in the presence of the
background electric fields, in a partially compact spacetime. The branes have
motions along a common direction that is perpendicular to both of them. Using
the boundary state formalism, we calculate their interaction amplitude. Some
special cases of this interaction will be studied in detail.
