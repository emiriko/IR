We describe an algorithm to compute the geodesics in an arbitrary CAT(0)
cubical complex. A key tool is a correspondence between cubical complexes of
global non-positive curvature and posets with inconsistent pairs. This
correspondence also gives an explicit realization of such a complex as the
state complex of a reconfigurable system, and a way to embed any interval in
the integer lattice cubing of its dimension.
