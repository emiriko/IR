We studied the formation process of star clusters using high-resolution
N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamcs simulations of colliding galaxies. The
total number of particles is 1.2x10^8 for our high resolution run. The
gravitational softening is 5 pc and we allow gas to cool down to \sim 10 K.
During the first encounter of the collision, a giant filament consists of cold
and dense gas found between the progenitors by shock compression. A vigorous
starburst took place in the filament, resulting in the formation of star
clusters. The mass of these star clusters ranges from 10^{5-8} Msun. These star
clusters formed hierarchically: at first small star clusters formed, and then
they merged via gravity, resulting in larger star clusters.
