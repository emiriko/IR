The Semantic Web is one of the main efforts aiming to enhance human and
machine interaction by representing data in an understandable way for machines
to mediate data and services. It is a fast-moving and multidisciplinary field.
This study conducts a thorough bibliometric analysis of the field by collecting

utilizes a total of 44,157 papers with 651,673 citations from Scopus, and
22,951 papers with 571,911 citations from WOS. Based on these papers and
citations, it evaluates the research performance of the Semantic Web (SW) by
identifying the most productive players, major scholarly communication media,
highly cited authors, influential papers and emerging stars.
