We study the energy gap opening in the electronic spectrum of graphene
bilayers caused by asym- metric doping. Both substitutional impurities (boron
acceptors and nitrogen donors) and adsorbed potassium donors are considered.
The gap evolution with dopant concentration is compared to the situation in
which the asymmetry between the layers is induced by an external electric
field. The effects of adsorbed potassium are similar to that of an electric
field, but substitutional impurities behave quite differently, showing smaller
band gaps and a large sensitivity to disorder and sublattice occupation.
