We compute the production cross section of a top-antitop pair in association
with a jet at hadron colliders at next-to-leading order accuracy matched with
parton shower algorithms to make predictions at the hadron level. The parton
shower allows for including the decay of the top quarks at the leading order
accuracy. We use a framework based on three well established numerical codes,
the POWHEG-BOX, used for the calculation of the cross section, HELAC, which
generates the matrix elements for the Born-level, real emission and the virtual
part, and finally a parton shower program, such as PYTHIA or HERWIG, which
generate the parton-shower and hadronization.
