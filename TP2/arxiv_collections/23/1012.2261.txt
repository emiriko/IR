The similarities and differences between three commonly used formalisms for
radiative parton energy loss in hot strongly interacting matter are discussed.
The single gluon emission spectra are evaluated for a model system consisting
of a homogeneous medium with a fixed length, the `TECHQM brick'. Sizable
quantitative differences are found and the origins of these differences are
discussed.
