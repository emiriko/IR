We present recent studies of charmonium multiquark states. We use different
interacting models and numerical methods to study deeply bound four-quark
states and meson-meson molecules. No deeply bound four-quark states are found
in our analysis. A nice description of the X(3872) is obtained as a
$D\bar{D}^*-J/\Psi\omega$ coupled channel state.
