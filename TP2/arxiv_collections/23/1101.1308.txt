These notes present a detailed introduction to Maldacena's calculation of the
three-point function generated by the simplest class of inflationary models:
those with a single inflaton field whose potential satisfies the slow-roll
conditions and whose quantum fluctuations start in the asymptotic Bunch-Davies
vacuum state. The three-point function should be the most readily observed
evidence for non-Gaussianities amongst the primordial fluctuations produced by
inflation. In these inflationary theories the non-Gaussianities are predicted
to be extremely small, being naturally suppressed by the small slow-roll
parameters.
