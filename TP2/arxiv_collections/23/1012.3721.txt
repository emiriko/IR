We study expansions in non-integer negative base -{\beta} introduced by Ito
and Sadahiro. Using countable automata associated with (-{\beta})-expansions,
we characterize the case where the (-{\beta})-shift is a system of finite type.
We prove that, if {\beta} is a Pisot number, then the (-{\beta})-shift is a
sofic system. In that case, addition (and more generally normalization on any
alphabet) is realizable by a finite transducer. We then give an on-line
algorithm for the conversion from positive base {\beta} to negative base
-{\beta}. When {\beta} is a Pisot number, the conversion can be realized by a
finite on-line transducer.
