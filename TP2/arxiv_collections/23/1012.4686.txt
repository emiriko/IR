Accurate reconstruction of the mass of a resonance decaying to a pair of
$\tau$ leptons is challenging because of the presence of multiple neutrinos
from $\tau$ decays. The existing methods rely on either a partially
reconstructed mass, which has a broad spectrum that reduces sensitivity, or the
collinear approximation, which is applicable only to the relatively small
fraction of events. We describe a new technique, which provides an accurate
mass reconstruction of the original resonance and does not suffer from the
limitations of the collinear approximation. The major improvement comes from
replacing assumptions of the collinear approximation by a requirement that
mutual orientations of the neutrinos and other decay products are consistent
with the mass and decay kinematics of a $\tau$ lepton. This is achieved by
minimizing a likelihood function defined in the kinematically allowed phase
space region. In this paper we describe the technique and illustrate its
performance using $Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau$ and $H\to\tau\tau$ events simulated
with the realistic detector resolution. The method is also tested on a clean
sample of data $Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau$ events collected by the CDF experiment
at the Tevatron. We expect that this new technique will allow for a major
improvement in searches for the Higgs boson at both the LHC and the Tevatron.
