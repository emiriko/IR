We review the computation of the anomalous dimension of twist operators in
the planar limit of N=4 SYM using the asymptotic Bethe ansatz and demonstrate
how this quantity is obtained at weak, strong and intermediate values of the
coupling constant. The anomalous dimension of twist operators in the limit of
large Lorentz spin played a major role in the construction as well as in many
tests of the asymptotic Bethe equations, this aspect of the story is
emphasised.
