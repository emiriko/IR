Let R be a normal, equi-codimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring of dimension $d\geq
2$ with a canonical module. We give a sufficient criterion that establishes a
derived equivalence between the noncommutative crepant resolutions of R. When
$d\leq 3$ this criterion is always satisfied and so all noncommutative crepant
resolutions of R are derived equivalent. Our method is based on cluster tilting
theory for commutative algebras, developed in [IW10].
