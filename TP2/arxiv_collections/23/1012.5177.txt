Motivated by the on-going investigation of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ under
pressure, we study a variant of the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland (SS)
spin-1/2 model with two types of dimers. Combined with the frustration of the
SS model, this modification induces, in a large parameter range, a dimensional
reduction at low energies, with nearly decoupled effective S=1 Haldane chains
forming along one of the diagonals of the lattice. We also present evidence
that the intermediate plaquette solid phase of the undistorted SS model remains
stable in a finite region of the phase diagram.
