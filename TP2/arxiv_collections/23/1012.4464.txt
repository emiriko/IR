Low-density neutron matter is relevant to the study of neutron-rich nuclei
and neutron star crusts. Unpolarized neutron matter has been studied
extensively over a number of decades, while experimental guidance has recently
started to emerge from the field of ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we
study population-imbalanced neutron matter (possibly relevant to magnetars and
to density functionals of nuclei) applying a Quantum Monte Carlo method that
has proven successful in the field of cold atoms. We report on the first ab
initio simulations of superfluid low-density polarized neutron matter. For
systems with small imbalances, we find a linear dependence of the energy on the
polarization, the proportionality coefficient being dependent on the density.
We also present results for the momentum and pair distributions of the two
fermionic components.
