With the augmentation of IceCube by DeepCore, the prospect for detecting dark
matter annihilation in the Sun is much improved. To complement this
experimental development, we provide a thorough template analysis of the
particle physics issues that are necessary to precisely interpret the data. Our
study is about nitty-gritty and is intended as a framework for detailed work on
a variety of dark matter candidates. To accurately predict the source neutrino
spectrum, we account for spin correlations of the final state particles and the
helicity-dependence of their decays, and absorption effects at production. We
fully treat the propagation of neutrinos through the Sun, including neutrino
oscillations, energy losses and tau regeneration. We simulate the survival
probability of muons produced in the Earth by using the Muon Monte Carlo
program, reproduce the published IceCube effective area, and update the
parameters in the differential equation that approximates muon energy losses.
To evaluate the zenith-angle dependent atmospheric background event rate, we
track the Sun and determine the time it spends at each zenith angle.
Throughout, we employ neutralino dark matter as our example.
