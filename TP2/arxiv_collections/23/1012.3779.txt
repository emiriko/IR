Periodic light curve behavior predicted for some binary black hole systems
might be detected in large samples, such as the multi-million quasar sample
expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We investigate the
false-alarm probability for the discovery of a periodic signal in light curves
simulated using damped random walk (DRW) model. This model provides a good
description of observed light curves, and does not include periodic behavior.
We used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for a periodic signal in a
million simulated light curves that properly sample the DRW parameter space,
and the LSST cadence space. We find that even a very conservative threshold for
the false-alarm probability still yields thousands of "good" binary black hole
candidates. We conclude that the future claims for binary black holes based on
Lomb-Scargle analysis of LSST light curves will have to be interpreted with
caution.
