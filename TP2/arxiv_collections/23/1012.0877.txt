The book considers some theoretical questions of nuclear astro-physics
thermal energies and light atomic nuclei. For the analysis of re-actions is
used potential two cluster model of light nuclei with classifica-tion of states
by orbital schemes. On its basis photonuclear processes in p2H, p3H, p6Li,
p7Li, p9Be and p12C, and also 2H4He, 3H4He, 3He4He and 4He12C channels are
considered and astrophysical S - factors corre-sponding to them are calculated.
It is shown, that used methods allow to describe well available experimental
data in the field of astrophysical energies. This Book is written in Russian,
but will perhaps present certain interest.
