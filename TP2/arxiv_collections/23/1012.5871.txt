We construct a new minimal complex surface of general type with $p_g=0$,
$K^2=2$ and $H_1=\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ (in fact
$\pi_1^{\text{alg}}=\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$), which settles the existence
question for numerical Campedelli surfaces with all possible algebraic
fundamental groups. The main techniques involved in the construction are a
rational blow-down surgery and a $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothing theory.
