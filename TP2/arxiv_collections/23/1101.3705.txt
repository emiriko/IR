Stability control in laser is still an emerging field of research. In this
paper the dynamics of External cavity semiconductor lasers (ECSLs) is widely
studied applying the methods of chaos physics. The stability is analyzed
through plotting the Lyapunov exponent spectra, bifurcation diagrams and time
series. The oscillation of the electric field E has been reported to be either
periodic (P1,P2,..) or chaotic. The results of the study show that the rich
nonlinear dynamics of the electric field |E|^2 includes saddle node
bifurcations, quasi-periodicity and regular pulse packages. The issue of
finding the conditions for creating stable domains has been studied. By
considering the dynamical pumping current system coupled with laser, a method
for the creation of the stable domain has been introduced.
