We introduce a stochastic process with Wishart marginals: the generalised
Wishart process (GWP). It is a collection of positive semi-definite random
matrices indexed by any arbitrary dependent variable. We use it to model
dynamic (e.g. time varying) covariance matrices. Unlike existing models, it can
capture a diverse class of covariance structures, it can easily handle missing
data, the dependent variable can readily include covariates other than time,
and it scales well with dimension; there is no need for free parameters, and
optional parameters are easy to interpret. We describe how to construct the
GWP, introduce general procedures for inference and predictions, and show that
it outperforms its main competitor, multivariate GARCH, even on financial data
that especially suits GARCH. We also show how to predict the mean of a
multivariate process while accounting for dynamic correlations.
