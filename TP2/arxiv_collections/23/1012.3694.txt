We present a Monte Carlo study of the finite temperature properties of an
extended Hubbard-Peierls model describing one dimensional $\pi$-conjugated
polymers. The model incorporates electron-phonon and hyperfine interaction and
it is solved at the mean field level for half filling. In particular we explore
the model as a function of the strength of electron-electron and
electron-phonon interactions. At low temperature the system presents a
diamagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition as the electron-electron
interaction strength increases. At the same time by increasing the
electron-phonon coupling there is a transition from a homogeneous to a Peierls
dimerized geometry. As expected such a Peierls dimerized phase disappears at
finite temperature as a result of thermal vibrations. More intriguing is the
interplay between the electron-phonon and the electron-electron interactions at
finite temperature. In particular we demonstrate that for a certain region of
the parameter space there is a spin-crossover, where the system transits from a
low-spin to a high-spin state as the temperature increases. In close analogy to
standard spin-crossover in divalent magnetic molecules such a transition is
entropy driven. Finally we discuss the role played by the hyperfine interaction
over the phase diagram.
