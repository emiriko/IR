The method of "Isotropic Entanglement" (IE), inspired by Free Probability
Theory and Random Matrix Theory, predicts the eigenvalue distribution of
quantum many-body (spin) systems with generic interactions. At the heart is a
"Slider", which interpolates between two extrema by matching fourth moments.
The first extreme treats the non-commuting terms classically and the second
treats them isotropically. Isotropic means that the eigenvectors are in generic
positions. We prove Matching Three Moments and Slider Theorems and further
prove that the interpolation is universal, i.e., independent of the choice of
local terms. Our examples show that IE provides an accurate picture well beyond
what one expects from the first four moments alone.
