The generalized multispin Jahn-Teller model on a finite lattice or formally
equivalent Dicke model extended to two long-wavelength coherent bosons of
different frequencies is shown to exhibit a crossover between the
polaron-modified "quasi-normal" and the squeezed "radiation" domains. We
investigate effects of two kinds of interfering fluctuations on the phase
crossover and on statistical characteristics of boson complex spectra: (i)
Fluctuations in the electron subsystem- finite-size quantum fluctuations- are
responsible for the dephasing of the coherence in the radiation domain and for
the moderate occupation of the excited states in the normal domain. In the
quasiclassical limit, radiation phase implies existence of a coherent acoustic
super-radiant phase. (ii) Level-spacing fluctuations in excited boson level
subsystem with strong level repulsions. Related probability distributions are
shown to be non-universally spread between the limiting universal Wigner-Dyson
and Poisson distributions. We proved that the difference in boson frequencies
is responsible for reaching the most stochastic limit of the Wigner-Dyson
distribution. Instanton lattice as a sequence of tunneling events in the most
chaotic radiation domain exhibits maximal number of level-avoidings
(repulsions). The non-universality of the distributions is caused by boson
correlations which compete the level repulsions.
