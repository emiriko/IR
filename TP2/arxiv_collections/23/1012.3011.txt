Bipartite Correlation clustering is the problem of generating a set of
disjoint bi-cliques on a set of nodes while minimizing the symmetric difference
to a bipartite input graph. The number or size of the output clusters is not
constrained in any way. The best known approximation algorithm for this problem
gives a factor of 11. This result and all previous ones involve solving large
linear or semi-definite programs which become prohibitive even for modestly
sized tasks. In this paper we present an improved factor 4 approximation
algorithm to this problem using a simple combinatorial algorithm which does not
require solving large convex programs. The analysis extends a method developed
by Ailon, Charikar and Alantha in 2008, where a randomized pivoting algorithm
was analyzed for obtaining a 3-approximation algorithm for Correlation
Clustering, which is the same problem on graphs (not bipartite). The analysis
for Correlation Clustering there required defining events for structures
containing 3 vertices and using the probability of these events to produce a
feasible solution to a dual of a certain natural LP bounding the optimal cost.
It is tempting here to use sets of 4 vertices, which are the smallest
structures for which contradictions arise for Bipartite Correlation Clustering.
This simple idea, however, appears to be evasive. We show that, by modifying
the LP, we can analyze algorithms which take into consideration subgraph
structures of unbounded size. We believe our techniques are interesting in
their own right, and may be used for other problems as well.
