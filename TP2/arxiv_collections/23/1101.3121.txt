Integral transforms arising from the separable solutions to the Helmholtz
differential equation are presented. Pairs of these integral transforms are
related via Plancherel theorem and, ultimately, any of these integral
transforms may be calculated using only Fourier transforms. This result is used
to evaluate the mean value of momenta associated to the symmetries of the
reduced wave equation. As an explicit example, the orbital angular momenta of
plane and elliptic-cylindrical waves is presented.
