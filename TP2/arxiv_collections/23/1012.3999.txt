We review the duality and integrability of N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons
theory in three dimensions and IIA superstring theory on the background
AdS4xCP3. We introduce both of these models and describe how their degrees of
freedom are mapped to excitations of a long-range integrable spin-chain.
Finally, we discuss the properties of the Bethe equations, the S-matrix and the
algebraic curve that are special to this correspondence and differ from the
case of N=4 SYM theory and strings on AdS5xS5.
