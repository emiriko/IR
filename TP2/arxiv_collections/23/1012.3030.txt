Two fundamental objects in knot theory are the minimal genus surface and the
least area surface bounded by a knot in a 3-dimensional manifold. When the knot
is embedded in a general 3-manifold, the problems of finding these surfaces
were shown to be NP-complete and NP-hard respectively. However, there is
evidence that the special case when the ambient manifold is R^3, or more
generally when the second homology is trivial, should be considerably more
tractable. Indeed, we show here that a natural discrete version of the least
area surface can be found in polynomial time. The precise setting is that the
knot is a 1-dimensional subcomplex of a triangulation of the ambient
3-manifold. The main tool we use is a linear programming formulation of the
Optimal Bounding Chain Problem (OBCP), where one is required to find the
smallest norm chain with a given boundary. While the decision variant of OBCP
is NP-complete in general, we give conditions under which it can be solved in
polynomial time. We then show that the least area surface can be constructed
from the optimal bounding chain using a standard desingularization argument
from 3-dimensional topology. We also prove that the related Optimal Homologous
Chain Problem is NP-complete for homology with integer coefficients,
complementing the corresponding result of Chen and Freedman for mod 2 homology.
