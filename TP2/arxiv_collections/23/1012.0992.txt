Our objective is to demonstrate an inconsistency with both the original and
modern Everettian Many Worlds Interpretations. We do this by examining two
important corollaries of the universally valid quantum mechanics in the context
of the Quantum Brownian Motion (QBM) model: "Entanglement Relativity" and the
"parallel occurrence of decoherence." We conclude that the highlighted
inconsistency demands that either there is a privileged spatial structure of
the QBM model universe or that the Everettian Worlds are not physically real.
