The ATLAS Collaboration recently reported strong modifications of dijet
properties in heavy ion collisions. In this work, we discuss to what extent
these first data constrain already the microscopic mechanism underlying jet
quenching. Simple kinematic arguments lead us to identify a frequency
collimation mechanism via which the medium efficiently trims away the soft
components of the jet parton shower. Through this mechanism, the observed dijet
asymmetry can be accomodated with values of $\hat{q}\, L$ that lie in the
expected order of magnitude.
