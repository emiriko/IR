We present the first exact analysis of some of the temporal properties of
multivariate self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes, which
constitute powerful representations of a large variety of systems with bursty
events, for which past activity triggers future activity. The term
"multivariate" refers to the property that events come in different types, with
possibly different intra- and inter-triggering abilities. We develop the
general formalism of the multivariate generating moment function for the
cumulative number of first-generation and of all generation events triggered by
a given mother event (the "shock") as a function of the current time $t$. This
corresponds to studying the response function of the process. A variety of
different systems have been analyzed. In particular, for systems in which
triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension
directed or symmetric chain of influence in type space, we report a novel
hierarchy of intermediate asymptotic power law decays $\sim
1/t^{1-(m+1)\theta}$ of the rate of triggered events as a function of the
distance $m$ of the events to the initial shock in the type space, where $0 <
\theta <1$ for the relevant long-memory processes characterizing many natural
and social systems. The richness of the generated time dynamics comes from the
cascades of intermediate events of possibly different kinds, unfolding via a
kind of inter-breeding genealogy.
