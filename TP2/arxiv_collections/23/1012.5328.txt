Recent radio observations reveal the existence of mini radio lobes in active
galaxies with their scales of $\sim 10 {\rm pc}$. The lobes are expected to be
filled with shock accelerated electrons and protons. In this work, we examine
the photon spectra from the mini lobes, properly taking the hadronic processes
into account. We find that the resultant broadband spectra contain the two
distinct hadronic bumps in $\gamma$-ray bands, i.e., the proton synchrotron
bump at $\sim$ MeV and the synchrotron bump at $\sim$ GeV due to the secondary
electrons/positrons produced via photo-pion cascade. Especially when the
duration of particle injection is shorter than the lobe age, radio-dark
$\gamma$-ray lobes are predicted. The existence of the $\gamma$-ray lobes could
be testable with the future TeV-$\gamma$ telescope {\it CTA}.
