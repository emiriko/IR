Rauzy fractals are compact sets with fractal boundary that can be associated
with any unimodular Pisot irreducible substitution. These fractals can be
defined as the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of compact sets, where each set is
a renormalized projection of a finite union of faces of unit cubes. We exploit
this combinatorial definition to prove the connectedness of the Rauzy fractal
associated with any finite product of three-letter Arnoux-Rauzy substitutions.
