We present cluster decay studies of $^{56}$Ni$^*$ formed in heavy-ion
collisions using different Fermi density and nuclear radius parameters proposed
by various authors. Our study reveals that different technical parameters do
not alter the transfer structure of fractional yields significantly. The
cluster decay half-lives of different clusters lies within $\pm$10% for
different Fermi density parameters and nuclear radius, therefore, justify the
current set of parameters used in the literature for the calculations of
cluster decay.
