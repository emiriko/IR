Physically observable particles are assumed to result from an interaction
between massless positively and negatively oriented 2-component Weyl neutrinos.
A simple quantum mechanical analysis of a composite system of Weyl neutrinos of
opposite orientations with a certain specific interaction shows that such a
model can exhibit a 2-fold branching and defect in the total energy of the
system, which could then be interpreted as formation of massive particles.
