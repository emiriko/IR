The ATLAS Detector will be upgraded for higher intensity running of the LHC.
A long shutdown is envisioned in 2016 prior to the so-called Phase I running. A
new pixel layer, called the Insertable B-Layer (IBL), will be inserted at a
radius of about 3.2~cm between the existing Pixel Detector and a new (smaller
radius) beam-pipe. The IBL requires the development of several new technologies
to cope with the increased radiation level and pixel occupancy, as well as to
improve the physics performance of the existing Pixel Detector. The IBL project
provides a test of technologies for the Phase II upgrade of the entire ATLAS
tracker for luminosities around 10^35 cm^-2s^-1. An overview of the project
with particular emphasis on the IBL layout and expected performance as well as
the module development including hybridization technologies is presented.
