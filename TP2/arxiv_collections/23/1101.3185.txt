The operation of superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities, as used for
circuit quantum electrodynamics and kinetic inductance detectors, in
perpendicular magnetic fields normally leads to a reduction of the device
performance due to energy dissipating Abrikosov vortices. We experimentally
investigate the vortex induced energy losses in such Nb resonators with
different spatial distributions of micropatterned pinning sites (antidots) by
transmission spectroscopy measurements at 4.2 K. In comparison to resonators
without antidots we find a significant reduction of vortex induced losses and
thus increased quality factors over a broad range of frequencies and applied
powers in moderate fields.
