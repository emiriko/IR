We discuss the effects of a novel polaronic disorder in the recently proposed
two-fluid model for manganites. Using effective field theory as well as direct
numerical simulations, we show that this disorder can have dramatic effects in
terms of the transition from ferromagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal
upon hole-doping, including an Anderson localized regime where variable range
hopping may be observed.
