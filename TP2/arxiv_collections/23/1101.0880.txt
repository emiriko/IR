A concrete model for a 7-dimensional gauge theory under special holonomy is
proposed, within the paradigm outlined by Donaldson and Thomas, over the
asymptotically cylindrical G2-manifolds provided by Kovalev's noncompact
version of the Calabi conjecture. One obtains a solution to the $G_2$-instanton
equation from the associated Hermitian Yang-Mills problem, to which the methods
of Simpson et al. are applied, subject to a crucial asymptotic stability
assumption over the "boundary at infinity".
