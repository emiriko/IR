Recently, exact solutions of wormhole geometries supported by a nonminimal
curvature-matter coupling were found, where the nonminimal coupling minimizes
the violation of the null energy condition of normal matter at the throat. In
this brief report, we present a solution where normal matter satisfies the
energy conditions at the throat and it is the higher order curvature
derivatives of the nonminimal coupling that is responsible for the null energy
condition violation, and consequently for supporting the respective wormhole
geometries. For simplicity, we consider a linear R nonmiminal curvature-matter
coupling and an explicit monotonically increasing function for the energy
density. Thus, the solution found is not asymptotically flat, but may in
principle be matched to an exterior vacuum solution.
