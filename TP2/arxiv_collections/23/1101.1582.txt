We show by quantum Monte Carlo simulations of realistic Kondo lattice models
derived from electronic--structure calculations that multiple quantum critical
points can be realized in Plutonium--based materials. We place representative
systems including PuCoGa5 on a realistic Doniach phase diagram and identify the
regions where the magnetically mediated superconductivity could occur. Solution
of an inverse problem to restore the quasiparticle renormalization factor for
f-electrons is shown to be sufficiently good to predict the trends among
Sommerfeld coefficients and magnetism. Suggestion on the possible experimental
verification for this scenario is given for PuAs.
