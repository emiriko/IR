We present a quantitative study of the current-voltage characteristics (CVC)
of diffusive superconductor/ insulator/ ferromagnet/ superconductor (SIFS)
tunnel Josephson junctions. In order to obtain the CVC we calculate the density
of states (DOS) in the F/S bilayer for arbitrary length of the ferromagnetic
layer, using quasiclassical theory. For a ferromagnetic layer thickness larger
than the characteristic penetration depth of the superconducting condensate
into the F layer, we find an analytical expression which agrees with the DOS
obtained from a self-consistent numerical method. We discuss general properties
of the DOS and its dependence on the parameters of the ferromagnetic layer. In
particular we focus our analysis on the DOS oscillations at the Fermi energy.
Using the numerically obtained DOS we calculate the corresponding CVC and
discuss their properties. Finally, we use CVC to calculate the macroscopic
quantum tunneling (MQT) escape rate for the current biased SIFS junctions by
taking into account the dissipative correction due to the quasiparticle
tunneling. We show that the influence of the quasiparticle dissipation on the
macroscopic quantum dynamics of SIFS junctions is small, which is an advantage
of SIFS junctions for superconducting qubits applications.
