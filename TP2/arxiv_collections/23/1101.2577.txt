The vast parallelism, exceptional energy efficiency and extraordinary
information inherent in DNA molecules are being explored for computing, data
storage and cryptography. DNA cryptography is a emerging field of cryptography.
In this paper a novel encryption algorithm is devised based on number
conversion, DNA digital coding, PCR amplification, which can effectively
prevent attack. Data treatment is used to transform the plain text into cipher
text which provides excellent security
