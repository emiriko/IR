In this paper we calculate the contributions to the branching ratio of $B_s
\to \gamma\gamma$ from the charged Pseudo-Goldstone bosons appeared in one
generation Technicolor model. We find that the theoretical values of the
branching ratio, $BR(B_s\to\gamma\gamma)$, including the contributions of PGBs,
$P^\pm$ and $P^{\pm}_8$, are much different from the $SM$ prediction. The new
physics effects can be enhance 2-3 levels to $SM$ result. It is shown that the
decay $B_s\to \gamma\gamma$ can give the test the new physics signals from the
technicolor model.
