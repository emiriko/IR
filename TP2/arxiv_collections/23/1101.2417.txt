Non-Abelian discrete family symmetries play a pivotal role in the formulation
of models with tri-bimaximal lepton mixing. We discuss how to obtain symmetries
such as A4, semidirect product of Z7 and Z3, and Delta(27) from an underlying
SU(3) gauge symmetry. Higher irreducible representations are required to
achieve the spontaneous breaking of the continuous group. We present methods of
identifying the required vacuum alignments and discuss in detail the symmetry
breaking potentials.
