Epitaxial (001) BiFeO3 thin films grown on vicinal SrTiO3 substrates are
under large anisotropic stress from the substrates. The variations of the
crystallographic tilt angle and the c lattice constant, caused by the lattice
mismatch, along the film thickness were analyzed quantitatively using the X-ray
diffraction technique. By generalizing the Nagai model, we estimated how step
bunching resulted in the vertical lattice mismatch between adjacent BiFeO3
layers, which induced the strain relaxation and crystallographic tilt. The step
bunching was confirmed by the increased terrace width on the BiFeO3 surface.
