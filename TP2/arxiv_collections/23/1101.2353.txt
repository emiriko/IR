Astronomical Site testing data plays a vital role in the simulation, design,
evaluation and operation of adaptive optics systems for large telescope. We
present the example of TMT and its first light facilitiy adaptive optics system
NFIRAOS, and illustrate the many simulations done based on site testing data.
