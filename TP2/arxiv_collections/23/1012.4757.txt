We consider spin effects related to the random spin-orbit interaction in
graphene. Such a random interaction can result from the presence of ripples
and/or other inhomogeneities at the graphene surface. We show that the random
spin-orbit interaction generally reduces the spin dephasing (relaxation) time,
even if the interaction vanishes on average. Moreover, the random spin-orbit
coupling also allows for spin manipulation with an external electric field. Due
to the spin-flip interband as well as intraband optical transitions, the spin
density can be effectively generated by periodic electric field in a relatively
broad range of frequencies.
