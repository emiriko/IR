Tiling recognizable two-dimensional languages, also known as REC, generalize
recognizable string languages to two dimensions and share with them several
theoretical properties. Nevertheless REC is not closed under complementation
and the membership problem is NP-complete. This implies that this family REC is
intrinsically non-deterministic. The natural and immediate definition of
unambiguity corresponds to a family UREC of languages that is strictly
contained in REC. On the other hand this definition of unambiguity leads to an
undecidability result and therefore it cannot correspond to any deterministic
notion. We introduce the notion of line-unambiguous tiling recognizable
languages and prove that it corresponds or somehow naturally introduces
different notions of determin- ism that define a hierarchy inside REC.
