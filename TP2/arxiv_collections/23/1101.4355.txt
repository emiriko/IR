The paper is devoted to complete proofs of theorems on consistency on cubic
lattices for $3 \times 3$ determinants. The discrete nonlinear equations on
$\mathbb{Z}^2$ defined by the condition that the determinants of all $3 \times
3$ matrices of values of the scalar field at the points of the lattice
$\mathbb{Z}^2$ that form elementary $3 \times 3$ squares vanish are considered;
some explicit concrete conditions of general position on initial data are
formulated; and for arbitrary initial data satisfying these concrete conditions
of general position, theorems on consistency on cubic lattices (a consistency
"around a cube") for the considered discrete nonlinear equations on
$\mathbb{Z}^2$ defined by $3 \times 3$ determinants are proved.
