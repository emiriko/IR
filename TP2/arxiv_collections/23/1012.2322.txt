A model is proposed to study the process of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in
cancer cells. The model accounts for the role played by the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in regulating the oxygen intake. VEGF-A is
dynamically controlled by the HIF-1alpha concentration. If not degraded,
HIF-1alpha can bind to the subunit termed HIF-1beta and so experience
translocation to the nucleus, to exert its proper transcriptional activity. The
delicate balance between these opposing tendencies translates into the
emergence of distinct macroscopic behaviors in terms of the associated
molecular concentrations that we here trace back to normoxia, hypoxia and death
regimes. These aspects are firstly analyzed with reference to the ideal
mean-field scenario. Stochastic fluctuations are also briefly discussed and
shown to seed a cooperative interaction among cellular units, competing for the
same oxygen reservoir.
