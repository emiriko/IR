The differential cross sections for cold neutron scattering in mosaic
deuterium crystals have been calculated for various target temperatures. The
theoretical results are compared with the recent experimental data for the
neutron wavelengths $\lambda\approx$~1--9~\AA. It is shown that the structures
of observed Bragg peaks can be explained by the mosaic spread of about
$3^{\circ}$ and contributions from a~limited number of crystal orientations.
Such a~crystal structure should be also taken into account in ultracold neutron
upscattering due to the coherent phonon annihilation in solid deuterium.
