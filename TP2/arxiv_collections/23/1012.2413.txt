We prove an inequality between horizon area and angular momentum for a class
of axially symmetric black holes. This class includes initial conditions with
an isometry which leaves fixed a two-surface. These initial conditions have
been extensively used in the numerical evolution of rotating black holes. They
can describe highly distorted black holes, not necessarily near equilibrium. We
also prove the inequality on extreme throat initial data, extending previous
results.
