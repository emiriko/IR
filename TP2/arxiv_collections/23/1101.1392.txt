We prove that the first complex homology of the Johnson subgroup of the
Torelli group $T_g$ is a non-trivial unipotent $T_g$-module for all $g\ge 4$
and give an explicit presentation of it as a $\Sym H_1(T_g,\C)$-module when
$g\ge 6$. We do this by proving that, for a finitely generated group $G$
satisfying an assumption close to formality, the triviality of the restricted
characteristic variety implies that the first homology of its Johnson kernel
$K$ is a nilpotent module over the corresponding Laurent polynomial ring,
isomorphic to the infinitesimal Alexander invariant of the associated graded
Lie algebra of $G$. In this setup, we also obtain a precise nilpotence test.
