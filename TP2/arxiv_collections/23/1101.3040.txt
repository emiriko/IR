A two-dimensional generalized cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with
complex coefficients for the group dispersion and nonlinear terms is used to
investigate the evolution of a finite-amplitude localized initial perturbation.
It is found that modulation of the latter can lead to side-band formation, wave
condensation, collapse, turbulence, and inverse cascade, although not all
together nor in that order.
