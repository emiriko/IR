It is known that in the regime of superlinear diffusion, characterized by
zero integral friction (vanishing integral of the memory function), the
generalized Langevin equation may have non-ergodic solutions which do not relax
to equilibrium values. It is shown that the equation may have non-ergodic
(non-stationary) solutions even if the integral of the memory function is
finite and diffusion is normal.
