We unify two recent results concerning equilibration in quantum theory. We
first generalise a proof of Reimann [PRL 101,190403 (2008)], that the
expectation value of 'realistic' quantum observables will equilibrate under
very general conditions, and discuss its implications for the equilibration of
quantum systems. We then use this to re-derive an independent result of Linden
et. al. [PRE 79, 061103 (2009)], showing that small subsystems generically
evolve to an approximately static equilibrium state. Finally, we consider
subspaces in which all initial states effectively equilibrate to the same
state.
