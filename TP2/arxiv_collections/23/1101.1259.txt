Hydrogen produced from the photocatalytic splitting of water is one of the
reliable alternatives to replace the polluting fossil and the radioactive
nuclear fuels. Here, we provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of blue-
and red-shifting O$-$H covalent bonds within a single water molecule adsorbed
on MgO surface as a result of asymmetric displacement polarizabilities. The
adsorbed H-O-H on MgO gives rise to one weaker H-O bond, while the other O-H
covalent bond from the same adsorbed water molecule compensates this effect
with a stronger bond. The weaker bond (nearest to the surface), the interlayer
tunneling electrons and the silver substrate are shown to be the causes for the
smallest dissociative activation energy on MgO monolayer. The origin that is
responsible to initiate the splitting mechanism is proven to be due to the
changes in the polarizability of an adsorbed water molecule, which are further
supported by the temperature-dependent static dielectric constant measurements
for water below the first-order electronic-phase transition temperature.
