We present observations of the formation, propagation and decay of vortex-
shaped features in coronal images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
associated with an eruption starting at about 2:30UT on Apr 8, 2010. The series
of vortices formed along the interface between an erupting (dimming) region and
the surrounding corona. They ranged in size from several to ten arcseconds, and
traveled along the interface at 6-14 km/s. The features were clearly visible in
six out of the seven different EUV wavebands of the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA). Based on the structure, formation, propagation and decay of
these features, we identified these features as the first observations of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability in the corona in EUV. The interpretation is
supported by linear analysis and by MHD model of KH instability. We conclude
that the instability is driven by the velocity shear between the erupting and
closed magnetic field of the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). The shear flow driven
instability can play an important role in energy transfer processes in coronal
plasma.
