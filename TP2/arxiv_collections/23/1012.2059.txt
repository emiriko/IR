The quantum many-body problem can be rephrased as a variational determination
of the two-body reduced density matrix, subject to a set of N-representability
constraints. The mathematical problem has the form of a semidefinite program.
We adapt a standard primal-dual interior point algorithm in order to exploit
the specific structure of the physical problem. In particular the matrix-vector
product can be calculated very efficiently. We have applied the proposed
algorithm to a pairing-type Hamiltonian and studied the computational aspects
of the method. The standard N-representability conditions perform very well for
this problem.
