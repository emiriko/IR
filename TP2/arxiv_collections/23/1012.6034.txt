The calculation of the long-distance contribution to the $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mass
matrix is divided into three parts: First, the calculation of the matrix
element between kaon states of the product of two space-time integrated,
$\Delta S=1$, four-quark weak operators. Second an RI/MOM subtraction to remove
the short distance part of this matrix element in a fashion consistent with the
calculation of the physical short distance part. Third an application of the
Lellouch-Luscher method, generalized to second order in the weak interactions,
to control finite volume errors. Such an approach promises to permit accurate
lattice calculation of the $K_L$-$K_S$ mass difference and the long-distance
contributions to $\epsilon_K$.
