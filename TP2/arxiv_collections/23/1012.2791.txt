Observations of the Sun and of Sun-like stars provide access to different
aspects of stellar magnetic activity that, when combined, help us piece
together a more comprehensive picture than can be achieved from only the solar
or the stellar perspective. Where the Sun provides us with decent spatial
resolution of, e.g., magnetic bipoles and the overlying dynamic, hot
atmosphere, the ensemble of stars enables us to see rare events on at least
some occasions. Where the Sun shows us how flux emergence, dispersal, and
disappearance occur in the complex mix of polarities on the surface, only
stellar observations can show us the activity of the ancient or future Sun. In
this review, I focus on a comparison of statistical properties, from
bipolar-region emergence to flare energies, and from heliospheric events to
solar energetic particle impacts on Earth. In doing so, I point out some
intriguing correspondences as well as areas where our knowledge falls short of
reaching unambiguous conclusions on, for example, the most extreme
space-weather events that we can expect from the present-day Sun. The
difficulties of interpreting stellar coronal light curves in terms of energetic
events are illustrated with some examples provided by the SDO, STEREO, and GOES
spacecraft.
