In this Letter, we study the transient electron transfer phenomena of
single-electron devices with alternating external gate voltages. We obtain a
high frequency limit for pumping electrons one at a time in single-electron
devices. Also, we find that in general the electrical current is not
proportional to the frequency of the external signals in the single-electron
devices, due to the strong quantum coherence tunneling effect.
