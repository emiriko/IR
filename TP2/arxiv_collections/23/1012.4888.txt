We have performed quantum molecular-dynamics simulations for methane under
shock compressions up to 80 GPa. We obtain good agreement with available
experimental data for the principal Hugoniot, derived from the equation of
state. A systematic study of the optical conductivity spectra, one-particle
density of states, and the distributions of the electronic charge over
supercell at Hugoniot points shows that the transition of shocked methane to a
metallic state takes place close to the density at which methane dissociates
significantly into molecular hydrogen and some long alkane chains. Through
analyzing the pair correlation function, we predict the chemical picture of the
shocked methane. In contrast to usual assumptions used for high pressure
modeling of methane, we find that no diamond-like configurations occurs for the
whole density-temperature range studied.
