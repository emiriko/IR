Displays based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology are
appearing on many mobile devices. Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED
displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In
particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors. This has
made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of
bright colors.
  To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and
realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages
with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by
the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with
important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time,
and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a
browser engine. According to measure-ments with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is
able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and
reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable
delay.
