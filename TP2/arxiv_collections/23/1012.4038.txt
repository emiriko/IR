Collisions of heavy ions (nuclei) at ultra-relativistic energies (sqrt(s_NN)
>> 10 GeV per nucleon-nucleon collision in the centre of mass system) are
regarded as a unique tool to produce in the laboratory a high energy density
and high temperature state of strongly-interacting matter. In this short
review, we will discuss the expected features of this hot and dense state,
describe indications on its properties emerged from the experimental programs
at the CERN-SPS and BNL-RHIC accelerators, and finally outlook the perspectives
for the forthcoming heavy-ion runs at the CERN-LHC.
