It is well-known that the variations of Goos-H\"anchen shifts (GHSs) are
closely associated with the enengy-flux provided by evanescent states in the
case of total internal reflection. However, when the frustrated internal total
reflection (FTIR) is realized with a Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA)
double-prism system operated in the microwave frequency range of 8.2 GHz to
12.4 GHz, we observe that the GH shifts for the reflected beam show periodic
resonances with varying the operation frequency or the air layer thickness,
which is different from the variation of the corresponding reflected energy.
Moreover, in another FTIR based system introduced by a composite absorptive
material slab with a two-dimensional top layer of frequency selective surface
(FSS), the GHSs for reflected beam are discovered as not only resonant but also
negative with the incidence of transverse electric that is TE polarized.
