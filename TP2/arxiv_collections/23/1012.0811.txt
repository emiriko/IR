We present a re-analysis of archival HST/NICMOS transmission spectroscopy of
the exoplanet system, HD 189733, from which detections of several molecules
have been claimed. As expected, we can replicate the transmission spectrum
previously published when we use an identical model for the systematic effects,
although the uncertainties are larger as we use a residual permutation
algorithm in an effort to account for instrumental systematics. We also find
that the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when slightly changing
the instrument model, and conclude that the NICMOS transmission spectrum is too
dependent on the method used to remove systematics to be considered a robust
detection of molecular species, given that there is no physical reason to
believe that the baseline flux should be modelled as a linear function of any
chosen set of parameters.
