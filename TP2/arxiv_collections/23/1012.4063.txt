A new simulation box setup is introduced for the precise description of the
wavepacket evolution of two electronic systems in intense laser pulses. In this
box, the regions of the hydrogen molecule H$_{2} $, and singly and doubly
ionized species, H$_{2}^+ $ and H$_{2}^{+2} $, are well recognized and their
time-dependent populations are calculated at different laser field intensities.
In addition, some new regions are introduced and characterized as quasi-double
ionization and their time-dependencies on the laser field intensity are
calculated and analyzed. The adopted simulation box setup is special in that it
assures proper evaluation of the second ionization. In this study, the dynamics
of the electrons and nuclei of the hydrogen molecule are separated based on the
adiabatic approximation. The time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger and Newton
equations are solved simultaneously for the electrons and the nuclei,
respectively. Laser pulses of 390 nm wavelength at four different intensities
(i.e. $ 1\times10^{14} $, $ 5\times10^{14} $, $ 1\times10^{15} $, and $
5\times10^{15} $ W cm$^{-2}$) are used in these simulations. Details of the
central H$_{2} $ region is also presented and discussed. This region is divided
into four sub-regions related to the ionic state H$^+$H$^-$ and covalent
(natural) state HH. The effect of the motion of nuclei on the enhanced
ionization is discussed. Finally, some different time-dependent properties are
calculated and their dependencies on the intensity of the laser pulse are
studied, and their correlations with the populations of different regions are
analyzed.
