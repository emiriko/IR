The notion of silting mutation was introduced by Iyama and the author. In
this paper we mainly study silting mutation for self-injective algebras and
prove that any representation-finite symmetric algebra is tilting-connected.
Moreover we give some sufficient conditions for a Bongartz-type Lemma to hold
for silting objects.
