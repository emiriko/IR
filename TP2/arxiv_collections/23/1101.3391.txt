The efficient repair of cellular DNA is essential for the maintenance and
inheritance of genomic information. In order to cope with the high frequency of
spontaneous and induced DNA damage, a multitude of repair mechanisms have
evolved. These are enabled by a wide range of protein factors specifically
recognizing different types of lesions and finally restoring the normal DNA
sequence. This work focuses on the repair factor XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum
complementation group C), which identifies bulky DNA lesions and initiates
their removal via the nucleotide excision repair pathway. The binding of XPC to
damaged DNA can be visualized in living cells by following the accumulation of
a fluorescent XPC fusion at lesions induced by laser microirradiation in a
fluorescence microscope. In this work, an automated image processing pipeline
is presented which allows to identify and quantify the accumulation reaction
without any user interaction. The image processing pipeline comprises a
preprocessing stage where the image stack data is filtered and the nucleus of
interest is segmented. Afterwards, the images are registered to each other in
order to account for movements of the cell, and then a bounding box enclosing
the XPC-specific signal is automatically determined. Finally, the
time-dependent relocation of XPC is evaluated by analyzing the intensity change
within this box. Comparison of the automated processing results with the manual
evaluation yields qualitatively similar results. However, the automated
analysis provides more accurate, reproducible data with smaller standard
errors. The image processing pipeline presented in this work allows for an
efficient analysis of large amounts of experimental data with no user
interaction required.
