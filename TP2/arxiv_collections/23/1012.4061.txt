We construct generalized solutions to the ultradiscrete KdV equation,
including the so-called negative solition solutions. The method is based on the
ultradiscretization of soliton solutions to the discrete KdV equation with
gauge transformation. The conserved quantities of the ultradiscrete KdV
equation are shown to be constructed in a similar way to those for the box-ball
system.
