We obtain a lower bound on the sum of two orthogonal spin component variances
in a plane. This gives a novel planar uncertainty relation which holds even
when the Heisenberg relation is not useful. We investigate the asymptotic,
large $J$ limit, and derive the properties of the planar quantum squeezed
states that saturate this uncertainty relation. These states extend the concept
of spin squeezing to any two conjugate spin directions. We show that planar
quantum squeezing can be achieved experimentally as the ground state of a
Bose-Einstein condensate in two coupled potential wells with a critical
attractive interaction. These states reduce interferometric phase noise at all
phase angles simultaneously. This is useful for one-shot interferometric
phase-measurements where the measured phase is completely unknown. Our results
can also be used to derive entanglement criteria for multiple spins $J$ at
separated sites, with applications in quantum information.
