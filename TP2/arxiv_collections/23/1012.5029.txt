We consider how trapped molecules can be sympathetically cooled by ultracold
atoms. As a prototypical system, we study LiH molecules co-trapped with
ultracold Li atoms. We calculate the elastic and inelastic collision cross
sections of LiH + Li with the molecules initially in the ground state and in
the first rotationally excited state. We then use these cross sections to
simulate sympathetic cooling in a static electric trap, an ac electric trap,
and a microwave trap. In the static trap we find that inelastic losses are too
great for cooling to be feasible for this system. The ac and microwave traps
confine ground-state molecules, and so inelastic losses are suppressed.
However, collisions in the ac trap can take molecules from stable trajectories
to unstable ones and so sympathetic cooling is accompanied by trap loss. In the
microwave trap there are no such losses and sympathetic cooling should be
possible.
