Infrared absorption study has been carried out on a series of half doped
manganites, $La_{0.5}Ca_{0.5-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}$ $(0.1\leq x\leq0.5)$, with
varying magnetic ground state. The charge ordering transition observed in
samples with {\normalsize $x\leq0.3$ is accompanied by a mode at
$\sim525cm^{-1}$ in addition to the stretching mode at $615cm^{-1}$ and bending
mode at $400cm^{-1}$. Phonon hardening is found to occur below the CE - type
antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. The value of the insulating gap
decreases on doping with Sr from $727cm^{-1}$ to $615cm^{-1}.$}
