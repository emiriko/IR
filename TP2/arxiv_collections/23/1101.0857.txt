Elastic sheets with macroscopic dimensions are easy to deform by bending and
stretching. Yet shaping nanometric sheets by mechanical manipulation is hard.
Here we show that nanoparticle self-assembly could be used to this end. We
demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that spherical nanoparticles adhering to
the outer surface of an elastic nanotube can self-assemble into linear
structures as a result of curvature-mediated interactions. We find that
nanoparticles arrange into rings or helices on stretchable nanotubes, and as
axial strings on nanotubes with high rigidity to stretching. These
self-assembled structures are inextricably linked to a variety of deformed
nanotube profiles, which can be controlled by tuning the concentration of
nanoparticles, the nanoparticle-nanotube diameter ratio and the elastic
properties of the nanotube. Our results open the possibility of designing
nanoparticle-laden tubular nanostructures with tailored shapes, for potential
applications in materials science and nanomedicine.
