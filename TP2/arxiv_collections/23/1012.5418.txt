Distribution of the transmission coefficient T of a long system with a
correlated Gaussian disorder is studied analytically and numerically in terms
of the generalized Lyapunov exponent (LE) and the cumulants of lnT. The effect
of the disorder correlations on these quantities is considered in weak,
moderate and strong disorder for different models of correlation. Scaling
relations between the cumulants of lnT are obtained. The cumulants are treated
analytically within the semiclassical approximation in strong disorder, and
numerically for an arbitrary strength of the disorder. A small correlation
scale approximation is developed for calculation of the generalized LE in a
general correlated disorder. An essential effect of the disorder correlations
on the transmission statistics is found. In particular, obtained relations
between the cumulants and between them and the generalized LE show that, beyond
weak disorder, transmission fluctuations and deviation of their distribution
from the log-normal form (in a long but finite system) are greatly enhanced due
to the disorder correlations. Parametric dependence of these effects upon the
correlation scale is presented.
