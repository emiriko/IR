Systems consisting of few interacting fermions are the building blocks of
matter with atoms and nuclei being the most prominent examples. We have created
an artificial few-body quantum system with complete control over the system's
quantum state using ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical dipole trap. We
deterministically prepare ground state systems consisting of one to ten
particles with fidelities of ~ 90%. We can tune the inter-particle interactions
to arbitrary values using a Feshbach resonance and have observed the
interaction-induced energy shift for a pair of repulsively interacting atoms.
With this work, quantum simulation of strongly correlated fewbody systems has
become possible. In addition, these microscopic quantum systems can be used as
building blocks for scalable quantum information processing.
