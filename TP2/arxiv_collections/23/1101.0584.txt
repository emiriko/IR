The detection of gravitational waves from compact binaries relies on a
computationally burdensome processing of gravitational-wave detector data. The
parameter space of compact-binary-coalescence gravitational waves is large and
optimal detection strategies often require nearly redundant calculations.
Previously, it has been shown that singular value decomposition of search
filters removes redundancy. Here we will demonstrate the use of singular value
decomposition for a composite detection statistic. This can greatly improve the
prospects for a computationally feasible rapid detection scheme across a large
compact binary parameter space.
