The paper deals with joint state and parameter estimation for nonlinear
continuous-time systems. Based on a guaranteed LPV approximation, the set
adaptive observers design problem is solved avoiding the exponential complexity
obstruction usually met in the set-membership parameter estimation. Potential
application to fault diagnosis is considered. The efficacy of the proposed set
adaptive observers is demonstrated on several examples.
