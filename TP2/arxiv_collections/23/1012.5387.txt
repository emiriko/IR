Neutrino energy losses through neutral weak currents in the triplet-spin
superfluid neutron liquid are studied for the case of condensate involving
several magnetic quantum numbers. Low-energy excitations of the multicomponent
condensate in the timelike domain of the energy and momentum are analyzed.
Along with the well-known excitations in the form of broken Cooper pairs, the
theoretical analysis predicts the existence of collective waves of spin density
at very low energy. Because of a rather small excitation energy of spin waves,
their decay leads to a substantial neutrino emission at the lowest
temperatures, when all other mechanisms of neutrino energy loss are killed by a
superfluidity. Neutrino energy losses caused by the pair recombination and
spin-wave decays are examined in all of the multicomponent phases that might
represent the ground state of the condensate, according to modern theories, and
for the case when a phase transition occurs in the condensate at some
temperature. Our estimate predicts a sharp increase in the neutrino energy
losses followed by a decrease, along with a decrease in the temperature, that
takes place more rapidly than it would without the phase transition. We
demonstrate the important role of the neutrino radiation caused by the decay of
spin waves in the cooling of neutron stars.
