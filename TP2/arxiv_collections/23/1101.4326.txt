We calibrate the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) for electron impact
excitation processes empirically. Differential cross sections (DCS) for the
excitation of the $2p^53s$, $2p^53p$,$2p^54s$, and $2p^54p$ configurations of
Ne and the $3p^54s$ and $3p^54p$ configurations of Ar by electron impact are
calculated using DWBA for incident energies between 20 and 100 eV. The
calculated results are compared with the absolute experimental measurements and
other theoretical results. We found that the structure of the DCS can be well
reproduced by the DWBA model while the magnitude is overestimated for most
cases considered here. The differences in magnitude between DWBA and experiment
are used to test the calibration of DWBA such that the DWBA can be used to
describe laser-induced electron impact excitation processes. These processes
are involved in the non-sequential double ionization of atoms in strong laser
fields.
