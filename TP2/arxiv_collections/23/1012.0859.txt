We present a family of non-CSS quantum error-correcting code consisting of
geometrically local stabilizer generators on a 3D lattice. We study the
Hamiltonian constructed from ferromagnetic interaction of overcomplete set of
local stabilizer generators. The degenerate ground state of the system is
characterized by a quantum error-correcting code whose number of encoded qubits
are equal to the second Betti number of the manifold. These models (i) have
solely local interactions; (ii) admit a strong-weak duality relation with an
Ising model on a dual lattice; (iii) have topological order in the ground
state, some of which survive at finite temperature; and (iv) behave as
classical memory at finite temperature.
