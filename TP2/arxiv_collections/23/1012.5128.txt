We study temporal variations in the amplitudes and widths of high-degree
acoustic modes in the quiet and active Sun by applying ring-diagram technique
to the GONG+ and MDI Dopplergrams during the declining phase of cycle 23. The
increase in amplitudes and decrease in line-widths in the declining phase of
the solar activity is in agreement with previous studies. A similar solar cycle
trend in the mode parameters is also seen in the quiet-Sun regions but with a
reduced magnitude. Moreover, the amplitudes obtained from GONG+ data show
long-term variations on top of the solar cycle trend.
