The horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GC) is mainly
governed by metallicity. The second parameter problem, well known since the
60's, states that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the observed HB
morphology of many GCs. Despite many efforts to resolve this issue, the second
parameter phenomenon still remains without a satisfactory explanation. We have
analyzed blue, red-HB, and RR-Lyrae stars in the GC M4 and studied their Fe,
Na, and O abundances. Our goal is to investigate possible connections between
the bimodal HB of M4 and the chemical signatures of the two stellar populations
recently discovered among red giants of this cluster. We obtained
FLAMES-UVES/GIRAFFE spectra of a sample of 22 stars covering the HB from the
red to the blue region. While iron has the same abundance in both the red and
blue-HB segment, the red-HB is composed of stars with scaled-solar sodium
abundances, while the blue-HB stars are all sodium enhanced and oxygen
depleted. The RR-Lyrae are Na-poor, as the red-HB stars, and O-rich. This is
what we expect if the blue-HB consists of a second generation of stars formed
from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar population through
high-temperature hydrogen-burning processes that include the CNO, NeNa, and
MgAl cycles and are therefore expected to be He-rich. According to this
scenario, the sodium and oxygen pattern detected in the blue and red-HB
segments suggests helium as the second parameter that rules the HB morphology
in M4.
