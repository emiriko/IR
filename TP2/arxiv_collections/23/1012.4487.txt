Museum stores represent integral parts of the museums that have also a lot to
benefit from a successful presence on the web arena. In addition to traditional
web sites, carefully designed electronic commerce (e-commerce) sites may
increase the potential of museum stores offering possibilities for on-line
shopping and other commercial functions. In parallel, the recent convergence of
the traditionally separate technologies of the Internet and mobile telephony
has brought the concept of 'wireless Internet' into the spotlight. Within this
context, 'mobile commerce' (m-commerce) is a relatively new trend that
represents a natural extension of e-commerce into the wireless world.
M-commerce refers to electronic business transactions and differentiates from
e-commerce since it involves the use of mobile devices and wireless medium
rather than wired. The unique characteristics of mobile computing bring forward
new challenges and opportunities for museum stores. This article presents the
design and implementation of an e-commerce and an m-commerce museum shop
application. The aim is to evaluate and compare the two applications in terms
of several parameters, such as available technologies, strengths and
limitations, design requirements, usability, interaction speed, usage cost, etc
and also to identify ways for enhancing the potential of such applications and
designing successful and profitable business models.
