The European School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young
physicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances in
elementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on quantum
field theory, quantum chromodynamics, physics beyond the Standard Model,
flavour physics, effective field theory, cosmology, as well as statistical data
analysis.
