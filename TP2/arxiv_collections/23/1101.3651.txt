Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC) is an X-ray camera onboard the MAXI mission of
the International Space Station. Two sets of SSC sensors view X-ray sky using
charge-coupled devices (CCDs) in 0.5--12\,keV band. The total area for the
X-ray detection is about 200\,cm$\rm ^2$ which is the largest among the
missions of X-ray astronomy. The energy resolution at the CCD temperature of
$-$70 \degc is 145\,eV in full width at the half maximum (FWHM) at 5.9\,keV,
and the field of view is 1\deg .5 (FWHM) $\times$ 90\deg for each sensor. The
SSC could make a whole-sky image with the energy resolution good enough to
resolve line emissions, and monitor the whole-sky at the energy band of $<$
2\,keV for the first time in these decades.
