The B0.2 V magnetic star tau Sco stands out from the larger population of
massive OB stars due to its high X-ray activity, peculiar wind diagnostics and
highly complex magnetic field. This paper presents the discovery of the first
two tau Sco analogues - HD 66665 and HD 63425, identified by the striking
similarity of their UV spectra to that of tau Sco. ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetric
observations were secured by the Magnetism in Massive Stars CFHT Large Program,
in order to characterize the stellar and magnetic properties of these stars.
CMFGEN modelling of optical ESPaDOnS spectra and archived IUE UV spectra showed
that these stars have stellar parameters similar to those of tau Sco. A
magnetic field of similar surface strength is found on both stars, reinforcing
the connection between the presence of a magnetic field and wind peculiarities.
However, additional phase-resolved observations will be required in order to
assess the potential complexity of the magnetic fields, and verify if the wind
anomalies are linked to this property.
