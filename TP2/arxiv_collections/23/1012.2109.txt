A possible realization of Hall conductivity, quantized at odd integer factors
of $e^2/h$ for graphene's honeycomb lattice is proposed. I argue that, in the
presence of \emph{uniform} real and pseudo-magnetic fields, the valley
degeneracy from the higher Landau levels can be removed. A pseudo-magnetic
field may arise from bulging or stretching of the graphene flake. This may lead
to observation of plateaus in the Hall conductivity at quantized values $f
e^2/h$, with $f=\pm 3, \pm 5$ etc, which have not been observed in measurement
of Hall conductivity. However, in a collection of noninteracting Dirac fermions
living in the honeycomb lattice subject to real and pseudo field, the zeroth
Landau level still enjoys the valley and the spin degeneracy. Upon including
the Zeeman coupling, the spin degeneracy is removed from all the Landau levels.
The effects of short ranged electron-electron interactions are also considered,
particularly, the onsite Hubbard repulsion (U) and the nearest-neighbor Coulomb
repulsion (V). Within the framework of the extended Hubbard model with only
those two components of finite ranged Coulomb repulsion, it is shown that
infinitesimally weak interactions can place the system in a gapped insulating
phase by developing a \emph{ferrimegnatic} order, if $U>>V$. Therefore, one may
expect to see the plateaus in the Hall conductivity at all the integer values,
$f=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \pm3,...$. Scaling behavior of interaction induced gap at
$f=1$ in presence of finite pseudo flux is also addressed. Qualitative
discussion on finite size effects and behavior of the interaction induced gap
when the restriction on uniformity of the fields are relaxed, is presented as
well. Possible experimental set up that can test relevance of our theory has
been proposed.
