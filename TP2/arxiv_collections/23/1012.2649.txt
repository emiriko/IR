We present the first observations of a probable brown dwarf, obtained with
the new spectrograph X-shooter mounted on the UT2@VLT. The target (2MASS
J053825.4-024241) is a 0.06 Msun object in the star-formation region sigma
Orionis. The X-shooter spectrum covers simultaneously the whole range from UV
to NIR (300-2500 nm). The J053825.4-024241 spectrum is rich in emission lines
that are typical of accreting young object and clearly shows the Balmer jump.
Moreover, many photospheric atomic and molecular absorption lines yield the
spectral type and confirm that the object is young. We compute the mass
accretion rate from all available observed accretion diagnostics. We find that
there is a large spread in the Macc values (up to a factor 40) that is not
caused by variability; some of this spread may be intrinsic, i.e., owing to
different physical conditions of the emitting region for the same Macc.
However, within the large error bars all Macc measurements agree, and the mean
value is logMacc ~ -9.86 +- 0.45 Myr. The hydrogen Balmer lines are clearly
detected up to n=25. Their ratios suggest that the emitting region is cold
(T~2000-3000 K), dense and in thermal equilibrium (LTE), and that the lines are
optically thick up to n~21. We briefly discuss the implications of this result
for magnetospheric accretion models.
