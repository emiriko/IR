The effect of rigid surfaces on the dynamics of thin liquid films which are
amenable to the lubrication approximation is considered. It is shown that the
Helfrich energy of the layer gives rise to additional terms in the
time-evolution equations of the liquid film. The dynamics is found to depend on
the absolute value of the spontaneous curvature, irrespective of its sign. Due
to the additional terms, a novel finite wavelength instability of flat rigid
interfaces can be observed. Furthermore, the dependence of the shape of a
droplet on the bending rigidity as well as on the spontaneous curvature is
discussed.
