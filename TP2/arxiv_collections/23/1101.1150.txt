We study the dc resistivity of UNi2Al3 thin films as a function of
temperature and magnetic field. We focus on the temperature range around the
antiferromagnetic transition (TN \approx 4 K in zero applied field). From a
clear signature of TN in the dc resistance along the crystallographic
a-direction, we extract the shape of the magnetic phase diagram. Here we find
quantitative differences in comparison to previous studies on bulk crystals.
