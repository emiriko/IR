We consider a Weyl invariant extension of Dirac-Born-Infeld type gravity. An
appropriate choice of the metric hides the scalar degree of freedom which is
required by the local scale invariance of the action at the first sight, and
then a vector field acquires mass. Moreover, nonminimal couplings of the vector
field and curvatures are induced, which may be suitable to the vector inflation
scenario.
