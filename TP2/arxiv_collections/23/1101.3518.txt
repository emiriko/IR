Bose-Einstein correlations between identical particles are measured in
samples of proton-proton collisions at 0.9 and 7 TeV centre-of-mass energies,
recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The signal is observed in the form
of an enhancement of number of pairs of same-sign charged particles with small
relative momentum. The dependence of this enhancement on kinematic and
topological features of the event is studied.
