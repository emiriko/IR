We evaluate the Cold Nuclear Matter effects on J/psi production in pPb and
PbPb collisions at the current LHC energy, taking into account the gluon
shadowing and the nuclear absorption. We use the complete kinematics in the
underlying 2 to 2 partonic process, namely $g+g \to \jpsi + g$ as expected from
LO pQCD. The resulting shadowing is responsible for a large J/psi suppression
in pPb and PbPb, and shows a strong rapidity dependence.
