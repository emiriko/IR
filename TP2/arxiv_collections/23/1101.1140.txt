We report the all-optical production of a Rb87 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
in a simple 1.06 micron dipole trap experiment. We load a single beam dipole
trap directly from a magneto-optic trap (MOT) using an optimized loading
sequence. After evaporation in the single beam, a second crossed beam is used
for compression. The intensity in both beams is then reduced for evaporation to
BEC. We obtain a BEC with 3.5E4 atoms after 3 seconds of total evaporation
time. We also give a detailed account of the thermal distribution in cross beam
traps. This account highlights the possible difficulties in using shorter
wavelength lasers to condense all optically.
