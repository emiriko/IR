It is shown that short-range correlations between large prime numbers (~10^5
and larger) have a Poissonian nature. Correlation length \zeta = 4.5 for the
primes ~10^5 and it is increasing logarithmically according to the prime number
theorem. For moderate prime numbers (~10^4) the Poissonian distribution is not
applicable while the correlation length surprisingly continues to follow to the
logarithmical law. A chaotic (deterministic) hypothesis has been suggested to
explain the moderate prime numbers apparent randomness.
