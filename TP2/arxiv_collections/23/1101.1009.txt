We show that the entanglement resulting from an entanglement swapping
operation performed with spontaneous parametric down-conversion can be made
faithful without post-selection using sum-frequency generation. This invites us
to revisit the sum-frequency process and from a proof-of-principle experiment,
we demonstrate that it provides a realistic solution for non-linear optics at
the single-photon level. This opens the way to attractive alternatives to
six-photon protocols based on linear optics used e.g. for the heralded creation
of maximally entangled pairs or for the implementation of device-independent
quantum key distribution.
