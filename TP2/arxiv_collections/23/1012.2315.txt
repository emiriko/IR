Transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) provide
three-dimensional images of the partonic structure of the nucleon in momentum
space. We made impressive progress in understanding TMDs, both from the
theoretical and experimental point of view. This brief overview on TMDs is
divided in two parts: in the first, an essential list of achievements is
presented. In the second, a selection of open questions is discussed.
