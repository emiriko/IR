We study a two-dimensional system of two Coulombically interacting electrons
in an external harmonic confining potential. More precisely, we present
calculations for the singlet ground-state of the system. We explain the nature
of the degeneracy in the spectrum of the reduced density matrix and provide
detailed results for the dependencies of the entanglement on the interaction
strength. Among other features, it is indicated that in the limit of an
infinitely strong interaction, the angular and radial correlations are
asymptotically independent of each other. Appearing in this limit, the pure
radial correlation effects are quantitatively investigated for the first time.
