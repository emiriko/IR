We discover that a spatially localized gain supports stable vortex solitons
in media with cubic nonlinearity and two-photon absorption. The interplay
between nonlinear losses and gain in amplifying rings results in suppression of
otherwise ubiquitous azimuthal modulation instabilities of radially symmetric
vortex solitons. We uncover that the topology of the gain profile imposes
restrictions on the maximal possible charge of vortex solitons. Symmetry
breaking occurs at high gain levels resulting in the formation of necklace
vortex solitons composed of asymmetric bright spots.
