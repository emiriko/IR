Transport coefficients of causal dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics
(CDR) are studied in quenched lattice simulations. CDR describes the behavior
of relativistic non-Newtonian fluids in which the relaxation time appears as a
new transport coefficient besides the shear and bulk viscosities. It was
recently shown that these coefficients can be given by the temporal-correlation
functions of the energy-momentum tensors as in the case of the
Green-Kubo-Nakano formula. By using the new formula in CDR, we study the
transport coefficients with lattice simulations in pure SU(3) gauge theory.
After defining the energy-momentum tensor on the lattice, we extract a ratio of
the shear viscosity to the relaxation time which is given only in terms of the
static correlation functions. The simulations are performed on $24^3 \times
4$--16 lattices with $\beta_{_{\rm LAT}} = 6.0$, which corresponds to the
temperature range of $0.5 \simle T/T_c \simle 1.8$, where $T_c$ is the critical
temperature.
