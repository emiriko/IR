We introduce an intuitive measure of genuine multipartite entanglement which
is based on the well-known concurrence. We show how lower bounds on this
measure can be derived that also meet important characteristics of an
entanglement measure. These lower bounds are experimentally implementable in a
feasible way enabling quantification of multipartite entanglement in a broad
variety of cases.
