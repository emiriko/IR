We present a new approach for constructing optical phase-space-time-frequency
tomography (OPSTFT) of an optical wave field. This tomography can be measured
by using a novel four-window optical imaging system based on two local
oscillator fields balanced heterodyne detection. The OPSTFT is a Wigner
distribution function of two independent Fourier Transform pairs, i.e.,
phase-space and time-frequency. From its theoretical and experimental aspects,
it can provide information of position, momentum, time and frequency of a
spatial light field with precision beyond the uncertainty principle. We
simulate the OPSTFT for a light field obscured by a wire and a single-line
absorption filter. We believe that the four-window system can provide spatial
and temporal properties of a wave field for quantum image processing and
biophotonics.
