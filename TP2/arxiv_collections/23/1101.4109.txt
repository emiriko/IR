Using calculations from first principles, we herein consider the bond made
between thiolat e with a range of different Au clusters, with a particular
focus on the spin moments inv olved in each case. For odd number of gold atoms,
the clusters show a spin moment of 1.~ $\mu_B$. The variation of spin moment
with particle size is particularly dramatic, with t he spin moment being zero
for even numbers of gold atoms. This variation may be linked w ith changes in
the odd-even oscillations that occur with the number of gold atoms, and is
associated with the formation of a S-Au bond. This bond leads to the presence
of an extra electron that is mainly sp in character in the gold part. Our
results sugg est that any thiolate-induced magnetism that occurs in gold
nanoparticles may be locali zed in a shell below the surface, and can be
controlled by modifying the coverage of the thiolates.
