The light flavor antiquark distributions of the nucleon sea are calculated in
the effective chiral quark model and compared with experimental results. The
contributions of the flavor-symmetric sea-quark distributions and the nuclear
EMC effect are taken into account to obtain the ratio of Drell-Yan cross
sections $\sigma^{\mathrm{pD}}/2\sigma^{\mathrm{pp}}$, which can match well
with the results measured in the FermiLab E866/NuSea experiment. The calculated
results also match the measured $\bar{d}(x)-\bar{u}(x)$ from different
experiments, but unmatch the behavior of $\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)$ derived
indirectly from the measurable quantity
$\sigma^{\mathrm{pD}}/2\sigma^{\mathrm{pp}}$ by the FermiLab E866/NuSea
Collaboration at large $x$. We suggest to measure again $\bar{d}(x)/\bar{u}(x)$
at large $x$ from precision experiments with careful experimental data
treatment. We also propose an alternative procedure for experimental data
treatment.
