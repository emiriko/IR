The networking ability of journals reflects their academic influence among
peer journals. This paper analyzes the cited and citing environments of the
journal--Advances in Atmospheric Sciences--using methods from social network
analysis. The journal has been actively participating in the international
journal environment, but one has a tendency to cite papers published in
international journals. Advances in Atmospheric Sciences is intensely
interrelated with international peer journals in terms of similar citing
pattern. However, there is still room for an increase in its academic
visibility given the comparatively smaller reception in terms of cited
references.
