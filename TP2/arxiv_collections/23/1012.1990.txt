We present a study of the self consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation
(SCOZA) for square-well (SW) potentials of narrow width delta. The main purpose
of this investigation is to elucidate whether in the limit delta --> 0, the
SCOZA predicts a finite value for the second virial coefficient at the critical
temperature B2(Tc), and whether this theory can lead to an improvement of the
approximate Percus-Yevick solution of the sticky hard-sphere (SHS) model due to
Baxter [R. J. Baxter, J. Chem. Phys. 49, 2770 (1968)]. For SW of non vanishing
delta, the difficulties due to the influence of the boundary condition at high
density already encountered in an earlier investigation [E. Schoell-Paschinger,
A. L. Benavides, and R. Castaneda-Priego, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234513 (2005)]
prevented us from obtaining reliable results for delta < 0.1. In the sticky
limit this difficulty can be circumvented, but then the SCOZA fails to predict
a liquid-vapor transition. The picture that emerges from this study is that for
delta --> 0, the SCOZA does not fulfill the expected prediction of a constant
B2(Tc) [M. G. Noro and D. Frenkel, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 2941 (2000)], and that
for thermodynamic consistency to be usefully exploited in this regime, one
should probably go beyond the Ornstein-Zernike ansatz.
