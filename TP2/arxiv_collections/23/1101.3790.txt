We show that the inherent entanglement of the ground state of strongly
correlated systems can be exploited for both classical and quantum
communications. Our strategy is based on a single qubit rotation which encodes
information in the entangled nature of the ground state. In classical
communication, our mechanism conveys more than one bit of information in each
shot, just as dense coding does, without demanding long range entanglement. In
our scheme for quantum communication, which may more appropriately be
considered as a remote state preparation, the quality is higher than the highly
studied attaching scenarios. Moreover, we propose to implement this new way of
communication in optical lattices where all the requirements of our proposal
have already been achieved.
