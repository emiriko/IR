We investigate the kinetics of chiral phase transitions in quark matter. We
discuss the phase diagram of this system in both a microscopic framework (using
the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model) and a phenomenological framework (using a Landau
free energy). Then, we study the far-from-equilibrium coarsening dynamics
subsequent to a quench from the chirally-symmetric phase to the massive quark
phase. Depending on the nature of the quench, the system evolves via either
{\it spinodal decomposition} or {\it nucleation and growth}. The morphology of
the ordering system is characterized using the order-parameter correlation
function, structure factor, domain growth laws, etc.
