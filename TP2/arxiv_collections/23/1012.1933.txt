Theory of quantum games is relatively new to the literature and its
applications to various areas of research are being explored. It is a novel
interpretation of strategies and decisions in quantum domain. In the earlier
work on quantum games considerable attention was given to the resolution of
dilemmas present in corresponding classical games. Two separate quantum schemes
were presented by Eisert et al. and Marinatto and Weber to resolve dilemmas in
Prisoners' Dilemma and Battle of Sexes games respectively. However for the
latter scheme it was argued that dilemma was not resolved. We have modified the
quantization scheme of Marinatto and Weber to resolve the dilemma. We have
developed a generalized quantization scheme for two person non-zero sum games
which reduces to the existing schemes under certain conditions. Applications of
this generalized quantization scheme to quantum information theory are studied.
Measurement being ubiquitous in quantum mechanics can not be ignored in quantum
games. With the help of generalized quantization scheme we have analyzed the
effects of measurement on quantum games. Qubits are the important elements for
playing quantum games and are generally prone to decoherence due to their
interactions with environment. An analysis of quantum games in presence of
quantum correlated noise is performed in the context of generalized
quantization scheme. Quantum key distribution is one of the key issues of
quantum information theory for the purpose of secure communication. Using
mathematical framework of generalized quantization scheme we have proposed a
protocol for quantum key distribution and a technique for quantum state
tomography.
