Many quantum mechanical problems (such as dissipative phase fluctuations in
metallic and superconducting nanocircuits, or impurity scattering in Luttinger
liquids) involve a continuum of bosonic modes with a marginal spectral density
diverging as the inverse of energy. We construct a Numerical Renormalization
Group in this singular case, with a manageable violation of scale separation at
high energy, capturing reliably the low energy physics. The method is
demonstrated by a non-perturbative solution over several energy decades for the
dynamical conductance of a Luttinger liquid with a single static defect.
