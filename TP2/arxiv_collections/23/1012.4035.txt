The first measurement of two-pion Bose-Einstein correlations in central Pb-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider is
presented. We observe a growing trend with energy now not only for the
longitudinal and the outward but also for the sideward pion source radius. The
pion homogeneity volume and the decoupling time are significantly larger than
those measured at RHIC.
