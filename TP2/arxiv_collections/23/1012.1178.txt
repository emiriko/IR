We present a detailed phenomenological study of direct photon production in
association with a heavy-quark jet in pA collisions at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC) and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at next-to-leading
order in QCD. The dominant contribution to the cross-section comes from the
gluon--heavy-quark (gQ) initiated subprocess, making \gamma + Q production a
process very sensitive to both the gluon and the heavy-quark parton
distribution functions (PDFs). Additionally, the RHIC and LHC experiments are
probing complementary kinematic regions in the momentum fraction x_2 carried by
the target partons. Thus, the nuclear production ratio R^{\gamma+Q}_{pA} can
provide strong constraints, over a broad x-range, on the poorly determined
nuclear parton distribution functions which are extremely important for the
interpretation of results in heavy-ion collisions.
