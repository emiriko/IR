We present a theoretical description of Bernstein modes that arise as a
result of the coupling between plasmon-like collective excitations
(upper-hybrid mode) and inter-Landau-level excitations, in graphene in a
perpendicular magnetic field. These modes, which are apparent as avoided level
crossings in the spectral function obtained in the random-phase approximation,
are described to great accuracy in a phenomenological model. Bernstein modes,
which may be measured in inelastic light-scattering experiments or in
photo-conductivity spectroscopy, are a manifestation of the Coulomb interaction
between the electrons and may be used for a high-precision measurement of the
upper-hybrid mode at small non-zero wave vectors.
