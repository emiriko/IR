The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) was installed in the Hubble Space
Telescope in May, 2009 as part of Servicing Mission 4 to provide high
sensitivity, medium and low resolution spectroscopy at far- and
near-ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV, NUV). COS is the most sensitive FUV/NUV
spectrograph flown to date, spanning the wavelength range from 900{\AA} to
3200{\AA} with peak effective area approaching 3000 cm^2. This paper describes
instrument design, the results of the Servicing Mission Orbital Verification
(SMOV), and the ongoing performance monitoring program.
