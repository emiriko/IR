Two thermodynamic "paradoxes" of black hole physics are re-examined. The
first is that there is a thermal instability involving two coupled blackbody
cavities containing two black holes, and second is that a classical black hole
can swallow up entropy in the form of ambient blackbody photons without
increasing its mass. The resolution of the second paradox by Bekenstein and by
Hawking is re-visited. The link between Hawking radiation and Wigner's
superluminal tunneling time is discussed using two equivalent Feynman diagrams,
and Feynman's re-interpretation principle.
