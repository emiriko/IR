It has been recently discovered that Cepheids harbor circumstellar envelopes
(CSEs). RS Pup is the Cepheid that presents the most prominent circumstellar
envelope known, the origin of which is not yet understood. Our purpose is to
estimate the flux contribution of the CSE around RS Pup at the one arcsecond
scale (~2000 AU) and to investigate its geometry, especially regarding
asymmetries, to constrain its physical properties. We obtained near-infrared
images in two narrow band filters centered on \lambda = 1.644 and 2.180 \mu m
(NB 1.64 and IB 2.18, respectively) that comprise two recombination lines of
hydrogen: the 12-4 and 7-4 (Brackett \gamma) transitions, respectively. We used
NACO's cube mode observations in order to improve the angular resolution with
the shift-and-add technique, and to qualitatively study the symmetry of the
spatially extended emission from the CSE with a statistical study of the
speckle noise. We probably detect at a 2\sigma level an extended emission with
a relative flux (compared with the star in the same filter) of 38 $\pm$ 17% in
the NB 1.64 filter and 24 $\pm$ 11% in the IB 2.18 filter. This emission is
centered on RS Pup and does not present any detectable asymmetry. We attribute
the detected emission to the likely presence of an hydrogen envelope
surrounding the star.
