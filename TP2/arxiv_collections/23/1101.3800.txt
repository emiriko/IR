We present calculations of thermal evolution of Hot Jupiters with various
masses and effective temperatures under Ohmic dissipation. The resulting
evolutionary sequences show a clear tendency towards inflated radii for
effective temperatures that give rise to significant ionization of alkali
metals in the atmosphere, compatible with the trend of the data. The degree of
inflation shows that Ohmic dissipation, along with the likely variability in
heavy element content can account for all of the currently detected radius
anomalies. Furthermore, we find that in absence of a massive core, low-mass hot
Jupiters can over-flow their Roche-lobes and evaporate on Gyr time-scales,
possibly leaving behind small rocky cores.
