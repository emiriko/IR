In the present study, turbulent impurity transport in Deuterium tokamak
plasmas, driven by Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) and Trapped Electron (TE)
modes, has been investigated using fluid and gyrokinetic models. The impurity
diffusivity ($D_Z$) and convective velocity ($V_Z$) are calculated, and from
these the zero-flux peaking factor ($PF_0$) is derived. This quantity expresses
the impurity density gradient at which the convective and diffusive transport
of impurities are exactly balanced. The sign of $PF_0$ is of special interest,
as it determines whether the impurities are subject to an inward ($PF_0 > 0$)
or outward ($PF_0 < 0$) pinch.
