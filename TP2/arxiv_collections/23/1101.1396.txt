We propose to model the image differentials of astrophysical source maps by
Student's t-distribution and to use them in the Bayesian source separation
method as priors. We introduce an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling scheme to unmix the astrophysical sources and describe the derivation
details. In this scheme, we use the Langevin stochastic equation for
transitions, which enables parallel drawing of random samples from the
posterior, and reduces the computation time significantly (by two orders of
magnitude). In addition, Student's t-distribution parameters are updated
throughout the iterations. The results on astrophysical source separation are
assessed with two performance criteria defined in the pixel and the frequency
domains.
