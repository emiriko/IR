Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations are studied for a parallel coupled vertical
double quantum dot with a common source and drain electrode. We observe AB
oscillations of current via a one-electron bonding state as the ground state
and an anti-bonding state as the excited state. As the center gate voltage
becomes more negative, the oscillation period is clearly halved for both the
bonding and antibonding states, and the phase changes by half a period for the
antibonding state. This result can be explained by a calculation that takes
account of the indirect interdot coupling via the two electrodes.
