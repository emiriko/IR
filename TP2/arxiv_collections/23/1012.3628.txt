This work concerns physical layer collision recovery for cheap sensors with
allowed variations in frequency and delay of their communications. The work is
presented as a generic, communication theoretic framework and demonstrated
using UHF RFID tag technology. Previous work in this area has not provided
recovery for more than two tags, which is shown to be possible in this work.
Also presented is a novel mathematical model of the tag signal, incorporating
the allowed variations in frequency and delay. The main motivation is seen in
the observation that random variations in frequency and delay make the collided
signals of different tags separable. The collision recovery is done by
estimating the sensor specific variation in frequency and delay and using these
estimates in a successive interference cancellation algorithm and a maximum
likelihood sequence decoder, to iteratively reconstruct a sensor signal and
remove it from the received signal. Numerical simulations show that the
estimates and proposed algorithm are effective in recovering collisions. The
proposed algorithm is then incorporated into a numerical simulation of the
Qprotocol for UHF RFID tags and is shown to be effective in providing fast and
power efficient sensor arbitration.
