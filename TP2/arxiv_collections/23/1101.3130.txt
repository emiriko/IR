We analyze the desynchronization bifurcation in the coupled R\"ossler
oscillators. After the bifurcation the coupled oscillators move away from each
other with a square root dependence on the parameter. We define system
transverse Lyapunov exponents and in the desynchronized state one is positive
while the other is negative implying that one oscillator is trying to fly away
while the other is holding it. We give a simple model of coupled integrable
systems that shows a similar phenomena and can be treated as the normal form
for the desynchronization bifurcation. We conclude that the desynchronization
is a pitchfork bifurcation of the transverse manifold.
