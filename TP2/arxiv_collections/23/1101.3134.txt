In this paper we study the scalar generalized Verma module $M$ associated to
a character of a parabolic subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}(E)$. Here $E$ is a
finite dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field $K$ of
characteristic zero. The Verma module $M$ has a canonical simple quotient $L$
with a canonical filtration $F$. In the case when the quotient $L$ is finite
dimensional we use left annihilator ideals in $U(\mathfrak{sl}(E))$ and
geometric results on jet bundles to generalize to an algebraically closed field
of characteristic zero a classical formula of W. Smoke on the structure of the
jet bundle of a line bundle on an arbitrary quotient $\operatorname{SL}(E)/P$
where $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}(E)$. This formula was
originally proved by Smoke in 1967 using analytic techniques.
