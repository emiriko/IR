We present a simple prescription to flatten isolated Bloch bands with
non-zero Chern number. We first show that approximate flattening of bands with
non-zero Chern number is possible by tuning ratios of nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest neighbor hoppings in the Haldane model and, similarly, in the
chiral-pi-flux square lattice model. Then we show that perfect flattening can
be attained with further range hoppings that decrease exponentially with
distance. Finally, we add interactions to the model and present exact
diagonalization results for a small system at 1/3 filling that support (i) the
existence of a spectral gap, (ii) that the ground state is a topological state,
and (iii) that the Hall conductance is quantized.
