Energetic particle irradiation of solids can cause surface ultra-smoothening,
self-organized nanoscale pattern formation, or degradation of the structural
integrity of nuclear reactor components. Periodic patterns including
high-aspect ratio quantum dots, with occasional long-range order and
characteristic spacing as small as 7 nm, have stimulated interest in this
method as a means of sub-lithographic nanofabrication. Despite intensive
research there is little fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing
the selection of smooth or patterned surfaces, and precisely which physical
effects cause observed transitions between different regimes has remained a
matter of speculation. Here we report the first prediction of the mechanism
governing the transition from corrugated surfaces to flatness, using only
parameter-free molecular dynamics simulations of single-ion impact induced
crater formation as input into a multi-scale analysis, and showing good
agreement with experiment. Our results overturn the paradigm attributing these
phenomena to the removal of target atoms via sputter erosion. Instead, the
mechanism dominating both stability and instability is shown to be the
impact-induced redistribution of target atoms that are not sputtered away, with
erosive effects being essentially irrelevant. The predictions are relevant in
the context of tungsten plasma-facing fusion reactor walls which, despite a
sputter erosion rate that is essentially zero, develop, under some conditions,
a mysterious nanoscale topography leading to surface degradation. Our results
suggest that degradation processes originating in impact-induced target atom
redistribution effects may be important, and hence that an extremely low
sputter erosion rate is an insufficient design criterion for morphologically
stable solid surfaces under energetic particle irradiation.
