The asymptotic behavior of expressions of the form $%
\sum_{t=1}^{n}f(r_{n}x_{t})$ where $x_{t}$ is an integrated process, $r_{n}$ is
a sequence of norming constants, and $f$ is a measurable function has been the
subject of a number of articles in recent years. We mention Borodin and
Ibragimov (1995), Park and Phillips (1999), de Jong (2004), Jeganathan (2004),
P\"{o}tscher (2004), de Jong and Whang (2005), Berkes and Horvath (2006), and
Christopeit (2009) which study weak convergence results for such expressions
under various conditions on $x_{t}$ and the function $f$. Of course, these
results also provide information on the order of magnitude of $%
\sum_{t=1}^{n}f(r_{n}x_{t})$. However, to the best of our knowledge no result
is available for the case where $f$ is non-integrable with respect to
Lebesgue-measure in a neighborhood of a given point, say $x=0$. In this paper
we are interested in bounds on the order of magnitude of $%
\sum_{t=1}^{n}|x_{t}| ^{-\alpha}$ when $\alpha \geq 1$, a case where the
implied function $f$ is not integrable in any neighborhood of zero. More
generally, we shall also obtain bounds on the order of magnitude for
$\sum_{t=1}^{n}v_{t}|x_{t}| ^{-\alpha}$ where $v_{t}$ are random variables
satisfying certain conditions.
