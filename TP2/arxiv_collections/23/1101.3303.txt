We present a statistical study of the characteristics of very large amplitude
whistler waves inside the terrestrial magnetosphere using waveform capture data
from the Wind spacecraft as an addition of the study by Kellogg et al.,
[2010b]. We observed 244(65) whistler waves using electric(magnetic) field data
from the Wind spacecraft finding ~40%(~62%) of the waves have peak-to-peak
amplitudes of >/- 50 mV/m(>/- 0.5 nT). We present an example waveform capture
of the largest magnetic field amplitude (>/- 8 nT peak-to-peak) whistler wave
ever reported in the radiation belts. The estimated Poynting flux magnitude
associated with this wave is >/- 300 microW/m^2, roughly four orders of
magnitude above previous estimates. Such large Poynting flux values are
consistent with rapid energization of electrons. The majority of the largest
amplitude whistlers occur during magnetically active periods (AE > 200 nT). The
waves were observed to exhibit a broad range of propagation angles with respect
to the magnetic field, 0{\deg} </- {\theta}_kB < 90{\deg}, which showed no
consistent variation with magnetic latitude. These results are inconsistent
with the idea that the whistlers are all generated at the equator, propagating
along the magnetic field, and that the observed obliqueness is due to
propagation effects. We also identified three types of electron distributions
observed simultaneously with the whistler waves including beam-like,
beam/flattop, and anisotropic distributions. The whistlers exhibited different
characteristics depending on the observed electron distributions. The majority
of the waveforms observed in our study have f/f_ce </- 0.5 and are observed
primarily in the radiation belts simultaneously with anisotropic electron
distributions.
