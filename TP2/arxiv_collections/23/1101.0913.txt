We explore the phase diagram of ultracold bosonic polar molecules confined to
a planar optical lattice of triangular geometry. External static electric and
microwave fields can be employed to tune the effective interactions between the
polar molecules into a regime of extended two- and three-body repulsions of
comparable strength, leading to a rich quantum phase diagram. In addition to
various solid phases, an extended supersolid phase is found to persist deep
into the three-body dominated regime. While three-body interactions break
particle-hole symmetry explicitly, a characteristic supersolid-supersolid
quantum phase transition is observed, which indicates the restoration of
particle-hole symmetry at half-filling. We revisit the spatial structure of the
supersolid at this filling, regarding the existence of a further supersolid
phase with three inequivalent sublattices, and provide evidence that this state
is excluded also at finite temperatures.
