We re-evaluate our model predictions in Phys. Rev. D 79, 013002 (2009) for
different observables in neutrino induced coherent pion production. This comes
as a result of the new improved fit to old bubble chamber data of the dominant
axial C_5^A nucleon-to-Delta form factor. We find an increase of 20%-30% in the
values for the total cross sections. Uncertainties induced by the errors in the
determination of C_5^A are computed. Our new results turn out to be compatible
within about $1\sigma$ with the former ones. We also stress the existing
tension between the recent experimental determination of the \sigma(CC coh
\pi^+)}/\sigma(NC coh \pi^0)} $ ratio by the SciBooNE Collaboration and the
theoretical predictions.
