It has been recently reported that a granular mixture in which grains differ
in their restitution coefficients presents segregation: the more inelastic
particles sink to the bottom. When other segregation mechanisms as buoyancy and
the Brazil nut effect are present, the inelasticity induced segregation can
compete with them. First, a detailed analysis, based on numerical simulations
of two dimensional systems, of the competition between buoyancy and the
inelasticity induced segregation is presented, finding that there is a
transition line in the parameter space that determines which mechanism is
dominant. In the case of neutrally buoyant particles having different sizes the
inelasticity induced segregation can compete with the Brazil nut effect (BNE).
Reverse Brazil nut effect (RBNE) could be obtained at large inelasticities of
the intruder. At intermediate values, BNE and RBNE coexist and large inelastic
particles are found both near the bottom and at the top of the system.
