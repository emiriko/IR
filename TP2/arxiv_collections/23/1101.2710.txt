We analyze the supersymmetric contributions to the direct CP asymmetries of
the decays $B \to \pi K^*$ and $B\to\rho K$ within Soft Collinear Effective
Theory. We extend the Standard Model analysis of these asymmetries to include
the next leading order QCD corrections. We find that, even with QCD correction,
the Standard Model predictions can not accommodate the direct CP asymmetries in
these decay modes. Using Mass Insertion Approach, we show that non-minimal
flavor SUSY contributions mediated by gluino exchange can enhance the CP
asymmetries significantly and thus can accommodate the experimental results.
