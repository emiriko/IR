The paper discusses relationships between aesthetics theory and mathematical
models of mind. Mathematical theory describes abilities for concepts, emotions,
instincts, imagination, adaptation, learning, cognition, language, approximate
hierarchy of the mind and evolution of these abilities. The knowledge instinct
is the foundation of higher mental abilities and aesthetic emotions. Aesthetic
emotions are present in every act of perception and cognition, and at the top
of the mind hierarchy they become emotions of the beautiful. The learning
ability is essential to everyday perception and cognition as well as to the
historical development of understanding of the meaning of life. I discuss a
controversy surrounding this issue. Conclusions based on cognitive and
mathematical models confirm that judgments of taste are at once subjective and
objective, and I discuss what it means. The paper relates cognitive and
mathematical concepts to those of philosophy and aesthetics, from Plato to our
days, clarifies cognitive mechanisms and functions of the beautiful, and
resolves many difficulties of contemporary aesthetics.
