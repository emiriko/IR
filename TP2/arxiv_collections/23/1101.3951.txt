The concept of smooth deformations of a Riemannian manifolds, recently
evidenced by the solution of the Poincar\'e conjecture, is applied to
Einstein's gravitational theory and in particular to the standard FLRW
cosmology. We present a brief review of the deformation of Riemannian geometry,
showing how such deformations can be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert
dynamical principle. We show that such deformations of space-times of general
relativity produce observable effects that can be measured by four-dimensional
observers. In the case of the FLRW cosmology, one such observable effect is
shown to be consistent with the accelerated expansion of the universe.
