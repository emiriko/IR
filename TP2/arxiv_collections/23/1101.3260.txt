Based on high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra
analysis of 90 solar type stars, we have established several new metallicity
calibrations in Teff range [5600, 6500] K based on red spectra with the
wavelength range of 560-880 nm. The new metallicity calibrations are applied to
determine the metallicity of solar analogs selected from SDSS spectra. There is
a good consistent result with the adopted value presented in SDSS-DR7 and a
small scatter of 0.26 dex for stars with S/N > 50 is obtained. This study
provides a new reliable way to derive the metallicity for solar-like stars with
low resolution spectra. In particular, our calibrations are useful for finding
metal-rich stars, which are missing in SSPP.
