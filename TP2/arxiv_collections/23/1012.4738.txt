Penguin transitions play a key role in the search of New Physics hints in the
heavy flavor sector. During the last decade CDF has been exploring this
opportunity with a rich study of two--body charmless decays of neutral B mesons
into charged final--state particles. After briefly introducing the aspects of
this physics peculiar to the hadron collision environment, I report on two
interesting results: the first polarization measurement of the B^0_s --> phi
phi decay and the update of the B^0(_s) --> h^+h'^- decays analysis.
