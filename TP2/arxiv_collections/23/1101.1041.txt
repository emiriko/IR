Studies aimed at understanding the global properties of the
hyperpolarizabilities have focused on identifying universal properties when the
hyperpolarizabilities are at the fundamental limit. These studies have taken
two complimentary approaches: (1) Monte Carlo techniques that statistically
probe the full parameter space of the Schrodinger Equation using the sum rules
as a constraint; and, (2) numerical optimization studies of the first and
second hyperpolarizability where models of the scalar and vector potentials are
parameterized and the optimized parameters determined, from which universal
properties are investigated. Here, we employ an energy spectrum constraint on
the Monte Carlo method to bridge the divide between these two approaches. The
results suggest an explanation for the origin of the factor of 20-30 gap
between the best molecules and the fundamental limits and establishes the basis
for the three-level ansatz.
