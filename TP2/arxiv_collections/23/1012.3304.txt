Using calculations on defective graphene from first principles, we herein
consider the dependence of the properties of the monovacancy of graphene under
isotropic strain, with a particular focus on spin moments. At zero strain, the
vacancy shows a spin moment of 1.5 $\mu_B$ that increases to $\sim$2 $\mu_B$
when the graphene is in tension. The changes are more dramatic under
compression, in that the vacancy becomes non-magnetic when graphene is
compressed more than 2%. This transition is linked to changes in the atomic
structure that occurs around vacancies, and is associated with the formation of
ripples. For compressions slightly greater than 3%, this rippling leads to the
formation of a heavily reconstructed vacancy structure that consists of two
deformed hexagons and pentagons. Our results suggest that any defect-induced
magnetism that occurs in graphene can be controlled by applying a strain, or
some other mechanical deformations.
