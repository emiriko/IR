In this paper we explicitly compute all Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
for semisimple or Kac-Moody groups G, that is, the structure coefficients of
the cohomology algebra H^*(G/P), where P is a parabolic subgroup of G. These
coefficients are of importance in enumerative geometry, algebraic combinatorics
and representation theory. Our formula for the Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients is given in terms of the Cartan matrix and the Weyl group of G.
However, if some off-diagonal entries of the Cartan matrix are 0 or -1, the
formula may contain negative summands. On the other hand, if the Cartan matrix
satisfies $a_{ij}a_{ji}\ge 4$ for all $i,j$, then each summand in our formula
is nonnegative that implies nonnegativity of all Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients. We extend this and other results to the structure coefficients of
the T-equivariant cohomology of flag varieties G/P and Bott-Samelson varieties
Gamma_\ii(G).
