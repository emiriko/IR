It is shown that the quantum phase transition in metallic non-s-wave
ferromagnets, or spin nematics, is generically of first order. This is due to a
coupling of the order parameter to soft electronic modes that play a role
analogous to that of the electromagnetic vector potential in a superconductor,
which leads to a fluctuation-induced first-order transition. A generalized
mean-field theory for the p-wave case is constructed that explicitly shows this
effect. Tricritical wings are predicted to appear in the phase diagram in a
spatially varying magnetic field, but not in a homogeneous one.
