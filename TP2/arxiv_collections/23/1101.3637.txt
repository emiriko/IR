We consider the eigenvalue problem of a kinetic collision operator for a
quantum Brownian particle interacting with a one-dimensional chain. The quantum
nature of the system gives rise to a difference operator. For the
one-dimensional case, the momentum space separates into infinite sets of
disjoint subspaces dynamically independent of one another. The eigenvalue
problem of the collision operator is solved with the continued fraction method.
The spectrum is non-negative, possesses an accumulation point and exhibits a
band structure. We also construct the eigenvectors of the collision operator
and establish their completeness and orthogonality relations in each momentum
subspaces.
