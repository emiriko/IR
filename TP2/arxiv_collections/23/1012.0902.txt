Radiative corrections for several heavy fermions bound together via the Higgs
boson exchange are studied. The fermion bags considered include 12, or fewer,
fermions occupying the lowest S_{1/2} shell. It is shown that for `moderately
heavy' fermions with masses 0.4< m c^2< 1 TeV the radiative corrections are
small, 10^{-2}, and have an attractive nature. Therefore they do not put
existence of the fermion bag in doubt. This proves that these fermion bags can
exist in nature.
