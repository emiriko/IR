In this paper, we introduce the notion of efficiency (consistency) and
examine some asymptotic properties of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We
apply these results to the data augmentation (DA) procedure for independent and
identically distributed observations. More precisely, we show that if both the
sample size and the running time of the DA procedure tend to infinity the
empirical distribution of the DA procedure tends to the posterior distribution.
This is a local property of the DA procedure, which may be, in some cases, more
helpful than the global properties to describe its behavior. The advantages of
using the local properties are the simplicity and the generality of the
results. The local properties provide useful insight into the problem of how to
construct efficient algorithms.
