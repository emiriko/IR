Cosmic magnetic fields are an integral component of the interstellar medium
(ISM), having influence on scales ranging from star formation to galactic
dynamics. While observations of external galaxies offer a `birds-eye-view' of
magnetic fields within galaxies, it is equally important to explore the
magnetic field of our own Milky Way Galaxy, which offers a more detailed,
albeit more complicated view. Over the past decade there has been a significant
increase in interest in the Galactic magnetic field, fueled largely by
innovations developed through the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey. In this
paper, I review the current state of understanding of the Galactic magnetic
field, and discuss briefly new and future observations that will provide
exciting new insights about the field.
