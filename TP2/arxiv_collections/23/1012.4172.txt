In this note, we will show that the supergravity theory which is dual to ABJM
field theory can be consistently reduced to scalar-coupled AdS-Einstein gravity
and then consider the reflection symmetric domain wall and its small
fluctuation. This domain wall solution is none other than dimensional reduction
of M2-brane configuration.
