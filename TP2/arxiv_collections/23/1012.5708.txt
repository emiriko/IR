For two solutions of the WDVV equations that are related by the inversion
symmetry, we show that the associated principal hierarchies of integrable
systems are related by a reciprocal transformation, and the tau functions of
the hierarchies are related by a Legendre type transformation. We also consider
relationships between the Virasoro constraints and the topological deformations
of the principal hierarchies.
