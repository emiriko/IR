We investigate thermodynamic properties of one-dimensional U(N)
supersymmetric gauge theories with 4 and 8 supercharges in the planar large-N
limit by Monte Carlo calculations. Unlike the 16 supercharge case, the
threshold bound state with zero energy is widely believed not to exist in these
models. This led A.V. Smilga to conjecture that the internal energy decreases
exponentially at low temperature instead of decreasing with a power law. In the
16 supercharge case, the latter behavior was predicted from the dual black
0-brane geometry and confirmed recently by Monte Carlo calculations. Our
results for the models with 4 and 8 supercharges indeed support the exponential
behavior, revealing a qualitative difference from the 16 supercharge case.
