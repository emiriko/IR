The study of rare B-decays at SuperB provides unique opportunities to
understand the Standard Model and to constrain new physics. It is discussed the
new physics potential of the B -> K\nu\nu and B -> K^*\nu\nu system from the
proposed SuperB experiment with 75ab-1 of data (5 nominal years of data
taking).
