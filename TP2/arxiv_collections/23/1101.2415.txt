Starting from the fluctuating Boltzmann equation for smooth inelastic hard
spheres or disks, closed equations for the fluctuating hydrodynamic fields to
Navier-Stokes order are derived. This requires to derive constitutive relations
for both the fluctuating fluxes and the correlations of the random forces. The
former are identified as having the same form as the macroscopic average fluxes
and involving the same transport coefficients. On the other hand, the random
force terms exhibit two peculiarities as compared with their elastic limit for
molecular systems. Firstly, they are not white, but have some finite relaxation
time. Secondly, their amplitude is not determined by the macroscopic transport
coefficients, but involves new coefficients.
