The statistical analysis of properties of 213 rich clusters of galaxies is
performed. The existence of correlations between the X-ray luminosity and the
temperature of the intracluster medium and between the X-ray luminosity and the
velocity dispersion of the galaxies is confirmed. New anti-correlation between
optical luminosities L_Halpha and x-ray luminosities L_x of intracluster gas in
clusters is discovered: log(L_Halpha/L_Sun)=a-b(log(L_x/L_Sun)). The existence
of sequences in the log(L_Halpha/L_Sun)-log(L_x/L_Sun) plane testifies to that
the masses of the intracluster gas in different clusters can differ
significantly.
