We report on the results from the radial-velocity follow-up program performed
to establish the planetary nature and to characterize the transiting candidates
discovered by the space mission CoRoT. We use the SOPHIE at OHP, HARPS at ESO
and the HIRES at Keck spectrographs to collect spectra and high- precision
radial velocity (RV) measurements for several dozens dif- ferent candidates
from CoRoT. We have measured the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect of several
confirmed planets, especially CoRoT- 1b which revealed that it is another
highly inclined system. Such high-precision RV data are necessary for the
discovery of new tran- siting planets. Furthermore, several low mass planet
candidates have emerged from our Keck and HARPS data.
