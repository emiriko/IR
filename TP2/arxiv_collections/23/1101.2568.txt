We investigate the dynamics of quantum discord during the purification
process. In the case of Werner states, it is shown that quantum discord is
increased after a round of purification protocol. Furthermore, quantum mutual
information and classical correlation is also increased during this
process.Wealso give an analytic expression for a class of higher dimensional
states which have additive quantum discord.
