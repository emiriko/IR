We study the boundary-driven asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in a
one-dimensional chain with long-range links. Shortcuts are added to a chain by
connecting $pL$ different pairs of sites selected randomly where $L$ and $p$
denote the chain length and the shortcut density, respectively. Particles flow
into a chain at one boundary at rate $\alpha$ and out of a chain at the other
boundary at rate $\beta$, while they hop inside a chain via nearest-neighbor
bonds and long-range shortcuts. Without shortcuts, the model reduces to the
boundary-driven ASEP in a one-dimensional chain which displays the low density,
high density, and maximal current phases. Shortcuts lead to a drastic change.
Numerical simulation studies suggest that there emerge three phases; an empty
phase with $ \rho = 0 $, a jammed phase with $ \rho = 1 $, and a shock phase
with $ 0<\rho<1$ where $\rho$ is the mean particle density. The shock phase is
characterized with a phase separation between an empty region and a jammed
region with a localized shock between them. The mechanism for the shock
formation and the non-equilibrium phase transition is explained by an analytic
theory based on a mean-field approximation and an annealed approximation.
