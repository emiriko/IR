The three laws of Robotics first appeared together in Isaac Asimov's story
'Runaround' after being mentioned in some form or the other in previous works
by Asimov. These three laws commonly known as the three laws of robotics are
the earliest forms of depiction for the needs of ethics in Robotics. In
simplistic language Isaac Asimov is able to explain what rules a robot must
confine itself to in order to maintain societal sanctity. However, even though
they are outdated they still represent some of our innate fears which are
beginning to resurface in present day 21st Century. Our society is on the
advent of a new revolution; a revolution led by advances in Computer Science,
Artificial Intelligence & Nanotechnology. Some of our advances have been so
phenomenal that we surpassed what was predicted by the Moore's law. With these
advancements comes the fear that our future may be at the mercy of these
androids. Humans today are scared that we, ourselves, might create something
which we cannot control. We may end up creating something which can not only
learn much faster than anyone of us can, but also evolve faster than what the
theory of evolution has allowed us to. The greatest fear is not only that we
might lose our jobs to these intelligent beings, but that these beings might
end up replacing us at the top of the cycle. The public hysteria has been
heightened more so by a number of cultural works which depict annihilation of
the human race by robots. Right from Frankenstein to I, Robot mass media has
also depicted such issues. This paper is an effort to understand the need for
ethics in Robotics or simply termed as Roboethics. This is achieved by the
study of artificial beings and the thought being put behind them. By the end of
the paper, however, it is concluded that there isn't a need for ethical robots
but more so ever a need for ethical roboticists.
