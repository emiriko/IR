We summarize several projects carried out by the CTEQ global analysis of
parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton during 2010. We discuss a
recently released CT10 family of PDFs with a fixed and variable QCD coupling
strength; implementation of combined HERA and Tevatron lepton asymmetry data
sets; theoretical issues associated with the analysis of $W$ charge asymmetry
in PDF fits; PDFs for leading-order shower programs; and constraints on new
color-octet fermions from the hadronic data.
