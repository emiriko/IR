We produce three vast classes of exact periodic and soliton solutions to the
one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with the pseudopotential in the
form of a nonlinear lattice (NL), induced by a spatially periodic modulation of
the local nonlinearity. It is well known that NLs in Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs) may be created by means of the Feshbach-resonance technique. The model
may also include linear potentials with the same periodicity. The NL modulation
function, the linear potential (if any), and the corresponding exact solutions
are expressed in terms of the Jacobi's elliptic functions of three types, cn,
dn, and sn, which give rise to the three different classes of the solutions.
The potentials and associated solutions are parameterized by two free constants
and an additional sign parameter in the absence of the linear potential. In the
presence of the latter, the solution families feature two additional free
parameters. The families include both sign-constant and sign-changing NLs.
Density maxima of the solutions may coincide with either minima or maxima of
the periodic pseudopotential. The solutions reduce to solitons in the limit of
the infinite period. The stability of the solutions is tested via direct
simulations of the GPE. As a result, stability regions are identified for the
periodic solutions and solitons. The periodic patterns of the cn type, and the
respective limit-form solutions in the form of bright solitons, may be stable
both in the absence and presence of the linear potential. The stability of the
two other solution classes, of the dn and sn types, is only possible with the
linear potential.
