Is the scaling, \lambda \sim Rm^{1/2}, for the growth rate of small-scale
dynamo instability at low magnetic Prandtl numbers and large magnetic Reynolds
numbers, Rm, valid in the vicinity of the threshold? Our analysis and even
numerical solution (Malyshkin and Boldyrev, 2010) of the dynamo equations for a
Gaussian white-noise velocity field (the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model) imply that
the answer is negative. Contrary to the claim by Malyshkin and Boldyrev (2010),
there are two different asymptotics for the dynamo growth rate: in the vicinity
of the threshold and far from the threshold.
