SOFIA presents a number of interesting challenges for the development of a
data reduction environment which, at its initial phase, will have to
incorporate pipelines from seven different instruments. Therefore, the SOFIA
data reduction software must run code which has been developed in a variety of
dissimilar environments which will only increase in future generations of
instrumentation. We investigated three distinctly different situations for
performing pipelined data reduction in SOFIA: automated data reduction after
data archival at the end of a mission, re-pipelining of science data with
updated calibrations or optimum parameters, and the interactive user-driven
local execution and analysis of data reduction by an investigator. These
different modes would traditionally result in very different software
implementations of algorithms used by each instrument team, in effect tripling
the amount of data reduction software that would need to be maintained by
SOFIA. We present here a unique approach for enfolding all the
instrument-specific data reduction software in the observatory framework and
verifies the needs for all three reduction scenarios as well as the standard
visualization tools. The SOFIA data reduction structure would host the
different algorithms and techniques that the instrument teams develop in their
own environment. Ideally, duplication of software is minimized across the
system because instrument teams can draw on software solutions and techniques
previously delivered to SOFIA by other instruments. With this approach, we
minimize the effort for analyzing and developing new software reduction
pipelines for future generation instruments. We also explore the potential
benefits of this approach in the portability of the software to an
ever-broadening science audience, as well as its ability to ease the use of
distributed processing for data reduction pipelines.
