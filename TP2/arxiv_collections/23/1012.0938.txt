Spectra of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) measured at the Earth are the
combination of several processes: sources production and acceleration,
propagation in the interstellar medium and propagation in the heliosphere.
Inside the solar cavity the flux of GCRs is reduced due to the solar
modulation, the interaction which they have with the interplanetary medium. We
realized a 2D stochastic simulation of solar modulation to reproduce CR spectra
at the Earth, and evaluated the importance in our results of the Local
Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) model and its agreement with data at high energy.
We show a good agreement between our model and the data taken by AMS-01 and
BESS experiments during periods with different solar activity conditions.
Furthermore we made a prediction for the flux which will be measured by AMS-02
experiment.
