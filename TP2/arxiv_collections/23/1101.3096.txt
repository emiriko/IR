Blind Searches of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data have resulted in the
discovery of 24 gamma-ray pulsars in the first year of survey operations, most
of which remain undetected in radio, despite deep radio follow-up searches. I
summarize the latest Fermi LAT blind search efforts and results, including the
discovery of a new Geminga-like pulsar, PSR J0734-1559. Finally, I discuss some
of the challenges faced in carrying out these searches into the future, as well
as the prospects for finding additional pulsars among the large number of LAT
unassociated sources.
