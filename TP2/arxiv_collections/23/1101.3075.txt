A new type of solution for the full 3+1 dimensional space-time Schroedinger
equation is presented here. We consider elegant presentation of the exact
solution in a spherical coordinate system, along with the assuming of
separation of the two angular co-ordinates from the radial and time variables.
The separation of variables follows from an assumed product form of the full
potential function, which should allow us to reduce the Schroedinger Eq. to
Riccati ODE in stationary case. If the angular dependence is constant, then the
azimuthal dependence is linear and the polar dependence is logarithmic. With
this reduction the remaining partial differential equation links the radial and
time dependence which is, in effect, the standard time-dependent spherical
radial Schroedinger equation. Besides, we obtain that the time-depended
2-angles solutions exist if the axis of preferential direction of wave
propagation is similar to the time arrow in mechanical processes. The other
possibility is the appropriate phase-shifting of the time-depended solutions. A
paraxial type approximation is obtained for the solution in the limit in which
the polar angle approaches zero.
