Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy is performed on an enriched
radioactive Ar-39 sample. The spectrum of the 3s^2 3p^5 4s [3/2]_2 - 3s^2 3p^5
4p [5/2]_3 cycling transition at 811.8 nm is recorded, and its isotope shift
between Ar-39 and Ar-40 is derived. The hyperfine coupling constants A and B
for both the 4s [3/2]_2 and 4p [5/2]_3 energy levels in Ar-39 are also
determined. The results partially disagree with a recently published
measurement of the same transition. Based on earlier measurements as well as
the current work, the isotope shift and hyperfine structure of the
corresponding transition in Ar-37 are also calculated. These spectroscopic data
are essential for the realization of laser trapping and cooling of Ar-37 and
Ar-39.
