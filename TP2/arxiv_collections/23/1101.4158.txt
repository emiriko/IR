A close substellar companion has been claimed to orbit the bright sdB star HD
149382 with a period of 2.391d. In order to check this important discovery we
gathered 26 high resolution spectra over 55 days with the HERMES spectrograph
on the 1.2m Mercator telescope on La Palma, and analyzed the resulting radial
velocities. Our data show no sign of any significant radial-velocity
periodicities, and from the high precision of our measurements we rule out any
RV variations with amplitudes higher than 0.79 km/s on periods shorter than 50
days.
