This is the first study of the effect of pressure on transition metal
dichalcogenides intercalated by atoms that order magnetically.
Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ is a layered system where the intercalated Co atoms order
antiferromagnetically at T$_N$ = 26 K at ambient pressure. We have conducted a
detailed study of dc-resistivity ($\rho$), thermoelectric power (S) and thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$). We found that at ambient pressure the magnetic
transition corresponds to a well pronounced peak in dS/dT, as well as to a kink
in the dc-resistivity. The effect of ordering on the thermal conductivity is
rather small but, surprisingly, more pronounced in the lattice contribution
than in the electronic contribution to $\kappa$. Under pressure, the
resistivity increases in the high temperature range, contrary to all previous
measurements in other layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). In the
low temperature range, the strong dependences of thermopower and resistivity on
pressure are observed below TN, which, in turn, also depends on pressure at
rate of dT$_N$/dp $\approx$ -1 K/kbar. Several possible microscopic
explanations of the reduction of the ordering temperature and the evolution of
the transport properties with pressure are discussed.
