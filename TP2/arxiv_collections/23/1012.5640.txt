We prove that the Svetlichny's inequality can be derived from the existence
of joint measurements and the principle of no-signaling. Then we show that, on
the basis of quantum measurement assumption, it would imply the breach of
causality if the magnitude of violation of Svetlichny's inequality exceeds
quantum bound.
