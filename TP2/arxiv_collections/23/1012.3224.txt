A new revision of the McMaster catalog of Milky Way globular clusters is
available. This is the first update since 2003 and the biggest single revision
since the original version of the catalog published in 1996. The list now
contains a total of 157 objects classified as globular clusters. Major upgrades
have been made especially to the cluster coordinates, metallicities, and
structural profile parameters, and the list of parameters now also includes
central velocity dispersion.
  NB: This paper is a stand-alone publication available only on the astro-ph
archive; it will not be published separately in a journal.
