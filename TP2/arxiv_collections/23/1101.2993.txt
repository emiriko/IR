We derive the canonical form of mixing of the mass eigenstates in the
lepto-quark sector of the 4-generation Dirac-Kaehler extension of the SM
(DK-SM) [1,2]. The 4 x 4 CKM matrix of DK-SM is expressed in terms two U(2)
matrices. It depends on 2 real parameters and 3 phases. The resulting observed
3 x 3 CKM matrix exhibits previously unknown tree-level algebraic relations
among its elements. The simplest two, V_ts = V_cb and V_cs = V_tb, are
supported by the experimental data [3]. The 4 x 4 CKM matrix can be fully
reconstructed from the experimental values of the 3 x 3 CKM matrix. Thus,
except for masses of the fourth generation, the quark sector of the DK-SM
theory can be reconstructed in its entirety using the 3 x 3 CKM matrix
precision measurements.
