We highlight an interesting mapping between the moving breather solutions of
the generalized Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations and the static solutions
of neutral scalar field theories. Using this connection, we then obtain several
new moving breather solutions of the cubic-quintic NLS equation both with and
without uniform phase in space. The stability of some stationary solutions is
investigated numerically and the results confirmed via dynamical evolution.
