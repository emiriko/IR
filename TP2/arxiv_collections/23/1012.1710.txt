A model for experiments testing Bell Inequalities is presented that does not
involve nonlocal effects. It constitutes essentially a physical explanation of
a "loophole" in the logic of these experiments, which, if not excluded, in
principle nullifies the conventional conclusions, namely, that some kind of
nonlocal interrelationship is intrinsic to quantum mechanics. The mechanism of
the model "spoofs" the results predicted by conventional analysis employing
quantum principles, without, however, using any of them.
