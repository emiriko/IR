With the improvement in fabrication techniques it is now possible to produce
atom-like semiconductor structures with unique electronic properties. This
makes possible periodic arrays of nano-structures in which the Coulomb
interaction, polarizability, and tunneling may all be varied. We study the
collective properties of 2D arrays and 3D face centered cubic lattices of
singly-charged nano-spherical shells, sometimes called `quantum-dot quantum
wells' or `core-shell quantum dots.' We find that for square arrays, the
classical groundstate is an Ising anti-ferroelectret (AFE), while the quantum
groundstate undergoes a transition from a uniform state to an AFE. The
triangular lattice, in contrast, displays properties characteristic of
frustration. Three dimensional face-centered cubic lattices polarize in planes,
with each layer alternating in direction. We discuss the possible experimental
signals of these transitions.
