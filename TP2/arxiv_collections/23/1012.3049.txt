The Relativistic Distorted-Wave Impulse Approximation is used to describe the
$^3$He($e,e^\prime p$)$^2$H process. We describe the $^3$He nucleus within the
adiabatic hyperspherical expansion method with realistic nucleon-nucleon
interactions. The overlap between the $^3$He and the deuteron wave functions
can be accurately computed from a three-body calculation. The nucleons are
described by solutions of the Dirac equation with scalar and vector (S-V)
potentials. The wave function of the outgoing proton is obtained by solving the
Dirac equation with a S-V optical potential fitted to elastic proton scattering
data on the residual nucleus. Within this theoretical framework, we compute the
cross section of the reaction and other observables like the
transverse-longitudinal asymmetry, and compare them with the available
experimental data measured at JLab.
