Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are mainly protons confined in the galactic
magnetic field to form an isotropic flux inside the galaxy. Before reaching the
Earth orbit they enter the Heliosphere and undergo diffusion, convection,
magnetic drift and adiabatic energy loss. The result is a reduction of
particles flux at low energy (below 10 GeV), called solar modulation. We
realized a quasi time-dependent 2D Stochastic Simulation of Solar Modulation
that is able to reproduce CR spectra once known the Local Interstellar Spectrum
(LIS). We were able to estimate the different behaviors associated to the
polarity dependence of the Heliospheric modulation for particles as well as for
antiparticles. We show a good agreement with the antiproton/proton ratio
measured by AMS-01, Pamela, BESS, Heat and Caprice and we performed a
prediction for the AMS-02 Experiment.
