Our Galaxy resides in the center of a vast "Halo" of Dark Matter (DM). This
concentration produces, in many viable particle physics models, an indirect
Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) annihilation signal that peaks in
the Fermi-LAT's energy range. Our knowledge of the diffuse background is
essential to placing reasonable limits on the DM mass and cross-section. We
incorporate a systematic variation of the GALPROP galactic diffuse background
model, constrained by current cosmic-ray measurements, into a profile
likelihood analysis and present preliminary upper limits on the DM annihilation
cross-section using the Fermi-LAT data.
