In addition to being a very interesting quantum phenomenon, Schr\"odinger cat
swapping has the potential for application in the preparation of quantum states
that could be used in metrology and other quantum processing. We study in
detail the effects of field decoherence on a cat-swapping system comprising a
set of identical qubits, or spins, all coupled to a field mode. We demonstrate
that increasing the number of spins actually mitigates the effects of field
decoherence on the collapse and revival of a spin Schr\"odinger cat, which
could be of significant utility in quantum metrology and other quantum
processing.
