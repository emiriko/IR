If the inflaton is a pseudoscalar, then it naturally interacts with gauge
fields via an axion-like coupling to $F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$. Through
this coupling, the rolling inflaton produces quanta of the gauge field, that in
their turn source the tensor components of the metric perturbations. Due to the
parity-violating nature of the system, the right- and the left-handed tensor
modes have different amplitudes. Such an asymmetry manifests itself in the form
of non-vanishing TB and EB correlation functions in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). We compute the amplitude of the parity-violating tensor modes
and we discuss two scenarios, consistent with the current data, where
parity-violating CMB correlation functions will be detectable in future
experiments.
