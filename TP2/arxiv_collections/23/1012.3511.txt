We present transverse field muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements on
single crystals of the spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet Herbertsmithite. We find
that the spins are more easily polarized when the field is perpendicular to the
kagome plane. We demonstrate that the difference in magnetization between the
different directions cannot be accounted for by Dzyaloshinksii-Moriya type
interactions alone, and that anisotropic axial interaction is present.
