Macroscopic quantum vacuum and modern theories of gravitation share the
strong interplay between geometry and physical phenomena. We review selected
issues related to the accuracy of the measurement of Casimir forces with
particular emphasis on the implications for the search of non-Newtonian
gravitational forces in the micrometer range. We then discuss the interplay of
the Higgs particle with gravitation, arguing that spectroscopic shifts in
atomic transitions due to the modifications of the vacuum expectation value of
the Higgs field in regions with strong curvature of space-time may be of
conceptual and observational relevance.
