The combination of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) with resonant XUV
excitation of a core electron into the transient valence vacancy that is
created in the course of the HHG process is investigated theoretically. In this
setup, the first electron performs a HHG three-step process whereas, the second
electron Rabi flops between the core and the valence vacancy. The modified HHG
spectrum due to recombination with the valence and the core is determined and
analyzed for krypton on the 3d ---> 4p resonance in the ion. We assume an 800
nm laser with an intensity of about 10^14 W/cm^2 and XUV radiation from the
Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) with an intensity in the range
10^13--10^16 W/cm^2. Our prediction opens perspectives for nonlinear XUV
physics, attosecond x rays, and HHG-based spectroscopy involving core orbitals.
