We investigate the cosmic evolution of low luminosity
($L_{\rm{1.4GHz}}<10^{25}\rm{W~Hz^{-1}sr^{-1}}$) radio sources in the XMM Large
Scale Structure survey field (XMM-LSS). We match low frequency selected
(610~MHz) radio sources in the XMM-LSS field with near infrared $K$-band
observations over the same field from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey. We
use both the mean $V/V_{\rm{max}}$ statistic and the radio luminosity function
of these matched sources to quantify the evolution of the co-moving space
density of the low luminosity radio sources in our sample. Our results indicate
that the low luminosity sources evolve differently to their high luminosity
counterparts out to a redshift of z$\sim$0.8. The derived luminosity function
is consistent with an increase in the co-moving space density of low luminosity
sources by a factor of $\sim$1.5 at z=0.8. We show that the use of the $K-z$
diagram for the radio source population, although coarser than a full
photometric redshift analysis, produces consistent results with previous
studies using $\sim >10$ band photometry. This offers a promising method for
conducting similar analyses over the whole sky with future near- and
mid-infrared surveys.
