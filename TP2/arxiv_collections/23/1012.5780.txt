We consider generalized zero-temperature Glauber dynamics under partially
synchronous updating mode for a one dimensional system. Using Monte Carlo
simulations, we calculate the phase diagram and show that the system exhibits
phase transition between ferromagnetic and active antiferromagnetic phase.
Moreover, we provide analytical calculations that allow to understand the
origin of the phase transition and confirm simulation results obtained earlier
for synchronous updates.
