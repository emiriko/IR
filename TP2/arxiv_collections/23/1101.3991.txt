The asteroseismic analysis of white dwarfs allows us to peer below their
photospheres and determine their internal structure. At ~ 28,000 K EC20058-5234
is the hottest known pulsating helium atmosphere white dwarf. As such, it
constitutes an important link in the evolution of white dwarfs down the cooling
track. It is also astrophysically interesting because it is at a temperature
where white dwarfs are expected to cool mainly through the emission of plasmon
neutrinos. In the present work, we perform an asteroseismic analysis of
EC20058-5234 and place the results in the context of stellar evolution and time
dependent diffusion calculations. We use a parallel genetic algorithm
complemented with targeted grid searches to find the models that fit the
observed periods best. Comparing our results with similar modeling of
EC20058-5234's cooler cousin CBS114, we find a helium envelope thickness
consistent with time dependent diffusion calculations and obtain a precise mode
identification for EC20058-5234.
