The kinematics of loop gravity can be given a manifestly Lorentz-covariant
formulation: the conventional SU(2)-spin-network Hilbert space can be mapped to
a space K of SL(2,C) functions, where Lorentz covariance is manifest. K can be
described in terms of a certain subset of the "projected" spin networks studied
by Livine, Alexandrov and Dupuis. It is formed by SL(2,C) functions completely
determined by their restriction on SU(2). These are square-integrable in the
SU(2) scalar product, but not in the SL(2,C) one. Thus, SU(2)-spin-network
states can be represented by Lorentz-covariant SL(2,C) functions, as
two-component photons can be described in the Lorentz-covariant Gupta-Bleuler
formalism. As shown by Wolfgang Wieland in a related paper, this manifestly
Lorentz-covariant formulation can also be directly obtained from canonical
quantization. We show that the spinfoam dynamics of loop quantum gravity is
locally SL(2,C)-invariant in the bulk, and yields states that are preciseley in
K on the boundary. This clarifies how the SL(2,C) spinfoam formalism yields an
SU(2) theory on the boundary. These structures define a tidy Lorentz-covariant
formalism for loop gravity.
