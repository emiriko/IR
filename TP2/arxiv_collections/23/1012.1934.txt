Controlling the interaction between localized optical and mechanical
excitations has recently become possible following advances in micro- and
nano-fabrication techniques. To date, most experimental studies of
optomechanics have focused on measurement and control of the mechanical
subsystem through its interaction with optics, and have led to the experimental
demonstration of dynamical back-action cooling and optical rigidity of the
mechanical system. Conversely, the optical response of these systems is also
modified in the presence of mechanical interactions, leading to strong
nonlinear effects such as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and
parametric normal-mode splitting. In atomic systems, seminal experiments and
proposals to slow and stop the propagation of light, and their applicability to
modern optical networks, and future quantum networks, have thrust EIT to the
forefront of experimental study during the last two decades. In a similar
fashion, here we use the optomechanical nonlinearity to control the velocity of
light via engineered photon-phonon interactions. Our results demonstrate EIT
and tunable optical delays in a nanoscale optomechanical crystal device,
fabricated by simply etching holes into a thin film of silicon (Si). At low
temperature (8.7 K), we show an optically-tunable delay of 50 ns with
near-unity optical transparency, and superluminal light with a 1.4 microseconds
signal advance. These results, while indicating significant progress towards an
integrated quantum optomechanical memory, are also relevant to classical signal
processing applications. Measurements at room temperature and in the analogous
regime of Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) show the utility of
these chip-scale optomechanical systems for optical buffering, amplification,
and filtering of microwave-over-optical signals.
