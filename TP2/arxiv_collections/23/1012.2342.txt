We use the method of steepest descents to study the root distribution of the
Ehrhart polynomial of the $d$-dimensional cross-polytope, namely
$\mathcal{L}_{d}$, as $d\rightarrow \infty$. We prove that the distribution
function of the roots, approximately, as $d$ grows, by variation of argument of
the generating function $\sum_{m\geq
0}\mathcal{L}_{d}(m)t^{m+x-1}=(1+t)^{d}(1-t)^{-d-1}t^{x-1}$, as $t$ varies
appropriately on the segment of the imaginary line contained inside the unit
disk.
