In [Van Benthem 2007] the concept of a public announcement is used to study
the effect of the iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. We
offer a simple generalisation of this approach to cover arbitrary strategic
games and many optimality notions. We distinguish between announcements of
optimality and announcements of rationality.
