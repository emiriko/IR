Macroscopically, confined electron gases at polar oxide interfaces are
rationalized within the simple "polar catastrophe" model. At the microscopic
level, however, many other effects such as electric fields, structural
distortions and quantum-mechanical interactions enter into play. Here we show
how to bridge the gap between these two length scales, by combining the
accuracy of first-principles methods with the conceptual simplicity of model
Hamiltonian approaches. To demonstrate our strategy, we address the equilibrium
distribution of the compensating free carriers at polar LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interfaces. Remarkably, a model including only calculated bulk properties of
SrTiO3 and no adjustable parameters accurately reproduces our full
first-principles results. Our strategy provides a unified description of charge
compensation mechanisms in SrTiO3-based systems.
