With an emphasis in detecting Earth-like planets set forth by the 2010
Decadal Survey and in searching for planets around M dwarfs set forth by the
2008 Exoplanet Task Force, radial velocity surveys with infrared echelle
spectrometers will have a significant impact on future exoplanet studies. Here,
we present the results of an infrared radial velocity survey of a sample of 14
late-M dwarfs with the NIRSPEC echelle spectrometer on the Keck II telescope.
Using telluric lines for wavelength calibration, we are able to achieve
measurement precisions of 150-300 m/s over a year-long timeframe. While we
require more RV epochs to determine whether most of our stars have
planetary-mass companions, we have placed upper limits of 5-10 MJ on the masses
of planets around a sub-set of our sample. We have also determined the
rotational velocities for all the stars in the sample and offer our
multi-order, high-resolution spectra over 2.0 to 2.4 micron to the modeling
community to better understand the atmospheres of late-M dwarfs.
