The Polyakov loop is included in the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R chiral quark-meson
model by considering the propagation of the constituent quarks, coupled to the
(sigma,pi) meson multiplet, on the homogeneous background of a temporal gauge
field, diagonal in color space. The model is solved at finite temperature and
quark baryon chemical potential both in the chiral limit and for the physical
value of the pion mass by using an expansion in the number of flavors N_f.
Keeping the fermion propagator at its tree-level, a resummation on the pion
propagator is constructed which resums infinitely many orders in 1/N_f, where
O(1/N_f) represents the order at which the fermions start to contribute in the
pion propagator. The influence of the Polyakov loop on the tricritical or the
critical point in the mu_q-T phase diagram is studied for various forms of the
Polyakov loop potential.
