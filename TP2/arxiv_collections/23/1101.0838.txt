In this paper we study the interaction between a point magnetic dipole and a
semi-infinite metamaterial using the method of images. We obtain analytical
expressions for the levitation force for an arbitrarily oriented dipole.
Surprisingly the maximal levitation force for negative permeability is found to
be stronger compared to the case when the dipole is above a superconductor.
