We compare the systematics of binding energies computed within the standard
and extended versions of the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model and the Skyrme
Hartree-Fock (SHF) model. The general trends for the binding energies for
super-heavy nuclei are significantly different for these models. The SHF models
tend to underbind the superheavy nuclei, while, RMF models show just the
opposite trend. The extended RMF model seems to provide remarkable improvements
over the results obtained for the standard RMF model.
