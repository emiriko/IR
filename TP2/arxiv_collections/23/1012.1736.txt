We constrain, from rare tau decays, several combinations of $\lambda$ and
$\lambda'$ type couplings coming from Supersymmetry without R-parity. The
processes that we consider are tau --> l M, tau --> l_i l_j l_k, and tau --> l
gamma, where l stands for either e or mu, and M is the generic symbol for a
meson. We update several existing bounds, and provide a few new ones too.
