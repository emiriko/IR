We analyze the relation between the mass of the central supermassive black
hole (Mbh) and the number of globular clusters (Ngc) in elliptical galaxies and
bulges as a ramification of the black hole fundamental plane, the theoretically
predicted and observed multi-variable correlation between Mbh and bulge binding
energy. Although the tightness of the Mbh-Ngc correlation suggests an unlikely
causal link between supermassive black holes and globular clusters, such a
correspondence can exhibit small scatter even if the physical relationship is
indirect. We show that the relatively small scatter of the Mbh-Ngc relation
owes to the mutual residual correlation of Mbh and Ngc with stellar mass when
the velocity dispersion is held fixed. Thus, present observations lend evidence
for feedback-regulated models in which the bulge binding energy is most
important; they do not necessarily imply any `special' connection between
globular clusters and Mbh. This raises the question of why Ngc traces the
formation of ellipticals and bulges sufficiently well to be correlated with
binding energy.
