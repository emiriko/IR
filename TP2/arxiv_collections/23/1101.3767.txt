In this paper we present several measurements of single top quark production
from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron. The various analyses utilize
integrated luminosity ranging from 2.1 to 4.8 fb -1. The results include the
observation of single top production with a combined cross section of 2.76
+0.58 -0.47 pb for a top quark mass of 170 GeV/c2, as well as measurements of
top quark polarization and first evidence for t-channel production.
