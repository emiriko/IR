We show that the equations of motion associated with a complexified
sigma-model action do not admit manifest dual SO(n,n) symmetry. In the process
we discover new type of numbers which we called `complexoids' in order to
emphasize their close relation with both complex numbers and matroids. It turns
out that the complexoids allow to consider the analogue of the complexified
sigma-model action but with (1+1)-worldsheet metric, instead of
Euclidean-worldsheet metric. Our observations can be useful for further
developments of complexified quantum mechanics.
