Experimental data obtained in cosmic ray investigations at energies above the
knee are discussed. All features observed at these energies starting from the
knee, changes of mass composition and concluding with various types of unusual
events are analysed in the framework of the new hadron interaction model
producing blobs of quark gluon matter. Consequences for LHC experiments are
considered.
