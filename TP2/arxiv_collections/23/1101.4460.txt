The advent of nucleon-nucleon potentials derived from chiral perturbation
theory, as well as the so-called V-low-k approach to the renormalization of the
strong short-range repulsion contained in the potentials, have brought renewed
interest in realistic shell-model calculations. Here we focus on calculations
where a fully microscopic approach is adopted. No phenomenological input is
needed in these calculations, because single-particle energies, matrix elements
of the two-body interaction, and matrix elements of the electromagnetic
multipole operators are derived theoretically. This has been done within the
framework of the time-dependent degenerate linked-diagram perturbation theory.
We present results for some nuclei in different mass regions. These evidence
the ability of realistic effective hamiltonians to provide an accurate
description of nuclear structure properties.
