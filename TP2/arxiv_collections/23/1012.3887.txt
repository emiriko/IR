Recent work has found that the interplay between spin accumulation and
Coulomb blockade in nanoparticle arrays results in peaky I-V and tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR) curves and in huge values of the TMR. We analyze how
these effects are influenced by a polarization asymmetry of the electrodes, the
dimensionality of the array, the temperature, resistance or charge disorder and
long-range interactions. We show that the magnitude and voltage dependence of
the TMR does not change with the dimensionality of the array or the presence of
junction resistance disorder. A different polarization in the electrodes
modifies the peak shape in the I-V and TMR curves but not their order of
magnitude. Increasing the temperature or length of the interaction reduces to
some extent the size of the peaks, being the reduction due to long-range
interactions smaller in longer arrays. Charge disorder should be avoided to
observe large TMR values.
