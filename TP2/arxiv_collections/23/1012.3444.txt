Recently extended precise numerical methods and droplet scaling arguments
allow for a coherent picture of the glassy states of two-dimensional Ising spin
glasses to be assembled. The length scale at which entropy becomes important
and produces "chaos", the extreme sensitivity of the state to temperature, is
found to depend on the type of randomness. For the $\pm J$ model this length
scale dominates the low-temperature specific heat. Although there is a type of
universality, some critical exponents do depend on the distribution of
disorder.
