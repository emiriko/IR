Recent theoretical developments of hadrons in nuclei are briefly reviewed in
the aspect of chiral symmetry in nuclei. We show a general sum rule connecting
in-medium hadronic quantities and quark condensate, emphasizing that both
pionic mode and particle-hole excitations in the nuclear medium are responsible
for reduction of the chiral condensate in nuclear matter. We also discuss that
few-body nuclear systems with kaons are good objects to investigate basic
features of kaon-nucleus interactions, showing recent understandings of the
structure of Lambda(1405) and possible bound states of KbarNN and KKbarN. We
also mention eta mesonic nuclei in connection with chiral symmetry of baryons.
