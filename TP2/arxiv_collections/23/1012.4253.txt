We study in this paper the resistivity encountered by Ising itinerant spins
traveling in the so-called $J_1-J_2$ frustrated simple cubic Ising lattice. For
the lattice, we take into account the interactions between nearest-neighbors
and next-nearest-neighbors, $J_1$ and $J_2$ respectively. Itinerant spins
interact with lattice spins via a distance-dependent interaction. We also take
into account an interaction between itinerant spins. The lattice is frustrated
in a range of $J_2$ in which we show that it undergoes a very strong
first-order transition. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we calculate the
resistivity $\rho$ of the itinerant spins and show that the first-order
transition of the lattice causes a discontinuity of $\rho$.
