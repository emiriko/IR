This paper reports a detailed analysis of the optical light curve of PSR
B0540-69, the second brightest pulsar in the visible band, obtained in 2009
(Jan. 18 and 20, and Dec. 14, 15, 16, 18) with the very high speed photon
counting photometer Iqueye mounted at the ESO 3.6-m NTT in La Silla (Chile).
The optical light curve derived by Iqueye shows a double structure in the main
peak, with a raising edge steeper than the trailing edge. The double peak can
be fitted by two Gaussians with the same height and FWHM of 13.3 and 15.5 ms
respectively. Our new values of spin frequencies allow to extend by 3.5 years
the time interval over which a reliable estimate of frequency first and second
derivatives can be performed. A discussion of implications on the braking index
and age of the pulsar is carried out. A value of n = 2.087 +/- 0.007 for the
overall braking index from 1987 to 2009 is derived. The braking index corrected
age is confirmed around 1700 years.
