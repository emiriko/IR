We have proposed to use an effective theory to describe interactions of an
$N\bar N$-system. The effective theory can be constructed in analogy to the
existing effective theory for an $NN$-system. In this work we study the
next-to-leading order correction to $N\bar N$ scattering near the threshold in
the effective theory. We find that the experimental data can be well described
with the effective theory.
