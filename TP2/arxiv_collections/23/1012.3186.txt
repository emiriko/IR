In a recent paper Yang and Kim discuss the lowest baryon mass formulas using
a chiral soliton model. However, contrary to their assertion, their result is
not equivalent to a generalized Gell Mann-Okubo mass formula derived
(G.Morpurgo 1992) using only general properties of QCD (The General
parameterization method). The reason for the non equivalence is that the
generalized mass formula include all the main terms that break flavor at second
order, whereas the Authors above do not go beyond first order flavor breaking
(and should therefore find the usual Gell Mann Okubo formula). That is is not
so, due to some inconsistencies. Below we confine to the part of the Yang-Kim
paper dealing with the mass formula. We will not consider the other items of
their paper.
