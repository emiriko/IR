Using data from the Galactic All-Sky Survey, we have compared the properties
and distribution of HI clouds in the disk-halo transition at the tangent points
in mirror-symmetric regions of the first quadrant (QI) and fourth quadrant
(QIV) of the Milky Way. Individual clouds are found to have identical
properties in the two quadrants. However, there are 3 times as many clouds in
QI as in QIV, their scale height is twice as large, and their radial
distribution is more uniform. We attribute these major asymmetries to the
formation of the clouds in the spiral arms of the Galaxy, and suggest that the
clouds are related to star formation in the form of gas that has been lifted
from the disk by superbubbles and stellar feedback, and fragments of shells
that are falling back to the plane.
