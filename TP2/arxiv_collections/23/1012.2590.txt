Previous studies have indicated that the near-side peak of high-pT triggered
di-hadron correlations can be decomposed into two parts, a jet-like correlation
and the ridge. We present data from Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN)=62
and 200 GeV, which should allow more robust tests of models. The jet-like
correlation is narrow in both azimuth and pseudorapidity and has properties
similar to those expected from vacuum fragmentation. The yield of particles in
the jet-like correlation are presented for both systems and at both energies
and compared to the yields expected from di-hadron correlations in PYTHIA 8.1.
The ridge is narrow in azimuth but broad in pseudorapidity and roughly
independent of pseudorapidity within STAR's acceptance. Attempts have been made
to explain the production of the ridge component as coming from recombination,
momentum kicks, Glasma flux tubes, and a plasma instability. However, few
models have attempted to quantitatively calculate the characteristics of the
ridge. The yield in the ridge is compared for all systems and energies. The
implications for measurements at the LHC are discussed in context of the data
and models.
