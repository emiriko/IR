The adaptive optics system at the 3.6 m AEOS telescope was used to measure
the astrometry and differential magnitude in I-band of 56 binary stars in 2002.
The astrometric measurements will be of use for future orbital determination,
and the photometric measurements will be of use in estimating the spectral
types of the component stars. Two candidate companions were detected, but
neither is likely to be gravitationally bound. Nine systems had not been
observed in over 40 years. Eight of these are shown to share common proper
motion, while HD 182352 is shown to be a background star. One of the two
components of the HD 114378 (Alpha Com) is shown to be a variable star of
unknown type. In addition, 86 stars were unresolved and the full-width half
maxima of the images are presented.
