The article "Physics of Consciousness" treats mind as an abstract Hilbert
space with a set of orthogonal base vectors to describe information like
particles, which are considered to be the elementary excitation of a quantum
field. A non-Hermitian operator of Self is introduced to create these
information like particles which in turn will constitute a coherent information
field. The non - zero average of this self operator is shown to constitute our
basic I. Awareness and consciousness is described very simply as a response
function of these operators to external world. We show with a very simple
neural model how a baby less than two years old develop self-awareness as the
neural connectivity achieves a critical value. The all-important I is the basic
cognitive order parameter of each human brain and is a result of thermodynamic
phase transition from a chaotic disordered state to a symmetry broken coherent
ordered state, very akin to physics of superfluidity.
