We have recently reported the calculation of slope and curvature of
Isgur-Wise function based on Variationally Improved Perturbation Theory (VIPT)
in a QCD inspired potential model. In that work, Coulombic potential was taken
as the parent while the linear one as the perturbation.In this work, we choose
the linear one as the parent with Coulombic one as the perturbation and see the
consequences. Keywords: VIPT,Isgur-Wise function, charge radii and convexity
pa- rameter.
