In our Nature paper, we reported observation of Fermi pocket in
Bi_2(Sr_{2-x}La_x)CuO_{6+\delta} (La-Bi2201) by angle-resolved photoemission
(ARPES) measurements. King et al. tried to assign the Fermi pocket we observed
as due to an additional q2 superstructure. In the process, it creates a number
of serious inconsistencies and flaws in their interpretation. Any one of these
inconsistencies goes strongly against King et al.'s proposal, making their
proposed structural origin highly unlikely as the cause of the observed Fermi
pocket. In our Nature paper, we already pointed out that this structural origin
is unlikely based on the absence of additional q2-induced first-order
superstructure bands of the main band MB. This conclusion remains valid and
gains even stronger support by considering King et al's data.
