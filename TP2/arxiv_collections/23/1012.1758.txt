We consider a resonantly perturbed system of coupled nonlinear oscillators
with small dissipation and outer periodic perturbation. We show that for the
large time $t \sim \epsilon^{-2}$ one component of the system is described in
the main by the inhomogeneous Mathieu equation while the other component
represents pulsation of large amplitude. A Hamiltonian system is obtained which
describes the behaviour of the envelope in the main. The analytic results agree
to numerical simulations.
