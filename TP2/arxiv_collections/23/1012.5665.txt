We report a spectral-line survey of the extreme carbon star IRC+10216 carried
out between 293.9 and 354.8 GHz with the Submillimeter Array. A total of 442
lines were detected, more than 200 for the first time; 149 are unassigned. Maps
at an angular resolution of ~3" were obtained for each line. A substantial new
population of narrow lines with an expansion velocity of ~4 km/s (i.e. ~ 30% of
the terminal velocity) was detected. Most of these are attributed to rotational
transitions within vibrationally excited states, emitted from energy levels
above the v=0, J=0 ground state with excitation energy of 1000-3000 K. Emission
from these lines appears to be centered on the star with an angular extent of
<1". We use multiple transitions detected in several molecules to derive
physical conditions in this inner envelope of IRC+10216.
