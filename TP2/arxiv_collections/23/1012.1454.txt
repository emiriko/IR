We consider a purely massive local relativistic quantum theory specified by a
family of von Neumann algebras indexed by the space-time regions. We assume
that, affiliated with the algebras associated to wedge regions, there are
operators which create only single particle states from the vacuum (so-called
polarization-free generators) and are well-behaved under the space-time
translations. Strengthening a result of Borchers, Buchholz and Schroer, we show
that then the theory is unitarily equivalent to that of a free field for the
corresponding particle type. We admit particles with any spin and localization
of the charge in space-like cones, thereby covering the case of
string-localized covariant quantum fields.
