This Cool Stars 16 splinter session was devoted to reviewing our current
knowledge of correlated X-ray and radio emission from cool stars in order to
prepare for new large radio observatories such as the EVLA. A key interest was
to discuss why the X-ray and radio luminosities of some cool stars are in clear
breach of a correlation that holds for other active stars, the so-called
G\"udel-Benz relation. This article summarizes the contributions whereas the
actual presentations can be accessed on the splinter website
