The study of warm molecular gas in the inner region (<10 AU) of circumstellar
disks around young stars is of significant importance to understand how planets
are forming. This inner zone of disks can now be explored in unprecedented
detail with the high spectral (R=100000) and spatial resolution spectrometer
CRIRES at the VLT. This paper investigates a set of disks that show CO
ro-vibrational v=1-0 4.7 micron emission line profiles characterized by a
single, narrow peak and a broad base extending to > 50 km/s, not readily
explained by just Keplerian motions of gas in the inner disk. The line profiles
are very symmetric, have high line/continuum ratios and have central velocity
shifts of <5 km/s relative to the stellar radial velocity. The disks in this
subsample are accreting onto their central stars at high rates relative to the
parent sample. All disks show CO lines from v=2, suggesting that the lines are
excited, at least in part, by UV fluorescence. Analysis of their spatial
distribution shows that the lines are formed within a few AU of the central
star. It is concluded that these broad centrally peaked line profiles are
inconsistent with the double peaked profiles expected from just an inclined
disk in Keplerian rotation. Alternative non-Keplerian line formation mechanisms
are discussed, including thermally and magnetically launched winds and funnel
flows. The most likely interpretation is that these profiles originate from a
combination of emission from the inner part (< a few AU) of a circumstellar
disk, perhaps with enhanced turbulence, and a slow moving disk wind, launched
by either EUV emission or soft X-rays.
