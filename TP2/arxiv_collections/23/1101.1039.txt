New polynomials associated with a special Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model
corresponding to the standard two-site Bose-Hubbard model are derived based on
the Stieltjes correspondence. It is shown that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between zeros of this new polynomial and solutions of the Bethe
ansatz equations for the LMG model.A one-dimensional classical electrostatic
analogue corresponding to the special LMG model is established according to
Stieltjes early work. It shows that any possible configuration of equilibrium
positions of the charges in the electrostatic problem corresponds uniquely to
one set of roots of the Bethe ansatz equations for the LMG model, and the
number of possible configurations of equilibrium positions of the charges
equals exactly to the number of energy levels in the LMG model. Some relations
of sums of powers and inverse powers of zeros of the new polynomials related to
the eigenenergies of the LMG model are derived.
