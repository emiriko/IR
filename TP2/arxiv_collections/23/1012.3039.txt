We explore the house price distributions for the English cities of London,
Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Birmingham and Leeds. We find Pareto (power
law) behaviour in their upper tails, which is clearly distinct from lognormal
and gamma distributions in the cases of London, Manchester and Newcastle. For
London, the city with the lowest power, this is a striking match with that
found in the wealth distribution of the super-rich. We propose an index of
Housing Wealth Inequality based on the Pareto exponent and analogous to the
Gini coefficient, and comment on its possible uses.
