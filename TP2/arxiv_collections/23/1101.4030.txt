Coherent control of optically-injected carrier distributions in single and
bilayer graphene allows the injection of electrical currents. Using a
tight-binding model and Fermi's golden rule, we derive the carrier and
photocurrent densities achieved via interference of the quantum amplitudes for
two-photon absorption at a fundamental frequency, $\omega$, and one-photon
absorption at the second harmonic, $2\omega$. Strong currents are injected
under co-circular and linear polarizations. In contrast, opposite-circular
polarization yields no net current. For single-layer graphene, the magnitude of
the current is unaffected by the rotation of linear-polarization axes, in
contrast with the bilayer and with conventional semiconductors. The dependence
of the photocurrent on the linear-polarization axes is a clear and measurable
signature of interlayer coupling in AB-stacked multilayer graphene. We also
find that single and bilayer graphene exhibit a strong, distinct
linear-circular dichroism in two-photon absorption.
