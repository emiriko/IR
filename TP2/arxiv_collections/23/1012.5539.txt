We study transport properties of weakly interacting spinless electrons in
one-dimensional single channel quantum wires. The effects of interaction
manifest as three-particle collisions due to the severe constraints imposed by
the conservation laws on the two-body processes. We focus on short wires where
the effects of equilibration on the distribution function can be neglected and
collision integral can be treated in perturbation theory. We find that
interaction-induced corrections to conductance and thermopower rely on the
scattering processes that change number of right- and left-moving electrons.
The latter requires transition at the bottom of the band which is exponentially
suppressed at low temperatures. Our theory is based on the scattering approach
that is beyond the Luttinger-liquid limit. We emphasize the crucial role of the
exchange terms in the three-particle scattering amplitude that was not
discussed in the previous studies.
