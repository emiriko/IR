The first integrals of the Kepler problem are used to compute preliminary
orbits starting from two short observed arcs of a celestial body, which may be
obtained either by optical or radar observations. We write polynomial equations
for this problem, that we can solve using the powerful tools of computational
Algebra. An algorithm to decide if the linkage of two short arcs is successful,
i.e. if they belong to the same observed body, is proposed and tested
numerically. In this paper we continue the research started in [Gronchi,
Dimare, Milani, 'Orbit determination with the two-body intergrals', CMDA (2010)
107/3, 299-318], where the angular momentum and the energy integrals were used.
A suitable component of the Laplace-Lenz vector in place of the energy turns
out to be convenient, in fact the degree of the resulting system is reduced to
less than half.
