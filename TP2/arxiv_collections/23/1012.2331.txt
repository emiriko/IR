We prove the integrality of the Taylor coefficients of roots of mirror maps
at the origin. By mirror maps, we mean formal power series z.exp(G(z)/F(z)),
where F(z) and G(z)+log(z)F(z) are particular solutions of certain generalized
hypergeometric differential equations. This enables us to prove a conjecture
stated by Zhou in "Integrality properties of variations of Mahler measures"
[arXiv:1006.2428v1 math.AG]. The proof of these results is an adaptation of the
techniques used in our article "Crit\`ere pour l'int\'egralit\'e des
coefficients de Taylor des applications miroir", [J. Reine Angew. Math. (to
appear)].
