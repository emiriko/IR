We report on detailed magnetic measurements on the cubic helimagnet FeGe in
external magnetic fields and temperatures near the onset of long-range magnetic
order at $T_C= 278.2(3)$ K. Precursor phenomena display a complex succession of
temperature-driven crossovers and phase transitions in the vicinity of $T_C$.
The A-phase region, present below $T_C$ and fields $H<0.5$ kOe, is split in
several pockets. Relying on a modified phenomenological theory for chiral
magnets, the main part of the A-phase could indicate the existence of a $+\pi$
Skyrmion lattice, the adjacent A$_2$ pocket, however, appears to be related to
helicoids propagating in directions perpendicular to the applied field.
