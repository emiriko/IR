In the first two years since the launch of the Fermi Observatory, the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has detected over 500 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), of
which 18 were confidently detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) above 100
MeV. Besides GRBs, GBM has triggered on other transient sources, such as Soft
Gamma Repeaters (SGRs), Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) and solar flares.
Here we present the science highlights of the GBM observations.
