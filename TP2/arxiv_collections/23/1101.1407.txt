The statistical tests that are commonly used for detecting mean or median
treatment effects suffer from low power when the two distribution functions
differ only in the upper (or lower) tail, as in the assessment of the Total
Sharp Score (TSS) under different treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. In this
article, we propose a more powerful test that detects treatment effects through
the expected shortfalls. We show how the expected shortfall can be adjusted for
covariates, and demonstrate that the proposed test can achieve a substantial
sample size reduction over the conventional tests on the mean effects.
