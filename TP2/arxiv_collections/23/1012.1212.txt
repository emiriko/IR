We propose a quantum approach to nonequilibrium dynamics which combines the
successful aspects of classical-statistical simulations on a lattice with the
ability to take into account quantum corrections. It is based on the 2PI
effective action for inhomogeneous fields and a volume average. This procedure
does not involve any double counting which could appear in sampling
prescriptions for inhomogeneous quantum evolutions. As an example, we study
nonequilibrium dynamics of defect formation in 1+1 dimensional relativistic
scalar field theory and compare to insufficient descriptions based on
homogeneous quantum fields. The latter are analyzed in detail by coupling the
field to an external source, such that the emerging influence of defects can be
studied by lowering the source to zero.
