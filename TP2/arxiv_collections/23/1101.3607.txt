The recently observed high-spin rotational bands in odd-$A$ nuclei $^{247,
249}$Cm and $^{249}$Cf [Tandel \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. C 82 (2010) 041301R]
are investigated by using the cranked shell model (CSM) with the pairing
correlations treated by a particle-number conserving (PNC) method in which the
blocking effects are taken into account exactly. The experimental moments of
inertia and alignments and their variations with the rotational frequency
$\omega$ are reproduced very well by the PNC-CSM calculations. By examining the
$\omega$-dependence of the occupation probability of each cranked Nilsson
orbital near the Fermi surface and the contributions of valence orbitals to the
angular momentum alignment in each major shell, the level crossing and
upbending mechanism in each nucleus is understood clearly.
