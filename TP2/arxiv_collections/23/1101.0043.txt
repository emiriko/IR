The thermodynamics of the deconfined phase of the SU(N) gauge theory is
studied. Careful study is made of the approach to the continuum limit. The
latent heat of the deconfinement transition is studied, for the theories with
3, 4 and 6 colors. Continuum estimates of various thermodynamic quantities are
studied, and the approach to conformality investigated. The bulk thermodynamic
quantities at different N are compared, to investigate the validity of 't Hooft
scaling at these values of N.
