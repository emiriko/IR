We analyze changes of the electronic structure of a triangular molecule under
the influence of an electric field (i.e., the Stark effect). The effects of the
field are shown to be anisotropic and include both a linear and a nonlinear
part. For strong electron correlations, we explicitly derive exchange couplings
in an effective spin Hamiltonian. For some conditions one can find a dark spin
state, for which one of the spins is decoupled from the others. The model is
also applied for studying electronic transport through a system of three
coherently coupled quantum dots. Since electron transfer rates are anisotropic,
the current characteristics are anisotropic as well, differing for small and
large electric field.
