In this paper we use ternary representation of numbers for compressing text
data. We use a binary map for ternary digits and introduce a way to use the
binary 11-pair, which has never been use for coding data before, and we futher
use 4-Digits ternary representation of alphabet with lowercase and uppercase
with some extra symbols that are most commonly used in day to day life. We find
a way to minimize the length of the bits string, which is only possible in
ternary representation thus drastically reducing the length of the code. We
also find some connection between this technique of coding dat and Fibonacci
numbers.
