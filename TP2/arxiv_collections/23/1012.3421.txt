A giant tunneling electroresistance effect may be achieved in a ferroelectric
tunnel junction by exploiting the magnetoelectric effect at the interface
between a ferroelectric barrier and magnetic La1-xSrxMnO3 electrode. Using
first-principles density functional theory we demonstrate that a few magnetic
monolayers of La1-xSrxMnO3 near the interface act, in response to ferroelectric
polarization reversal, as an atomic scale spin-valve by filtering
spin-dependent current. This effect produces more than an order of magnitude
change in conductance, and thus constitutes a giant resistive switching effect.
