We discuss the evaluation of certain d dimensional angular integrals which
arise in perturbative field theory calculations. We find that the angular
integral with n denominators can be computed in terms of a certain special
function, the so-called H-function of several variables. We also present
several illustrative examples of the general result and briefly consider some
applications.
