The paper presents theoretical and empirical analyses of project dynamics and
emergent complexity in new product development (NPD) projects. A model-driven
approach is taken and mathematical models of cooperative work are formulated
based on the theory of vector-autoregressive (VAR)and hidden Marvov
(HM)processes. To validate the models with field data, a case study was carried
out in an industrial company. Furthermore, concepts and measures of complex
systems science are analyzed. To evaluate emergent complexity in NPD projects,
an information-theory measure-termed "effective measure complexity" (EMC)- is
chosen, because it can be derived from first principles and can be calculated
efficiently. EMC measures the mutual information between the infinite past and
future histories of a stochastic process. According to this principle, EMC is
of particular interest for evaluating time-dependent complexity. The formulated
VAR and HM models provide the base for the calculation of several closed-form
solutions of EMC, solutions that allow an explicit complexity assessment based
on the model's independent parameters. Finally, the theoretical complexity
analyses are elucidated in practical terms through an applied example of
optimizing project organization design. The objective is to minimize emergent
complexity by choosing the "best" team design from within a predefined group of
developers with different productivities in a simulated NPD project. The
application shows that EMC is not only a highly satisfactory quantity in theory
but it has also leads to useful results in organizational optimization.
