We provide the isoscalar factors of the SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan series 8x35
which are extensions of the previous works of de Swart, McNamee and Chilton and
play practical roles in current ongoing strange flavor hadron physics research.
To this end, we pedagogically study the SU(3) Lie algebra, its spin symmetries,
and its eigenvalues for irreducible representations. We also evaluate the
values of the Wigner D functions related to the isoscalar factors; these
functions are immediately applicable to strange flavor hadron phenomenology.
Exploiting these SU(3) group properties associated with the spin symmetries, we
investigate the decuplet-to-octet transition magnetic moments and the baryon
octet and decuplet magnetic moments in the flavor symmetric limit to construct
the Coleman-Glashow-type sum rules.
