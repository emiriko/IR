This review gives an overview of most recent measurements of top quark
production cross sections including differential cross sections and searches
for new physics in the top quark sector. Datasets corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of up to 5.7 fb-1 are presented which were taken at the
Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV at Fermilab.
