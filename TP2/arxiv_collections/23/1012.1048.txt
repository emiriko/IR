We predict a significant delay of two-electron photoemission from the helium
atom after absorption of an attosecond XUV pulse. We establish this delay by
solving the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation and by subsequent tracing the
field-free evolution of the two-electron wave packet. This delay can also be
related to the energy derivative of the phase of the complex double
photoionization (DPI) amplitude which we evaluate by the convergent
close-coupling method. Our observations prompt future attosecond streaking
experiments on DPI of He which can elucidate various mechanisms of this
strongly correlated ionization process.
