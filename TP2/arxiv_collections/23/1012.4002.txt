Scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory reveal a
remarkable symmetry structure. In addition to the superconformal symmetry of
the Lagrangian of the theory, the planar amplitudes exhibit a dual
superconformal symmetry. The presence of this additional symmetry imposes
strong restrictions on the amplitudes and is connected to a duality relating
scattering amplitudes to Wilson loops defined on polygonal light-like contours.
The combination of the superconformal and dual superconformal symmetries gives
rise to a Yangian, an algebraic structure which is known to be related to the
appearance of integrability in other regimes of the theory. We discuss two dual
formulations of the symmetry and address the classification of its invariants.
