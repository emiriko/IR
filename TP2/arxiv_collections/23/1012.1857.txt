X-ray emission is ubiquitous among massive stars. In the last decade, X-ray
observations revolutionized our perception of stellar winds but opened a
Pandora's box of urgent problems. X-rays penetrating stellar winds suffer
mainly continuum absorption, which greatly simplifies the radiative transfer
treatment. The small and large scale structures in stellar winds must be
accounted for to understand the X-ray emission from massive stars. The analysis
of X-ray spectral lines can help to infer the parameters of wind clumping,
which is prerequisite for obtaining empirically correct stellar mass-loss
rates. The imprint of large scale structures, such as CIRs and equatorial
disks, on the X-ray emission is predicted, and new observations are testing
theoretical expectations. The X-ray emission from magnetic stars proves to be
more diverse than anticipated from the direct application of the
magnetically-confined wind model. Many outstanding questions about X-rays from
massive stars will be answered when the models and the observations advance.
