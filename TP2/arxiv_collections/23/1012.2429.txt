We have made experimental measurements of electrical conductivity, pH and
relative magnetic susceptibility of the aqueous solutions of 24 indian spices.
The measured values of electrical conductance of these spices are found to be
linearly related to their ash content and bulk calorific values reported in
literature. The physiological relevance of the pH and diamagnetic
susceptibility of spices when consumed as food or medicine will be also
discussed.
