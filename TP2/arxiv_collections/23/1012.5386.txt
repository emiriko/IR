As we shall briefly recall, Nordstr\"om's theory of gravity is
observationally ruled out. It is however an interesting example of non-minimal
coupling of matter to gravity and of the role of conformal transformations. We
show in particular that they could be useful to extend manifolds through
curvature singularities.
