We generalize Bohr's complementarity principle for wave and particle
properties to arbitrary quantum systems. We begin by noting that a
particle-like state is represented by a spatially-localized wave function and
its narrow probability density is displaced by spatial translations. In
contrast a wave-like state is represented by a spatially-delocalized wave
function and the corresponding broad position probability density is invariant
to spatial translations. The wave-particle dichotomy can therefore be seen as a
competition between displacement and invariance of the state with respect to
spatial translations. We generalize this dichotomy to arbitrary quantum systems
with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces as follows. We use arbitrary finite
symmetry groups to represent transformations of the quantum system. The
symmetry (i.e. invariance) or asymmetry (i.e. displacement) of a given state
with respect to transformations of the group are identified with the
generalized wave and particle nature, respectively. We adopt a measure of wave
and particle properties based on the amount of information that can be encoded
in the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the state.
