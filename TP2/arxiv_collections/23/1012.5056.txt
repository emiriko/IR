We suggest a more general than quantum statistical mechanics ($QSM$)
microdescription of objects in a heat bath taken into account a vacuum as an
object environment - modification of quantum mechanics at finite temperatures;
we call it $(\hbar, k)$-dynamics ($ \hbar kD$). This approach allows us in a
new manner to calculate some important macroparameters and to modify standard
thermodynamics. We create an effective apparatus for features description of
nearly perfect fluids in various mediums. As an essentially new model of an
object environment we suppose a quantum heat bath and its properties, including
cases of cold and warm vacuums, are studied. We describe the thermal
equilibrium state in place of the traditional density operator in term of a
wave function the amplitude and phase of which have temperature dependence.
  We introduce a new generative operator, Schroedingerian, or stochastic action
operator, and show its fundamental role in the microdescription. We demonstrate
that a new macroparameter, namely the effective action, can be obtained through
averaging of the Schroedingerian over the temperature dependent wave function.
It is established that such different parameters as internal energy, effective
temperature, and effective entropy and their fluctuations can be expressed
through a single quantity - the effective action.
