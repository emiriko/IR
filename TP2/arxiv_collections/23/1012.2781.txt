In order to elucidate the vacuum structure of the Aoki phase, we carried out
a numerical investigation of QCD with two flavours of Wilson fermions, within
the p.d.f. framework and in the absence of external sources. The simulations
performed at V = 44 suggest a rich vacuum structure, where the observable
$i\bar\psi\gamma_5\psi$ is allowed to take non-zero values of the same order of
magnitude than the order parameter of the Aoki phase
$i\bar\psi\gamma_5\tau_3\psi$. However, the simulation at higher volumes V =
6^4 suffers from large statistical errors.
