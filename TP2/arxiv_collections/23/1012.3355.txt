We present preliminary results on the of neutral kaon oscillations in
extensions of the Standard Model. Using Nf=2 maximally twisted sea quarks and
Osterwalder-Seiler valence quarks, we achieve both O(a)-improvement and
continuum-like renormalization pattern for the relevant four-fermion operators.
We perform simulations at three values of the lattice spacing and
extrapolate/interpolate our results to the continuum limit and physical
light/strange quark mass. The calculation of the renormalization constants of
the complete operator basis is performed non- perturbatively in the RI-MOM
scheme.
