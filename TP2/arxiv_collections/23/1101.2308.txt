Many finite subgroups of SU(3) are commonly used in particle physics. The
classification of the finite subgroups of SU(3) began with the work of H.F.
Blichfeldt at the beginning of the 20th century. In Blichfeldt's work the two
series (C) and (D) of finite subgroups of SU(3) are defined. While the group
series Delta(3n^2) and Delta(6n^2) (which are subseries of (C) and (D),
respectively) have been intensively studied, there is not much knowledge about
the group series (C) and (D). In this work we will show that (C) and (D) have
the structures (C) \cong (Z_m x Z_m') \rtimes Z_3 and (D) \cong (Z_n x Z_n')
\rtimes S_3, respectively. Furthermore we will show that, while the (C)-groups
can be interpreted as irreducible representations of Delta(3n^2), the
(D)-groups can in general not be interpreted as irreducible representations of
Delta(6n^2).
