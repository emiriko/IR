We calculate the conductivity of arbitrarily stacked multilayer graphene
sheets within a relaxation time approximation, considering both short-range and
long-range impurities. We theoretically investigate the feasibility of
identifying the stacking order of these multilayers using transport
measurements. For relatively clean samples, the conductivities of the various
stacking configurations depend on the carrier density as a power-law for over
two decades. This dependence arises from a low density decomposition of the
multilayer band structure into a sum of chiral Hamiltonians. For dirty samples,
the simple power-law relationship no longer holds. Nonetheless, identification
of the number of layers and stacking sequence is still possible by careful
comparison of experimental data to the results presented here.
