We address measurements of covariant phase observables (CPOs) by means of
realistic eight-port homodyne detectors. We do not assume equal quantum
efficiencies for the four photodetectors and investigate the conditions under
which the measurement of a CPO may be achieved. We show that balancing the
efficiencies using an additional beam splitter allows us to achieve a CPO at
the price of reducing the overall effective efficiency, and prove that it is
never a smearing of the ideal CPO achievable with unit quantum efficiency. An
alternative strategy based on employing a squeezed vacuum as a parameter field
is also suggested, which allows one to increase the overall efficiency in
comparison to the passive case using only a moderate amount of squeezing. Both
methods are suitable for implementantion with current technology.
