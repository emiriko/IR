As part of a mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of young stars with the
Spitzer Space Telescope, an unclassified red emission line object was
discovered. Based on its high ionization state indicated by the Spitzer
spectrum, this object could either be a dusty Supernova Remnant (SNR) or a
Planetary Nebula (PN). In this research note, the object is classified and the
available spectroscopic data are presented to the community for further
analysis. UV/optical/NIR spectra were obtained during the science verification
run of the VLT/X-shooter. A large number of emission lines are identified
allowing the determination of the nature of this object. The presence of
strong, narrow (Delta_v ~ 8 - 74 km/s) emission lines, combined with very low
line ratios of, e.g., [N II]/Halpha and [S II]/Halpha show that the object is a
Planetary Nebula (PN) that lies at an undetermined distance behind the Serpens
Molecular Cloud. This illustrates the potential of X-shooter as an efficient
tool for constraining the nature of faint sources with unknown spectral
properties or colors.
