We demonstrate that period-doubled discrete breathers appear from the
anti-continuum limit of the driven Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model of DNA. These
novel breathers result from a stability overlap between sub-harmonic solutions
of the driven Morse oscillator. Sub-harmonic breathers exist whenever a
stability overlap is present within the Feigenbaum cascade to chaos and
therefore an entire cascade of such breathers exists. This phenomenon is
present in any driven lattice where the on-site potential admits sub-harmonic
solutions. In DNA these breathers may have ramifications for cellular gene
expression.
