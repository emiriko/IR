The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS) is a project that is
observing all known Galactic O stars with B < 13 (~2000 objects) in the
blue-violet part of the spectrum with R~2500. It also includes two companion
surveys (a spectroscopic one at R~1500 and a high resolution imaging one). It
is based on v2.0 of the Galactic O star catalog (v1, Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al.
2004; v2, Sota et al. 2008). We have completed the first part of the main
project. Here we present results on the first 400 objects of the sample.
