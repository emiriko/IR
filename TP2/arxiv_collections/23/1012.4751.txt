The Torelli group, I(S_g), is the subgroup of the mapping class group
consisting of elements that act trivially on the homology of the surface. There
are three types of elements that naturally arise in studying I(S_g): bounding
pair maps, separating twists, and simply intersecting pair maps (SIP-maps).
Historically the first two types of elements have been the focus of the
literature on I(S_g), while SIP-maps have received relatively little attention
until recently, due to an infinite presentation of I(S_g) introduced by Andrew
Putman that uses all three types of elements. We will give a topological
characterization of the image of an SIP-map under the Johnson homomorphism and
Birman-Craggs-Johnson homomorphism. We will also classify which SIP-maps are in
the kernel of these homomorphisms. Then we will look at the subgroup generated
by all SIP-maps, SIP(S_g), and show it is an infinite index subgroup of I(S_g).
