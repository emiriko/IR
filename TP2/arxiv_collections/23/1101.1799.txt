We present OGLE-III Photometric Maps of the Galactic disk fields observed
during the OGLE-III campaigns for low luminosity transiting objects that led to
the discovery of the first transiting exoplanets. The maps contain precise,
calibrated VI photometry of about 9 million stars from 21 OGLE-III fields in
the Galactic disk observed in the years 2002-2009 and covering more than 7
square degrees in the sky. Precise astrometry of these objects is also
provided. We discuss quality of the data and present a few color-magnitude
diagrams of the observed fields. All photometric data are available to the
astronomical community from the OGLE Internet archive.
