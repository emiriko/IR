Two theory-driven models of electron ionization cross sections, the
Binary-Encounter-Bethe model and the Deutsch-M\"ark model, have been design and
implemented; they are intended to extend the simulation capabilities of the
Geant4 toolkit. The resulting values, along with the cross sections included in
the EEDL data library, have been compared to an extensive set of experimental
data, covering more than 50 elements over the whole periodic table.
