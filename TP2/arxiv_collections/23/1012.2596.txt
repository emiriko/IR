Unified exact average capacity results for L-branch coherent diversity
receivers including equal-gain combining (EGC) and maximal-ratio combining
(MRC) are not known. This paper develops a novel generic framework for the
capacity analysis of $L$-branch EGC/MRC over generalized fading channels. The
framework is used to derive new results for the Gamma shadowed generalized
Nakagami-m fading model which can be a suitable model for the fading
environments encountered by high frequency (60 GHz and above) communications.
The mathematical formalism is illustrated with some selected numerical and
simulation results confirming the correctness of our newly proposed framework.
