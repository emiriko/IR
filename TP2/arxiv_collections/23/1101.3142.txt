In order to obtain Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial films crystallized in martensite
structures showing Magnetic-Induced Rearrangement (MIR) of martensite variants,
a fine control of the composition is required. Here we present how the
co-sputtering process might be helpful in the development of Ni-Mn-Ga epitaxial
films. A batch of epitaxial Ni-Mn-Ga films deposited by co-sputtering of a
Ni-Mn-Ga ternary target and a pure manganese target has been studied. The
co-sputtering process allows a precise control of the film compositions and
enables keeping the epitaxial growth of Ni-Mn-Ga austenite during deposition at
high temperature. It gives rise to tune the content of the MIR-active
14-modulated martensite in the film at room temperature, as well as micro and
macro-twinned domains sizes.
