Perfect sampling is a technique that uses coupling arguments to provide a
sample from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain in a finite time
without ever computing the distribution. This technique is very efficient if
all the events in the system have monotonicity property. However, in the
general (non-monotone) case, this technique needs to consider the whole state
space, which limits its application only to chains with a state space of small
cardinality. We propose here a new approach for the general case that only
needs to consider two trajectories. Instead of the original chain, we use two
bounding processes (envelopes) and we show that, whenever they couple, one
obtains a sample under the stationary distribution of the original chain. We
show that this new approach is particularly effective when the state space can
be partitioned into pieces where envelopes can be easily computed. We further
show that most Markovian queueing networks have this property and we propose
efficient algorithms for some of them.
