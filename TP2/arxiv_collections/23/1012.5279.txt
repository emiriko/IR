We report state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the singlet $n
\to \pi^*$ (CO) vertical excitation energy in the acrolein molecule, extending
the recent study of Bouab\c{c}a {\it et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 130}, 114107
(2009)]. We investigate the effect of using a Slater basis set instead of a
Gaussian basis set, and of using state-average versus state-specific
complete-active-space (CAS) wave functions, with or without reoptimization of
the coefficients of the configuration state functions (CSFs) and of the
orbitals in variational Monte Carlo (VMC). It is found that, with the Slater
basis set used here, both state-average and state-specific CAS(6,5) wave
functions give an accurate excitation energy in diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC),
with or without reoptimization of the CSF and orbital coefficients in the
presence of the Jastrow factor. In contrast, the CAS(2,2) wave functions
require reoptimization of the CSF and orbital coefficients to give a good DMC
excitation energy. Our best estimates of the vertical excitation energy are
between 3.86 and 3.89 eV.
