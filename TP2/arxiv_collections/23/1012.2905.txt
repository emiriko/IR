The fusion rules of conformal field theories admitting an sl^(2)-symmetry at
level k=-1/2 are studied. It is shown that the fusion closes on the set of
irreducible highest weight modules and their images under spectral flow, but
not when "highest weight" is replaced with "relaxed highest weight". The fusion
of the relaxed modules, necessary for a well-defined u^(1)-coset, gives two
families of indecomposable modules on which the Virasoro zero-mode acts
non-diagonalisably. This confirms the logarithmic nature of the associated
theories. The structures of the indecomposable modules are completely
determined as staggered modules and it is shown that there are no logarithmic
couplings (beta-invariants). The relation to the fusion ring of the c=-2
triplet model and the implications for the beta gamma ghost system are briefly
discussed.
