Epitaxial niobium-nitride thin films with a critical temperature of Tc=16K
and a thickness of 100nm were fabricated on MgO(100) substrates by pulsed laser
deposition. Low-temperature magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images of the
supercurrent vortices were measured after field cooling in a magnetic field of
3mT at various temperatures. Temperature dependence of the penetration depth
has been evaluated by a two-dimensional fitting of the vortex profiles in the
monopole-monopole model. Its subsequent fit to a single s-wave gap function
results in the superconducting gap amplitude Delta(0) = 2.9 meV = 2.1*kB*Tc, in
perfect agreement with previous reports. The pinning force has been
independently estimated from local depinning of individual vortices by lateral
forces exerted by the MFM tip and from transport measurements. A good
quantitative agreement between the two techniques shows that for low fields, B
<< Hc2, MFM is a powerful and reliable technique to probe the local variations
of the pinning landscape. We also demonstrate that the monopole model can be
successfully applied even for thin films with a thickness comparable to the
penetration depth.
