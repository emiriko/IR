The structure and interface characteristics of (LaVO3)6m(SrVO3)m
superlattices deposited on (100)-SrTiO3 (STO) substrate were studied using
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Cross-section TEM studies revealed that
both LaVO3 (LVO) and SrVO3 (SVO) layers are good single crystal quality and
epitaxially grown with respect to the substrate. It is evidenced that LVO
layers are made of two orientational variants of a distorted perovskite
compatible with bulk LaVO3 while SVO layers suffers from a tetragonal
distortion due to the substrate induced stain. Electron Energy Loss
Spectroscopy (EELS) investigations indicate changes in the fine structure of
the V L23 edge, related to a valence change between the LaVO3 and SrVO3 layers.
