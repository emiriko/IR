After the discovery of V391 Peg b, the first planet detected around a post
Red Giant phase star (Silvotti et al. 2007), the EXOTIME (EXOplanet search with
the TIming MEthod) project is focused on the search for new planets with
similar characteristics. The aim of the project is to organize a global
observing network to collect as much data as possible for a sample of five
subdwarf B (sdB) stars and share them in order to obtain a more precise
analysis. These evolved pulsators may have extremely regular oscillation
periods. This feature makes these stars suitable to search for planetary
companions with the timing method as in the case of pulsars. In this
contribution we present the project and some preliminary results for the star
PG 1325+101 (QQ Vir) after the first two years of activity.
