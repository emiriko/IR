The influence of a single walled carbon nanotube on the structure of a
cholesterol cluster (domain) developed over the surface of the endothelial
protein 1LQV has been investigated using the classical molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation technique. We have observed a substantial impact of carbon nanotube
on the arrangement of the cholesterol domain. The carbon nanotube can drag out
cholesterol molecules, remarkable reducing the volume of the domain settled
down on the protein.
