In this article we present a new format for storing sparse matrices. The
format is designed to perform well mainly on the GPU devices. We present its
implementation in CUDA. The performance has been tested on 1,600 different
types of matrices and we compare our format with the Hybrid format. We give
detailed comparison of both formats and show their strong and weak parts.
