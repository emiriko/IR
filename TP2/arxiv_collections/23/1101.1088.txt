We present the observed offsets of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs)
from their putative host galaxies and compare them to the expected
distributions of merging compact object binaries, given the observed properties
of the hosts. We find that for all but one burst in our sample the offsets are
consistent with this model. For the case of bursts with massive elliptical host
galaxies, the circular velocities of the hosts' haloes exceed the natal
velocities of almost all our compact object binaries. Hence the extents of the
predicted offset distributions for elliptical galaxies are determined largely
by their spatial extents. In contrast, for spiral hosts the galactic rotation
velocities are smaller than typical binary natal velocities and the predicted
burst offset distributions are more extended than the galaxies.
  One SGRB, 060502B, apparently has a large radial offset that is inconsistent
with an origin in a merging galactic compact binary. Although it is plausible
that the host of GRB 060502B is mis-identified, our results show that the large
offset is compatible with a scenario where at least a few per cent of SGRBs are
created by the merger of compact binaries that form dynamically in globular
clusters.
