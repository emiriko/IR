This work is an extended version of a paper published last year in Physical
Review Letters [S. de Man et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 040402 (2009)], where
we presented measurements of the Casimir force between a gold coated sphere and
a plate coated with either gold or an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer. The
experiment, which was performed in air, showed that ITO is sufficiently
conducting to prevent charge accumulation, but still transparent enough to
halve the Casimir attraction when compared to gold. Here, we report all the
experimental details that, due to the limited space available, were omitted in
the previous article. We discuss the performance of our setup in terms of
stability of the calibration procedure and reproducibility of the Casimir force
measurement. We also introduce and demonstrate a new technique to obtain the
spring constant of our force sensor. Furthermore, we present a thorough
description of the experimental method, a comprehensive explanation of data
elaboration and error analysis, and a complete characterization of the
dielectric function and of the surface roughness of the samples used in the
actual experiment.
