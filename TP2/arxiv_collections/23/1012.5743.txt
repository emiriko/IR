Copper ferrite thin films were rf sputtered at a power of 50W. The as
deposited films were annealed in air at 800{\deg}C and slow cooled. The
transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies were carried out on as deposited
as well as on slow cooled film. Significantly larger defect concentration,
including stacking faults, was observed in 50W as deposited films than the
films deposited at a higher rf power of 200W. The film annealed at 800{\deg}C
and then slow cooled showed an unusual grain growth upto 180nm for a film
thickness of ~240nm. These grains showed Kikuchi pattern.
