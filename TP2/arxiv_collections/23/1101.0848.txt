The energy-dependence of the electronic scattering time is probed by Landau
level spectroscopy in quasi neutral multilayer epitaxial graphene. From the
Landau levels broadening we find that the scattering rate increases linearly
with energy. This implies a surprising property of the Landau level spectrum in
graphene - the number of the resolved Landau levels remains constant with the
applied magnetic field. Insights are given about possible scattering mechanism
and carrier mobilities in the graphene system investigated.
