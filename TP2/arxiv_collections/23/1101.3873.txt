The results of diffuse neutron scattering experiment on PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3 single
crystal above the Burns temperature are reported. It is shown that the high
temperature elastic diffuse component is highly anisotropic in low-symmetry
Brillouin zones and this anisotropy can be described using Huang scattering
formalism assuming that the scattering originates from mesoscopic lattice
deformations due to elastic defects. The qualitative agreement between this
model and the experimental data is achieved with simple isotropic defects. It
is demonstrated that weak satellite maxima near the Bragg reflections can be
interpreted as the finite resolution effect.
