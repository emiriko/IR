We numerically examine the spatial evolution of the structure of coherent and
partially coherent laser beams (PCBs), including the optical vortices,
propagating in turbulent atmospheres. The influence of beam fragmentation and
wandering relative to the axis of propagation (z-axis) on the value of the
scintillation index (SI) of the signal at the detector is analyzed. A method
for significantly reducing the SI, by averaging the signal at the detector over
a set of PCBs, is described. This novel method is to generate the PCBs by
combining two laser beams - Gaussian and vortex beams, with different
frequencies (the difference between these two frequencies being significantly
smaller than the frequencies themselves). In this case, the SI is effectively
suppressed without any high-frequency modulators.
