We report the structure of the magnetic field and secular current in a Nearly
Ferroelectric Superconducting (NFE-SC) thin film. It was shown that unlike in
conventional superconducting films, the external radiation causes alternating
pattern of current strips. The strength of the innermost current torrents is
governed by the laser field intensity as well as resonance with the
ferroelectric component. The latter is modeled by secular reflection and random
scattering in the Pippard non-local limit. Our calculations suggest that
corresponding magnetic field pattern affects vortex formation in such material.
