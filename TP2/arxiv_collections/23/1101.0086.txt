We perform a proof-of-concept implementation of the massively parallel
algorithm (P.M. Lushnikov, Opt. Lett., v. 27, 939 (2002)) for simulation of
dispersion-managed wavelength-division-multiplexed optical fiber systems.
Linear scalability of the algorithm with the number of computer cores is
demonstrated. Exact result on the accuracy of the implemented algorithm is
found analytically and confirmed numerically as well as it is compared with to
accuracy of the standard split-step algorithm.
