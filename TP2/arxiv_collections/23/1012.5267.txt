I-V characteristics of polycrystalline Y(1-x)CaxBa2Cu3O(7-{\delta}) samples
(x=0.025 and 0.20) have been measured at different temperatures and magnetic
fields in the range 0.1 T-6.9 T. The scaling behavior has been established for
both samples at all magnetic fields. The dynamic exponent z displays some
morphology dependence with higher value for small grain size sample
Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O(7-{\delta}). The static exponent {\nu} has been determined
from {\rho} vs. T dependence at given magnetic field. The critical exponents
are field independent with one only exception ({\nu} - for
Y0.975Ca0.025Ba2Cu3O(7-{\delta}) sample). This is connected with the special
interrelation between the vortex correlation length, {\xi}, and intervortex
spacing {\alpha} ({\xi} \leq {\alpha}) at all magnetic fields above Tg for this
sample and its better pinning.
