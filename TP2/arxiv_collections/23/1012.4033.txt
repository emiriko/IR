A search for pair production of second-generation scalar leptoquarks in the
final state with two muons and two jets is performed using proton-proton
collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC. The
data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 34 inverse
picobarns. The number of observed events is in good agreement with the
predictions from the standard model processes. An upper limit is set on the
second-generation leptoquark cross section times beta^2 as a function of the
leptoquark mass, and leptoquarks with masses below 394 GeV are excluded at a
95% confidence level for beta = 1, where beta is the leptoquark branching
fraction into a muon and a quark. These limits are the most stringent to date.
