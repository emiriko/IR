We discuss radiation effects in systems with near zero dielectric constant.
An enhancement of intensity by example of transition and diffusive radiations
is demonstrated. A sharp peak in the transition radiation spectral-angular
intensity is predicted. Numerical estimates for specific systems are made and
possible applications are discussed.
