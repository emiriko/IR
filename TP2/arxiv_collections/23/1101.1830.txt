We try to interpret the recently updated measurement of the cosmic ray
electron (CRE) spectrum observed by Fermi-LAT, together with PAMELA data on
positron fraction, in a single-component scenario adopting different
propagation setups; we find that the model is not adequate to reproduce the two
datasets, so the evidence of an extra primary component of electrons and
positrons is strengthened. Instead, a double component scenario computed in a
Kraichnan-like diffusion setup (which is suggested by B/C and $\bar{p}$ data)
gives a satisfactory fit of all exisiting measurements. We confirm that nearby
pulsars are good source candidates for the required $e^\pm$ extra-component and
we show that the predicted CRE anisotropy in our scenario is compatible with
Fermi-LAT recently published constraints.
