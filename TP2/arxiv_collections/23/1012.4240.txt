ECLiPSe is a Prolog-based programming system, aimed at the development and
deployment of constraint programming applications. It is also used for teaching
most aspects of combinatorial problem solving, e.g. problem modelling,
constraint programming, mathematical programming, and search techniques. It
uses an extended Prolog as its high-level modelling and control language,
complemented by several constraint solver libraries, interfaces to third-party
solvers, an integrated development environment and interfaces for embedding
into host environments. This paper discusses language extensions,
implementation aspects, components and tools that we consider relevant on the
way from Logic Programming to Constraint Logic Programming.
