This paper presents a novel theory for understanding the mechanics behind
non-conventional superconductors. It presents the hypothesis that
non-conventional superconductors are 2D lattices of super-cells and that the
superconductivity mechanism involves the ordered hopping of itinerant electrons
along with phase transitions in the edge percolations.
