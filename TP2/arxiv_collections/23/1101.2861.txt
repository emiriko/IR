The problem of the helix-coil transition of biopolymers in explicit solvents,
like water, with the ability for hydrogen bonding with solvent is addressed
analytically using a suitably modified version of the Generalized Model of
Polypeptide Chains. Besides the regular helix-coil transition, an additional
coil-helix or reentrant transition is also found at lower temperatures. The
reentrant transition arises due to competition between polymer-polymer and
polymer-water hydrogen bonds. The balance between the two types of hydrogen
bonding can be shifted to either direction through changes not only in
temperature, but also by pressure, mechanical force, osmotic stress or other
external influences. Both polypeptides and polynucleotides are considered
within a unified formalism. Our approach provides an explanation of the
experimental difficulty of observing the reentrant transition with pressure;
and underscores the advantage of pulling experiments for studies of DNA.
Results are discussed and compared with those reported in a number of recent
publications with which a significant level of agreement is obtained.
