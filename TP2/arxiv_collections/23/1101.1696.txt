Collapse of an intense (2+1)-dimensional wave packet in a medium with cubic
nonlinearity and a two-dimensional dispersion of an order higher than parabolic
is studied both theoretically and experimentally. The carrier waves are
microwave backward volume spin waves which propagate in a stripe made from a
thin ferrimagnetic film and the packet is a spin-wave bullet. We show that
before being self-destroyed the bullet irradiates untrapped dispersive waves,
which is in agreement with a previous theoretical prediction. Since, in
addition, the ferromagnetic medium is characterized by an induced uniaxial
anisotropy, this radiation takes the form of narrow beams of continuous waves
at very specific angles to its propagation direction. Based on our theoretical
calculations we find that these beams are caustic beams and the angles are the
characteristic spin-wave caustic angles modified by the motion of the source.
