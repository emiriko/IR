A theoretical model of a single molecule coupled to many vibronic modes is
presented. At low energies, transport is dominated by electron-vibron processes
where transfer of an electron through the dot is accompanied by the
excitation/emission of quanta (vibrons). Because the frequency of the $n$th
mode is taken as an $n$th multiple of the frequency of the fundamental mode,
several energetically degenerate or quasi-degenerate vibronic configurations
can contribute to transport. We investigate the consequences of strong
electron-vibron coupling in a fully \emph{symmetric} set-up. Several striking
features are predicted. In particular, a gate-asymmetry and pronounced negative
differential conductance features are observed. We attribute these features to
the presence of slow channels originating from the interplay of Franck-Condon
suppression of transport channels and spin/orbital degeneracies.
