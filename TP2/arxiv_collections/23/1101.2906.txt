In Wisniewski et al. 2010, paper I, we analyzed 15 years of spectroscopic and
spectropolarimetric data from the Ritter and Pine Bluff Observatories of 2 Be
stars, 60 Cygni and {\pi} Aquarii, when a transition from Be to B star
occurred. Here we anaylize the intrinsic polarization, where we observe
loop-like structures caused by the rise and fall of the polarization Balmer
Jump and continuum V-band polarization being mismatched temporally with
polarimetric outbursts. We also see polarization angle deviations from the
mean, reported in paper I, which may be indicative of warps in the disk, blobs
injected at an inclined orbit, or spiral density waves. We show our ongoing
efforts to model time dependent behavior of the disk to constrain the
phenomena, using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes.
