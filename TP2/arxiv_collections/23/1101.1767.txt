The magnetoresistance as a function of temperature and field for atomically
flat interfaces between 8 unit cells of LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 is reported.
Anomalous anisotropic behavior of the magnetoresistance is observed below 30 K
for superconducting samples with carrier concentration of 3.5\times10^13 cm^-2
. We associate this behavior to a magnetic order formed at the interface.
