We study the noisy GHZ-W mixture. We demonstrate some necessary but not
sufficient criteria for different classes of separability of these states. It
turns out that the partial transposition criterion of Peres and the criteria of
G\"uhne and Seevinck dealing with matrix elements are the strongest ones for
different separability classes of this 2 parameter state. As a new result we
determine a set of entangled states of positive partial transpose.
