Today, asteroseismology is entering in its golden age thanks to the
observations provided by the CoRoT and Kepler space missions. In particular, we
will make significant progresses in the understanding of the structure and
evolution of solar-like oscillating stars. These stars have acoustic modes
stochastically excited by the near-surface convection. Thanks to the
observations already provided by these two missions, we have detected several
hundred of stars showing solar-like oscillations in the main sequence and
several thousands in the red- giant branch. Here, I give an overview of the
present status of the most important results obtained from both missions for
stellar physics and the potential use of asteroseismology to characterize stars
harboring planets.
