The aim of this thesis is to determine classes of NP relations for which
random generation and approximate counting problems admit an efficient
solution. Since efficient rank implies efficient random generation, we first
investigate some classes of NP relations admitting efficient ranking. On the
other hand, there are situations in which efficient random generation is
possible even when ranking is computationally infeasible. We introduce the
notion of ambiguous description as a tool for random generation and approximate
counting in such cases and show, in particular, some applications to the case
of formal languages. Finally, we discuss a limit of an heuristic for
combinatorial optimization problems based on the random initialization of local
search algorithms showing that derandomizing such heuristic can be, in some
cases, #P-hard.
