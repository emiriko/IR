Results from transport measurements in individual $W_{x}V_{1-x}O_{2}$
nanowires with varying extents of $W$ doping are presented. An abrupt thermally
driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) is observed in these wires and the
transition temperature decreases with increasing $W$ content at a pronounced
rate of - (48-56) K/$at.%W$, suggesting a significant alteration of the phase
diagram from the bulk. These nanowires can also be driven through a
voltage-driven MIT and the temperature dependence of the insulator to metal and
metal to insulator switchings are studied. While driving from an insulator to
metal, the threshold voltage at which the MIT occurs follows an exponential
temperature dependence ($V_{TH\uparrow}\propto\exp(\nicefrac{-T}{T_{0}}))
$whereas driving from a metal to insulator, the threshold voltage follows
$V_{TH\downarrow}\propto\sqrt{T_{c}-T}$ and the implications of these results
are discussed.
