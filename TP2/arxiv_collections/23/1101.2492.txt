We study the properties of dilute bosons immersed in a single component Fermi
sea across a broad boson-fermion Feshbach resonance. The stability of the
mixture requires that the bare interaction between bosons exceeds a critical
value, which is a universal function of the boson-fermion scattering length,
and exhibits a maximum in the unitary region. We calculate the quantum
depletion, momentum distribution and the boson contact parameter across the
resonance. The transition from condensate to molecular Fermi gas is also
discussed.
