It is shown that due to Thomas precession, angular momentum is not generally
a constant of the motion in a quasiclassical model of the Positronium atom
consisting of circular-orbiting point charges with intrinsic spin and
associated magnetic moment. Despite absence of externally-applied torque,
angular momentum is a constant of the motion only if the electron and positron
intrinsic angular momentum vector components perpendicular to the orbital
angular momentum are antiparallel and of equal magnitude.
