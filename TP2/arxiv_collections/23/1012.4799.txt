Optical spectropolarimeters can be used to produce maps of the surface
magnetic fields of stars and hence to determine how stellar magnetic fields
vary with stellar mass, rotation rate, and evolutionary stage. In particular,
we now can map the surface magnetic fields of forming solar-like stars, which
are still contracting under gravity and are surrounded by a disk of gas and
dust. Their large scale magnetic fields are almost dipolar on some stars, and
there is evidence for many higher order multipole field components on other
stars. The availability of new data has renewed interest in incorporating
multipolar magnetic fields into models of stellar magnetospheres. I describe
the basic properties of axial multipoles of arbitrary degree and derive the
equation of the field lines in spherical coordinates. The spherical magnetic
field components that describe the global stellar field topology are obtained
analytically assuming that currents can be neglected in the region exterior to
the star, and interior to some fixed spherical equipotential surface. The field
components follow from the solution of Laplace's equation for the magnetostatic
potential.
