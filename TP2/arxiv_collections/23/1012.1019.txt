We apply ideas from $C^*$-algebra to the study of disordered topological
insulators. We extract certain almost commuting matrices from the free Fermi
Hamiltonian, describing band projected coordinate matrices. By considering
topological obstructions to approximating these matrices by exactly commuting
matrices, we are able to compute invariants quantifying different topological
phases. We generalize previous two dimensional results to higher dimensions; we
give a general expression for the topological invariants for arbitrary
dimension and several symmetry classes, including chiral symmetry classes, and
we present a detailed $K$-theory treatment of this expression for time reversal
invariant three dimensional systems. We can use these results to show
non-existence of localized Wannier functions for these systems.
  We use this approach to calculate the index for time-reversal invariant
systems with spin-orbit scattering in three dimensions, on sizes up to $12^3$,
averaging over a large number of samples. The results show an interesting
separation between the localization transition and the point at which the
average index (which can be viewed as an "order parameter" for the topological
insulator) begins to fluctuate from sample too sample, implying the existence
of an unsuspected quantum phase transition separating two different delocalized
phases in this system. One of the particular advantages of the $C^*$-algebraic
technique that we present is that it is significantly faster in practice than
other methods of computing the index, allowing the study of larger systems. In
this paper, we present a detailed discussion of numerical implementation of our
method.
