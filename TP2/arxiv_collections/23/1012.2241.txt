Periodic solution parameters, in chaotic dynamical systems, form periodic
windows with characteristic distribution in two-parameter spaces. Recently,
general properties of this organization have been reported, but a theoretical
explanation for that remains unknown. Here, for the first time we associate the
distribution of these periodic windows with scaling laws based in fundamental
dynamic properties. For the R\"ossler system, we present a new scenery of
periodic windows composed by multiple spirals, continuously connected,
converging to different points along of a homoclinic bifurcation set. We show
that the bi-dimensional distribution of these periodic windows unexpectedly
follows scales given by the one-parameter homoclinic theory. Our result is a
strong evidence that, close to homoclinic bifurcations, periodic windows are
aligned in the two-parameter space.
