In this comment we explain the discrepancies mentioned by the authors between
their results and ours about the influence of the gravitational quadrupole
moment in the perturbative calculation of corrections to the precession of the
periastron of quasielliptical Keplerian equatorial orbits around a point mass.
The discrepancy appears to be consequence of two different calculations of the
angular momentum of the orbits.
