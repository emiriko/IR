The expansion of the fireball created in Au-Au collisions at 200GeV and Pb-Pb
collisions at 2.76TeV is modelled using the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics.
The experimentally observed interferometry radii are well reproduced.
Additional pre-equilibrium flow improves slightly the results for the lower
energies studied.
