We present a theoretical study of plasmonic lattice solitons (PLSs) formed in
two-dimensional (2D) arrays of metallic nanowires embedded into a nonlinear
medium with Kerr nonlinearity. We analyze two classes of 2D PLSs families,
namely, fundamental and vortical PLSs in both focusing and defocusing media.
Their existence, stability, and subwavelength spatial confinement are studied
in detail.
