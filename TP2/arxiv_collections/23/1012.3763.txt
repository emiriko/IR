The concept of topological persistence, introduced recently in computational
topology, finds applications in studying a map in relation to the topology of
its domain. Since its introduction, it has been extended and generalized in
various directions. However, no attempt has been made so far to extend the
concept of topological persistence to a generalization of `maps' such as
cocycles which are discrete analogs of closed differential forms, a well known
concept in differential geometry. We define a notion of topological persistence
for 1-cocycles in this paper and show how to compute its relevant numbers. It
turns out that, instead of the standard persistence, one of its variants which
we call level persistence can be leveraged for this purpose. It is worth
mentioning that 1-cocyles appear in practice such as in data ranking or in
discrete vector fields.
