The authors demonstrated that a full-Heusler Co2FeGe (CFG) alloy thin film
was epitaxially grown by rapid-thermal-annealing-induced germanidation of an
Fe/Co/pseudo-Ge(001)-on-insulator (GOI) multilayer formed on a Si-on-insulator
(SOI) substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements with the out-of-plane and
in-plane configurations revealed that the CFG film was epitaxially grown along
the [001] direction with the in-plane epitaxial relation of CFG[100]||GOI[100],
although the film slightly contained a texture component. The strong (111) and
(200) superlattice diffraction intensities indicated that the CFG film had a
high degree of order for the L21 structure. Cross-sectional high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy images of the film implied that the film had
the dominant epitaxial and slight texture components, which was consistent with
the XRD measurements. The epitaxial component was grown directly on the BOX
layer of the SOI substrate without the formation of any interfacial layer.
