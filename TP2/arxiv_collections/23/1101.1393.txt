The collision of the doubly-magic nuclei $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb is a benchmark
in nuclear reaction studies. Our new measurements of back-scattered
projectile-like fragments at sub-barrier energies show show that transfer of 2
protons ($2p$) is much more probable than $\alpha$-particle transfer. $2p$
transfer probabilities are strongly enhanced compared to expectations for the
sequential transfer of two uncorrelated protons; at energies around the fusion
barrier absolute probabilities for two proton transfer are similar to those for
one proton transfer. This strong enhancement indicates strong $2p$ pairing
correlations in $^{16}$O, and suggests evidence for the occurrence of a nuclear
supercurrent of two-proton Cooper pairs in this reaction, already at energies
well below the fusion barrier.
