The tensor and spin-orbit forces contribute essentially to the formation of
the spin mean field, and give rise to the same dynamical effect, namely spin
polarization. In this paper, based on time-dependent density functional
calculations, we show that the tensor force, which usually acts like a small
correction to the spin-orbit force, becomes more important in heavy-ion
reactions and the effect increases with the mass of the system.
