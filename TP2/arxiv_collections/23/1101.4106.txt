Globular clusters (GCs) are emerging as a new class of gamma-ray emitters,
thanks to the data obtained from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By now,
eight GCs are known to emit gamma-rays at energies >100~MeV. Based on the
stellar encounter rate of the GCs, we identify potential gamma-ray emitting GCs
out of all known GCs that have not been studied in details before. In this
paper, we report the discovery of a number of new gamma-ray GCs: Liller 1, NGC
6624, and NGC 6752, and evidence for gamma-ray emission from M80, NGC 6139, and
NGC 6541, in which gamma-rays were found within the GC tidal radius. With one
of the highest metallicity among all GCs in the Milky Way, the gamma-ray
luminosity of Liller 1 is found to be the highest of all known gamma-ray GCs.
In addition, we confirm a previous report of significant gamma-ray emitting
region next to NGC 6441. We briefly discuss the observed offset of gamma-rays
from some GC cores. The increasing number of known gamma-ray GCs at distances
out to ~10 kpc is important for us to understand the gamma-ray emitting
mechanism and provides an alternative probe to the underlying millisecond
pulsar populations of the GCs.
