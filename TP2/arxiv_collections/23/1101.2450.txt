We use CFHT/MegaCam data to search for outer halo star clusters in M33 as
part of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS). This work extends
previous studies out to a projected radius of 50 kpc and covers over 40 square
degrees. We find only one new unambiguous star cluster in addition to the five
previously known in the M33 outer halo (10 kpc <= r <= 50 kpc). Although we
identify 2440 cluster candidates of various degrees of confidence from our
objective image search procedure, almost all of these are likely background
contaminants, mostly faint unresolved galaxies. We measure the luminosity,
color and structural parameters of the new cluster in addition to the five
previously-known outer halo clusters. At a projected radius of 22 kpc, the new
cluster is slightly smaller, fainter and redder than all but one of the other
outer halo clusters, and has g' ~ 19.9, (g'-i') ~ 0.6, concentration parameter
c ~ 1.0, a core radius r_c ~ 3.5 pc, and a half-light radius r_h ~ 5.5 pc. For
M33 to have so few outer halo clusters compared to M31 suggests either tidal
stripping of M33's outer halo clusters by M31, or a very different, much calmer
accretion history of M33.
