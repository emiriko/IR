We investigate the dynamics of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), composed of atoms in two distinct hyperfine states, which are linearly
coupled by two-photon Raman transitions. The condensate is loaded into a
double-well potential (DWP). A variety of dynamical behaviors, ranging from
regular Josephson oscillations, to mixed Rabi-Josephson oscillations and to
regimes featuring an increasing complexity, are described in terms of a reduced
Hamiltonian system with four degrees of freedoms, which are the numbers of
atoms in each component in the left and right potential wells, whose
canonically conjugate variables are phases of the corresponding wave functions.
Using the system with the four degrees of freedom, we study the dynamics of
fractional imbalances of the two bosonic components, and compare the results to
direct simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) describing the
bosonic mixture. We perform this analysis when the fractional imbalance
oscillates around a zero-time averaged value and in the self-trapping regime as
well.
