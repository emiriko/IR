We present a family of methods, which can describe behaviour of quantum
ensembles and demonstrate the creation of nontrivial (meta) stable states
(patterns), localized, chaotic, entangled or decoherent from basic localized
modes in collective models arising from the quantum hierarchy of Wigner-von
Neumann-Moyal equations.
