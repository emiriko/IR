We propose a model for the simulation of the blowdown of vessels containing
two-phase (gas-liquid) hydrocarbon fluids, considering non equilibrium between
phases. Two phases may be present either already at the beginning of the
blowdown process (for instance in gas-liquid separators) or as the liquid is
formed from flashing of the vapor due to the cooling induced by pressure
decrease. There is experimental evidence that the assumption of thermodynamic
equilibrium is not appropriate, since the two phases show an independent
temperature evolution. Thus, due to the greater heat transfer between the
liquid phase with the wall, the wall in contact with the liquid experiences a
stronger cooling than the wall in contact with the gas, during the blowdown. As
a consequence, the vessel should be designed for a lower temperature than if it
was supposed to contain vapor only. Our model is based on a compositional
approach, and it takes into account internal heat and mass transfer processes,
as well as heat transfer with the vessel wall and the external environment.
Numerical simulations show a generally good agreement with experimental
measurements.
