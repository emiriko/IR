As an attempt to find a way to resolve the discrepancy between calculated by
traditional methods PV effects and the available set of experimental data, we
analyze the methods of calculations of symmetry violating effects in few-body
nuclear systems. The overview of methods of calculations of PV and TRIV effects
in few-body neutron induced reactions is presented with the analysis of values
of calculated parameters and their accuracy.
