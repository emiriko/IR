We have recently proposed a new method for charging Li-ion batteries based on
large-scale molecular dynamics studies (I. Abou Hamad et al, Phys. Chem. Chem.
Phys., 12, 2740 (2010)). Applying an additional oscillating electric field in
the direction perpendicular to the graphite sheets of the anode showed an
exponential decrease in charging time with increasing amplitude of the applied
oscillating field. Here we present new results exploring the effect on the
charging time of changing the orientation of the oscillating field. Results for
oscillating fields in three orthogonal directions are compared.
