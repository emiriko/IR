We consider geometric and analytical aspects of M-theory on a manifold with
boundary Y. The partition function of the C-field requires summing over
harmonic forms. When Y is closed Hodge theory gives a unique harmonic form in
each de Rham cohomology class, while in the presence of a boundary the
Hodge-Morrey-Friedrichs decomposition should be used. This leads us to study
the boundary conditions for the C-field. The dynamics and the presence of the
dual to the C-field gives rise to a mixing of boundary conditions with one
being Dirichlet and the other being Neumann. We describe the mixing between the
corresponding absolute and relative cohomology classes via Poincar\'e duality
angles, which we also illustrate for the M5-brane as a tubular neighborhood.
Several global aspects are then considered. We provide a systematic study of
the extension of the E8 bundle and characterize obstructions. Considering Y as
a fiber bundle, we describe how the phase looks like on the base, hence
providing dimensional reduction in the boundary case via the adiabatic limit of
the eta invariant. The general use of the index theorem leads to a new effect
given by a gravitational Chern-Simons term CS on Y whose restriction to the
boundary would be a generalized WZW model. This suggests that holographic
models of M-theory can be viewed as a sector within this index-theoretic
approach.
