The migration of the giant planets due to the scattering of planetesimals
causes powerful resonances to move through the asteroid belt and the
terrestrial planet region. Exactly when and how the giant planets migrated is
not well known. In this paper we present results of an investigation of the
formation of the terrestrial planets during and after the migration of the
giant planets. The latter is assumed to have occurred immediately after the
dissipation of the nebular disk -- i.e. "early" with respect to the timing of
the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). The presumed cause of our modeled early
migration of the giant planets is angular mometum transfer between the planets
and scattered planetesimals.
