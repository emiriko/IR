The correlation dynamics is investigated for various bi-partitions of a
composite system consisting of two qubits, and two independent and
non-identical noisy environments. The two qubits have no direct interaction
with each other and locally interact with their environments. Classical and
quantum correlations including entanglement are initially prepared only between
the two qubits. We find that, contrary to the identical noisy environment case,
the entanglement and quantum correlation transfer directions can be controlled
by combining different noisy environments. The amplitude damping environment
determines whether there exists entanglement transfer among the bi-partitions
of a composite system. When one qubit is coupled to an amplitude damping
environment but another one to a bit-flip one, we find a very interesting
result that all the quantum and classical correlations, and even the
entanglement, originally existing between the qubits, can be completely
transferred without any loss to the qubit coupled to the bit-flip environment
and the amplitude-damping environment. We also notice that it is possible to
distinguish the quantum correlation from the classical correlation and
entanglement by combining different noisy environments.
