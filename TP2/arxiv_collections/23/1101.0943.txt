I arrived in Berkeley in 1957, at which time Leo was an Acting Assistant
Professor of Mathematics here. He had recently proven the "individual ergodic
theorem of information theory"---a triumph---and since this was becoming
central to my own interests, it would have been natural for us to work
together. However, Leo's interests shifted to more applied work, specifically
statistics, and he soon moved to UCLA. So we never became collaborators, but we
did became good friends, especially after 1980 when he returned to Berkeley as
a Professor of Statistics.
