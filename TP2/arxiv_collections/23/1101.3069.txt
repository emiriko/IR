I review recent lattice calculations performed with Nf=2 and Nf=2+1 dynamical
fermions which provide a precise computation of the BK bag parameter. I also
report on Nf=2 dynamical quark simulations aiming at the computation of the
full basis of the Delta_S=2 four-fermion operator matrix elements that are
relevant to models beyond the Standard Model.
