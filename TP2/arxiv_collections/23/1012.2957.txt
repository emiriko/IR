Context. To progress in the understanding of evolution of massive stars one
needs to constrain the mass-loss and determine the phenomenon responsible for
the ejection of matter an its reorganization in the circumstellar environment
Aims. In order to test various mass-ejection processes, we probed the geometry
and kinematics of the dust and gas surrounding the A[e] supergiant HD 62623.
Methods. We used the combined high spectral and spatial resolution covered by
the VLTI/AMBER instrument. Thanks to a new multiwavelength optical/IR
interferometry imaging technique, we reconstructed the first velocity-resolved
images with a milliarcsecond resolution in the infrared domain. Results. We
managed to disentangle the dust and gas emission in the HD 62623 circumstellar
disc.We measured the dusty disc inner inner rim, i.e. 6 mas, constrained the
inclination angle and the position angle of the major-axis of the disc.We also
measured the inner gaseous disc extension (2 mas) and probed its velocity field
thanks to AMBER high spectral resolution. We find that the expansion velocity
is negligible, and that Keplerian rotation is a favoured velocity field. Such a
velocity field is unexpected if fast rotation of the central star alone is the
main mechanism of matter ejection. Conclusions. As the star itself seems to
rotate below its breakup-up velocity, rotation cannot explain the formation of
the dense equatorial disc. Moreover, as the expansion velocity is negligible,
radiatively driven wind is also not a suitable explanation to explain the disc
formation. Consequently, the most probable hypothesis is that the accumulation
of matter in the equatorial plane is due to the presence of the spectroscopic
low mass companion.
