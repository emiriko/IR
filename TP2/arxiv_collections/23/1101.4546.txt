We present Gould's Belt (GB) Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations of the Lupus
V and VI clouds and discuss them in combination with near-infrared (2MASS)
data. Our observations complement those obtained for other Lupus clouds within
the frame of the Spitzer "Core to Disk" (c2d) Legacy Survey. We found 43 Young
Stellar Object (YSO) candidates in Lupus V and 45 in Lupus VI, including 2
transition disks, using the standard c2d/GB selection method. None of these
sources was classified as a pre-main sequence star from previous optical,
near-IR and X-ray surveys. A large majority of these YSO candidates appear to
be surrounded by thin disks (Class III; ~79% in Lupus V and ~87% in Lupus VI).
These Class III abundances differ significantly from those observed for the
other Lupus clouds and c2d/GB surveyed star-forming regions, where objects with
optically thick disks (Class II) dominate the young population. We investigate
various scenarios that can explain this discrepancy. In particular, we show
that disk photo-evaporation due to nearby OB stars is not responsible for the
high fraction of Class III objects. The gas surface densities measured for
Lupus V and VI lies below the star-formation threshold (AV {\eqsim}8.6 mag),
while this is not the case for other Lupus clouds. Thus, few Myrs older age for
the YSOs in Lupus V and VI with respect to other Lupus clouds is the most
likely explanation of the high fraction of Class III objects in these clouds,
while a higher characteristic stellar mass might be a contributing factor.
