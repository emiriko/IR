We study the set of models in which the Standard Model symmetry is extended
with the flavour group A4 and there are three copies of the Standard Model
Higgs that transform as a triplet under this group. In this setup, new channels
for flavour violating processes can be studied once the A4 representations of
the fermions in the theory are given. We show that it is of great importance to
take these constraints into account as they can put severe constraints on the
viability of flavour models.
