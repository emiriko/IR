In this paper, we let $\Hecke$ be the Hecke algebra associated with a finite
Coxeter group $W$ and with one-parameter, over the ring of scalars
$\Alg=\mathbb{Z}(q, q^{-1})$. With an elementary method, we introduce a
cellular basis of $\Hecke$ indexed by the sets $E_J (J\subseteq S)$ and obtain
a general theory of "Specht modules". We provide an algorithm for $W\!$-graphs
for the "generic Specht module", which associates with the Kazhdan and Lusztig
cell ( or more generally, a union of cells of $W$ ) containing the longest
element of a parabolic subgroup $W_J$ for appropriate $J\subseteq S$. As an
example of applications, we show a construction of $W\!$-graphs for the Hecke
algebra of type $A$.
