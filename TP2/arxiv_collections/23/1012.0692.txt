The giant planets of our solar system possess envelopes consisting mainly of
hydrogen and helium but are also significantly enriched in heavier elements
relatively to our Sun. In order to better constrain how these heavy elements
have been delivered, we quantify the amount accreted during the so-called "late
heavy bombardment", at a time when planets were fully formed and planetesimals
could not sink deep into the planets. On the basis of the "Nice model", we
obtain accreted masses (in terrestrial units) equal to $0.15\pm0.04
\rm\,M_\oplus$ for Jupiter, and $0.08 \pm 0.01 \rm\,M_\oplus$ for Saturn. For
the two other giant planets, the results are found to depend mostly on whether
they switched position during the instability phase. For Uranus, the accreted
mass is $0.051 \pm 0.003 \rm\,M_\oplus$ with an inversion and $0.030 \pm 0.001
\rm\,M_\oplus$ without an inversion. Neptune accretes $0.048 \pm 0.015
\rm\,M_\oplus$ in models in which it is initially closer to the Sun than
Uranus, and $0.066 \pm 0.006 \rm\,M_\oplus$ otherwise. With well-mixed
envelopes, this corresponds to an increase in the enrichment over the solar
value of $0.033 \pm 0.001$ and $0.074 \pm 0.007$ for Jupiter and Saturn,
respectively. For the two other planets, we find the enrichments to be $2.1 \pm
1.4$ (w/ inversion) or $1.2 \pm 0.7$ (w/o inversion) for Uranus, and $2.0 \pm
1.2$ (w/ inversion) or $2.7 \pm 1.6$ (w/o inversion) for Neptune. This is
clearly insufficient to explain the inferred enrichments of $\sim 4$ for
Jupiter, $\sim 7$ for Saturn and $\sim 45$ for Uranus and Neptune.
