The entanglement classification of four qubits is related to the extremal
black holes of the 4-dimensional STU model via a time-like reduction to three
dimensions. This correspondence is generalised to the entanglement
classification of a very special four-way entanglement of eight qubits and the
black holes of the maximally supersymmetric N = 8 and exceptional magic N = 2
supergravity theories.
