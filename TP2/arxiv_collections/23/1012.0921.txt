In this work, it has been investigated whether photonic density of states
maps can be applied to the design of photonic crystal-based devices. For this
reason, comparison between photonic density of states maps and transmittance
maps was carried out. Results of comparison show full correspondence between
these characteristics. Photonic density of states maps appear to be preferable
for the design of photonic crystal devices, than photonic band gap maps
presented earlier and than transmittance maps shown in the paper.
