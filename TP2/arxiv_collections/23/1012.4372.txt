This is a 'facsimile-style' translation of Wigner's seminal paper on
measurement limitations in the presence of additive conservation laws. A
critical survey of the history of subsequent extensions and variations of what
is now known as the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) Theorem is provided in a paper
published concurrently.
