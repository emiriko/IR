We simulate a colloidal particle (radius R) in a cholesteric liquid crystal
(pitch p) with tangential order parameter alignment at the particle surface.
The local defect structure evolves from a dipolar pair of surface defects
(boojums) at small R/p to a pair of twisted disclination lines wrapping around
the particle at larger values. On dragging the colloid with small velocity v
through the medium along the cholesteric helix axis (an active microrheology
measurement), we find a hydrodynamic drag force that scales linearly with v but
superlinearly with R-in striking violation of Stokes' law, as generally used to
interpret such measurements.
