Studying flavor changing neutral current transitions provides important
information that helps searches for physics beyond the standard model. In this
paper we report on recent measurements of these transitions using data
collected by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron $p\bar{p}$ collider,
including world-leading limits on the branching fraction of the decay
$B^0_{(s)} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, a forward-backward asymmetry measurement in $B^0
\to K^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays which is
consistent and competitive with best $B$-factories results, and the first
observation of the decay $B^0_s \to \phi \mu^+ \mu^-$.
