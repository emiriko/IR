We consider finite-dimensional Markovian open quantum systems, and
characterize the extent to which time-independent Hamiltonian control may allow
to stabilize a target quantum state or subspace and optimize the resulting
convergence speed. For a generic Lindblad master equation, we introduce a
dissipation-induced decomposition of the associated Hilbert space, and show how
it serves both as a tool to analyze global stability properties for given
control resources and as the starting point to synthesize controls that ensure
rapid convergence. The resulting design principles are illustrated in realistic
Markovian control settings motivated by quantum information processing,
including quantum-optical systems and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.
