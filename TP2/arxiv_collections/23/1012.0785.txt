The unusual magnetoelectric effects observed in the multiferroic phase
arising below TN=6.7K in Ba2CoGe2O7 (BCG) are related to the spontaneous
toroidal moment existing in this compound. The transition to the multiferroic
state, which involves spontaneous magnetization, polarization and toroidal
moment gives rise to spontaneous toroidic effects. These effects produce
specific contributions to the spontaneous polarization and magnetization under
applied magnetic or electric fields which provide indirect indications of the
existence and role of the toroidal moment in multiferroic materials. The
toroidic contribution to the electric polarization in BCG is shown to result
from single-ion effects.
