In a recent paper, Custers {\it et al.} \cite{custers} argue for the
existence of a new metallic quantum critical phase at 0 K in the Ge-doped
heavy-fermion system YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ in the presence of magnetic frustration. In
here we discuss the consequences of this identification for the (more standard)
field induced quantum critical phase.
