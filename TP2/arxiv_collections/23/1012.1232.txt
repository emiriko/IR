Analyticity of nucleon form factors allows to derive sum rules which, using
space-like and time-like data as input, can give unique information about
behaviors in energy regions not experimentally accessible. Taking advantage
from new time-like data on proton-antiproton differential cross section and
hence the possibility to separate electric and magnetic form factors also in
the time-like region, we verify the consistency of the asymptotic behavior
predicted by the perturbative QCD for the proton magnetic form factor.
