We review the semiclassical analysis of strings in AdS5xS5 with a focus on
the relationship to the underlying integrable structures. We discuss the
perturbative calculation of energies for strings with large charges, using the
folded string spinning in an AdS3 subset of AdS5 as our main example.
Furthermore, we review the perturbative light-cone quantization of the string
theory and the calculation of the worldsheet S-matrix.
