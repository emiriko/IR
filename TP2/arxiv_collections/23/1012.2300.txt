The nature of the magnetic correlations in Fe-based superconductors remains a
matter of controversy. To address this issue, we use inelastic neutron
scattering to characterize the strength and temperature dependence of
low-energy spin fluctuations in FeTe$_{0.35}$Se$_{0.65}$ ($T_c \sim 14$ K).
Integrating magnetic spectral weight for energies up to 12 meV, we find a
substantial moment ($\agt 0.26 \mu_B/$Fe) that shows little change with
temperature, from below T$_c$ to 300 K. Such behavior cannot be explained by
the response of conduction electrons alone; states much farther from the Fermi
energy must have an instantaneous local spin polarization. It raises
interesting questions regarding the formation of the spin gap and resonance
peak in the superconducting state.
