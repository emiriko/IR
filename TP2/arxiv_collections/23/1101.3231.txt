We propose an adjusted likelihood ratio test of two-factor separability
(Kronecker product structure) for unbalanced multivariate repeated measures
data. Here we address the particular case where the within subject correlation
is believed to decrease exponentially in both dimensions (e.g., temporal and
spatial dimensions). However, the test can be easily generalized to factor
specific matrices of any structure. A simulation study is conducted to assess
the inference accuracy of the proposed test. Longitudinal medical imaging data
concerning schizophrenia and caudate morphology illustrates the methodology.
