We discuss a random matrix theory that was originally constructed to describe
two-color QCD at low density in the phase with a nonzero chiral condensate.
With a particular choice of a parameter, the same random matrix theory also
describes the high-density phase of two-color QCD. In this phase a BCS
superfluid of diquark pairs is formed, and the pattern of chiral symmetry
breaking is very different from that at low density. Analytical results for the
spectral density obtained from this random matrix theory allow for the
extraction of the BCS gap from lattice data.
