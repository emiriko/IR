We extend a classical result by Derdzinski and Shen, on the restrictions
imposed on the Riemann tensor by the existence of a nontrivial Codazzi tensor.
The new conditions of the theorem include Codazzi tensors (i.e. closed 1-forms)
as well as tensors with gauged Codazzi condition (i.e. "recurrent 1-forms"),
typical of some well known differential structures.
