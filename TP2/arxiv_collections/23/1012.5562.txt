We introduce a modified version of the well-known dependency pair framework
that is suitable for the termination analysis of rewriting under forbidden
pattern restrictions. By attaching contexts to dependency pairs that represent
the calling contexts of the corresponding recursive function calls, it is
possible to incorporate the forbidden pattern restrictions in the (adapted)
notion of dependency pair chains, thus yielding a sound and complete approach
to termination analysis. Building upon this contextual dependency pair
framework we introduce a dependency pair processor that simplifies problems by
analyzing the contextual information of the dependency pairs. Moreover, we show
how this processor can be used to synthesize forbidden patterns suitable for a
given term rewriting system on-the-fly during the termination analysis.
