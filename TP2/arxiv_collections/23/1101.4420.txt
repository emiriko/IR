J. Beck has shown that if two players alternately select previously unchosen
points from the plane, Player 1 can always build a congruent copy of any given
finite goal set G, in spite of Player 2's efforts to stop him. We give a finite
goal set G (it has 5 points) which Player 1 cannot construct before Player 2 in
this achievement game played in the plane.
