This paper is devoted to the pricing of Barrier options by optimal quadratic
quantization method. From a known useful representation of the premium of
barrier options one deduces an algorithm similar to one used to estimate
nonlinear filter using quadratic optimal functional quantization. Some
numerical tests are fulfilled in the Black-Scholes model and in a local
volatility model and a comparison to the so called Brownian Bridge method is
also done.
