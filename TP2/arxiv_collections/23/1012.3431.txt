We show that dipolar bosons and fermions confined in a quasi-one-dimensional
ring trap exhibit a rich variety of states because their interaction is
inhomogeneous. For purely repulsive interactions, with increasing strength of
the dipolar coupling there is a crossover from a gas-like state to an
inhomogeneous crystal-like one. For small enough angles between the dipoles and
the plane of the ring, there are regions with attractive interactions, and
clustered states can form.
