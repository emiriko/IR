We construct two classes of infinitely many commuting operators associated
with the elliptic quantum group $U_{q,p}(\hat{sl_N})$. We call one of them the
integral of motion ${\cal G}_m$, $(m \in {\mathbb N})$ and the other the
boundary transfer matrix $T_B(z)$, $(z \in {\mathbb C})$. The integral of
motion ${\cal G}_m$ is related to elliptic deformation of the $N$-th KdV
theory. The boundary transfer matrix $T_B(z)$ is related to the boundary
$U_{q,p}(\hat{sl_N})$ face model. We diagonalize the boundary transfer matrix
$T_B(z)$ by using the free field realization of the elliptic quantum group,
however diagonalization of the integral of motion ${\cal G}_m$ is open problem
even for the simplest case $U_{q,p}(\hat{sl_2})$.
