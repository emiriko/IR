The recent measurement of negative higher-order Kerr effect (HOKE) terms in
gases has given rise to a controversial debate, fed by its impact on short
laser pulse propagation. By comparing the experimentally measured yield of the
third and fifth harmonics, with both an analytical and a full comprehensive
numerical propagation model, we confirm the absolute and relative values of the
reported HOKE indices.
