We present an analysis of the near-infrared continuum emission from the
circumstellar gas disks of Be stars using a radiative transfer code for a
parametrized version of the viscous decretion disk model. This isothermal gas
model creates predicted images that we use to estimate the HWHM emission radius
along the major axis of the projected disk and the spatially integrated flux
excess at wavelengths of 1.7, 2.1, 4.8, 9, and 18 ?m. We discuss in detail the
effect of the disk base density, inclination angle, stellar effective
temperature, and other physical parameters on the derived disk sizes and color
excesses. We calculate color excess estimates relative to the stellar V -band
flux for a sample of 130 Be stars using photometry from 2MASS and the AKARI
infrared camera all-sky survey. The color excess relations from our models make
a good match of the observed color excesses of Be stars. We also present our
results on the projected size of the disk as a function of wavelength for the
classical Be star ? Tauri, and we show that the model predictions are
consistent with interferometric observations in the H, K', and 12 \mu m bands.
