According to the helicity conservation (HCns) theorem, the sum of the
helicities should be conserved, in any 2-to-2 processes in MSSM with R-parity
conservation, at high energies; i.e. all amplitudes violating this rule, must
vanish asymptotically. The realization of HCns in gluon-fusion to charginos or
neutralinos is studied, at the one loop electroweak order (EW), and simple high
energy expressions are derived for the non-vanishing helicity conserving (HC)
amplitudes. These are very similar to the corresponding expressions for $gg \to
W^+W^-, ZZ, \gamma Z, \gamma\gamma $ derived before. Asymptotic relations among
observable unpolarized cross sections for many such processes are then
obtained, some of which may hold at LHC-type energies.
