We consider the problem of quantum communication mediated by an optical
refocusing system, which is schematized as a thin lens with a finite pupil.
This model captures the basic features of all those situations in which a
signal is either refocused by a repeater for long distance communication, or it
is focused on a detector prior to the information decoding process. Introducing
a general method for linear optical systems, we compute the communication
capacity of the refocusing apparatus. Although the finite extension of the
pupil may cause loss of information, we show that the presence of the
refocusing system can substantially enhance the rate of reliable communication
with respect to the free-space propagation.
