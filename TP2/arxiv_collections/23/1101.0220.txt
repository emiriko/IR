Previous studies suggest that punishment is a useful way to promote
cooperation in the well-mixed public goods game, whereas it still lacks
specific evidence that punishment maintains cooperation in spatial prisoner's
dilemma game as well. To address this issue, we introduce a mechanism of
recorded punishment, involved with memory and punishment, into spatial
prisoner's dilemma game. We find that increasing punishment rate or memory
length promotes the evolution of cooperation monotonously. Interestingly,
compared with traditional version, recorded punishment will facilitate
cooperation better through a recovery effect. Moreover, through examining the
process of evolution, we provide an interpretation to this promotion
phenomenon, namely, the recovery effect can be warranted by an evolution
resonance of standard deviation of fitness coefficient. Finally, we confirm our
results by studying the impact of uncertainty within strategy adoptions. We
hope that our work may sharpen the understanding of the cooperative behavior in
the society.
