We report the study of a novel linear magneto-resistance (MR) under
perpendicular magnetic fields in Bi2Se3 nanoribbons. Through angular dependence
magneto-transport experiments, we show that this linear MR is purely due to
two-dimensional (2D) transport, in agreement with the recently discovered
linear MR from 2D topological surface state in bulk Bi2Te3, and the linear MR
of other gapless semiconductors and graphene. We further show that the linear
MR of Bi2Se3 nanoribbons persists to room temperature, underscoring the
potential of exploiting topological insulator nanomaterials for room
temperature magneto-electronic applications.
