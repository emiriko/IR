We report on theoretical study of second harmonic generation in graphene.
Phenomenological analysis based on symmetry arguments is carried out. It is
demontrated, that in ideal graphene samples second harmonic generation is
possible only if the radiation wave vector or its magnetic field is taken into
account. Microscopic theory is developed for the classical regime of radiation
interaction with electrons, where photon energy is much smaller than the charge
carriers characteristic energy. It is demonstrated, that the emitted radiation
can be strongly circularly polarized for the linearly polarized incident wave.
