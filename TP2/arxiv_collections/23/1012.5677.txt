We study bond energy correlation functions in an exactly solvable quantum
spin model of Kitaev type on the kagome lattice with stable Fermi surface of
partons proposed recently by Chua et al, Ref.\[arXiv:1010.1035]. Even though
any spin correlations are ultra-short ranged, we find that the bond energy
correlations have power law behavior with a $1/|{\bm r}|^3$ envelope and
oscillations at incommensurate wavevectors. We determine the corresponding
singular surfaces in momentum space, which provide a gauge-invariant
characterization of this gapless spin liquid.
