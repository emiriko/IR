An effective formalism is developed to handle decaying two-state systems.
Herewith, observables of such systems can be described by a single operator in
the Heisenberg picture. This allows for using the usual framework in quantum
information theory and, hence, to enlighten the quantum feature of such systems
compared to non-decaying systems. We apply it to systems in high energy
physics, i.e. to oscillating meson-antimeson systems. In particular, we discuss
the entropic Heisenberg uncertainty relation for observables measured at
different times at accelerator facilities including the effect of CP violation,
i.e. the imbalance of matter and antimatter. An operator-form of Bell
inequalities for systems in high energy physics is presented, i.e. a
Bell-witness operator, which allows for simple analysis of unstable systems.
