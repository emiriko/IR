We have performed a thermal analysis of the light scalar susceptibilities in
the context of SU(3)-Chiral Perturbation Theory to one loop taking into account
the QCD source of isospin breaking (IB), i.e corrections coming from $m_u\neq
m_d$. We find that the value of the connected scalar susceptibility in the
infrared regime and below the critical temperature is entirely dominated by the
$\pi^0-\eta$ mixing, which leads to model-independent $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^0)$
corrections, where $\epsilon\sim m_d-m_u$, in the combination
$\chi_{uu}-\chi_{ud}$ of flavour breaking susceptibilities.
