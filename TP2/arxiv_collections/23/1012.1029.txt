We consider phenomenological consequences of RS2-n model with infinite extra
dimension, namely, the production, in high energy collisions, of a photon or
Z-boson escaping from our brane in association with a photon remaining on the
brane. This would show up as process $e^+e^-\rightarrow \gamma +$nothing. We
compare the signal with the Standard Model background coming from $e^+e^-
\rightarrow \gamma \bar{\nu} \nu$. We also make a comparison with
$e^+e^-\rightarrow \gamma +$nothing in the ADD model.
