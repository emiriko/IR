We report the influence of external pressure on the temperature dependence of
magnetization and electrical resistivity as well as high-resolution
photoemission studies for an alloy, Ce2Rh(0.7)Co(0.3)Si3, ordering magnetically
below 3 K. It is found that the external pressure has the same effect as that
induced by (further) Co substitution for Rh in the series, Ce2Rh(1-x)Co(x)Si3,
resulting in qualitative changes in the features in the magnetic and transport
data, with a suppression of magnetic ordering followed by quantum critical
point effect. The high-resolution spectra reveal signature of Kondo feature at
ambient feature. These findings support the validity of spin-density-wave
picture in this series.
