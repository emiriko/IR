An accumulation of multi-epoch, high-resolution, optical spectra reveal that
the nearby star G77-50 is a very cool DAZ white dwarf externally polluted by
Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, and possibly Na, Cr, Mn. The metallic and hydrogen absorption
features all exhibit multiple components consistent with Zeeman splitting in a
B~120kG magnetic field. Ultraviolet through infrared photometry combined with
trigonometric parallaxes yield Teff=5310K, M=0.60Msun, and a cooling age of
5.2Gyr. The space velocity of the white dwarf suggests possible membership in
the Galactic thick disk, consistent with an estimated total age of 8.6Gyr.
G77-50 is spectrally similar to G165-7 and LHS 2534; these three cool white
dwarfs comprise a small group exhibiting both metals and magnetism. The
photospheric metals indicate accretion of rocky debris similar to that
contained in asteroids, but the cooling age implies a remnant planetary system
should be stable. A possibility for G77-50 and similarly old, polluted white
dwarfs is a recent stellar encounter that dynamically rejuvenated the system
from the outside-in. Metal abundance measurements for these cooler white dwarfs
have the potential to distinguish material originating in outer region
planetesimals injected via fly-by. If common envelope evolution can generate
magnetic fields in white dwarfs, then G77-50 and its classmates may have
cannibalized an inner giant planet during prior evolution, with their metals
originating in terrestrial bodies formed further out. Although speculative,
this scenario can be ruled out if terrestrial planet formation is prohibited in
systems where a giant planet has migrated to the inner region nominally
engulfed during the post-main sequence.
