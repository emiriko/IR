Insulating substrates are crucial for electrical transport study and room
temperature application of topological insulator films at thickness of only
several nanometers. High quality quantum well films of Bi2Se3, a typical
three-dimensional topological insulator, have been grown on \alpha-Al2O3
(sapphire) (0001) by molecular beam epitaxy. The films exhibit well-defined
quantum well states and surface states, suggesting the uniform thickness over
macroscopic area. The Bi2Se3 thin films on sapphire (0001) provide a good
system to study low-dimensional physics of topological insulators since
conduction contribution from the substrate is negligibly small.
