We perform an analysis of the luminosities of galaxies in groups in the SDSS
DR7. We analyse the luminosity function (LF) as a function of group mass for
different photometric bands, galaxy populations, galaxy positions within the
groups, and the group surrounding large scale density. We find that M*
brightens and alpha becomes steeper as a function of mass in all SDSS
photometric bands, in agreement with previous results. From the analysis of
different galaxy populations, we observe that different methods to split galaxy
populations, based on the concentration index or the colour-magnitude diagram,
produce quite different behaviours in the luminosity trends, mainly for alpha.
These discrepancies and the trends with mass mentioned above are explained when
analysing the LF of galaxies classified simultaneously according to their
concentrations and colours. We find that only the red spheroids have a LF that
strongly depends on group mass. Late type galaxies, whether blue or red, have
luminosity functions that do not depend on group mass. The intrinsic change in
the LF of spheroids and the varying number contributions of the different types
explain all the observed trends with group mass. On the other hand, dividing
the galaxy members in the inner and outer regions of the groups do not
introduce a significant difference in the Schechter parameter trends, except
for the characteristic absolute magnitude in the high group virial mass range
(M>1x10^13 M_sun/h) which is an indication of luminosity segregation in massive
groups. Finally, we also analyse the possible influence of the large scale
surrounding environment on the LF. We find that galaxies inhabiting groups at
low density regions experience more pronounced variations on the Schechter
parameters as a function of groups mass, while galaxies in groups at high
density regions show an almost constant behaviour.
