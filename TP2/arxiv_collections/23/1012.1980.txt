In this presentation the experiences of the LHC experiments using grid
computing were presented with a focus on experience with distributed analysis.
After many years of development, preparation, exercises, and validation the LHC
(Large Hadron Collider) experiments are in operations. The computing
infrastructure has been heavily utilized in the first 6 months of data
collection. The general experience of exploiting the grid infrastructure for
organized processing and preparation is described, as well as the successes
employing the infrastructure for distributed analysis. At the end the expected
evolution and future plans are outlined.
