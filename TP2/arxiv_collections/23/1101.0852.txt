We present exact calculations of the chromatic polynomial and resultant
ground state entropy of the $q$-state Potts antiferromagnet on lattice strips
that are homeomorphic expansions of a strip of the kagome lattice. The
dependence of the ground state entropy on the form of homeomorphic expansion is
elucidated.
