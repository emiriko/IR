We consider the spin-current driven dynamics of a magnetic nanostructure in a
conductive magnetic wire under a heat gradient in an open circuit, spin Seebeck
effect geometry. It is shown that the spin-current scattering results in a
spin-current torque acting on the nanostructure and leading to precession and
displacement. The scattering leads also to a redistribution of the spin
electrochemical potential along the wire resulting in a break of the
polarity-reversal symmetry of the inverse spin Hall effect voltage with respect
to the heat gradient inversion.
