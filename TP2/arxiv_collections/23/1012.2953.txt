We briefly review the computational strategy we have recently introduced for
computing glueball masses and matrix elements, which achieves an exponential
reduction of statistical errors compared to standard techniques. The global
symmetries of the theory play a crucial role in the approach. We show how our
previous work on parity can be generalized to other symmetries. In particular
we discuss how to extract the mass of the 0++, 2++ and 0-+ lightest glueballs
avoiding the exponential degradation of the signal to noise ratio. We present
new numerical results and update the published ones.
