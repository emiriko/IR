We used four known chromospheric activity indicators to measure long-term
activity variations in a sample of 23 M-dwarf stars from the HARPS planet
search program. We compared the indices using weighted Pearson correlation
coefficients and found that in general (i) the correlation between $S_{CaII}$
and \ion{Na}{i} is very strong and does not depend on the activity level of the
stars, (ii) the correlation between our $S_{CaII}$ and H$\alpha$ seems to
depend on the activity level of the stars, and (iii) there is no strong
correlation between $S_{CaII}$ and \ion{He}{i} for these type of stars.
