The limitations on the production and profitability of entanglement in a
harmonic chain under strong driving are considered. We report on the limits of
attainable entanglement for a given set of squeezings of the eigenmodes,
showing that the higher the entanglement the more oscillatory and thus less
easy to profit from. We also comment on propagation properties of entanglement,
discussing the role of fast rotating terms and illustrating several issues with
the example of a sudden switch of the coupling.
