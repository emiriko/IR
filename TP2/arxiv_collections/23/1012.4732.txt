We have studied the sensitivity of supernova production of the gamma emitting
nuclei 26Al, 44Ti and 60Fe to variations of the rates of the triple alpha and
12C(alpha, gamma) reactions. Over a range of twice their experimental
uncertainties we find variations in the production of 60Fe by more than a
factor of five. Smaller variations, about a factor of two to three, were
observed for 26Al and 44Ti. The yields of these isotopes change significantly
when the abundances of Lodders (2003) are used instead of those of Anders and
Grevesse (1989). These sensitivities will limit conclusions based on a
comparison of observed gamma ray intensities and stellar models until the
helium burning rates are better known. Prospects for improving the helium
burning rates are discussed and a new version of the Boyes rate for 12C(alpha,
gamma} is presented.
