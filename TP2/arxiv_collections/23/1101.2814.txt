An efficient method to fabricate transparent glass ceramic fibers containing
in-situ grown Er3+-doped oxide nanoparticles is presented. Characterization of
the drawn fibers exhibits low loss (0.4 dB/m) and broadened Er3+ emission
spectrum. This attractive method offers new scopes for fiber amplifiers.
