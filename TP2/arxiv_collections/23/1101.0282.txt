This invited summary gives some concluding remarks regarding theoretical
aspects of the research presented at Charm2010. I will specialize to the role
of theory and the relative reach of theory and experiment in three of the major
areas of charm physics address at this conference, specifically 1) charm
production, 2) charm weak decays, and 3) charm hadron spectroscopy. After a
discussion of the status of progress on representative topics in each of these
areas I will conclude with a previously unrelated Feynman story from a
conference in the early days of charm.
