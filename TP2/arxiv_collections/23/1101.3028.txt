Symmetry-breaking perturbations destabilize the critical points of the
two-channel and two-impurity Kondo models, thereby leading to a crossover from
non-Fermi liquid behavior to standard Fermi liquid physics. Here we use an
analogy between this crossover and one occurring in the boundary Ising model to
calculate the full zero temperature crossover Green function analytically. In
remarkable agreement with our numerical renormalization group calculations, the
single exact function applies for an arbitrary mixture of the relevant
perturbations in each model. This rich behavior resulting from finite channel
asymmetry, inter-lead charge transfer and/or magnetic field should be
observable in quantum dot or tunneling experiments.
