Spitzer observations reveal the presence of warm debris from a tidally
destroyed rocky and possibly icy planetary body orbiting the white dwarf GD 61.
Ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of the metal-contaminated stellar
photosphere reveal traces of hydrogen, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron, and
calcium. The nominal ratios of these elements indicate an excess of oxygen
relative to that expected from rock-forming metal oxides, and thus it is
possible that water was accreted together with the terrestrial-like debris.
Iron is found to be deficient relative to magnesium and silicon, suggesting the
material may have originated as the outer layers of a differentiated parent
body, as is widely accepted for the Moon.
