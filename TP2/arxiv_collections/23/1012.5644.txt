We develop an adiabatic Floquet picture in the length gauge to describe the
dynamics of a hydrogen atom in an intense laser field. In this picture, we
discuss the roles played by frequency and intensity in terms of adiabatic
potentials and the couplings between them, which gives a physical and intuitive
picture for quantum systems exposed to a laser field. For simplicity, analyze
hydrogen and give the adiabatic potential curves as well as some physical
quantities that can be readily calculated for the ground state. Both linearly
and circularly polarized laser fields are discussed.
