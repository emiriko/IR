Divergence-free Lie algebras (also known as the special Lie algebras of
Cartan type) are Lie algebras of volume-preserving transformation groups. They
are simple in generic case. Dokovic and Zhao found a certain graded
generalization of them. In this paper, we classify all the irreducible and
indecomposable multiplicity-free modules of the simple generalized
divergence-free Lie algebras.
