Integrin signaling regulates cell migration and plays a pivotal role in
developmental processes and cancer metastasis. Integrin signaling has been
studied extensively and much data is available on pathway components and
interactions. Yet the data is fragmented and an integrated model is missing. We
use a rule-based modeling approach to integrate available data and test
biological hypotheses regarding the role of talin, Dok1 and PIPKI in integrin
activation. The detailed biochemical characterization of integrin signaling
provides us with measured values for most of the kinetics parameters. However,
measurements are not fully accurate and the cellular concentrations of
signaling proteins are largely unknown and expected to vary substantially
across different cellular conditions. By sampling model behaviors over the
physiologically realistic parameter range we find that the model exhibits only
two different qualitative behaviours and these depend mainly on the relative
protein concentrations, which offers a powerful point of control to the cell.
Our study highlights the necessity to characterize model behavior not for a
single parameter optimum, but to identify parameter sets that characterize
different signaling modes.
