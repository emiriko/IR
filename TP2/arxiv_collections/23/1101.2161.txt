We give a description of why the existence of a fourth generation is likely
to provide enough CP violation for baryogenesis, and trace how this observation
came about. We survey the current experimental and theoretical pursuits and
outline a research agenda, touching upon unitarity violation and very heavy
chiral quarks, and comment on how the electroweak phase transition picture
might be altered.
