We discuss some ideas resulting from a phenomenological relation recently
declared between the tension of string connecting the static quark-antiquark
pair and surface tension of corresponding cylindrical bag. This relation
analysis leads to the temperature of vanishing surface tension coefficient of
the QGP bags at zero baryonic charge density as T_\sigma = 152.9 +- 4.5 MeV. We
develop the view point that this temperature value is not a fortuitous
coincidence with the temperature of (partial) chiral symmetry restoration as
seen in the lattice QCD simulations. Besides, we argue that T_\sigma defines
the QCD (tri)critical endpoint temperature and claim that a negative value of
surface tension coefficient recently discovered is not a sole result, but
should also exist in ordinary liquids at the supercritical temperatures.
