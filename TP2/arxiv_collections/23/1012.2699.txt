A prognostic watch of the electric power system (EPS)is framed up, which
detects the threat to EPS for a day ahead according to the characteristic times
for a day ahead and according to the droop for a day ahead. Therefore, a
prognostic analysis of the EPS development for a day ahead is carried out. Also
the power grid, the electricity marker state, the grid state and the level of
threat for a power grid are found for a day ahead. The accuracy of the built up
prognostic watch is evaluated.
