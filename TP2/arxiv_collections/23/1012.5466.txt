We consider the simplest class of the R-invariant gauge mediation model with
the gravitino mass in the one to ten keV range. We show that the entropy
production from the supersymmetry breaking sector makes the gravitino into a
warm dark matter candidate. We also discuss that the gluino mass can be lighter
than the wino mass even when the messenger sector satisfies the GUT relations
at the GUT scale.
