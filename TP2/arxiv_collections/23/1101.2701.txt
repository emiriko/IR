We consider the spin determination of new colored particles in the missing
energy plus jets channel at the early stage of LHC. We use a three site moose
model to describe the low energy Lagrangian of all same spin partner (LHT or
UED like) models and check the gauge invariance of the amplitude. For the
benchmark production and decay channel $pp \rightarrow U^{(R)} U^{(R)}
\rightarrow u u B_H B_H$, in contrast to those in supersymmetric models, there
are spin correlations which affect the polar and azimuthal angle distributions
of the quarks from the heavy partner $U^{(R)}$ decay. We show such effects
would be visible in the $E_{\rm T miss} / M_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the
reconstructed azimuthal angle correlation using MAOS reconstruction.
