Principles of financial product synthesis from a few basic financial products
constitute an interesting research topic inspired by Islamic finance. We make
an effort to answer general questions that should be answered before starting
to investigate the main issues concerning this topic with the formalization of
financial products and principles of financial product synthesis. We also
outline the outcome of some preparatory explorations, which have been conducted
with the purpose to form a reasonable preliminary picture of the details of
financial products that are relevant to the study of the principles of
financial product synthesis.
