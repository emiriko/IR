Min-entropy sampling gives a bound on the min-entropy of a randomly chosen
subset of a string, given a bound on the min-entropy of the whole string.
K\"onig and Renner showed a min-entropy sampling theorem that holds relative to
quantum knowledge. Their result achieves the optimal rate, but it can only be
applied if the bits are sampled in blocks, and only gives weak bounds for the
non-smooth min-entropy. We give two new quantum min-entropy sampling theorems
that do not have the above weaknesses. The first theorem shows that the result
by K\"onig and Renner also applies to bitwise sampling, and the second theorem
gives a strong bound for the non-smooth min-entropy. Our results imply a new
lower bound for k-out-of-n random access codes: while previous results by
Ben-Aroya, Regev, and de Wolf showed that the decoding probability is
exponentially small in k if the storage rate is smaller than 0.7, our results
imply that this holds for any storage rate strictly smaller than 1, which is
optimal.
