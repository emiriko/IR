In high rate DS-UWB systems with low spreading factor, the selective
multipath interference canceller with linear equalization (SMPIC-LE) is
developed to alleviate severe multipath interferences induced by the poor
orthogonality of spreading codes. The SMPIC iteratively mitigates the strongest
inter-path interference, inter-chip interference and inter-symbol interference,
while the former two are unresolvable in conventional RAKE-decision feedback
equalizer (DFE) receivers. The numerical results and complexity analysis
demonstrate that SMPIC-LE with proper parameters provides an attractive overall
advantage in performance and computational complexity compared with RAKE-DFE.
In addition, it approaches the matched filter bound well as the RAKE finger in
SMPIC increases.
