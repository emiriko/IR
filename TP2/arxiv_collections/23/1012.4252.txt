We report the realization of a read-write device out of the ferromagnetic
semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As as the first step to fundamentally new information
processing paradigm. Writing the magnetic state is achieved by current-induced
switching and read-out of the state is done by the means of the tunneling
anisotropic magneto resistance (TAMR) effect. This one bit demonstrator device
can be used to design a electrically programmable memory and logic device.
