The flavor sector of Little Higgs models based on product groups, notably the
Littlest Higgs with T parity (LHT), has been extensively studied and some
amount of fine tuning was found to be required to meet the experimental
constraints. However, no such attention has been paid to other classes of
models. Here we analyze the phenomenology of flavor mixing in the lepton sector
of a simple group model, the Simplest Little Higgs (SLH). We obtain the Feynman
rules of the SLH in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge up to the necessary order and
calculate the leading contributions to the rare processes mu -> e gamma, mu ->
eee and mu-e conversion in nuclei. We find results comparable to those of the
LHT model, because in both cases they arise at the one-loop level. These
require the flavor alignment of the Yukawa couplings of light and heavy leptons
at the per cent level or an effective scale of around 10 TeV.
