Accretion disk winds are revealed in Chandra gratings spectra of black holes.
The winds are hot and highly ionized (typically composed of He-like and H-like
charge states), and show modest blue-shifts. Similar line spectra are sometimes
seen in "dipping" low-mass X-ray binaries, which are likely viewed edge-on;
however, that absorption is tied to structures in the outer disk, and
blue-shifts are not typically observed. Here we report the detection of
blue-shifted He-like Fe XXV (3100 +/- 400 km/s) and H-like Fe XXVI (1000 +/-
200 km/s) absorption lines in a Chandra/HETG spectrum of the transient pulsar
and low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17480-2446 in Terzan 5. These features indicate
a disk wind with at least superficial similarities to those observed in
stellar-mass black holes. The wind does not vary strongly with numerous weak
X-ray bursts or flares. A broad Fe K emission line is detected in the spectrum,
and fits with different line models suggest that the inner accretion disk in
this system may be truncated. If the stellar magnetic field truncates the disk,
a field strength of B = 0.7-4.0 E+9 Gauss is implied, which is in line with
estimates based on X-ray timing techniques. We discuss our findings in the
context of accretion flows onto neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.
