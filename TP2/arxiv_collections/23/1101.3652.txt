We investigate a tight-binding model of the octahedron-decorated cubic
lattice with spin-orbit coupling. We calculate the band structure of the
lattice and evaluate the Z_2 topological indices. According to the Z_2
topological indices and the band structure, we present the phase diagrams of
the lattice with different filling fractions. We find that the $(1;111)$ and
$(1;000)$ strong topological insulators occur in some range of parameters at
1/6, 1/2 and 2/3 filling fractions. Additionally, the $(0;111)$ weak
topological insulator is found at 1/6 and 2/3 filing fractions. We analyze and
discuss the characteristics of these topological insulators and their surfaces
states.
