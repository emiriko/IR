We calculate the vector current correlation function for light valence quarks
in the deconfined phase of QCD. The calculations have been performed in
quenched lattice QCD at T=1.45 Tc for four values of the lattice cut-off on
lattices up to size 128^3x48. This allows to perform a continuum extrapolation
of the correlation function in the Euclidean time interval tau*T -in [0.2,
0.5], which extends to the largest temporal separations possible at finite
temperature, to better than 1% accuracy. In this interval, at the value of the
temperature investigated, we find that the vector correlation function never
deviates from the free correlator for massless quarks by more than 9%. We also
determine the first two non-vanishing thermal moments of the vector meson
spectral function. The second thermal moment deviates by less than 7% from the
free value. With these constraints, we then proceed to extract information on
the spectral representation of the vector correlator and discuss resulting
consequences for the electrical conductivity and the thermal dilepton rate in
the plasma phase.
