The bands of graphite are extremely sensitive to topological defects which
modify the electronic structure. In this paper we found non-dispersive flat
bands no farther than 10 meV of the Fermi energy in slightly twisted bilayer
graphene as a signature of a transition from a parabolic dispersion of bilayer
graphene to the characteristic linear dispersion of graphene. This transition
occurs for relative rotation angles of layers around $1.5^o$ and is related to
a process of layer decoupling.
  We have performed ab-initio calculations to develop a tight binding model
with an interaction Hamiltonian between layers that includes the $\pi$ orbitals
of all atoms and takes into account interactions up to third nearest-neighbors
within a layer.
