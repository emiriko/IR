We have calculated the nuclear symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ up to
densities of $4 \sim 5 \rho_0$ with the effects from the Brown-Rho (BR) and
Ericson scalings for the in-medium mesons included. Using the $V_{low-k}$
low-momentum interaction with and without such scalings, the equations of state
(EOS) of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter have been calculated using a
ring-diagarm formalism where the particle-particle-hole-hole ring diagrams are
included to all orders. The EOS for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter
obtained with linear BR scaling are both overly stiff compared with the
empirical constraints of Danielewicz {\it et al.} \cite{daniel02}. In contrast,
satisfactory results are obtained by either using the nonlinear Ericson scaling
or by adding a Skyrme-type three-nucleon force (TNF) to the unscaled
$V_{low-k}$ interaction.
  Our results for $E_{sym}(\rho)$ obtained with the nonlinear Ericson scaling
are in good agreement with the empirical values of Tsang {\it et al.}
\cite{tsang09} and Li {\it et al.} \cite{li05}, while those with TNF are
slightly below these values. For densities below the nuclear saturation density
$\rho_0$, the results of the above calculations are nearly equivalent to each
other and all in satisfactory agreement with the empirical values.
