The communications sector is undergoing significant changes, with the
emergence of a number of platforms available to provide a different range of
services. Some of these platforms are complementary to each other, while others
are competitive, or can provide a valid substitute for some of the services
provided. Up till now, the most important communications platform in most of
the developing countries has been the public switched telecommunication network
(PSTN) which provides access to all households and buildings. This universality
in providing access has also meant that the network has generally been
designated as one for universal service.This chapter focuses on the area where
the most significant changes are taking place in the communication sector. The
objective of this chapter is neither to give an overview of all communication
platforms, nor is it aimed to assess the relative extent to which different
platforms complement or compete with each other. The central theme of this
chapter is to examine the developments in what is commonly refereed to as next
generation access networks and next generation core networks and their role in
convergence.
