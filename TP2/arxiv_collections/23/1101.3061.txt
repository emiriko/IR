The Virtual Observatory (VO) is an international attempt to collect
astronomical data (images, simulation, mission-logs, etc), organize it and
develop tools that let astronomers access this huge amount of information. The
VO not only simplifies the work of professional astronomers, it is also a
valuable tool for education and public outreach. For teachers and astronomers
who actively promote astronomy to the public the VO is an great opportunity to
access real astronomical data, use them and have a taste of the workaday life
of astronomers.
