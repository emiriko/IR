In this paper a short review of the theoretical problems of the pionic
radioactivity as a new nuclear mode is presented. The essential theoretical and
experimental results obtained in the 25 years from the prediction of the
nuclear pionic radioactivity are reviewed. Using the fission-like model it was
shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in the region where the pionic fissility
parameters attain their limiting value X=1 (see Fig.2-3). Hence, the SHE-region
is characterized by the absence of a classical barrier toward spontaneous pion
emission. Consequently, both decay modes, the pionic fission and the
spontaneous fission of SHE nuclides, essentially will be determined only by
shell effects. Then, it was seen that the usual predicted SHE-island of
stability around the double magic nucleus 298-[114], which is not confirmed
experimentally, can be explained by the dominant pionic radioactivity of the
SHE-nuclei from this region. The bimodal symmetric (see Figs. 5ab) as well as,
the supergiant radioactive halos (see Fig. 6) as two important signature of the
nuclear pionic fission are evidentiated.
