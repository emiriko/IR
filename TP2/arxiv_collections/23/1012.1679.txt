We present a method utilizing the continuity equation for the condensate
density to make predictions of the precessional frequency of single off-axis
vortices and of vortex arrays in Bose-Einstein condensates at finite
temperature. We also present an orthogonalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
formalism. We solve the continuity equation for the condensate density
self-consistently with the orthogonalized HFB equations, and find stationary
solutions in the frame rotating at this frequency. As an example of the utility
of this formalism we obtain time-independent solutions for
quasi-two-dimensional rotating systems in the co-rotating frame. We compare
these results with time-dependent predictions where we simulate stirring of the
condensate.
