Motivated by the study of billiards in polygons, we prove fine results for
the distribution of gaps of directions of saddle connections on translation
surfaces. As an application we prove that for almost every holomorphic
differential $\omega$ on a Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 2$ the smallest gap
between saddle connection directions of length at most a fixed length decays
faster than quadratically in the length. We also characterize the exceptional
set: the decay rate is not faster than quadratic if and only if $\omega$ is a
lattice surface.
