In this report, we present Raman spectroscopy investigation of the thermal
stability and dynamics of graphene edges. It was found that graphene edges
(both armchair and zigzag) are not stable and undergo modifications even at
temperature as low as 200{\deg}C. Based on polarized Raman results, we provide
possible structural models on how graphene edges change during annealing. The
zigzag edges rearrange and form armchair segments that are \pm30{\deg} relative
to the edge direction, while armchair edges are dominated by armchair segments
even at annealing temperature as high as 500{\deg}C. The modifications of edge
structures by thermal annealing (zigzag segments rearrange in form of armchair
segments) provide a flexible way to control the electronic properties of
graphene and graphene nanostructures.
