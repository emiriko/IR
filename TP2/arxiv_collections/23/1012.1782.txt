Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field $K$ and with
algebraically closed residue field of positive characteristic $p$. Let $X$ be a
smooth fibered surface over $R$ with geometrically connected fibers endowed
with a section $x\in X(R)$. Let $G$ be a finite solvable $K$-group scheme and
assume that either $|G|=p^n$ or $G$ has a normal series of length 2. We prove
that every quotient pointed $G$-torsor over the generic fiber $X_{\eta}$ of $X$
can be extended to a torsor over $X$ after eventually extending scalars and
after eventually blowing up $X$ at a closed subscheme of its special fiber
$X_s$.
