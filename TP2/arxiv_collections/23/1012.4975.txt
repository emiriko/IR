The Gompertz model describes the growth in time of the size of significant
quantities associated to a large number of systems, taking into account
nonlinearity features by a linear equation satisfied by a nonlinear function of
the size. Following this scheme, we introduce a class of hierarchical maps
which describe discrete sequences of intermediate characteristic scales. We
find the general solutions of the maps, which account for a rich set of
possible phenomena. Eventually, we provide an important application, by showing
that a map belonging to the class so introduced generates all the observed
astrophysical length and mass scales.
