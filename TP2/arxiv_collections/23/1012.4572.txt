We review an analysis of a consistent renormalization of the top and bottom
quark/squark sector of the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). Various
renormalization schemes are defined, analyzed analytically and tested
numerically in the decays Stop_2 -> Sbottom_i H^+/W^+ (i = 1,2). No scheme is
found that produces numerically acceptable results over all the cMSSM parameter
space, where problems occur mostly already for real parameters. Some numerical
examples for Gamma(Stop_2 -> Sbottom_1 H^+) in our preferred scheme, "m_b, A_b
DRbar" are shown.
