I discuss aspects of the QCD sum rule method which attracted theorists'
attention in earnest at a relatively late stage and are not yet fully solved.
At first I briefly review such general topics as the structure of the operator
product expansion in QCD and intrinsic limitations of the quark-hadron duality
concept. In the second part I comment on holographic constructions - a focus of
the current efforts to say something new on QCD at strong coupling. Of
particular interest to me is the recent derivation of the vacuum magnetic
susceptibility due to Son and Yamamoto. Remarkably, their result is the same as
that obtained previously by Vainshtein in the field-theoretic framework. For
some reasons, the Vainshtein formula, unexpectedly, is not successfull
numerically. This is a slightly modified version of the talk delivered at 15th
International QCD Conference "QCD 10," June 28 - July 3, 2010, Montpellier,
France.
