We examine the single-photon processes in the frame work of supersymmetric
models at future e+e- linear colliders. According to the recent experimental
achievement, the optimistic polarization degrees for both electron and positron
beams are taken into account to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio revealing the
observable difference between supersymmetry breaking models. The minimal
supergravity model and the minimal SU(5) grand unified model in gaugino
mediation have been examined as examples. We see that after several years of
accummulating data, the difference of the number of single-photon events
between the two models received from the collider would be in excess of three
times the statistical error, providing us the possibility to probe which model
would be realized in nature. The result is well suitable for the future running
of the International Linear Collider.
