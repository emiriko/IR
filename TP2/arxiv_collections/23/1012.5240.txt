We investigate the exploration problem of a short-sighted mobile robot moving
in an unknown cellular room. To explore a cell, the robot must enter it. Once
inside, the robot knows which of the 4 adjacent cells exist and which are
boundary edges. The robot starts from a specified cell adjacent to the room's
outer wall; it visits each cell, and returns to the start. Our interest is in a
short exploration tour; that is, in keeping the number of multiple cell visits
small. For abitrary environments containing no obstacles we provide a strategy
producing tours of length S <= C + 1/2 E - 3, and for environments containing
obstacles we provide a strategy, that is bound by S <= C + 1/2 E + 3H + WCW -
2, where C denotes the number of cells-the area-, E denotes the number of
boundary edges-the perimeter-, and H is the number of obstacles, and WCW is a
measure for the sinuosity of the given environment.
