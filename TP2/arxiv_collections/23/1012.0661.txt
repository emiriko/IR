With gravity, ionization, and radiation being considered, we perform 2.5D
compressible resistive MHD simulations of chromospheric magnetic reconnection
using the CIP-MOCCT scheme. The temperature distribution of the quiet-Sun
atmospheric model VALC and the helium abundance (10%) are adopted. Our 2.5D MHD
simulation reproduces qualitatively the temperature enhancement observed in
chromospheric microflares. The temperature enhancement $\Delta T$ is
demonstrated to be sensitive to the background magnetic field, whereas the
total evolution time $\Delta t$ is sensitive to the magnitude of the anomalous
resistivity. Moveover, we found a scaling law, which is described as $\Delta
T/\Delta t \sim {n_H}^{-1.5} B^{2.1} {\eta_0}^{0.88}$. Our results also
indicate that the velocity of the upward jet is much greater than that of the
downward jet and the X-point may move up or down.
