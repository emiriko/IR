The amount and characteristics of quantum-mechanically generated relic
gravitational waves and primordial density perturbations is a subject of great
theoretical and observational importance. Unfortunately, this subject is deeply
contaminated by inflationary misunderstandings and incorrect "standard
inflationary results". This note presents comments on a particular paper,
arXiv:1008.4471v1. However, the comments may have a more general significance
and may be of interest to other researchers working in this area of science.
