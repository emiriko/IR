Oceanic planets formed by type Ia supernovae become spectacularly abundant as
stars cease to shine. However, the timing may not be altogether inappropriate.
Neutrino annihilation might thermally regulate iron-cored water-worlds,
sustaining habitable subglacial oceans. If dark matter and dark energy decay to
neutrinos, the universe could support life for ~ 10^23 years. Civilisations
surmounting the arduous process of hereditary genetics soon discern the biotic
nature of the cosmos and accept their role within it. An infrastructure guards
against the spread of rogue colonists. Recruited colonists could harness the
available energy for the benefit of life with stupendous efficiency, providing
unmistakeable evidence of cosmological optimisation. The anthropic
coincidences, inhospitable aspects of the current universe and Fermi's paradox
would all be illuminated. Semiconductors sensitive to a neutrinoelectric effect
offer a laboratory test of the planetary heating mechanism.
