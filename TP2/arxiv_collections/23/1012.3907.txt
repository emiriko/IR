Spatio-temporal correlations of intensity of traffic are analysed for one
week data collected in the motorway M-30 around Madrid in January 2009. We
found that the lifetime of these correlations is the shortest in the evening,
between 6 and 8 p.m. This lifetime is a new indicator how much attention of
drivers is demanded in given traffic conditions.
