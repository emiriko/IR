We derive a phenomenological theory of current-induced staggered
magnetization dynamics in antiferromagnets. The theory captures the reactive
and dissipative current-induced torques and the conventional effects of
magnetic fields and damping. A Walker ansatz describes the dc current-induced
domain-wall motion when there is no dissipation. If magnetic damping and
dissipative torques are included, the Walker ansatz remains robust when the
domain-wall moves slowly. As in ferromagnets, the domain-wall velocity is
proportional to the ratio between the dissipative-torque and the magnetization
damping. In addition, a current-driven antiferromagnetic domain-wall acquires a
net magnetic moment.
