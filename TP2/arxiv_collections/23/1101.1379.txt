In this paper, we propose Probabilistic discrete-time Projection Temporal
Logic (PrPTL), which extends Projection Temporal Logic (PTL) with probability.
To this end, some useful formulas are derived and some logic laws are given.
Further, we define Time Normal Form (TNF) for PrPTL as the standard form and
prove that any PrPTL formulas can be rewritten to TNF. According to the TNF, we
construct the time normal form graph which can be used for the probabilistic
model checking on PrPTL.
