We study nucleation dynamics of Ising model in a topology that consists of
two coupled random networks, thereby mimicking the modular structure observed
in real-world networks. By introducing a variant of a recently developed
forward flux sampling method, we efficiently calculate the rate and elucidate
the pathway for nucleation process. It is found that as the network modularity
becomes worse the nucleation undergoes a transition from two-step to one-step
process. Interestingly, the nucleation rate shows a nonmonotonic dependency on
the modularity, in which a maximal nucleation rate occurs at a moderate level
of modularity. A simple mean field analysis is proposed to qualitatively
illustrate the simulation results.
