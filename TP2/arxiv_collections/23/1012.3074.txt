We study fully backreacting, Gauss-Bonnet (GB) holographic superconductors in
5 bulk spacetime dimensions. We explore the system's dependence on the scalar
mass for both positive and negative GB coupling, $\alpha$. We find that when
the mass approaches the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound and
$\alpha\rightarrow L^2/4$ the effect of backreaction is to increase the
critical temperature, $T_c$, of the system: the opposite of its effect in the
rest of parameter space. We also find that reducing $\alpha$ below zero
increases $T_c$ and that the effect of backreaction is diminished. We study the
zero temperature limit, proving that this system does not permit regular
solutions for a non-trivial, tachyonic scalar field and constrain possible
solutions for fields with positive masses. We investigate singular, zero
temperature solutions in the Einstein limit but find them to be incompatible
with the concept of GB gravity being a perturbative expansion of Einstein
gravity. We study the conductivity of the system, finding that the inclusion of
backreaction hinders the development of poles in the conductivity that are
associated with quasi-normal modes approaching the real axis from elsewhere in
the complex plane.
