It is known that a dual quasi-bialgebra with antipode $H$, i.e. a dual
quasi-Hopf algebra, fulfils a fundamental theorem for right dual quasi-Hopf
$H$-bicomodules. The converse in general is not true. We prove that, for a dual
quasi-bialgebra $H$, the structure theorem amounts to the existence of a
suitable map $S:H\rightarrow H$ that we call a preantipode of $H$.
