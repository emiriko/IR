The magnetized MINOS Near Detector, at a depth of 225 meters of water
equivalent (mwe), is used to measure the atmospheric muon charge ratio. The
ratio of observed positive to negative atmospheric muon rates, using 301 days
of data, is measured to be 1.266+/-0.001(stat.)+0.015/-0.014(syst.). This
measurement is consistent with previous results from other shallow underground
detectors, and is 0.108+/-0.019(stat. + syst.) lower than the measurement at
the functionally identical MINOS Far Detector at a depth of 2070 mwe. This
increase in charge ratio as a function of depth is consistent with an increase
in the fraction of muons arising from kaon decay for increasing muon surface
energies.
