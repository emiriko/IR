A major ingredient in Higgs searches at the Tevatron and LHC is the
elimination of backgrounds with jets. In current H -> WW -> lnulnu searches,
jet algorithms are used to veto central jets to obtain a 0-jet sample, which is
then analyzed to discover the Higgs signal. Imposing this tight jet veto
induces large double logarithms which significantly modify the Higgs production
cross section. These jet-veto logarithms are presently only accounted for at
fixed order or with the leading-logarithmic summation from parton-shower Monte
Carlos. Here we consider Higgs production with an inclusive event-shape
variable for the jet veto, namely beam thrust Tau_cm, which has a close
correspondence with a traditional p_T jet veto. Tau_cm allows us to
systematically sum the large jet-veto logarithms to higher orders and to
provide better estimates for theoretical uncertainties. We present results for
the 0-jet Higgs production cross section from gluon fusion at
next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order (NNLL), fully incorporating
fixed-order results at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). At this order the
scale uncertainty is 15-20%, depending on the cut, implying that a larger scale
uncertainty should be used in current Tevatron bounds on the Higgs.
