This thesis presents the development of entropy-elastic gelatin based
networks in the form of films or scaffolds. The materials have good prospects
for biomedical applications, especially in the context of bone regeneration.
Entropy-elastic gelatin based hydrogel films with varying crosslinking
densities were prepared with tailored mechanical properties. Gelatin was
covalently crosslinked in water above its sol gel transition, which suppressed
the gelatin chain helicity. Amorphous films were prepared with tailorable
degrees of swelling and wet state Young's modulus. The knowledge gained with
this bulk material was transferred to the integrated process of foaming and
crosslinking to obtain porous gelatin-based scaffolds. A gelatin solution was
foamed in the presence of saponin and the resulting foam was fixed by chemical
crosslinking with a diisocyanate. The scaffolds were analyzed in the dry state
by micro computed tomography (\mu CT, porosity: 65\pm 11-73\pm 14 vol.-%), and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM, pore size: 117\pm 28-166 \pm 32 \mu m).
After equilibration with water, the scaffolds were form-stable and displayed
shape recovery after removal of mechanical loads. The composition dependent
compression moduli (Ec: 10 50 kPa) were comparable to the bulk micromechanical
Young's moduli, which were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
hydrolytic degradation profile could be adjusted, and a controlled decrease of
mechanical properties was observed. The scaffold cytotoxicity and immunologic
responses were analyzed in vitro. Indirect eluate tests were carried out with
L929 cells so that fully cytocompatible scaffolds were obtained. Furthermore,
the material immune response was investigated in vitro. Minimal material
endotoxin contamination was successfully achieved (<0.5 EU/mL) by using
low-endotoxin gelatin and performing all synthetic steps in cleanroom.
