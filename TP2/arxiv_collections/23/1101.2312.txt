In this work, the possibilities for segmentation of cells from their
background and each other in digital image were tested, combined and improoved.
Lot of images with young, adult and mixture cells were able to prove the
quality of described algorithms. Proper segmentation is one of the main task of
image analysis and steps order differ from work to work, depending on input
images. Reply for biologicaly given question was looking for in this work,
including filtration, details emphasizing, segmentation and sphericity
computing. Order of algorithms and way to searching for them was also
described. Some questions and ideas for further work were mentioned in the
conclusion part.
