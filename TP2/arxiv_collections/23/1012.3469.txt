Beyond the main sequence solar type stars undergo extensive mass loss,
providing an environment where planet and brown dwarf companions interact with
the surrounding material. To examine the interaction of substellar mass objects
embedded in the stellar wind of an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, three
dimensional hydrodynamical simulations at high resolution have been calculated
utilizing the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. Attention is focused on the
perturbation of the substellar mass objects on the morphology of the outflowing
circumstellar matter. In particular, we determine the properties of the
resulting spiral density wake as a function of the mass, orbital distance, and
velocity of the object as well as the wind velocity and its sound velocity. Our
results suggest that future observations of the spiral pattern may place
important constraints on the properties of the unseen low mass companion in the
outflowing stellar wind.
