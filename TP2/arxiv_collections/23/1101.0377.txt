The temporal communication patterns of human individuals are known to be
inhomogeneous or bursty, which is reflected as the heavy tail behavior in the
inter-event time distribution. As the cause of such bursty behavior two main
mechanisms have been suggested: a) Inhomogeneities due to the circadian and
weekly activity patterns and b) inhomogeneities rooted in human task execution
behavior. Here we investigate the roles of these mechanisms by developing and
then applying systematic de-seasoning methods to remove the circadian and
weekly patterns from the time-series of mobile phone communication events of
individuals. We find that the heavy tails in the inter-event time distributions
remain robustly with respect to this procedure, which clearly indicates that
the human task execution based mechanism is a possible cause for the remaining
burstiness in temporal mobile phone communication patterns.
