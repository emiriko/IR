We prove that the automorphism group of the dihedral quandle with n elements
is isomorphic to the affine group of the integers mod n, and also obtain the
inner automorphism group of this quandle. In [9], automorphism groups of
quandles (up to isomorphisms) of order less than or equal to 5 were given. With
the help of the software Maple, we compute the inner and automorphism groups of
all seventy three quandles of order six listed in the appendix of [4]. Since
computations of automorphisms of quandles relates to the problem of
classification of quandles, we also describe an algorithm implemented in C for
computing all quandles (up to isomorphism) of order less than or equal to nine.
