The final goal of Information Retrieval (IR) is knowledge production.
However, it has been argued that knowledge production is not an individual
effort but a collaborative effort. Collaboration in information retrieval is
geared towards knowledge sharing and creation of new knowledge by users. This
paper discusses Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) and how it culminates
to knowledge creation. It explains how created knowledge is organized and
structured. It describes a functional architecture for the development of a CIR
prototype called MECOCIR. Some of the features of the prototype are presented
as well as how they facilitate collaborative knowledge exploitation. Knowledge
creation is explained through the knowledge conversion/transformation processes
proposed by Nonaka and CIR activities that facilitate these processes are
high-lighted and discussed
