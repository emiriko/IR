We have used the Green Bank Telescope at 350MHz to search 50 faint,
unidentified Fermi Gamma-ray sources for radio pulsations. So far, these
searches have resulted in the discovery of 10 millisecond pulsars, which are
plausible counterparts to these unidentified Fermi sources. Here we briefly
describe this survey and the characteristics of the newly discovered MSPs.
