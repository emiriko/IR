A modified Mott-Smith method for predicting the one-dimensional shock wave
solution at very high Mach numbers is constructed by developing a system of
fluid dynamic equations. The predicted shock solutions in a gas of Maxwell
molecules, a hard sphere gas and in argon using the newly proposed formalism
are compared with the experimental data, direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
solution and other solutions computed from some existing theories for Mach
numbers M<50. In the limit of an infinitely large Mach number, the predicted
shock profiles are also compared with the DSMC solution. The density,
temperature and heat flux profiles calculated at different Mach numbers have
been shown to have good agreement with the experimental and DSMC solutions
