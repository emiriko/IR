The paper is an informal report on joint work with Stefan Haller on Dynamics
in relation with Topology and Spectral Geometry. By dynamics one means a smooth
vector field on a closed smooth manifold; the elements of dynamics of concern
are the rest points, instantons and closed trajectories. One discusses their
counting in the case of a generic vector field which has some additional
properties satisfied by a still very large class of vector fields.
