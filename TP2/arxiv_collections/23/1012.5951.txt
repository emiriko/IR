We formulate elasticity theory with microrotations using the framework of
gauge theories, which has been developed and successfully applied in various
areas of gravitation and cosmology. Following this approach, we demonstrate the
existence of particle-like solutions. Mathematically this is due to the fact
that our equations of motion are of Sine-Gordon type and thus have soliton type
solutions. Similar to Skyrmions and Kinks in classical field theory, we can
show explicitly that these solutions have a topological origin.
