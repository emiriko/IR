We study the scaling behavior of physical observables in strongly-flavored
asymptotically free gauge theories, such as many-flavor QCD. Such theories
approach a quantum critical point when the number of fermion flavors is
increased. It is well-known that physical observables at this quantum critical
point exhibit an exponential scaling behavior (Miransky scaling), provided the
gauge coupling is considered as a constant external parameter. This scaling
behavior is modified when the scale dependence of the gauge coupling is taken
into account. Provided that the gauge coupling approaches an IR fixed point, we
derive the resulting universal power-law corrections to the exponential scaling
behavior and show that they are uniquely determined by the IR critical exponent
of the gauge coupling. To illustrate our findings, we compute the universal
corrections in many-flavor QCD with the aid of nonperturbative functional
renormalization group methods. In this case, we expect the power-law scaling to
be quantitatively more relevant if the theories are probed, for instance, at
integer Nf as done in lattice simulations.
