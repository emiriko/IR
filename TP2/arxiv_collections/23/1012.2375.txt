Most extrasolar planets currently known were discovered by means of an
indirect method that measures the stellar wobble caused by the planet. We
previously studied a triple system composed of a star and a nearby binary on
circular coplanar orbits. We showed that although the effect of the binary on
the star can be differentiated from the stellar wobble caused by a planet,
because of observational limitations the two effects may often remain
indistinguishable. Here, we develop a model that applies to eccentric and
inclined orbits. We show that the binary's effect is more likely to be mistaken
by planet(s) in the case of coplanar motion observed equator-on. Moreover, when
the orbits are eccentric, the magnitude of the binary's effect may be larger
than in the circular case. Additionally, an eccentric binary can mimic two
planets with orbital periods in the ratio 2/1. However, when the star's orbit
around the binary's center of mass has a high eccentricity and a reasonably
well-constrained period, it should be easier to distinguish the binary's effect
from a planet.
