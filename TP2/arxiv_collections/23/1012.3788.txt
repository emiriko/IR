Error performance is one of the main performance measures and derivation of
its closed-form expression has proved to be quite involved for certain systems.
In this letter, a unified closed-form expression, applicable to different
binary modulation schemes, for the bit error rate of dual-branch selection
diversity based systems undergoing independent but not necessarily identically
distributed generalized-K fading is derived in terms of the extended
generalized bivariate Meijer G-function.
