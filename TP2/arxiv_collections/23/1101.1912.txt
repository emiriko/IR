Nonextensive statistics in a Blast-Wave model (TBW) is implemented to
describe the identified hadron production in relativistic p+p and
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Incorporating the core and corona components within
the TBW formalism allows us to describe simultaneously some of the major
observations in hadronic observables at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider
(RHIC): the Number of Constituent Quark Scaling (NCQ), the large radial and
elliptic flow, the effect of gluon saturation and the suppression of hadron
production at high transverse momentum (pT) due to jet quenching. In this
formalism, the NCQ scaling at RHIC appears as a consequence of non-equilibrium
process. Our study also provides concise reference distributions with a least
chi2 fit of the available experimental data for future experiments and models.
