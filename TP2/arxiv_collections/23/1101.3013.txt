We report demonstration of light detection in liquid argon using an acrylic
lightguide detector system. This opens the opportunity for development of an
inexpensive, large-area light collection system for large liquid argon time
projection chambers. The guides are constructed of acrylic, with TPB embedded
in a surface coating with a matching index of refraction. We study the response
to early scintillation light produced by a 5.3 MeV alpha. We measure coating
responses from 7 to 8 PE on average, compared to an ideal expectation of 10 PE
on average. We estimate the attenuation length of light along the lightguide
bar to be greater than 0.5 m. The coating response and the attenuation length
can be improved; we show, however, that these results are already sufficient
for triggering in a large detector.
