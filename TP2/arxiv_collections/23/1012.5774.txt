Recent research indicates that packet transmission employing random linear
network coding can be regarded as transmitting subspaces over a linear operator
channel (LOC). In this paper we propose the framework of linear operator
broadcast channels (LOBCs) to model packet broadcasting over LOCs, and we do
initial work on the capacity region of constant-dimension multiplicative
LOBCs(CMLOBCs), a generalization of broadcast erasure channels. Two fundamental
problems regarding CMLOBCs are addressed-finding necessary and sufficient
conditions for degradation and deciding whether time sharing suffices to
achieve the boundary of the capacity region in the degraded case.
