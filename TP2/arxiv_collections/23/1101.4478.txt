The fundamental organizing principle resulting in the periodic table is the
nuclear charge. Arranging the chemical elements in an increasing atomic number
order, a symmetry pattern known as the Periodic Table is detectable. The
correlation between nuclear charge and the Periodic System of the Chemical
Elements (PSCE) indicates that the symmetry emerges from the nucleus. Nuclear
symmetry can only exist if the relative positions of the nucleons in the
nucleus are invariant. Pauli exclusion principle can also be interpreted as the
nucleons should occupy a lattice position. Based on symmetry and other
indicatives face centered cubic arrangement have been proposed for the nuclear
lattice. A lattice model, representing the protons and the neutrons by equal
spheres and arranging them alternately in a face centered cubic structure
forming a double tetrahedron, is able to reproduce all of the properties of the
nucleus including the quantum numbers and the periodicity of the elements.
Based on the geometry of the nuclear structure it is shown that when a new
'layer' of the nuclear structure starts then the distance between the first
proton in the new layer and the charge center of the nucleus is smaller than
the distance of the proton, which completed the preceding 'layer'. Thus a new
valence electron shell should start to develop when the nuclear structure is
expanded. The expansion of the double tetrahedron FCC nuclear lattice model
offers a feasible physical explanation how the nucleus affects the electronic
configuration of the chemical elements depicted by the periodic table.
