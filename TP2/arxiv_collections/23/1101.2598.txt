We show a method for implementing universal quantum computing using of a
singlet and triplets of nanowire double quantum dots coupled to a
one-dimensional transmission line resonator. This method is attractive for both
quantum computing and quantum control with inhibition of spontaneous emission,
enhanced spin qubit lifetime, strong coupling and quantum nondemolition
measurements of spin qubits. We analyze the performance and stability of all
required operations and emphasize that all techniques are feasible with current
experimental technology.
