We explain the dynamics of cold atoms, initially trapped and cooled in a
magneto-optic trap, in a monochromatic stationary standing electromagnetic wave
field. In the large detuning limit the system is modeled as a nonlinear quantum
pendulum. We show that wave packet evolution of the quantum particle probes
parametric regimes in the quantum pendulum which support classical period,
quantum mechanical revival and super revival phenomena. Interestingly, complete
reconstruction in particular parametric regime at quantum revival times is
independent of potential height.
