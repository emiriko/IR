We show that Wronskians between properly chosen linearly independent
solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation greatly facilitate the study of quantum
scattering in one dimension. They enable one to obtain the necessary
relationships between the coefficients that determine the asymptotic behavior
of the wavefunction. As illustrative examples we calculate the transmission
probability for the penetration of a Gaussian barrier and the scattering
resonances for a Gaussian well.
