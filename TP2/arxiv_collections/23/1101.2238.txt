This Resource Letter provides a guide to the literature on van der Waals and
Casimir-Polder forces. Journal articles, books, and other documents are cited
on the following topics: van der Waals forces, retarded dispersion forces or
Casimir-Polder forces between atoms or molecules, Casimir-Polder forces between
a molecule and a dielectric or conducting body, the summation of Casimir-Polder
forces as leading to the Casimir and Lifshitz forces between conducting and
dielectric bodies, Casimir friction, applications to nanotechnology, the nature
of the quantum vacuum, and experimental tests of the theory of Casimir and
Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces.
