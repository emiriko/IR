A. de Sole, V. G. Kac, and M. Wakimoto (arXiv:1004.5387) have recently
introduced a new family of compatible Hamiltonian operators of the form
$H^{(N,0)}=D^2\circ((1/u)\circ D)^{2n}\circ D$, where $N=2n+3$, $n=0,1,2,...$,
$u$ is the dependent variable and $D$ is the total derivative with respect to
the independent variable. We present a differential substitution that reduces
any linear combination of these operators to an operator with constant
coefficients and linearizes any evolution equation which is bi-Hamiltonian with
respect to a pair of any nontrivial linear combinations of the operators
$H^{(N,0)}$. We also give the Darboux coordinates for $H^{(N,0)}$ for any odd
$N\geqslant 3$.
