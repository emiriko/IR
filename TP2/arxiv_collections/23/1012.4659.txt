Recent results on the system size dependence of net-baryon and hyperon
production as measured at the CERN SPS are discussed. The observed Npart
dependences of yields, but also of dynamical properties, such as average
transverse momenta, can be described in the context of the core corona
approach. Other observables, such as antiproton yields and net-protons at
forward rapidities, do not follow the predictions of this model. Possible
implications for a search for a critical point in the QCD phase diagram are
discussed. Event-by-event fluctuations of the relative core to corona source
contributions might influence fluctuation observables (e.g. multiplicity
fluctuations). The magnitude of this effect is investigated.
