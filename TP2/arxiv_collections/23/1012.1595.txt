We review recent developments in models of neutrino masses and mixing.
Emphases are given to models based on finite group family symmetries from which
the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing can arise. In particular, we describe one
recent model based on SUSY SU(5) combined with a family symmetry based on the
double tetrahedral group, T'. All 22 observable fermion masses and mixing
angles and CP violating measures are fitted with only 9 parameters. In this
model, a near tri-bimaximal MNS matrix and a realistic CKM matrix are
simultaneously generated; the MNS matrix gets slightly modified by virtue of
having the Georgi-Jarlskog relations. Due to the presence of complex
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in T', CP violation in this model is entirely
geometrical in origin. The prediction of the model for the leptonic Dirac CP
phase is 227 degrees, which turns out to be very close to the current best fit
value of 220 degrees from SuperK.
