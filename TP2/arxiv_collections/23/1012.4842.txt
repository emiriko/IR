A simple molecular thermodynamic approach is applied to the study of the
adsorption of gases of chain molecules on solid surfaces. We use a model based
on the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for Variable Range (SAFT-VR)
potentials [A. Gil-Villegas, A. Galindo, P. J. Whitehead, S. J. Mills, G.
Jackson, A. N. Burgess, J. Chem. Phys. 106 (1997) 4168] that we extend by
including a quasi-two-dimensional approximation to describe the adsorption
properties of this type of real gases [A. Martinez, M. Castro, C. McCabe, A.
Gil-Villegas, J. Chem. Phys. 126 (2007) 074707]. The model is applied to
ethane, ethylene, propane, and carbon dioxide adsorbed on activated carbon and
silica gel, which are porous media of significant industrial interest. We show
that the adsorption isotherms obtained by means of the present SAFT-VR modeling
are in fair agreement with the experimental results provided in the literature
