FIT stands for Foundations of Interface Technologies. Component-based design
is widely considered as a major approach to developing systems in a time and
cost effective way. Central in this approach is the notion of an interface.
Interfaces summarize the externally visible properties of a component and are
seen as a key to achieving component interoperability and to predict global
system behavior based on the component behavior. To capture the intricacy of
complex software products, rich interfaces have been proposed. These interfaces
do not only specify syntactic properties, such as the signatures of methods and
operations, but also take into account behavioral and extra-functional
properties, such as quality of service, security and dependability. Rich
interfaces have been proposed for describing, e.g., the legal sequences of
messages or method calls accepted by components, or the resource and timing
constraints in embedded software. The development of a rigorous framework for
the specification and analysis of rich interfaces is challenging. The aim of
this workshop is to bring together researchers who are interested in the formal
underpinnings of interface technologies
