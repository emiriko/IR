In 2007 an interesting phenomenon was discovered: a thread of water, the
so-called water bridge (WB), can hang between two glass beakers filled with
deionized water if voltage is applied to them. We analyze the available
explanations of the WB stability and propose a completely different one: the
force that supports the WB is the surface tension of water and the role of
electric field is not to allow the WB to reduce its surface energy by means of
breaking into separate drops.
