In this paper, we propose a decentralized coordina- tion algorithm for safe
and efficient management of a group of mobile robots following predefined paths
in a dynamic industrial environment. The proposed algorithm is based on a
shared resources protocol and a replanning strategy. It is proved to guarantee
ordered traffic flows avoiding collisions, deadlocks (stall situations) and
livelock (agents move without reaching final destinations). Mutual access to
resources has been proved for the proposed approach while condition on the
maximum number of AGVs is given to ensure the absence of deadlocks during
system evolutions. Finally conditions to verify a local livelocks will also be
proposed. In consistency with the model of distributed robotic systems (DRS),
no centralized mechanism, synchronized clock, shared memory or ground support
is needed. A local inter-robot communication, based on sign-boards, is
considered among a small number of spatially adjacent robotic units.
