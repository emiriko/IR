We demonstrate the electrical detection of pulsed X-band Electron Nuclear
Double Resonance (ENDOR) in phosphorus-doped silicon at 5\,K. A pulse sequence
analogous to Davies ENDOR in conventional electron spin resonance is used to
measure the nuclear spin transition frequencies of the $^{31}$P nuclear spins,
where the $^{31}$P electron spins are detected electrically via spin-dependent
transitions through Si/SiO$_2$ interface states, thus not relying on a
polarization of the electron spin system. In addition, the electrical detection
of coherent nuclear spin oscillations is shown, demonstrating the feasibility
to electrically read out the spin states of possible nuclear spin qubits.
