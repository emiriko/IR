We synthesized the new Fe-based superconductor K0.8Fe2Se2 single crystals.
The obtained single crystal exhibited a sharp superconducting transition, and
the onset and zero-resistivity temperature was estimated to be 33 and 31.8 K,
respectively. A high upper critical field of 192 T was obtained. Anisotropy of
superconductivity of K0.8Fe2Se2 was ~3.6. Both the high upper critical field
and comparably low anisotropy are advantageous for the application under high
magnetic field.
