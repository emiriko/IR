The bulk microwave conductivity of a dirty d-wave superconductor is known to
depend sensitively on the range of the disorder potential: long-range
scattering enhances the conductivity, while short- range scattering has no
effect. Here we show that the three-terminal electrical conductance of a
normal-metal-d-wave superconductor-normal-metal junction has a dual behavior:
short-range scattering suppresses the conductance, while long-range scattering
has no effect.
