We present a simple and efficient scheme to reduce atom-number fluctuations
in optical lattices. The interaction-energy difference for atoms in different
vibrational states is used to remove excess atomic occupation. The remaining
vacant sites are then filled with atoms by merging adjacent wells, for which we
implement a protocol that circumvents the constraints of unitarity. The
preparation of large regions with precisely one atom per lattice site is
discussed for both bosons and fermions. The resulting low-entropy
Mott-insulating states may serve as high-fidelity register states for quantum
computing and as a starting point for investigations of many-body physics.
