Molecular biology explains function of molecules by their geometrical and
electronical structures that are mainly determined by utilization of quantum
effects in chemistry. However, further quantum effects are not thought to play
any significant role in the essential processes of life. On the contrary,
consideration of quantum circuits/protocols and organic molecules as software
and hardware of living systems that are co-optimized during evolution, may be
useful to overcome the difficulties raised by biochemical complexity and to
understand the physics of life. In this sense, we review quantum
information-theoretic approaches to the process of DNA replication and propose
a new model in which 1) molecular recognition of a nucleobase is assumed to
trigger an intrabase entanglement corresponding to a superposition of different
tautomer forms and 2) pairing of complementary nucleobases is described by
swapping intrabase entanglements with interbase entanglements. We examine
possible biochemical realizations of quantum circuits/protocols to be used to
obtain intrabase and interbase entanglements. We deal with the problem of
cellular decoherence by using the theory of decoherence-free subspaces and
subsystems. Lastly, we discuss feasibility of the computational or experimental
verification of the model and future research directions.
