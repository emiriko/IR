We consider a model where sterile neutrinos can propagate in a large
compactified extra dimension (a) giving rise to Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes and the
Standard Model left-handed neutrinos are confined to a 4-dimensional spacetime
brane. The KK modes mix with the standard neutrinos modifying their oscillation
pattern. We examine current experiments in this framework obtaining stringent
limits on a.
