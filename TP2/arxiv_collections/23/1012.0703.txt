We show that the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) constrained by the
two-loop-order requirement of cancellation of quadratic divergences is
consistent with the existing experimental constraints. The model allows to
ameliorate the little hierarchy problem by suppressing the quadratic
corrections to scalar masses and lifting the mass of the lightest Higgs boson.
A strong source of CP violation emerges from the scalar potential. The cutoff
originating from the naturality arguments is shifted from 0.6 TeV in the
Standard Model to >6 TeV in the 2HDM, depending on the mass of the lightest
scalar.
