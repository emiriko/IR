In this paper we address two questions concerning the effective action of a
topological insulator in one and three dimensional space without boundaries,
such as a torus. The first is whether a uniform $\theta$-term with $\theta=\pi$
is generated for a strong topological insulator. The second is whether such a
term has observable consequences in the bulk. The answers to both questions are
positive, but the observability in three dimension vanishes for infinite system
size.
