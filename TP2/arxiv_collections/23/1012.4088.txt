The study of human dynamics has attracted much interest from many fields
recently. In this paper, the fractal characteristic of human behaviors is
investigated from the perspective of time series constructed with the amount of
library loans. The Hurst exponents and length of non-periodic cycles calculated
through Rescaled Range Analysis indicate that the time series of human
behaviors is fractal with long-range correlation. Then the time series are
converted to complex networks by visibility graph algorithm. The topological
properties of the networks, such as scale-free property, small-world effect and
hierarchical structure imply that close relationships exist between the amounts
of repetitious actions performed by people during certain periods of time,
especially for some important days. Finally, the networks obtained are verified
to be not fractal and self-similar using box-counting method. Our work implies
the intrinsic regularity shown in human collective repetitious behaviors.
