We examine heralded nondeterministic noiseless amplification based on the
quantum scissors device, which has been shown to increase the one-photon
amplitude of a state at the expense of the vacuum-state amplitude. Here we
propose using the same basic design to perform perfect amplification in a basis
set of up to two photons. The device is much more efficient than several
one-photon amplifiers working in tandem. When used to amplify coherent states
this advantage is shown using either fidelity or in terms of probability of
sucessful action, or more strikingly in a combination of the two.
