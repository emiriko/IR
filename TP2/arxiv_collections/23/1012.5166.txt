Some bacterial and viral DNA sequences have been found to induce low
frequency electromagnetic waves in high aqueous dilutions. This phenomenon
appears to be triggered by the ambient electromagnetic background of very low
frequency. We discuss this phenomenon in the framework of quantum field theory.
A scheme able to account for the observations is proposed. The reported
phenomenon could allow to develop highly sensitive detection systems for
chronic bacterial and viral infections.
