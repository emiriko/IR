We fabricated FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting wires using ex-situ Powder-in-tube
method with an Fe sheath. It was amazing that superconducting current was
observed in the as-drawn wire without any heat treatments. By heat treatment at
200C for 2 hours, Tczero and Jc at 4.2 K were enhanced up to 9.1 K and 64.1
A/cm2 (Ic = 182.6 mA), respectively. Furthermore, the Jc of FeTe0.5Se0.5 wire
heat treated at 200C for 2 hours was not much sensitive to the applied magnetic
fields. Therefore, FeTe0.5Se0.5 wires have a great potential for applications.
