In this article, we study the radiative decays among the charmonium states
with the heavy quark effective theory, and make predictions for the ratios
among the radiative decay widths of an special multiplet to another multiplet.
The predictions can be confronted with the experimental data in the future and
put additional constraints in identifying the $X$, $Y$, $Z$ charmonium-like
mesons.
