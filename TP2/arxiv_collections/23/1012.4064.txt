We present a catalog of compact sources derived from the QUaD Galactic Plane
Survey. The survey covers ~800 square degrees of the inner galaxy (|b|<4
degrees) in Stokes I, Q and U parameters at 100 and 150 GHz, with angular
resolution 5 and 3.5 arcminutes. 505 unique sources are identified in I, of
which 239 are spatially matched between frequency bands, with 50 (216) detected
at 100 (150) GHz alone; 182 sources are identified as ultracompact HII (UCHII)
regions. Approximating the distribution of total intensity source fluxes as a
power-law, we find a slope of $\gamma_{S,100}=-1.8\pm0.4$ at 100 GHz, and
$\gamma_{S,150}=-2.2\pm0.4$ at 150 GHz. Similarly, the power-law index of the
source two-point angular correlation function is
$\gamma_{\theta,100}=-1.21\pm0.04$ and $\gamma_{\theta,150}=-1.25\pm0.04$. The
total intensity spectral index distribution peaks at $\alpha_{I}\sim0.25$,
indicating that dust emission is not the only source of radiation produced by
these objects between 100 and 150 GHz; free-free radiation is likely
significant in the 100 GHz band. Four sources are detected in polarized
intensity P, of which three have matching counterparts in I. Three of the
polarized sources lie close to the galactic center, Sagittarius A*, Sagittarius
B2 and the Galactic Radio Arc, while the fourth is RCW 49, a bright HII region.
An extended polarized source, undetected by the source extraction algorithm on
account of its $\sim0.5^{\circ}$ size, is identified visually, and is an
isolated example of large-scale polarized emission oriented distinctly from the
bulk galactic dust polarization.
