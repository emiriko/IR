All types of 4-point spheric conformal blocks in both sectors of N=1
superconformal field theory are introduced and analyzed. The elliptic
recurrence formulae are derived for all the types of blocks not previously
discussed in the literature. The results are used for numerical verification of
the crossing symmetry of some 4-point functions in the N=1 superconformal
Liouville field theory.
