The two-dimensional frustrated next nearest neighbor Heisenberg model on the
square lattice is a prime example for a spin system where quantum fluctuations
can either destroy or stabilize magnetic order. The phase boundaries and
staggered moment dependence on the frustration ratio J_2/J_1 of the exchange
constants are fairly well understood both from approximate analytical and
numerical methods. In this work we use exact diagonalization for finite
clusters for an extensive investigation of the more general J_1a,b-J_2 model
which includes a spatial exchange anisotropy between next-neighbor spins. We
introduce a systematic way of tiling the square lattice and, for this low
symmetry model, define a controlled procedure for the finite size scaling that
is compatible with the possible magnetic phases. We obtain ground state
energies, structure factors and ordered moments and compare with the results of
spin wave calculations. We conclude that J_1a,b exchange anisotropy strongly
stabilizes the columnar antiferromagnetic phase for all frustration parameters,
in particular in the region of the spin nematic phase of the isotropic model.
