We introduce a Hubbard model as the simple quantum generalization of the
classical capacitance circuit model to study semiconductor quantum-dot spin
qubits. We prove theoretically that our model is equivalent to the usual
capacitance circuit model in the absence of quantum fluctuations. However, our
model naturally includes quantum effects such as hopping and spin exchange. The
parameters of the generalized Hubbard model can either be directly read off
from the experimental plot of the stability diagram or be calculated from the
microscopic theory, establishing a quantitative connection between the two. We
show that, while the main topology of the charge stability diagram is
determined by the ratio between inter-site and on-site Coulomb repulsion, fine
details of the stability diagram reveal information about quantum effects.
Extracting quantum information from experiments using our Hubbard model
approach is simple, but would require the measurement resolution to increase by
an order of magnitude.
