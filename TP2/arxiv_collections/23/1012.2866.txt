Top-partners -- vector-like quarks which mix predominantly with the top quark
-- are simple extensions of the standard model present in many theories of new
physics such as little Higgs models, topcolor models, and extra dimensions.
Through renormalizable mixing with the top quark, these top-partners inherit
couplings to the Higgs boson. Higgs bosons produced from the decay of
top-partners are often highly boosted and ideal candidates for analyses based
on jet substructure. Using substructure methods, we show that light Higgs
bosons decaying to b b-bar can be discovered at the 14 TeV LHC with less than
10 inverse fb for top-partner masses up to 1 TeV.
