We study supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua arising from beta deformed
quiver gauge theories. The relation between the bounds on metastability and the
deformation are discussed. Metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua are found in
the IR of beta deformed cascading quivers with vector-like field content.
Furthermore the limiting case of massive Nf=Nc SQCD appears in the IR of gauge
theories with chiral-like field content. We comment on the field theory origin
of the deformation and on possible applications in AdS/CFT.
