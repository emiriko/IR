We consider the Higgs boson production in the gluon-fusion channel to
next-to-next-to-leading order within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
In particular, we present analytical results for the matching coefficient of
the effective theory and study its influence on the total production cross
section in the limit where the masses of all MSSM particles coincide. For
supersymmetric masses below 500 GeV it is possible to find parameters leading
to a significant enhancement of the Standard Model cross section, the
$K$-factors, however, change only marginally.
