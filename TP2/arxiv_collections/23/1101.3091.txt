Enumerating all 3-manifold triangulations of a given size is a difficult but
increasingly important problem in computational topology. A key difficulty for
enumeration algorithms is that most combinatorial triangulations must be
discarded because they do not represent topological 3-manifolds. In this paper
we show how to preempt bad triangulations by detecting genus in
partially-constructed vertex links, allowing us to prune the enumeration tree
substantially.
  The key idea is to manipulate the boundary edges surrounding partial vertex
links using expected logarithmic time operations. Practical testing shows the
resulting enumeration algorithm to be significantly faster, with up to 249x
speed-ups even for small problems where comparisons are feasible. We also
discuss parallelisation, and describe new data sets that have been obtained
using high-performance computing facilities.
