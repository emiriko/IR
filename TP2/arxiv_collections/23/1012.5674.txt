Three-dimensional source images for mid-rapidity, low transverse momentum
kaon and pion pairs have been extracted from central Au+Au collisions data at
\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment at RHIC. The pion source
function displays significant non-Gaussian features implying a finite pion
emission duration. On the other hand, the kaon source function is essentially
Gaussian, consistent with instantaneous emission from the fireball.
