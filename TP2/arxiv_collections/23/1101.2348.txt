Stable reduction methods will be important in the evaluation of high-order
perturbative diagrams appearing in QCD and mixed QCD-electroweak radiative
corrections at the LHC. Differential reduction techniques are useful for
relating hypergeometric functions with shifted values of the parameters. We
present a proposition relating the number of master integrals in the expansion
of a Feynman diagram to the number of derivatives in a differential reduction.
