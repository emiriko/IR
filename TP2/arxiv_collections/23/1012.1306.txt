It has been known for over 50 years that the radio emission from shell
supernova remnants (SNRs) indicates the presence of electrons with energies in
the GeV range emitting synchrotron radiation. The discovery of nonthermal X-ray
emission from supernova remnants is now 30 years old, and its interpretation as
the extension of the radio synchrotron spectrum requires electrons with
energies of up to 100 TeV. SNRs are now detected at GeV and TeV photon energies
as well. Strong suggestions of the presence of energetic ions exist, but
conclusive evidence remains elusive. Several arguments suggest that magnetic
fields in SNRs are amplified by orders of magnitude from their values in the
ambient interstellar medium. Supernova remnants are thus an excellent
laboratory in which to study processes taking place in very high Mach-number
shocks. I review the observations of high-energy emission from SNRs, and the
theoretical framework in which those observations are interpreted.
