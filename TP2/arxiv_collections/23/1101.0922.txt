In this paper we propose a malaria within-host model with k classes of age
for the parasitized red blood cells and n strains for the parasite. We provide
a global analysis for this model. A competitive exclusion principle holds. If
R0, the basic reproduction number, satisfies R0 </- 1, then the disease-free
equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. On the contrary if R0 > 1, then
generically there is a unique endemic equilibrium which corresponds to the
endemic stabilization of the most virulent parasite strain and to the
extinction of all the other parasites strains. We prove that this equilibrium
is globally asymptotically stable on the positive orthant if a mild sufficient
condition is satisfied.
