We present a method for treatment of three charged particles. The proposed
method has universal character and is applicable both for bound and continuum
states. A finite rank approximation is used for Coulomb potential in three-body
system Hamiltonian, that results in a system of one-dimensional coupled
integral equations. Preliminary numerical results for three-body atomic and
molecular systems like $H^{-}$, He, $pp\mu$ and other are presented.
