Strain can be used as an alternate way to tune the electronic properties of
graphene. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to tune the uniform strain of
graphene simply by changing the chemical vapor deposition growth temperature of
graphene on copper. Due to the cooling of the graphene on copper system, we can
induce a uniform compressive strain on graphene. The strain is analyzed by
Raman spectroscopy, where a shift in the 2D peak is observed and compared to
our ab initio calculations of the graphene on copper system as a function of
strain.
