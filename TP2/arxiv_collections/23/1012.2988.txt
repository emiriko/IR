We address the problem of a magnetic impurity in a two dimensional $U(1)$
spin liquid where the spinons have gap-less excitations near the Fermi-surface
and are coupled to an emergent gap-less gauge field. Using a large N expansion
we analyze the strong coupling behavior and obtain the Kondo temperature which
was found to be the same as for a Fermi-liquid. In this approximation we also
study the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility of the impurity. These
quantities present no deviations from the Fermi-liquid ones, consistent with
the notion that the magnetic impurity is only sensitive to the local density of
fermionic states.
