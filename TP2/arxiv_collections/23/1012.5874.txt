We study the effect of isospin degree of freedom on the balance energy
(E$_{bal}$) as well as its mass dependence throughout the mass range for two
different sets of isobaric systems with N/Z = 1 and 1.4 at different colliding
geometries ranging from the central to peripheral ones. Our findings reveal the
dominance of Coulomb repulsion in isospin effects on E$_{bal}$ as well as its
mass dependence throughout the range of the colliding geometry. Our results
also indicate that the effect of symmetry energy on the energy of vanishing
flow is uniform throughout the mass range and throughout the colliding
geometry.
