The ALICE and CMS data on the multiplicity distributions are compared with
the lower energy data and with the results from the 8.142 version of the PYTHIA
MC event generator with two tunings. The ALICE data for moments are used to
calculate the factorial cumulants. It is suggested that the data on moments or
cumulants are well suited to specify the optimal tuning of the model
parameters.
