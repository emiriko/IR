The SuperB project for a next generation asymmetric e+e- flavor factory to be
built in the Rome area with a baseline luminosity of 10^{36}cm-2s-1 is
discussed. Some explicit examples are given to elucidate how such a facility
can provide a uniquely sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.
The basic accelerator concepts allowing luminosities 50-100 times larger than
the existing B factories are briefly discussed, along with the main
characteristics of the SuperB detector.
