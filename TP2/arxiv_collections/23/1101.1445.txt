The forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) in top-pair production that was observed
in 2008 gets a boost in a recent CDF publication. Not only has the FBA further
been confirmed, but also distributional preferences are shown. Strikingly, the
FBA is the most sizable in the large $M_{t\bar t}$ invariant mass region and in
the large rapidity difference $|\Delta y|$ region. Here we used our previously
proposed $t$-channel exchanged $W'$ boson to explain the new observations. We
show that a new particle exchanged in the $t$-channel generically gives rise to
such observations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed $W'$ can be directly
produced in association with a top quark at the Tevatron and the LHC. We
perform a signal-background analysis and show that such a $W'$ is readily
observed at the Tevatron with a 10 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity and at the LHC-7 with
just a 100 pb$^{-1}$ luminosity.
