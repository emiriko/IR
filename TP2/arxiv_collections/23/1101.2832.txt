We analyze the growth rates of atmospheric carbon dioxide and human
population, by comparing the relative merits of two benchmark models, the
exponential law and the finite-time-singular (FTS) power law. The later results
from positive feedbacks, either direct or mediated by other dynamical
variables, as shown in our presentation of a simple endogenous macroeconomic
dynamical growth model. Our empirical calibrations finds that the human
population has decelerated from its previous super-exponential growth until
1960 to a slower-than-exponential growth associated with a decreasing growth
rate. However, the past decade is found to be characterized by an almost stable
growth rate approximately equal to r(2010) ~ 1% per year, suggesting that the
population growth is stabilizing at "just" an exponential growth. As for
atmospheric CO2 content, we find that it is at least exponentially increasing
and most likely characterized by an accelerating growth rate as off 2009,
consistent with an unsustainable FTS power law regime announcing a drastic
change of regime. The coexistence of a quasi-exponential growth of human
population with a super-exponential growth of carbon dioxide content in the
atmosphere is a diagnostic that, until now, improvements in carbon efficiency
per unit of production worldwide has been dramatically insufficient.
