We report on the results of deep X-ray follow-up observations of four
unidentified Fermi/LAT gamma-ray sources at high Galactic latitudes using
Suzaku. The studied objects were detected with high significance during the
first 3 months of Fermi/LAT operation, and subsequently better localized in the
Fermi/LAT 1 year catalog (1FGL). Possible associations with pulsars and active
galaxies have subsequently been discussed, and our observations provide an
important contribution to this debate. In particular, an X-ray point source was
found within the 95% confidence error circle of 1FGL J1231.1-1410. X-ray
spectrum is well-fitted by a blackbody with an additional power-law. This
supports the recently claimed identification of this source with a millisecond
pulsar (MSP) PSR J1231-1411. Concerning 1FGL J1311.7-3429, two X-ray sources
were found within the LAT error circle. Even though the X-ray spectral and
variability properties were accessed, their nature and relationship with the
gamma-ray source remain uncertain. We found several weak X-ray sources in the
field of 1FGL J1333.2+5056, one coinciding with CLASS J1333+5057. We argue the
available data are consistent with the association between these two objects.
Finally, we have detected an X-ray source in the vicinity of 1FGL J2017.3+0603.
This object was recently suggested to be associated with a newly discovered MSP
PSR J2017+0603, because of the spatial-coincidence and the gamma-ray pulse
detection. We have only detected the X-ray counterpart of the CLASS J2017+0603,
while we determined an X-ray flux upper limit at the pulsar position. All in
all, our studies indicate while a significant fraction of unidentified high
Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources is related to the pulsar and blazar
phenomena, associations with other classes of astrophysical objects are still
valid options.
