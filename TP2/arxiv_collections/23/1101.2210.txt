Four-component massive and massless Dirac fermions in the presence of long
range Coulomb interaction and chemical potential disorder exhibit striking
fermionic quantum criticality. For an odd number of flavors of Dirac fermions,
the sign of the Dirac mass distinguishes the topological and the trivial band
insulator phases, and the gapless semi-metallic phase corresponds to the
quantum critical point that separates the two. Up to a critical strength of
disorder, the semi-metallic phase remains stable, and the universality class of
the direct phase transition between two insulating phases is unchanged. Beyond
the critical strength of disorder the semi-metallic phase undergoes a phase
transition into a disorder controlled diffusive metallic phase, and there is no
longer a direct phase transition between the two types of insulating phases.
Our results are also applicable to even number of flavors of Dirac fermions,
and the band inversion transition in various non-topological narrow gap
semiconductors.
