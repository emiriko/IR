Using density functional theory, we have investigated the structural,
electronic and magnetic properties of infinitely periodic organometallic
vanadium-anthracene ($[V_2Ant]_\infinity)$ and $[V_4(BNAnt)_2]_\infinity$(where
BNAnt is B-N analogue of anthracene) for their possible application in
spintronics. From our calculations, we find that one-dimensional
$[V_2Ant]_\infinity$ and $[V_4(BNAnt)_2]_\infinity$ wires exhibit robust
ferromagnetic half-metallic and metallic behavior, respectively. The finite
sized $V_6Ant_2$ and $V_6(BNAnt)_2$ clusters are also found to exhibit
efficient spin filter properties when coupled to graphene electrodes on either
side.
