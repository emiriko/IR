The biological world, especially its majority microbial component, is
strongly interacting and may be dominated by collective effects. In this
review, we provide a brief introduction for statistical physicists of the way
in which living cells communicate genetically through transferred genes, as
well as the ways in which they can reorganize their genomes in response to
environmental pressure. We discuss how genome evolution can be thought of as
related to the physical phenomenon of annealing, and describe the sense in
which genomes can be said to exhibit an analogue of information entropy. As a
direct application of these ideas, we analyze the variation with ocean depth of
transposons in marine microbial genomes, predicting trends that are consistent
with recent observations using metagenomic surveys.
