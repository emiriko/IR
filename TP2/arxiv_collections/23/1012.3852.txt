We study numerically the non-equilibrium critical properties of the Ising
model defined on direct products of graphs, obtained from factor graphs without
phase transition (Tc = 0). On this class of product graphs, the Ising model
features a finite temperature phase transition, and we find a pattern of
scaling behaviors analogous to the one known on regular lattices: Observables
take a scaling form in terms of a function L(t) of time, with the meaning of a
growing length inside which a coherent fractal structure, the critical state,
is progressively formed. Computing universal quantities, such as the critical
exponents and the limiting fluctuation-dissipation ratio X_\infty, allows us to
comment on the possibility to extend universality concepts to the critical
behavior on inhomogeneous substrates.
