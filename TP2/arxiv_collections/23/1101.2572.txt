This paper reviews recent advances in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW)
and their application to transport in various systems. The introduction gives a
brief survey of the historical background of CTQW. After a short outline of the
theoretical ideas behind CTQW and of its relation to classical continuous-time
random walks (CTRW) in Sec.~2, implications for the efficiency of the transport
are presented in Sec.~3. The fourth section gives an overview of different
types of networks on which CTQW have been studied so far. Extensions of CTQW to
systems with long-range interactions and with static disorder are discussed in
section V. Systems with traps, i.e., systems in which the walker's probability
to remain inside the system is not conserved, are presented in section IV.
Relations to similar approaches to the transport are studied in section VII.
The paper closes with an outlook on possible future directions.
