In this paper the essential theoretical predictions for the nuclear muonic
radioactivity are presented by using a special fission-like model similar with
that used in description of the pionic emission during fission. Hence, a
fission-like model for the muonic radioactivity takes into account the
essential degree of freedom of the system: muon-fissility, muon-fission barrier
height, etc. Using this model it was shown that most of the SHE-nuclei lie in
the region where the muonic fissility parameters attain their limiting value
X=1. Hence, the SHE-region is characterized by the absence of a classical
barrier toward spontaneous muon and pion emissions. Numerical estimations on
the yields for the natural muonic radioactivities of the transuranium elements
as well numerical values for barrier heights are given only for even-even
parent nuclei. Some experimental results from LCP-identification emission
spectrum are reviewed. Also, the experimental results obtained by Khryachkov et
al, using new spectrometer for investigation of ternary nuclear fission, are
presented. The OPERA-experiment proposed to perform search for muonic
radioactivity from lead nuclei, in the low background conditions offered by the
Gran Sasso underground Laboratory (LNGS), is discussed.
