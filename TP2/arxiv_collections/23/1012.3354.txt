We examine the synchrony of the dynamics of localized [Ca^{2+}]_i
oscillations in internal pool of astrocytes via diffusing coupling of a network
of such cells in a certain topology where cytosolic Ca^{2+} and inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) are coupling molecules; and possible long range
interaction among the cells. Our numerical results claim that the cells exhibit
fairly well coordinated behaviour through this coupling mechanism. It is also
seen in the results that as the number of coupling molecular species is
increased, the rate of synchrony is also increased correspondingly. Apart from
the topology of the cells taken, as the number of coupled cells around any one
of the cells in the system is increased, the cell process information faster.
