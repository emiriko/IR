In this talk we discuss the analogy between data from heavy-ion collisions
and the Cosmic Microwave Background. We identify p_T correlations data as the
heavy-ion analogy to the CMB and extract a power-spectrum from the heavy-ion
data. We define the ratio of the final state power-spectrum to the initial
coordinate-space eccentricity as the transfer-function. From the
transfer-function we find that higher $n$ terms are suppressed and we argue
that the suppression provides information on length scales like the
mean-free-path. We make a rough estimate of the mean-free-path and find that it
is larger than estimates based on the centrality dependence of v_2.
