In this paper, we propose a novel S/D engineering for dual-gated Bilayer
Graphene (BLG) Field Effect Transistor (FET) using doped semiconductors (with a
bandgap) as source and drain to obtain unipolar complementary transistors. To
simulate the device, a self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF)
solver has been developed and validated against published experimental data.
Using the simulator, we predict an on-off ratio in excess of $10^4$ and a
subthreshold slope of ~110mV/decade with excellent scalability and current
saturation, for a 20nm gate length unipolar BLG FET. However, the performance
of the proposed device is found to be strongly dependent on the S/D series
resistance effect. The obtained results show significant improvements over
existing reports, marking an important step towards bilayer graphene logic
devices.
