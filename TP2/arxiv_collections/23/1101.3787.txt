We provide a glimpse of recent progress in hadron physics made using QCD's
Dyson-Schwinger equations, reviewing: the notion of in-hadron condensates and a
putative solution of a gross problem with the cosmological constant; the
dynamical generation of quark anomalous chromo- and electro-magnetic moments,
and their material impact upon the proton's electric/magnetic form factor
ratio; a computation that simultaneously correlates the masses of meson and
baryon ground- and excited-states; and a prediction for the x->1 value of the
ratio of neutron/proton distribution functions.
