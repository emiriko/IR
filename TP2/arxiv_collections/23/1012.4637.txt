We report on the quantification of entanglement by means of entanglement
measures on a four- and a six- qubit cluster state realized by using photons
entangled both in polarization and linear momentum. This paper also addresss
the question of the scaling of entanglement bounds from incomplete tomographic
information on the density matrix under realistic experimental conditions.
