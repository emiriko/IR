We have performed a measurement of the absolute yield of fluorescence photons
at the Fermilab Test Beam. A systematic uncertainty at 5% level was achieved by
the use of Cherenkov radiation as a reference calibration light source. A
cross-check was performed by an independent calibration using a laser light
source. A significant improvement on the energy scale uncertainty of Ultra-High
Energy Cosmic Rays is expected.
