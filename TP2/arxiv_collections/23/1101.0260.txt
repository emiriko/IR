This is a personal summary of the meeting "Saturation, the Color Glass
Condensate and Glasma: What Have we Learned from RHIC?" that took place at BNL
in May 2010. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the status of high
density QCD and parton saturation, and to review the progress that RHIC has
allowed in the field.
