We present an information geometric analysis of entanglement generated by an
s-wave scattering between two Gaussian wave packets. We conjecture that the pre
and post-collisional quantum dynamical scenarios related to an elastic head-on
collision are macroscopic manifestations emerging from microscopic statistical
structures. We then describe them by uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian
statistical models, respectively. This allows us to express the entanglement
strength in terms of scattering potential and incident particle energies.
Furthermore, we show how the entanglement duration can be related to the
scattering potential and incident particle energies. Finally, we discuss the
connection between entanglement and complexity of motion.
