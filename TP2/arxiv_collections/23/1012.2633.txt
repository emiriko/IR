Data Management portfolio within an organization has seen an upsurge in
initiatives for compliance, security, repurposing and storage within and
outside the organization. When such initiatives are being put to practice care
must be taken while granting access to data repositories for analysis and
mining activities. Also, initiatives such as Master Data Management, cloud
computing and self service business intelligence have raised concerns in the
arena of regulatory compliance and data privacy, especially when a large data
set of an organization are being outsourced for testing, consolidation and data
management. Here, an approach is presented where a new service layer is
introduced, by data governance group, in the architecture for data management
and can be used for preserving privacy of sensitive information.
