We discuss the nature of the brightest mid-IR point source (which we dub
Object X) in the nearby galaxy M33. Although multi-wavelength data on this
object have existed in the literature for some time, it has not previously been
recognized as the most luminous mid-IR object in M33 because it is entirely
unremarkable in both optical and near-IR light. In the Local Group Galaxies
Survey, Object X is a faint red source visible in VRI and H-alpha but not U or
B. It was easily seen at JHK_s in the 2MASS survey. It is the brightest point
source in all four Spitzer IRAC bands and is also visible in the MIPS 24-micron
band. Its bolometric luminosity is 5x10^5 L_sun. The source is optically
variable on short time scales (tens of days) and is also slightly variable in
the mid-IR, indicating that it is a star. Archival photographic plates (from
1949 and 1991) show no optical source, so the star has been obscured for at
least half a century. Its properties are similar to those of the Galactic OH/IR
star IRC+10420 which has a complex dusty circumstellar structure resulting from
episodic low velocity mass ejections. We propose that Object X is a M>30 M_sun
evolved star obscured in its own dust ejected during episodic mass loss events
over at least half a century. It may emerge from its current ultra-short
evolutionary phase as a hotter post-RSG star analogous to M33 Var A. The
existence and rarity of such objects can be an important probe of a very brief
yet eventful stellar evolutionary phase.
