We analyzed the electron neutrino data of the Gallium radioactive source
experiments and the electron antineutrino data of the reactor Bugey and Chooz
experiments in terms of neutrino oscillations. We found a hint of a
CPT-violating asymmetry of the effective neutrino and antineutrino mixing
angles.
