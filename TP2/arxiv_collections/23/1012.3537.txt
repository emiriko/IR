The coherent time evolution of electrons in double quantum dots induced by
fast bias-voltage switches is studied theoretically. As it was shown
experimentally, such driven double quantum dots are potential devices for
controlled manipulation of charge qubits. By numerically solving a quantum
master equation we obtain the energy- and time-resolved electron transfer
through the device which resembles the measured data. The observed oscillations
are found to depend on the level offset of the two dots during the manipulation
and, most surprisingly, also the on initialization stage. By means of an
analytical expression, obtained from a large-bias model, we can understand the
prominent features of these oscillations seen in both the experimental data and
the numerical results. These findings strengthen the common interpretation in
terms of a coherent transfer of electrons between the dots.
