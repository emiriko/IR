The goal of the SIMBA collaboration is to provide a global fit to the
available data in inclusive B -> X_s gamma and B -> X_u l nu decays. By
performing a global fit one is able to simultaneously determine the relevant
normalizations, i.e. the total B -> X_s gamma rate and the CKM-matrix element
|Vub|, together with the required input parameters, most importantly the
b-quark mass and the b-quark distribution function in the B-meson, called the
shape function. This strategy is analogous to the determination of |Vcb| from
global fits to inclusive B -> X_c l nu decays. In this talk, we present
preliminary results for the shape function and |C_7^incl Vtb Vts^*|, which
parametrizes the total B -> X_s gamma rate, from a global fit to the available
B -> X_s gamma measurements from BABAR and Belle.
