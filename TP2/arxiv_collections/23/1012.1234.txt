We calculate the `one-point function', meaning the marginal probability
density function for any single eigenvalue, of real and complex Wishart
correlation matrices. No explicit expression had been obtained for the real
case so far. We succeed in doing so by using supersymmetry techniques to
express the one-point function of real Wishart correlation matrices as a
twofold integral. The result can be viewed as a resummation of a series of Jack
polynomials in a non-trivial case. We illustrate our formula by numerical
simulations. We also rederive a known expression for the one-point function of
complex Wishart correlation matrices.
