We study luminosities of millisecond pulsars in globular clusters by fitting
the observed luminosity distribution with single and double power laws. We use
simulations to model the observed distribution as the brighter part of some
parent distribution for Terzan 5 and try to find a model which simultaneously
agrees with the observed diffuse radio flux, total predicted number of pulsars
and observed luminosity distribution. We find that wide ranges of parameters
for log-normal and power-law distributions give such good models. No clear
difference between the luminosity distributions of millisecond pulsars in
globular clusters and normal disk pulsars was seen.
