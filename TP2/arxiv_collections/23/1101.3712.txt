The generic identification problem is to decide whether a stochastic process
$(X_t)$ is a hidden Markov process and if yes to infer its parameters for all
but a subset of parametrizations that form a lower-dimensional subvariety in
parameter space. Partial answers so far available depend on extra assumptions
on the processes, which are usually centered around stationarity. Here we
present a general solution for binary-valued hidden Markov processes. Our
approach is rooted in algebraic statistics hence it is geometric in nature. We
find that the algebraic varieties associated with the probability distributions
of binary-valued hidden Markov processes are zero sets of determinantal
equations which draws a connection to well-studied objects from algebra. As a
consequence, our solution allows for algorithmic implementation based on
elementary (linear) algebraic routines.
