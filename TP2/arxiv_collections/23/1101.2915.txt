We construct open sets of Ck (k bigger or equal to 2) vector fields with
singularities that have robust exponential decay of correlations with respect
to the unique physical measure. In particular we prove that the geometric
Lorenz attractor has exponential decay of correlations with respect to the
unique physical measure.
