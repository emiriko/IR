We propose a new and simple method of estimating the radiation due to an
accelerated quark in a strongly coupled medium, within the framework of the
AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular, we offer a heuristic explanation of the
collimated nature of synchrotron radiation produced by a circling quark, which
was recently studied in Phys.Rev.D81 (2010) 126001. The gravitational dual of
such quark is a coiling string in AdS, whose backreaction on the spacetime
geometry remains tightly confined, as if 'beamed' towards the boundary. While
this appears to contradict conventional expectations from the scale/radius
duality, we resolve the issue by observing that the backreaction of a
relativistic string is reproduced by a superposition of gravitational shock
waves. We further demonstrate that this proposal allows us to reduce the
problem of computing the boundary stress tensor to merely calculating geodesics
in AdS, as opposed to solving linearized Einstein's equations.
