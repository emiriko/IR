The measurement problem for the optical phase has been traditionally attacked
for noiseless schemes or in the presence of amplitude or detection noise. Here
we address estimation of phase in the presence of phase diffusion and evaluate
the ultimate quantum limits to precision for phase-shifted Gaussian states. We
look for the optimal detection scheme and derive approximate scaling laws for
the quantum Fisher information and the optimal squeezing fraction in terms of
the overall total energy and the amount of noise. We also found that homodyne
detection is a nearly optimal detection scheme in the limit of very small and
large noise.
