The aim of this paper is to compute of the generalized aspects, i.e. the
maximal singularity-free domains in the Cartesian product of the joint space
and workspace, for a planar parallel mechanism in using quadtree model and
interval analysis based method. The parallel mechanisms can admit several
solutions to the inverses and the direct kinematic models. These singular
configurations divide the joint space and the workspace in several not
connected domains. To compute this domains, the quadtree model can be made by
using a discretization of the space. Unfortunately, with this method, some
singular configurations cannot be detected as a single point in the joint
space. The interval analysis based method allow us to assure that no
singularities are not found and to reduce the computing times. This approach is
tested on a simple planar parallel mechanism with two degrees of freedom.
