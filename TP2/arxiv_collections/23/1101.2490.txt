We demonstrate optical control of the LO phonon-plasmon coupled (LOPC) modes
in GaAs by using a femtosecond pump-pulse pair. The relaxation time of the
plasmon-like LOPC mode significantly depends on the separation time (\Delta t)
of the pump-pulse pair. Especially it is maximized when \Delta t becomes
simultaneously comparable to the half period of the longitudinal optical (LO)
phonon oscillation and resonant to the 3/4 period of the plasmon-like LOPC
oscillation. We attribute these observations to the modification of carrier-LO
phonon scattering and ballistic motion of the plasmon-like LOPC mode.
