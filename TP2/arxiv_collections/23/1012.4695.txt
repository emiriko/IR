The main reasons for searching for pulsars are to: (i) get an accurate census
of the neutron star population and its origin and evolution; (ii) connect
neutron stars to other stellar populations in the Galaxy and globular clusters;
(iii) study Galactic astronomy (the interstellar medium and magnetic field);
(iv) find and study new interesting individual objects; (v) study pulsar
phenomenology; (vi) find pulsars to add to the sensitivity of pulsar timing
arrays. This review focuses on blind (i.e. large area) searches for radio
pulsars. I'll summarize the methods we use, some of the challenges they
present, look at some of the recent and current efforts going on. I will also
look at outreach of this area to groups outside the traditional area of pulsar
research, highlight the discoveries of radio transients and look ahead to the
future. Pulsars found at other wavelengths will be reviewed elsewhere in this
volume.
