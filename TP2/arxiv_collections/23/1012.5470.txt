In this paper, a Hirota method is developed for applying to the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary time-dependent linear potential which
denotes the dynamics of soliton solutions in quasi-one-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensation. The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is decoupled
to two equations carefully. With a reasonable assumption the one- and
two-soliton solutions are constructed analytically in the presence of an
arbitrary time-dependent linear potential.
