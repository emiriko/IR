The recent Belle and BaBar measurements of the branching ratio of $B^+ \to
\tau^+ \nu_\tau$ indicate a significant deviation from the Standard Model
prediction. We demonstrate that this measurement has a serious impact on models
with minimal flavor violation involving a charged Higgs boson, ruling out a
large portion of the currently-allowed parameter space. In the constrained
minimal supersymmetric standard model, this creates a tension between the
measurements of $B^+ \to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ and the anomalous magnetic moment of
the muon, unless $\tan\beta$ is small, $\mu > 0$, and $A_0$ takes a large
negative value. In fact, a very small region of the parameter space of this
model, with small values of $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$, survives all the constraints
at 95% C.L.. It is remarkable that this specific region is still consistent
with the lightest supersymmetric particle as the dark matter. Moreover, it
predicts observable SUSY signals in the early runs of the LHC, even perhaps at
7 TeV. We also show that a consistent explanation for the deviation of the $B^+
\to \tau^+ \nu_\tau$ branching ratio from the Standard Model can be achieved in
a non-universal Higgs mass model, which could also predict early signals of
supersymmetry at the LHC.
