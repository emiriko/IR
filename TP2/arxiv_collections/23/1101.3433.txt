We calculate the bending angles of light under the strong electric and
magnetic fields by a charged black hole and a magnetized neutron star according
to the nonlinear electrodynamics of Euler-Heisenberg interaction. The bending
angle of light by the electric field of charged black hole is computed from
geometric optics and a general formula is derived for light bending valid for
any orientation of the magnetic dipole. The astronomical significance of the
light bending by magnetic field of a neutron star is discussed.
