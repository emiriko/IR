At an altitude of 3250m and at a latitude of $75^\circ$S, the Italo-French
Concordia station was open to winter-over teams in 2005. It is one of the high
points of the Antarctic polar plateau. These extreme remote sites are expected
to provide exceptional conditions for astronomical observations, specially in
the infra-red ranges, given the very cold winter temperatures, averaging well
below -60C. Being very flat as highest points of that very broad polar plateau,
they are also not subject to the famous katabatic winds that can be devastating
on the Antarctic coast, and in fact their mean wind speed along the year are
the weakest known on Earth, less than 3 m/s. Besides the resulting absence of
danger that such winds would present for large size optical instruments, this
situation offers another benefit, which is an excellent free atmosphere seeing
above a very thin but turbulent surface layer. This paper emphasizes these
seeing peculiarities, but not only. It is presented as simply following a
significant fraction of my slide presentation during the meeting.
