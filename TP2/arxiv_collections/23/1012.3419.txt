We study QCD evolution equations of the first transverse-momentum-moment of
the naive-time-reversal-odd fragmentation functions - the Collins function and
the polarizing fragmentation function. We find for the Collins function case
that the evolution kernel has a diagonal piece same as that for the
transversity fragmentation function, while for the polarizing fragmentation
function case this piece is the same as that for the unpolarized fragmentation
function. Our results might have important implications in the current global
analysis of spin asymmetries.
