In this Letter we report how thermodynamic properties of a giant frustrated
magnetic Keplerate molecule of N=30 spins s=1/2 can be evaluated with the help
of the highly accurate finite-temperature Lanczos method. The comparison to
experimental data shows excellent agreement. Since this molecule is
structurally related to the archetypical kagome lattice antiferromagnet we
expect new detailed insight into properties of this important class of
frustrated materials.
