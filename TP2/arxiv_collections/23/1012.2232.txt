We discuss slepton mass matrices in the $S_4$ flavor model with SUSY SU(5)
GUT. By considering the gravity mediation within the framework of supergravity
theory, we estimate the SUSY breaking terms in the slepton mass matrices, which
contribute to the $\mu \rightarrow e + \gamma$ decay.
  We obtain a lower bound for the ratio of $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$ as
$10^{-13}$ if $m_{\text{SUSY}}$ and $m_{1/2}$ are below 500GeV. The off
diagonal terms of slepton mass matrices also contribute to EDM of leptons. The
predicted electron EDM is around $10^{-29}-10^{-28}$cm. Our predictions are
expected to be tested in the near future experiment.
