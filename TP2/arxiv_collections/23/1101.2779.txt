We compute Lyapunov vectors (LVs) corresponding to the largest Lyapunov
exponents in delay-differential equations with large time delay. We find that
characteristic LVs, and backward (Gram-Schmidt) LVs, exhibit long-range
correlations, identical to those already observed in dissipative extended
systems. In addition we give numerical and theoretical support to the
hypothesis that the main LV belongs, under a suitable transformation, to the
universality class of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. These facts indicate
that in the large delay limit (an important class of) delayed equations behave
exactly as dissipative systems with spatiotemporal chaos.
