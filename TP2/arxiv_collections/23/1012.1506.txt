Some concepts used in the theory of convection-driven dynamos in rotating
spherical fluid shells are discussed. The analogy between imposed magnetic
fields and those generated by dynamo action is evaluated and the role of the
Elsasser number is considered. Eddy diffusivities are essential ingredients in
numerical dynamo simulations, but their effects could be misleading. New
aspects of the simultaneous existence of different dynamo states are described.
