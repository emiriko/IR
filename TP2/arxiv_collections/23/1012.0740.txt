We measure the detuning-dependent dynamics of a quasi-resonantly excited
single quantum dot coupled to a micropillar cavity. The system is modeled with
the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model where all experimental parameters are
determined by explicit measurements. We observe non-Markovian dynamics when the
quantum dot is tuned into resonance with the cavity leading to a
non-exponential decay in time. Excellent agreement between experiment and
theory is observed with no free parameters providing the first quantitative
description of an all-solid-state cavity QED system based on quantum dot
emitters.
