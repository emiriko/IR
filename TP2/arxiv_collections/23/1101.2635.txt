The foundations of quantum mechanics have been plagued by controversy
throughout the 85 year history of the field. It is argued that lack of clarity
in the formulation of basic philosophical questions leads to unnecessary
obscurity and controversy and an attempt is made to identify the main forks in
the road that separate the most important interpretations of quantum theory.
The consistent histories formulation, also known as "consistent quantum
theory", is described as one particular way (favored by the author) to answer
the essential questions of interpretation. The theory is shown to be a
realistic formulation of quantum mechanics, in contrast to the orthodox or
Copenhagen formulation which will be referred to as an operationalist theory.
