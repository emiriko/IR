We consider the black hole dynamical evolution in the framework of a
Lorentz-violating spacetime endowed with a Schwarzchild-like momentum-dependent
metric. Large deviations from the Hawking-Bekenstein predictions are obtained,
depending on the values of the Lorentz-violating parameter lambda introduced. A
non-trivial evolution comes out, following mainly from the existence of a
non-vanishing minimum mass: for large Lorentz violations, most of the black
hole evaporation takes place in the initial stage, which is then followed by a
stationary stage (whose duration depends on the value of lambda) where the mass
does not change appreciably. Furthermore, for the final stage of evolution, our
model predicts a sweet slow death of the black hole, whose "slowness" again
depends on lambda, in contrast with the violent final explosion predicted by
the standard theory.
