We calculate the evaporative cooling dynamics of trapped one-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensates for parameters leading to a range of condensates and
quasicondensates in the final equilibrium state. We confirm that solitons are
created during the evaporation process, but always eventually dissipate during
thermalisation. The distance between solitons at the end of the evaporation
ramp matches the coherence length in the final thermal state. Calculations were
made using the classical fields method. They bridge the gap between the phase
defect picture of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the long-wavelength phase
fluctuations in the thermal state.
