We have experimentally studied sub-Doppler laser cooling in a magneto-optical
trap for thulium atoms working at the wavelength of 410.6\,nm. Without any
dedicated molasses period of sub-Doppler cooling, the cloud of $3\times 10^6$
atoms at the temperature of 25(5)\,$\mu$K was observed. The measured
temperature is significantly lower than the Doppler limit of 240$\mu$K for the
cooling transition at 410.6\,nm. High efficiency of the sub-Doppler cooling
process is due to a near-degeneracy of the Land\'e-$g$ factors of the lower
$4f^{13}6s^{2}\, (J\,=\,{7}/{2})$ and the upper $4f^{12}5d_{3/2}6s^{2}\,
(J\,=\,{9}/{2})$ cooling levels.}
