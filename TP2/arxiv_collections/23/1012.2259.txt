Pressure conditions in incompressible Navier-Stokes equations give rise to
conservation of total energy. The energy rate getting into a volume is the same
energy rate that gets out from it. Suitable choice of pressure counteracts
energy disipation of viscosity term in such a way that total energy is
preserved. As consequence, this prevents kinetic energy blow-up in a given
volume of the fluid.
