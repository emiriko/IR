A hybrid method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations is presented.
The method inherits the attractive stabilizing mechanism of upwinded
discontinuous Galerkin methods when momentum advection becomes significant,
equal-order interpolations can be used for the velocity and pressure fields,
and mass can be conserved locally. Using continuous Lagrange multiplier spaces
to enforce flux continuity across cell facets, the number of global degrees of
freedom is the same as for a continuous Galerkin method on the same mesh.
Different from our earlier investigations on the approach for the
Navier--Stokes equations, the pressure field in this work is discontinuous
across cell boundaries. It is shown that this leads to very good local mass
conservation and, for an appropriate choice of finite element spaces, momentum
conservation. Also, a new form of the momentum transport terms for the method
is constructed such that global energy stability is guaranteed, even in the
absence of a point-wise solenoidal velocity field. Mass conservation, momentum
conservation and global energy stability are proved for the time-continuous
case, and for a fully discrete scheme. The presented analysis results are
supported by a range of numerical simulations.
