In the information system research, a question of particular interest is to
interpret and to predict the probability of a firm to adopt a new technology
such that market promotions are targeted to only those firms that were more
likely to adopt the technology. Typically, there exists significant difference
between the observed number of ``adopters'' and ``nonadopters,'' which is
usually coded as binary response. A critical issue involved in modeling such
binary response data is the appropriate choice of link functions in a
regression model. In this paper we introduce a new flexible skewed link
function for modeling binary response data based on the generalized extreme
value (GEV) distribution. We show how the proposed GEV links provide more
flexible and improved skewed link regression models than the existing skewed
links, especially when dealing with imbalance between the observed number of
0's and 1's in a data. The flexibility of the proposed model is illustrated
through simulated data sets and a billing data set of the electronic payments
system adoption from a Fortune 100 company in 2005.
