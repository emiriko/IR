We investigate the clustering and phase separation of a model of ultrasoft,
oppositely charged macroions by a combination of Monte Carlo and Molecular
Dynamics simulations. Static and dynamic diagnostics, including the dielectric
permittivity and the electric conductivity of the model, show that ion pairing
induces a sharp conductor-insulator transition at low temperatures and
densities, which impacts the separation into dilute and concentrated phases
below a critical temperature. Preliminary evidence is presented for a possible
tricritical nature of the phase diagram of the model.
