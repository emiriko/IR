We calculate the utility of high-frequency squeezed-state enhanced
two-frequency interferometry for low-frequency phase measurement. To use the
high-frequency sidebands of the squeezed light, a two-frequency intense laser
is used in the interferometry instead of a single-frequency laser as usual. We
find that the readout signal can be contaminated by the high-frequency phase
vibration, but this is easy to check and avoid. A proof-of-principle experiment
is in the reach of modern quantum optics technology.
