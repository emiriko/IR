At the LHC, a generic supersymmetric cascade can be a source of top quark.
Specifically third generation squarks and gluino are the major sources of top
quark which could also be boosted. In this article, we have shown that jet
substructure algorithm can be very useful in identifying such boosted top
quarks in the cascade. We take inclusive three jets plus zero lepton plus
missing energy final state and try to reconstruct at least one hadronically
decaying top quark by using top tagging techniques which has good prospect at
the LHC.
