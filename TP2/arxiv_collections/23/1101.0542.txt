The electrostatic interaction between an excited atom and a diatomic ground
state molecule in an arbitrary rovibrational level at large mutual separations
is investigated with a general second-order perturbation theory, in the
perspective of modeling the photoassociation between cold atoms and molecules.
We find that the combination of quadrupole-quadrupole and van der Waals
interactions compete with the rotational energy of the dimer, limiting the
range of validity of the perturbative approach to distances larger than 100
a.u.. Numerical results are given for the long-range interaction between Cs and
Cs$_2$, showing that the photoassociation is probably efficient whatever the
Cs$_2$ rotational energy.
