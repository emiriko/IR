Mott transition and ferrimagnetism are studied in the Hubbard model on the
anisotropic kagom\'e lattice using the variational cluster approximation and
the phase diagram at zero temperature and half-filling is analyzed. The
ferrimagnetic phase rapidly grows as the geometric frustration is relaxed, and
the Mott insulator phase disappears in moderately frustrated region, showing
that the ferrimagnetic fluctuations stemming from the relaxation of the
geometric frustration is enhanced by the electron correlations. In metallic
phase, heavy fermion behavior is observed and mass enhancement factor is
computed. Enhancement of effective spatial anisotropy by the electron
correlations is also confirmed in moderately frustrated region, and its effect
on heavy fermion behavior is examined.
