We present the temperature and density dependence of symmetry energy for
nuclear matter at finite temperature based on the approach of the
thermodynamics with Skyrme energy density functional. We first classify the
Skyrme interactions into 7 groups according to the range of neutron and proton
effective mass in neutron matter limit(99.99 per cent neutron in the matter).
We find that there is obvious correlation between the temperature dependence of
the symmetry energy and the splitting of the neutron and proton effective mass.
For some Skyrme interactions with $m^{*}_{n}>m^{*}_{p}$ and strong splitting of
the neutron and proton effective mass in asymmetric nuclear matter, a
transition of the temperature dependence of symmetry energy from decreasing
with temperature at low densities to increasing with temperature at high
densities appears. For other Skyrme interactions, we do not observe such
phenomenon. Our study show that the symmetry energy in hot asymmetric matter
not only depends on symmetry potential part but also on the splitting of the
neutron and proton effective mass to a certain extent.
