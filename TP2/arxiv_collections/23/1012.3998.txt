We review the role of integrability in the planar spectral problem of
four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories besides N=4 SYM. The cases
considered include the Leigh-Strassler marginal deformations of N=4 SYM, quiver
theories which arise as orbifolds of AdS5xS5 on the dual gravity side, as well
as various theories involving open spin chains.
