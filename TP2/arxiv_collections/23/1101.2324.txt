The calculation of the self force in the modeling of the gravitational-wave
emission from extreme-mass-ratio binaries is a challenging task. Here we
address the question of the possible emergence of a persistent spurious
solution in time-domain schemes, referred to as a {\em Jost junk solution} in
the literature, that may contaminate self force calculations. Previous studies
suggested that Jost solutions are due to the use of zero initial data, which is
inconsistent with the singular sources associated with the small object,
described as a point mass. However, in this work we show that the specific
origin is an inconsistency in the translation of the singular sources into jump
conditions. More importantly, we identify the correct implementation of the
sources at late times as the sufficient condition guaranteeing the absence of
Jost junk solutions.
