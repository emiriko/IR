High resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried
out to study the electronic structure and superconducting gap of the
(Tl$_{0.58}$Rb$_{0.42}$)Fe$_{1.72}$Se$_2$ superconductor with a T$_c$=32 K. The
Fermi surface topology consists of two electron-like Fermi surface sheets
around $\Gamma$ point which is distinct from that in all other iron-based
compounds reported so far. The Fermi surface around the M point shows a nearly
isotropic superconducting gap of $\sim$12 meV. The large Fermi surface near the
$\Gamma$ point also shows a nearly isotropic superconducting gap of $\sim$15
meV while no superconducting gap opening is clearly observed for the inner tiny
Fermi surface. Our observed new Fermi surface topology and its associated
superconducting gap will provide key insights and constraints in understanding
superconductivity mechanism in the iron-based superconductors.
