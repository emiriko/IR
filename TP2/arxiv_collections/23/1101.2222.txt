The authors show that the magnetization of a magnetostrictive/piezoelectric
multiferroic single-domain shape-anisotropic nanomagnet can be switched with
very small voltages that generate strain in the magnetostrictive layer. This
can be the basis of ultralow power computing and signal processing. With
appropriate material choice, the energy dissipated per switching event can be
reduced to $\sim$45 $kT$ at room temperature for a switching delay of $\sim$100
ns and $\sim$70 $kT$ for a switching delay of $\sim$10 ns, if the energy
barrier separating the two stable magnetization directions is $\sim$32 $kT$.
Such devices can be powered by harvesting energy exclusively from the
environment without the need for a battery.
