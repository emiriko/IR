Young Sun-like stars at the beginning of the pre-main sequence (PMS)
evolution are surrounded by accretion discs and remnant protostellar envelopes.
Photometric and spectroscopic variations of these stars are driven by
interactions of the star with the disc. Time scales and wavelength dependence
of the variability carry information on the physical mechanisms behind these
interactions. We conducted multi-epoch, multi-wavelength study of PV Cep, a
strongly variable, accreting PMS star. By combining our own observations from
2004-2010 with archival and literature data, we show that PV Cep started a
spectacular fading in 2005, reaching an I_C-band amplitude of 4 mag. Analysis
of variation of the optical and infrared fluxes, colour indices, and emission
line fluxes suggests that the photometric decline in 2005-2009 resulted from an
interplay between variable accretion and circumstellar extinction: since the
central luminosity of the system is dominated by accretion, a modest drop in
the accretion rate could induce the drastic restructuring of the inner disc.
Dust condensation in the inner disc region might have resulted in the
enhancement of the circumstellar extinction.
