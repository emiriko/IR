La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3/BiFeO3 and La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3/PbZr20Ti80O3 epitaxial
heterostructures have been grown on SrTiO3 substrates. Spin wave resonances are
used to study interface properties of the ferromagnetic La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3. We
find that the addition of the BiFeO3 or PbZr20Ti80O3 causes out-of-plane
surface pinning of the La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3. We are able to place new limits on
the exchange constant D of La(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO3 grown on these substrates and
confirm the presence of uniaxial and biaxial anisotropies caused by the SrTiO3
substrate.
