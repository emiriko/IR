We present an overview of recent work on flavour physics in the presence of a
sequential fourth generation. We will discuss shortly the constraints on the
new parameters and in the reminder present predictions for observables like
Br(B_s -> mu+ mu-), Br(K -> pi nu nubar) and the indirect CP violation S(psi
phi) in the B_s system. We will further stress the importance of
epsilon'/epsilon as a possible constraint once reliable lattice results for B_6
and B_8 become available. Lepton flavour violation is also briefly discussed in
view of prospects for tau physics at an upgraded flavour factory as well as
upcoming experiments for mu -> e gamma and mu-e conversion in nuclei.
