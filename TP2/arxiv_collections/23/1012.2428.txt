We propose an ultradiscrete analogue of Pl\"ucker relation specialized for
soliton solutions. It is expressed by an ultradiscrete permanent which is
obtained by ultradiscretizing the permanent, that is, the signature-free
determinant. Using this relation, we also show soliton solutions to the
ultradiscrete KP equation and the ultradiscrete two-dimensional Toda lattice
equation respectively.
