New technological developments have made it possible to interact with
computer systems and applications anywhere and anytime. It is vital that these
applications are able to adapt to the user, as a person, and to its current
situation, whatever that is. Therefore, the premises for evolution towards a
learning society and a knowledge economy are present. Hence, there is a
stringent demand for new learner-centred frameworks that allow active
participation of learners in knowledge creation within communities,
organizations, territories and society, at large. This paper presents the
multi-agent architecture of our context-aware system and the learning scenarios
within ubiquitous learning environments that the system provides support for.
This architecture is the outcome of our endeavour to develop ePH, a system for
sharing public interest information and knowledge, which is accessible through
always-on, context-aware services.
