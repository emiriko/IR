The bipartite and tripartite entanglement of a 3-qubit fermionic system when
one or two subsystems accelerated are investigated. It is shown that all the
one-tangles decrease as the acceleration increases. However, unlike the scalar
case, here one-tangles ${\cal N}_{C_I(AB_I)}$ and ${\cal N}_{C_I(AB)}$ never
reduce to zero for any acceleration. It is found that the system has only
tripartite entanglement when either one or two subsystems accelerated, which
means that the acceleration doesn't generate bipartite entanglement and doesn't
effect the entanglement structure of the quantum states in this system. It is
of interest to note that the $\pi$-tangle of the two-observers-accelerated case
decreases much quicker than that of the one-observer-accelerated case and it
reduces to a non-zero minimum in the infinite acceleration limit. Thus we argue
that the qutrit systems are better than qubit systems to perform quantum
information processing tasks in noninertial systems.
