Kepler's orbits with corrections due to Special Relativity are explored using
the Lagrangian formalism. A very simple model includes only relativistic
kinetic energy by defining a Lagrangian that is consistent with both the
relativistic momentum of Special Relativity and Newtonian gravity. The
corresponding equations of motion are solved in a Keplerian limit, resulting in
an approximate relativistic orbit equation that has the same form as that
derived from General Relativity in the same limit and clearly describes three
characteristics of relativistic Keplerian orbits: precession of perihelion;
reduced radius of circular orbit; and increased eccentricity. The prediction
for the rate of precession of perihelion is in agreement with established
calculations using only Special Relativity. All three characteristics are
qualitatively correct, though suppressed when compared to more accurate
general-relativistic calculations. This model is improved upon by including
relativistic gravitational potential energy. The resulting approximate
relativistic orbit equation has the same form and symmetry as that derived
using the very simple model, and more accurately describes characteristics of
relativistic orbits. For example, the prediction for the rate of precession of
perihelion of Mercury is one-third that derived from General Relativity. These
Lagrangian formulations of the special-relativistic Kepler problem are
equivalent to the familiar vector calculus formulations. In this Keplerian
limit, these models are supposed to be physical based on the likeness of the
equations of motion to those derived using General Relativity. The derivation
of this orbit equation is approachable by undergraduate physics majors and
nonspecialists whom have not had a course dedicated to relativity.
