Tidal dissipation in late-type stars is presently poorly understood and the
study of planetary systems hosting hot Jupiters can provide new observational
constraints to test proposed theories. We focus on systems with F-type
main-sequence stars and find that the recently discovered system CoRoT-11 is
presently the best suited for such a kind of investigation. A classic constant
tidal lag model is applied to reproduce the evolution of the system from a
plausible nearly synchronous state on the ZAMS to the present state, thus
putting constraints on the average modified tidal quality factor <Q'_s> of its
F6V star. Initial conditions with the stellar rotation period longer than the
orbital period of the planet can be excluded on the basis of the presently
observed state in which the star spins faster than the planet orbit. It is
found that <Q'_s> is approximately between 4.0E+06 and 2.0E+07 if the system
started its evolution on the ZAMS close to synchronization with an uncertainty
related to the constant tidal lag hypothesis and the estimated stellar magnetic
braking within a factor of about 5-6. Moreover, we discuss how the present
value of Q'_s can be measured by a timing of the mid-epoch and duration of the
transits as well as of the planetary eclipses to be observed in the infrared
with an accuracy of about 0.5-1 s over a time baseline of about 25 yr. CoRoT-11
is an highly interesting system potentially allowing us a direct measure of the
tidal dissipation in an F-type star as well as the detection of the precession
of the orbital plane of the planet that provides us with an accurate upper
limit for the obliquity of the stellar equator. If the planetary orbit has a
significant eccentricity (e>0.05), it will be possible to detect also the
precession of the line of the apsides and derive information on the Love number
of the planet and its tidal quality factor.
