The fact that canonical quantum gravity does not possess a fundamental notion
of time implies that the theory is unitary in a trivial sense. At the
fundamental level, this trivial unitarity leaves no room for a black-hole
information loss. Yet, a phenomenological loss of information may appear when
some matter degrees of freedom are reinterpreted as a clock-time. This explains
how both fundamental unitarity and phenomenological information loss may
peacefully coexist, which offers a resolution of the black-hole information
paradox.
