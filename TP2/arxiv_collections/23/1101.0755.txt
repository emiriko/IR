We search for lepton-flavor-violating tau-> ell V^0 decays, where ell is an
electron or muon and V^0 is one of the vector mesons rho^0, phi, omega, K*0 and
K*0-bar. We use 854 fb^{-1} of data collected with the Belle detector at the
KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider. No evidence for a signal is found in
any decay mode, and we obtain 90% confidence level upper limits on the
individual branching fractions in the range (1.2-8.4)*10^{-8}.
