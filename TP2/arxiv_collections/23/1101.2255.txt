Plasmoid structures in fast reconnection in low-beta plasmas are investigated
by two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. A high-resolution
shock-capturing code enables us to explore a variety of shock structures:
vertical slow shocks behind the plasmoid, another slow shocks in the
outer-region, and the shock-reflection in the front side. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz-like turbulence is also found inside the plasmoid. It is
concluded that these shocks are rigorous features in reconnection in low-beta
plasmas, where the reconnection jet speed or the upstream Alfven speed exceeds
the sound speed.
