Despite intense research in the field of strongly correlated electron
behavior for the past few decades, there has been very little effort to
understand this phenomenon in nano particles of the Kondo lattices. In this
article, we review the results of our investigation on the fine particles (less
than 1 micron) of some of the alloys obtained by high-energy ball-milling to
bring out that this synthetic method paves a way to study strong electron
correlations in nanocrystals of such alloys. We primarily focus on the alloys
of the series, CeRu(2-x)Rh(x)Si2, lying at different positions in Doniach's
magnetic phase diagram. While CeRu2Si2, a bulk paramagnet, appears to become
magnetic (of a glassy type) below about 8 K in fine particle form, in CeRh2Si2,
an antiferromagnet (T_N= 36 K) in bulk form, magnetism is destroyed (at least
down to 0.5 K) in fine particles. In the alloy, CeRu(0.8)Rh(1.2)Si2, at the
quantum critical point, no long range magnetic ordering is found
