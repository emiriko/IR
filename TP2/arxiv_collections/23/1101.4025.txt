Planetary migration poses a serious challenge to theories of planet
formation. In gaseous and planetesimal disks, migration can remove planets as
quickly as they form. To explore migration in a planetesimal disk, we combine
analytic and numerical approaches. After deriving general analytic migration
rates for isolated planets, we use N-body simulations to confirm these results
for fast and slow migration modes. Migration rates scale as 1/m (for massive
planets) and 1/(1+(e_H/3)^3), where m is the mass of a planet and e_H is the
eccentricity of the background planetesimals in Hill units. When multiple
planets stir the disk, our simulations yield the new result that large-scale
migration ceases. Thus, growing planets do not migrate through planetesimal
disks. To extend these results to migration in gaseous disks, we compare
physical interactions and rates. Although migration through a gaseous disk is
an important issue for the formation of gas giants, we conclude that migration
has little impact on the formation of terrestrial planets.
