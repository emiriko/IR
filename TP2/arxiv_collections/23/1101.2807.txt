The hot gas that fills the space between galaxies in clusters is rich in
metals. In their large potential wells, galaxy clusters accumulate metals over
the whole cluster history and hence they retain important information on
cluster formation and evolution. We use a sample of 5 cool core clusters to
study the distribution of metals in the ICM. We investigate whether the X-ray
observations yield good estimates for the metal mass and whether the heavy
elements abundances are consistent with a certain relative fraction of SN Ia to
SNCC. We derive detailed metallicity maps of the clusters from XMM - Newton
observations and we use them as a measure for the metal mass in the ICM. We
determine radial profiles for several elements and using population synthesis
and chemical enrichment models, we study the agreement between the measured
abundances and the theoretical yields. We show that even in relaxed clusters
the distribution of metals show a lot of inhomogeneities. Using metal maps
usually gives a metal mass 10-30% higher than the metal mass computed using a
single extraction region, hence it is expected that most previous metal mass
determination have underestimated metal mass. The abundance ratio of
{\alpha}-elements to Fe, even in the central parts of clusters, are consistent
with an enrichment due to the combination of SN Ia and SNCC.
