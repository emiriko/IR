The Casimir interaction energy due to the vacuum fluctuations of a massive
vector field between two perfectly conducting concentric spherical bodies is
computed. The TE contribution to the Casimir interaction energy is a direct
generalization of the massless case but the TM contribution is much more
complicated. Each TM mode is a linear combination of a transverse mode which is
the generalization of a TM mode in the massless case and a longitudinal mode
that does not appear in the massless case. In contrast to the case of two
parallel perfectly conducting plates, the are no TM discrete modes that vanish
identically in the perfectly conducting spherical bodies. Numerical simulations
show that the Casimir interaction force between the two bodies is always
attractive.
