Here, we present an analysis and interpretation of the experiment performed
by Jacques et al. (2007 Science 315, 966), which represents a realization of
Wheeler's delayed-choice Gedankenexperiment. Our analysis is based on the
evolution of the photon state, since the photon enters into the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with a removable beam-splitter until it exits. Given the same
incident photon state onto the output beam-splitter, BS_output, the photon's
state at the exit will be very different depending on whether BS_output is on
or off. Hence, the statistics of photon counts collected by the two detectors,
positioned along orthogonal directions at the exit of the interferometer, is
also going to be very different in either case. Therefore, it is not that the
choice of inserting (on) or removing (off) a beam-splitter leads to a delayed
influence on the photon behavior before arriving at the beam-splitter, but that
such a choice influences the photon state at and after BS_output, i.e., after
it has exited from the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The random on/off choice at
BS_output has no delayed effect on the photon to behave as a wave or a
corpuscle at the entrance and inside the interferometer, but influences the
subsequent evolution of the photon state incident onto BS_output.
