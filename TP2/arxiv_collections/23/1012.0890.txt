We analyze the static potential of a quark-antiquark pair at $T\,\geq\,T_c$,
where $T_c$ is a temperature of a deconfinement phase transition in QCD. We
discuss the possibility that the non-perturbative part of this potential can be
studied through the modification of the correlation functions, which define the
quadratic field correlators of the nonperturbative vaccuum fields. We use the
non-perturbative quark-antiquark potential derived in this way and the screened
one-gluon-exchange potential with $T$-dependent Debye screening mass to
calculate $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon$ and $\Omega_{bbb}$ binding energies and melting
temperatures in the deconfined phase of the full 2-flavors QCD.
