The terahertz spectra of the dynamic conductivity and radiation absorption
coefficient in germanium-silicon heterostructures with arrays of Ge hut
clusters (quantum dots) have been measured for the first time in the frequency
range of 0.3-1.2 THz at room temperature. It has been found that the effective
dynamic conductivity and effective radiation absorption coefficient in the
heterostructure due to the presence of germanium quantum dots in it are much
larger than the respective quantities of both the bulk Ge single crystal and
Ge/Si(001) without arrays of quantum dots. The possible microscopic mechanisms
of the detected increase in the absorption in arrays of quantum dots have been
discussed.
