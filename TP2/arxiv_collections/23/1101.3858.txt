We investigate the spin relaxation induced by acoustic phonons in the
presence of spin-orbit interactions in single electron Si/SiGe lateral coupled
quantum dots. The relaxation rates are computed numerically in single and
double quantum dots, in in-plane and perpendicular magnetic fields. The
deformation potential of acoustic phonons is taken into account for both
transverse and longitudinal polarizations and their contributions to the total
relaxation rate are discussed with respect to the dilatation and shear
potential constants. We find that in single dots the spin relaxation rate
scales approximately with the seventh power of the magnetic field, in line with
a recent experiment. In double dots the relaxation rate is much more sensitive
to the dot spectrum structure, as it is often dominated by a spin hot spot. The
anisotropy of the spin-orbit interactions gives rise to easy passages, special
directions of the magnetic field for which the relaxation is strongly
suppressed. Quantitatively, the spin relaxation rates in Si are typically 2
orders of magnitude smaller than in GaAs due to the absence of the
piezoelectric phonon potential and generally weaker spin-orbit interactions.
