In the paper, the functional definition of a plasma for-injector of separable
material is presented, and the requirements to it are formulated. The version
of a device for the material separation into elements based on the beam-plasma
discharge is under consideration. The dimensions of a pilot separating device
are determined. The following quantities are estimated: the particle
concentration per unit length of the separating device, effective length of the
beam-plasma interaction (BPI) within the separating device, dynamics of a
plasma density increase for metallic uranium, and thermal characteristics of a
phase transformation unit. A conclusion was drawn on the expedience and
validity of the development and realization of a plasma for-injector for
separating devices and technologies basing on the beam-plasma mechanism of
formation and heating of a highly ionized plasma.
