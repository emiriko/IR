We propose a setup to measure the lifetime of the parity of a pair of
Majorana bound states. The proposed experiment has one edge Majorana state
tunnel coupled to a quantum dot, which in turn is coupled to a metallic
electrode. When the Majorana Fermions overlap, even a small relaxation rate
qualitatively changes the non-linear transport spectrum, and for strong overlap
the lifetime can be read off directly from the height of a current peak. This
is important for the usage of Majorana Fermions as a platform for topological
quantum computing, where the parity relaxation is a limiting factor.
