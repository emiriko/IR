The anyonic excitations of topological two-body color code model are used to
implement a set of gates. Because of two-body interactions, the model can be
simulated in optical lattices. The excitations have nontrivial mutual
statistics, and are coupled to nontrivial gauge fields. The underlying lattice
structure provides various opportunities for encoding the states of a logical
qubit in anyonic states. The interactions make the transition between different
anyonic states, so being logical operation in the computational bases of the
encoded qubit. Two-qubit gates can be performed in a topological way using the
braiding of anyons around each other.
