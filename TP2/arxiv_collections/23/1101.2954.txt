The basic known and hypothetic one- and two-element phases of the B-C-N-O
system (both superhard phases having diamond and boron structures and
precursors to synthesize them) are described. The attention has been given to
the structure, basic mechanical properties, and methods to identify and
characterize the materials. For some phases that have been recently described
in the literature the synthesis conditions at high pressures and temperatures
are indicated.
