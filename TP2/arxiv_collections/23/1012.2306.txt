A surface layer ("skin") that is functionally and structurally different from
the bulk was found in single crystals of BiFeO3. Impedance analysis indicates
that a previously reported anomaly at T* ~ 275 \pm 5 ^/circC corresponds to a
phase transition confined at the surface of BiFeO3. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction as a function of both incidence angle and
photon wavelength unambiguously confirm the existence of a skin with an
estimated skin depth of few nanometres, elongated out-of-plane lattice
parameter, and lower electron density. Temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction
has revealed that the skin's out of plane lattice parameter changes abruptly at
T*, while the bulk preserves an unfeatured linear thermal expansion. The
distinct properties of the skin are likely to dominate in large surface to
volume ratios scenarios such as fine grained ceramics and thin films, and
should be particularly relevant for electronic devices that rely on interfacial
couplings such as exchange bias.
