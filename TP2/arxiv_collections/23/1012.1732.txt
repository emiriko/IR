The mean squared value of the photonic disorder is found to be reduced by a
factor of 100 in a typical GaAs based microcavity, when exposed to a circularly
polarized continuous wave optical pump without any special spatial patterning.
Resonant excitation of the cavity mode excites a spatially non-uniform
distribution of spin-polarized electrons, which depends on the photonic
disorder profile. Electrons transfer spin to nuclei via the hyperfine contact
interaction, inducing a long-living Overhauser magnetic field able to modify
the potential of exciton-polaritons.
