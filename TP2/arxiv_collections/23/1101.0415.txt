Mechanosensitive channels are ion channels activated by membrane tension. We
investigate the influence of bacterial mechanosensitive channels spatial
distribution on activation (gating). Based on elastic short-range interactions
we map this physical process onto an Ising-like model, which enables us to
predict the clustering of channels and the effects of clustering on their
gating. We conclude that the aggregation of channels and the consequent
interactions among them leads to a global cooperative gating behaviour with
potentially dramatic consequences for the cell.
