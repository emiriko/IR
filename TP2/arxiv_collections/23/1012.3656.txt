We derive an adaptive hierarchical method of estimating high dimensional
probability density functions. We call this method of density estimation the
"adaptive cluster expansion" or ACE for short. We present an application of
this approach, based on a multilayer topographic mapping network, that
adaptively estimates the joint probability density function of the pixel values
of an image, and presents this result as a "probability image". We apply this
to the problem of identifying statistically anomalous regions in otherwise
statistically homogeneous images.
