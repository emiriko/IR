We analyze the timescales of conflict decision-making in a primate society.
We present evidence for multiple, periodic timescales associated with social
decision-making and behavioral patterns. We demonstrate the existence of
periodicities that are not directly coupled to environmental cycles or known
ultraridian mechanisms. Among specific biological and socially-defined
demographic classes, periodicities span timescales between hours and days, and
many are not driven by exogenous or internal regularities. Our results indicate
that they are instead driven by strategic responses to social interaction
patterns. Analyses also reveal that a class of individuals, playing a critical
functional role, policing, have a signature timescale on the order of one hour.
We propose a classification of behavioral timescales analogous to those of the
nervous system, with high-frequency, or $\alpha$-scale, behavior occurring on
hour-long scales, through to multi-hour, or $\beta$-scale, behavior, and,
finally $\gamma$ periodicities observed on a timescale of days.
