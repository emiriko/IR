A large fraction of brown dwarfs and low-mass H-burning stars may form by
gravitational fragmentation of protostellar discs. We explore the conditions
for disc fragmentation and we find that they are satisfied when a disc is large
enough (>100 AU) so that its outer regions can cool efficiently, and it has
enough mass to be gravitationally unstable, at such radii. We perform radiative
hydrodynamic simulations and show that even a disc with mass 0.25 Msun and size
100 AU fragments. The disc mass, radius, and the ratio of disc-to-star mass
(Mdisc/Mstar~0.36) are smaller than in previous studies. We find that
fragmenting discs decrease in mass and size within a few 10^4 yr of their
formation, since a fraction of their mass, especially outside 100 AU is
consumed by the new stars and brown dwarfs that form. Fragmenting discs end up
with masses ~0.001-0.1 Msun, and sizes ~20-100 AU. On the other hand, discs
that are marginally stable live much longer. We produce simulated images of
fragmenting discs and find that observing discs that are undergoing
fragmentation is possible using current (e.g. IRAM-PdBI) and future (e.g. ALMA)
interferometers, but highly improbable due to the short duration of this
process. Comparison with observations shows that many observed discs may be
remnants of discs that have fragmented at an earlier stage. However, there are
only a few candidates that are possibly massive and large enough to currently
be gravitationally unstable. The rarity of massive (>0.2 Msun), extended (>100
AU) discs indicates either that such discs are highly transient (i.e. form,
increase in mass becoming gravitationally unstable due to infall of material
from the surrounding envelope, and quickly fragment), or that their formation
is suppressed (e.g. by magnetic fields). We conclude that current observations
of early-stage discs cannot exclude the mechanism of disc fragmentation.
