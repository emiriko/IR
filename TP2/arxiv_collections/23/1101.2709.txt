We review the recent experimental results on D and Ds meson leptonic decays
from CLEO-c, Belle, and BABAR, which results in the decay constants f_D= (206.7
+- 8.9) MeV and f_Ds= (257.3 +- 5.3) MeV. The latter is an average obtained by
the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG). Comparisons with Lattice QCD (LQCD)
calculations are discussed.
