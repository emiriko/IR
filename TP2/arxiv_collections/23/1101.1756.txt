Magneto-Raman scattering experiments from the surface of graphite reveal
novel features associated to purely electronic excitations which are observed
in addition to phonon-mediated resonances. Graphene-like and graphite domains
are identified through experiments with $\sim 1\mu m$ spatial resolution
performed in magnetic fields up to 32T. Polarization resolved measurements
emphasize the characteristic selection rules for electronic transitions in
graphene. Graphene on graphite displays the unexpected hybridization between
optical phonon and symmetric across the Dirac point inter Landau level
transitions. The results open new experimental possibilities - to use light
scattering methods in studies of graphene under quantum Hall effect conditions.
