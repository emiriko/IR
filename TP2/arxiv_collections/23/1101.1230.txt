An effective quantum pseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian for Yb_2TM_2O_7 (TM = Ti and
Sn) is obtained in terms of the atomic Kramers ground doublet of the LS
coupling and the crystalline electric field, which is almost described with
J^z=\pm 1/2. It is calculated microscopically as the sum of Anderson's
superexchange interaction and the magnetic dipole interaction. It is found that
it shows a strong exchange anisotropy.
