The purpose of this paper is to develop further the main concepts of
Phenomena Dynamic Logic (P-DL) and Cognitive Dynamic Logic (C-DL), presented in
the previous paper. The specific character of these logics is in matching
vagueness or fuzziness of similarity measures to the uncertainty of models.
These logics are based on the following fundamental notions: generality
relation, uncertainty relation, simplicity relation, similarity maximization
problem with empirical content and enhancement (learning) operator. We develop
these notions in terms of logic and probability and developed a Probabilistic
Dynamic Logic of Phenomena and Cognition (P-DL-PC) that relates to the scope of
probabilistic models of brain. In our research the effectiveness of suggested
formalization is demonstrated by approximation of the expert model of breast
cancer diagnostic decisions. The P-DL-PC logic was previously successfully
applied to solving many practical tasks and also for modelling of some
cognitive processes.
