A new combined NLO QCD analysis of the polarized inclusive and semi-inclusive
DIS data is presented. In contrast to previous combined analyses, the 1/Q^2
terms (kinematic - target mass corrections, and dynamic - higher twist
corrections) in the expression for the nucleon spin structure function g1 are
taken into account. The new COMPASS data are included in the analysis. The
impact of the semi-inclusive (SIDIS) data on the polarized parton densities
(PDFs) and on the higher twist corrections is demonstrated. The controversial
behavior of the polarized strange quark density obtained from the fit to the
DIS data alone, and a combined analysis of DIS and SIDIS data is discussed.
