We consider the problem of fairly dividing a heterogeneous cake between a
number of players with different tastes. In this setting, it is known that
fairness requirements may result in a suboptimal division from the social
welfare standpoint. Here, we show that in some cases, discarding some of the
cake and fairly dividing only the remainder may be socially preferable to any
fair division of the entire cake. We study this phenomenon, providing
asymptotically-tight bounds on the social improvement achievable by such
discarding.
