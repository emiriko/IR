We investigated the coronal activity of planet-hosting stars by means of
statistical analysis for a complete sample of stars in the solar neighborhood.
We find no observational evidence that Star-Planet Interactions are at work in
this sample, at least not at the sensitivity levels of our observations. We
additionally test the upsilon Andromedae system, an F8V star with a Hot Jupiter
and two other known planets, for signatures of Star-Planet Interactions in the
chromosphere, but only detect variability with the stellar rotation period.
