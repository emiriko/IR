Results from new measurements of dynamical $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ ratio
fluctuations are presented. Dynamical fluctuations in global conserved
quantities such as baryon number, strangeness, or charge may be observed near a
QCD critical point. The STAR experiment has previously acquired data in Au+Au
collisions at the energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 130, 62.4, and 19.6 GeV and
Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62.4, and 22.4 GeV. The commencing
of a QCD critical point search at RHIC has extended the reach of possible
measurements of dynamical $K/\pi$ and $p/\pi$ ratio fluctuations from Au+Au
collisions to lower energies. New results are compared to previous measurements
and to theoretical predictions from the UrQMD model.
