We report the first temperature dependent phonon transport measurements in
suspended Cu-CVD single layer graphene (SLG) from 15K to 380K using
microfabricated suspended devices. The thermal conductance per unit cross
section $\sigma$/A increases with temperature and exhibits a peak near T~280K
($\pm$10K) due to the Umklapp process. At low temperatures (T<140K), the
temperature dependent thermal conductivity scales as ~T^{1.5}, suggesting that
the main contribution to thermal conductance arises from flexural acoustic (ZA)
phonons in suspended SLG. The $\sigma$/A reaches a high value of 1.7$\times10^5
T^{1.5}$ W/m^2K, which is approaching the expected ballistic phonon thermal
conductance for two-dimensional graphene sheets. Our results not only clarify
the ambiguity in the thermal conductance, but also demonstrate the potential of
Cu-CVD graphene for heat related applications.
