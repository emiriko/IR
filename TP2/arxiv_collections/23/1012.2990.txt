The temporal behaviour of segmentation clock oscillations show phase
synchrony via mean field like coupling of delta protein restricting to nearest
neighbours only, in a configuration of cells arranged in a regular three
dimensional array. We found the increase of amplitudes of oscillating dynamical
variables of the cells as the activation rate of delta-notch signaling is
increased, however, the frequencies of oscillations are decreased
correspondingly. Our results show the phase transition from desynchronized to
synchronized behaviour by identifying three regimes, namely, desynchronized,
transition and synchronized regimes supported by various qualitative and
quantitative measurements.
