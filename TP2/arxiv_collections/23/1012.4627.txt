Doubly charmed mesons are studied within a quark model framework. We solve
the four-quark Schor\"dinger equation by means of a variational approach by
using different interacting potentials. Our results point to the existence of a
stable isoscalar doubly charmed four-quark meson with quantum numbers
$J^P=1^+$.
