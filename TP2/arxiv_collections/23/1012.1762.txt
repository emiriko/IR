We report on resonant optical spectroscopy of self-assembled InGaAs quantum
dots in which the number of electrons can accurately be tuned to N=0,1,2 by an
external gate voltage. Polarization, wave vector and magnetic field dependent
measurements enable us to clearly distinguish between resonant Raman and
resonant photoluminescence processes. The Raman spectra for N=1 and 2 electrons
considerably differ from each other. In particular, for N=2, the quantum-dot
He, the spectra exhibit both singlet and triplet transitions reflecting the
elementary many-particle interaction. Also the resonant photoluminescence
spectra are significantly changing by varying the number of electrons in the
QDs. For N=1 we observe strong polaronic effects which are suppressed for N=2.
