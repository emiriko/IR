The halo model (HM) describes the inhomogeneous universe as a collection of
halos. The full nonlinear power spectrum of the universe is well approximated
by the HM, whose prediction can be easily computed without lengthy numerical
simulations. This makes the HM a useful tool in cosmology. Here we explore the
lensing properties of the HM by use of the stochastic gravitational lensing
(sGL) method. We obtain for the case of point sources exact and simple integral
expressions for the expected value and variance of the lensing convergence,
which encode detailed information about the internal halo properties. In
particular a wide array of observational biases can be easily incorporated and
the dependence of lensing on cosmology is properly taken into account. This
simple setup should be useful for a quick calculation of the power spectrum and
the related lensing observables, which can play an important role in the
extraction of cosmological parameters from, e.g., SNe observations. Finally, we
discuss the probability distribution function of the HM which encodes more
information than the first two moments and can more strongly constrain the
large-scale structures of the universe. To check the accuracy of our modelling
we compare our predictions to the results from the Millennium Simulation.
