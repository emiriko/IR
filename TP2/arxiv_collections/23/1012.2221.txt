Adiabatic quantum charge pumping in graphene nanoribbon double barrier
structures with armchair and zigzag edges in the resonant transmission regime
is analyzed. Using recursive Green's function method we numerically calculate
the pumped charge for pumping contours encircling a resonance. We find that for
armchair ribbons the whole resonance line contributes to the pumping of a
single electron (ignoring double spin degeneracy) per cycle through the device.
The case of zigzag ribbons is more interesting due to zero-conductance
resonances. These resonances separate the whole resonance line into several
parts, each of which corresponds to the pumping of a single electron through
the device. Moreover, in contrast to armchair ribbons, one electron can be
pumped from the left lead to the right one or backwards. The current direction
depends on the particular part of the resonance line encircled by the pumping
contour.
