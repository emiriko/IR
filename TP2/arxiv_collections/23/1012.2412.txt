Actinide elements, such as uranium and plutonium, and their compounds are
best known as nuclear materials. When engineering optimal fuel materials for
nuclear power, important thermophysical properties to be considered are melting
point and thermal conductivity. Understanding the physics underlying transport
phenomena due to electrons and lattice vibrations in actinide systems is a
crucial step toward the design of better fuels. Using first principle LDA+DMFT
method, we conduct a systematic study on the correlated electronic structures
and transport properties of select actinide carbides, nitrides, and oxides,
many of which are nuclear fuel materials. We find that different mechanisms,
electrons--electron and electron--phonon interactions, are responsible for the
transport in the uranium nitride and carbide, the best two fuel materials due
to their excellent thermophysical properties. Our findings allow us to make
predictions on how to improve their thermal conductivities.
