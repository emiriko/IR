Primordial scalar perturbations may be generated when complex conformal
scalar field rolls down its negative quartic potential. We begin with the
discussion of peculiar infrared properties of this scenario. We then consider
the statistical anisotropy inherent in the model. Finally, we discuss the
non-Gaussianity of scalar perturbations. Because of symmetries, the bispectrum
vanishes identically. We present a general expression for the trispectrum and
give its explicit form in the folded limit.
