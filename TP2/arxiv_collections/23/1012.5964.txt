The role of Finsler-like metrics in situations where Lorentz symmetry
breaking and also CPT violation are discussed. Various physical instances of
such metrics both in quantum gravity and analogue systems are discussed. Both
differences and similarities between the cases will be emphasised. In
particular the medium of D-particles that arise in string theory will be
examined. In this case the breaking of Lorentz invariance, at the level of
quantum fluctuations, together with concomitant CPT in certain situations will
be analysed. In particular it will be shown correlations for neutral meson
pairs will be modified and a new contribution to baryogenesis will appear.
