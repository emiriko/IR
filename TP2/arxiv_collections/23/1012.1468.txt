The electronic and structural properties of a material are strongly
determined by its symmetry. Changing the symmetry via a photoinduced phase
transition offers new ways to manipulate material properties on ultrafast
timescales. However, in order to identify when and how fast these phase
transitions occur, methods that can probe the symmetry change in the time
domain are required. We show that a time-dependent change in the coherent
phonon spectrum can probe a change in symmetry of the lattice potential, thus
providing an all-optical probe of structural transitions. We examine the
photoinduced structural phase transition in VO2 and show that, above the phase
transition threshold, photoexcitation completely changes the lattice potential
on an ultrafast timescale. The loss of the equilibrium-phase phonon modes
occurs promptly, indicating a non-thermal pathway for the photoinduced phase
transition, where a strong perturbation to the lattice potential changes its
symmetry before ionic rearrangement has occurred.
