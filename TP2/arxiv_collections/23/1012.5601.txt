By using overlap Majorana fermions, the ${\cal N}=1$ chiral multiple can be
formulated so that the supersymmetry is manifest and the vacuum energy is
cancelled in the free limit, thanks to the bilinear nature of the free action.
It is pointed out, however, that in this formulation the reflection positivity
is violated in the bosonic part of the action, although it is satisfied in the
fermionic part. It is found that the positivity of the spectral density of the
bosonic two-point correlation function is ensured only for the spacial momenta
$a | p_k | \lesssim 1.72$ $(k=1,2,3)$. It is then argued that in formulating
${\cal N}=1$ Wess-Zumino model with the overlap Majorana fermion, one may adopt
a simpler nearest-neighbor bosonic action, discarding the free limit manifest
supersymmetry. The model still preserves the would-be U(1)$_R$ symmetry and
satisfies the reflection positivity.
