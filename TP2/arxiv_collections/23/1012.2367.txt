This note presents constraints on Standard Model parameters using published
and preliminary precision electroweak results obtained at the electron-positron
colliders LEP and SLC. The results are compared with precise electroweak
measurements from other experiments, notably CDF and D\O\ at the Tevatron.
Constraints on the input parameters of the Standard Model are derived from the
combined set of results obtained in high-$Q^2$ interactions, and used to
predict results in low-$Q^2$ experiments, such as atomic parity violation,
M{\o}ller scattering, and neutrino-nucleon scattering. The main changes with
respect to the experimental results presented in 2009 are new combinations of
results on the width of the W boson and the mass of the top quark.
