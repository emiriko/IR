We propose a scheme to generate an arbitrary Abelian vector potential for
atoms trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice. By making the optical
lattice potential dependent on the atomic state, we transform the problem into
that of a two-dimensional imaging. It is shown that an arbitrarily fine pattern
of the gauge field in the lattice can be realized without need of
diffraction-limited imaging.
