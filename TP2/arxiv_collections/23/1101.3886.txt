Implications are considered of the hypothesis that the symplectic group
$Sp(n/2)$ is the spontaneously violated gauge group of n lepton flavors.
Invariant Majorana masses are impossible in $Sp(n/2)$. For the local gauge
symmetry $Sp(n/2)$ the dynamical spontaneous violation is only achievable for
the number of flavors $n=6$ with simultaneous parity ($R,L-$symmetry)
violation. The see-saw mechanism produces here three light and three heavy
Dirac neutrinos. Majorana states are unavailable here. Neglecting heavy
particles in the $R,L-$symmetric system of weak and electromagnetic
interactions ($R,L-$independent values of isospins Tw and hypercharges $Y$ for
leptons or quarks) leads to a theory with parity nonconservation and axial
anomalies. Only weak left $(L)$ and full $(R+L)$ electromagnetic currents do
not have anomalies and remain independent of the physics of heavy masses. These
currents are the ones of the Standard Model. The absence of anomalies merely in
the combination of currents forming the electromagnetic one presents essential
difference with the SM case, where the both, left $T_W$ and $Y$, currents are
deprived of anomalies independently.
