Using the resistive-shunted-junction model we show that a split-ring
Josephson oscillator or radio-frequency SQUID in the hysteretic regime is
similar to an atomic system. It has a number of stationary states that we
characterize. Applying a short magnetic pulse we switch the system from one
state to another. These states can be detected via the reflection of a small
amplitude signal forming the base of a new spectroscopy.
