We show how to extract existential witnesses from classical proofs using
Krivine's classical realizability---where classical proofs are interpreted as
lambda-terms with the call/cc control operator. We first recall the basic
framework of classical realizability (in classical second-order arithmetic) and
show how to extend it with primitive numerals for faster computations. Then we
show how to perform witness extraction in this framework, by discussing several
techniques depending on the shape of the existential formula. In particular, we
show that in the Sigma01-case, Krivine's witness extraction method reduces to
Friedman's through a well-suited negative translation to intuitionistic
second-order arithmetic. Finally we discuss the advantages of using call/cc
rather than a negative translation, especially from the point of view of an
implementation.
