We analyze the \textit{Chandra} High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer
(HETGS) observation of the Seyfert $2$ AGN IRAS\,18325-5926. We detect a
$v=-360^{+41}_{-66}$~km~s$^{-1}$ blueshifted ionized absorber in the X-ray
spectrum, with photoionization parameter $\log\xi=2.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ and
hydrogen column density $N_{\rm
H}=1.55^{+0.75}_{-0.38}\times10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$. The absorber may be a
photoionized wind originating in the obscuring torus/global covering around the
black hole or outer edge of the accretion disk. The estimated mass outflow rate
suggests that the supermassive black hole in IRAS\,18325-5926 may significantly
affect the large-scale environment of the host galaxy, unless the solid angle
subtended by the outflow or the gas filling factor is small. A second warm
absorber may be needed to explain the absorption features in the vicinity of
the iron K edge, although insufficient counts in the data beyond $7.0$~keV make
it difficult to assess the nature of the second absorber. Most plausible is a
high ionization ($\log\xi\sim 2.3$ to $2.6$), high column density ($N_{\rm
H}\sim10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$) absorber with $v\sim -3000$ to $0$~km~s$^{-1}$,
although these parameters are not well constrained. We also examine the broad
Fe K emission line in the spectrum, which is likely due to Fe XXV in a highly
ionized accretion disk inclined at $25^\circ$, consistent with the
\textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC observations of the emission line. Because we are able
to view both the obscuring gas and the accretion disk of IRAS\,18325-5926, the
surrounding gas of IRAS\,18325-5926 may be patchy or we are viewing the system
at an angle just grazing the obscuring torus.
