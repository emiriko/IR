In this talk we first discuss the motivation for using the AdS/CFT
correspondence as a tool for the understanding of real-time dynamics of
quark-gluon plasma. After describing the effective dual degrees of freedom for
a strongly coupled gauge theory system, we review the subsequent theoretical
`layers' in the physics of quark-gluon plasma: a uniform plasma at fixed
temperature, linearized fluctuations, nonlinear hydrodynamic behaviour and
finally some aspects of addressing non-equilibrium physics. The discussion is
brief and aimed at nonspecialists.
