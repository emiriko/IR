The respective contribution of disk and jet components to the total emission
in low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is an open question. This
paper suggests that $\gamma$-rays emitted from electrons accelerated in jets
could be a direct diagnostic tool for a jet component to the total emission. We
demonstrate $\gamma$-ray flux from jets based on a synchrotron self-compton
(SSC) model on the assumption that radio and X-rays are dominantly produced
from jets in the case of a high state of a nearby LLAGN, NGC 4278. We also
survey parameter space in the model. Observational properties of LLAGNs in
radio and X-ray bands allow to constrain physical parameters in an emission
region. The size of the emission region $R$ is limited to $10^{16}$ cm $\leq R
\leq 10^{17.5}$ cm if the observed tight correlation between radio and X-ray
emission originates from the same jet component. If the beaming factor of the
emission region is close to the observed parsec scale jet of NGC 4278 and $R
\sim 10^{16}$ cm, the $\gamma$-rays may be detected by Cherenkov Telescope
Array, and the jet domination can be tested in the near future.
