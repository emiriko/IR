In this paper we construct a theory of quantum mechanics based on Shannon
information theory. We define a few principles regarding information-based
frames of reference, including explicitly the concept of information
covariance, and show how an ensemble of all possible physical states can be
setup on the basis of the accessible information in the local frame of
reference. In the next step the Bayesian principle of maximum entropy is
utilized in order to constrain the dynamics. We then show, with the aid of
Lisi's universal action reservoir approach, that the dynamics is equivalent to
that of quantum mechanics. Thereby we show that quantum mechanics emerges when
classical physics is subject to incomplete information. We also show that the
proposed theory is relational and that it in fact is a path integral version of
Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics. Furthermore we give a discussion on the
relation between the proposed theory and quantum mechanics, in particular the
role of observation and correspondence to classical physics is addressed. In
addition to this we derive a general form of entropy associated with the
information covariance of the local reference frame. Finally we give a
discussion and some open problems.
