Sterilization is a very popular word used in biomedical testing (like removal
of all microorganisms on surface of an article or in fluid using appropriate
chemical products). Motivated by this biological analogy, we, for the first
time, introduce the concept of sterilization of an image, i.e., removing any
steganographic information embedded in the image. Experimental results show
that our technique succeeded in sterilizing around 76% to 91% of stego pixels
in an image on average, where data is embedded using LSB-based steganography.
