A one-dimensional diatomic meta-chain with equal-size holes and
different-length slits is designed. Broadband coherent magnetic plasmon waves
(MPW) are formed in such a system, excited by both the electric resonance in
the slits and the magnetic resonance in the holes in a wide range of incidence
angles (00-400) and broad frequency bands (200-230 THz). The dispersion
properties of the MPW measured in our experiments agree with the theoretical
calculation based on the Lagrange model. The coherent MPWs reported in this
paper may have applications in subwavelength integrated nanocircuits.
