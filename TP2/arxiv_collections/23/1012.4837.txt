We present a random matrix theory (RMT) for the staggered lattice QCD Dirac
operator. The staggered RMT is equivalent to the zero-momentum limit of the
staggered chiral Lagrangian and includes all taste breaking terms at their
leading order. This is an extension of previous work which only included some
of the taste breaking terms. We will also present some results for the taste
breaking contributions to the partition function and the Dirac eigenvalues.
