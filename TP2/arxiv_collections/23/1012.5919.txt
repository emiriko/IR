Despite the tremendous success of the Standard Model, the arguments for the
necessity of an extension are compelling. An attractive option is provided by
Two-Higgs-Doublet models, due to their simplicity and them being the low-energy
limit of some more complete theories. In the most general version of the model,
the fermionic couplings of the neutral scalars are non-diagonal in flavour and,
therefore, generate unwanted flavour-changing neutral-current phenomena.
Different ways to suppress FCNCs have been developed, giving rise to a variety
of specific implementations of the 2HDM. Three of these are discussed in this
talk, comparing their phenomenological influence in flavour observables: The
use of a discrete Z2-symmetry, an expansion around this limit in a minimal
flavour violation scenario assuming the decoupling limit, and the Aligned
Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. All of these result in the absence of tree-level
flavour-changing neutral currents. Their different phenomenological
consequences are demonstrated for a selection of observables, namely (semi-)
leptonic decays, B->X_s gamma and mixing in the B0_d,s-systems.
