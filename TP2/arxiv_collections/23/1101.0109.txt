Developments in QCD at finite density are reviewed. I begin by discussing
some new algorithms which have been applied to other theories with sign
problems. Then I discuss the method of analytic continuation in QCD using a
series expansion and review some of the results obtained using this method. By
now there are several different simulations using the method, and together they
give estimates of the systematic lattice effects, which turn out to be
controlled. Finally I discuss a direct comparison of some of these lattice
predictions with new experimental data which results in a very pleasant
agreement.
