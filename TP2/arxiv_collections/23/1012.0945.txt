We have observed 37 bright, polarized radio sources with the Allen Telescope
Array (ATA) to present a novel analysis of their Faraday rotation properties.
Each source was observed during the commissioning phase with 2 to 4 100-MHz
bands at frequencies ranging from 1 to 2 GHz. These observations demonstrate
how the continuous frequency coverage of the ATA's log-periodic receiver can be
applied to the study of Faraday rotation measures (RMs). We use RM synthesis to
show that wide-bandwidth data can find multiple RM components toward a single
source. Roughly a quarter of the sources studied have extra RM components with
high confidence (brighter than ~40 mJy), when observing with a RM resolution of
roughly 100 rad/m2. These extra components contribute 10%-70% of the total
polarized flux. This is the first time multiple RM components have been
identified in a large sample of point sources. For our observing configuration,
these extra RM components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad/m2 ;
more generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more precisely than the RM
beam size. Comparing our 1-2 GHz RM spectra to VLBA polarimetric maps shows
both techniques can identify complicated Faraday structures in the sources.
However, the RM values and fractional polarization are generally smaller at
lower frequencies than in the higher-frequency VLBA maps. With a few
exceptions, the RMs from this work are consistent with that of earlier,
narrow-bandwidth, all-sky surveys. This work also describes the polarimetry
calibration procedure and that on-axis ATA observations of linear polarization
can be calibrated to an accuracy of 0.2% of Stokes I. Future research
directions include studying the time-dependent RM structure in Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) and enabling accurate, wide-area RM surveys to test models of
Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.
