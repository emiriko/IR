We present a summary of the latest measurements of branching fractions and
direct CP violations in the charmless hadronic two-body B decays B -> K^+ pi^-,
K^+ pi^0, K^0 pi^+ and K^0 pi^0, performed by the Belle, BABAR, CDF and CLEO
experiments. The interpretations and the future prospects about discrepancies,
called "Kpi puzzle", between theoretical expectations and measurements are
discussed.
