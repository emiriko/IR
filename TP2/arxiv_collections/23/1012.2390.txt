Some important topics from history of neutrino physics over the last fifty
years are discussed. History of neutrinos is older, at 4th December 2010 it
will be eightieth anniversary of the "neutrino birth". In that day W. Pauli
wrote the famous letter to participants of the physics conference at Tubingen
with the suggestion that "there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral
particle". We will concentrate mostly on the 50 years of neutrino history just
to show the long tradition of the Zakopane Theoretical School.
