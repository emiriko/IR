The optoelectronic and excitonic properties in a series of linear acenes
(naphthalene up to heptacene) are investigated using range-separated methods
within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). In these rather simple
systems, it is well-known that TDDFT methods using conventional hybrid
functionals surprisingly fail in describing the low-lying La and Lb valence
states, resulting in large, growing errors for the La state and an incorrect
energetic ordering as a function of molecular size. In this work, we
demonstrate that the range-separated formalism largely eliminates both of these
errors and also provides a consistent description of excitonic properties in
these systems. We further demonstrate that re-optimizing the percentage of
Hartree-Fock exchange in conventional hybrids to match wavefunction-based
benchmark calculations still yields serious errors, and a full 100%
Hartree-Fock range separation is essential for simultaneously describing both
of the La and Lb transitions. Based on an analysis of electron-hole transition
density matrices, we finally show that conventional hybrid functionals
overdelocalize excitons and underestimate quasiparticle energy gaps in the
acene systems. The results of our present study emphasize the importance of
both a range-separated and asymptotically-correct contribution of exchange in
TDDFT for investigating optoelectronic and excitonic properties, even for these
simple valence excitations.
