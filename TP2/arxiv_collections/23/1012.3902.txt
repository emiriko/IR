It is shown that weak correlations between the pair-breaking impurities in
superconductors influence a temperature dependence of the order parameter
within the Ginzburg and Landau region if the correlation radius of impurities R
is greater than the coherence length of the superconductor $\xi_0$.Dependence
of the square of the average order parameter on a temperature difference
$T_c-T$ changes its slope in a region $\xi_0\sqrt{T_c/(T_c-T)\sim R $.
Influence of correlations on other thermodynamic properties of superconductors
is discussed too.
