We show that the Brill-Lindquist initial data provides a counterexample to a
Riemannian Penrose inequality with charge conjectured by G. Gibbons. The
observation illustrates a sub-additive characteristic of the area radii for the
individual connected components of an outermost horizon as a lower bound of the
ADM mass.
