We present Submillimeter Array observations of high frequency SiO masers
around the supergiant VX Sgr and the semi-regular variable star W Hya. The
J=5-4, v=1 28SiO and v=0 29SiO masers of VX Sgr are shown to be highly linearly
polarized with a polarization from ~5-60%. Assuming the continuum emission
peaks at the stellar position, the masers are found within ~60 mas of the star,
corresponding to ~100 AU at a distance of 1.57 kpc. The linear polarization
vectors are consistent with a large scale magnetic field, with position and
inclination angles similar to that of the dipole magnetic field inferred in the
H2O and OH maser regions at much larger distances from the star. We thus show
for the first time that the magnetic field structure in a circumstellar
envelope can remain stable from a few stellar radii out to ~1400 AU. This
provides further evidence supporting the existence of large scale and
dynamically important magnetic fields around evolved stars. Due to a lack of
parallactic angle coverage, the linear polarization of masers around W Hya
could not be determined. For both stars we observed the 28SiO and 29SiO
isotopologues and find that they have a markedly different distribution and
that they appear to avoid each other. Additionally, emission from the SO
5_5-4_4 line was imaged for both sources. Around W Hya we find a clear offset
between the red- and blue-shifted SO emission. This indicates that W Hya is
likely host to a slow bipolar outflow or a rotating disk-like structure.
