We study the stability of spatially periodic, nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson
equilibria as an eigenproblem in a Fourier-Hermite basis (in the space and
velocity variables, respectively) of finite dimension, $N$. When the advection
term in Vlasov equation is dominant, the convergence with $N$ of the
eigenvalues is rather slow, limiting the applicability of the method. We use
the method of spectral deformation introduced in [J. D. Crawford and P. D.
Hislop, Ann. Phys. 189, 265 (1989)] to selectively damp the continuum of
neutral modes associated with the advection term, thus accelerating
convergence. We validate and benchmark the performance of our method by
reproducing the kinetic dispersion relation results for linear (spatially
homogeneous) equilibria. Finally, we study the stability of a periodic
Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode with multiple phase space vortices, compare our
results with numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson system and show that
the initial unstable equilibrium may evolve to different asymptotic states
depending on the way it was perturbed.
