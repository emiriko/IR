We construct a complete, realistic, and natural UV completion of minimal
conformal technicolor that explains the origin of quark and lepton masses and
mixing angles. As in "bosonic technicolor", we embed conformal technicolor in a
supersymmetric theory, with supersymmetry broken at a high scale. The exchange
of heavy scalar doublets generates higher-dimension interactions between
technifermions and quarks and leptons that give rise to quark and lepton masses
at the TeV scale. Obtaining a sufficiently large top quark mass requires strong
dynamics at the supersymmetry breaking scale in both the top and technicolor
sectors. This is natural if the theory above the supersymmetry breaking also
has strong conformal dynamics. We present two models in which the strong top
dynamics is realized in different ways. In both models, constraints from
flavor-changing effects can be easily satisfied. The effective theory below the
supersymmetry breaking scale is minimal conformal technicolor with an
additional light technicolor gaugino. We argue that this light gaugino is a
general consequence of conformal technicolor embedded into a supersymmetric
theory. If the gaugino has mass below the TeV scale it will give rise to an
additional pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that is observable at the LHC.
