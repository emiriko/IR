Free will is fundamental to morality, intuition of self, and normal
functioning of the society. However, science does not provide a clear logical
foundation for this idea. This paper considers the fundamental scientific
argument against free will, called reductionism, and explains the reasons for
choosing dualism against monism. Then, the paper summarizes unexpected
conclusions from recent discoveries in cognitive science. Classical logic turns
out not to be the fundamental mechanism of mind. It is replaced by dynamic
logic. Mathematical and experimental evidence are considered conceptually.
Dynamic logic counters logical arguments for reductionism. Contemporary science
of mind is not reducible; free will can be scientifically accepted along with
scientific monism.
