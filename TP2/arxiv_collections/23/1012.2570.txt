Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and dead comets comprise the vast majority of the
population of Near Earth Objects (NEOs) detected to date. Less is known of
their physical properties than of the much larger population of main-belt
asteroids. Due to the faintness and short duration of visibility of NEOs, many
characterization studies use broadband filters in 3 to 8 colors for taxonomic
classification and to study surface chemical composition. A spectrograph with
low spectral resolution R~30 used in a campaign or a continuing program on a
small telescope (1-2m class) would vastly improve the quantity and quality of
data on NEOs. The proposed baseline instrument would work in the visible using
a CCD detector, with a possible upgrade to include a second, near-IR (NIR)
channel extending coverage to 2.5 \mum or beyond. The optical design needs to
optimize overall optical throughput to permit observation of the faintest
possible objects on small telescopes at acceptable signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratios. An imaging mode to obtain accurate same-night broadband photometry
would be highly desirable.
