The study of atmospheric extinction based on the MASS data has been carried
out using the classical photometric pairs method. The extinction in V band can
be estimated at 0.m 19. The water vapour content has been derived from GPS
measurements. The median value of PWV for clear nights is equal to 7.7 mm.
