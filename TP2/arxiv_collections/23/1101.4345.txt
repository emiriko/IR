A rigid body in an ideal fluid is an important example of Hamiltonian systems
on a dual to the semidirect product Lie algebra $e(3) = so(3)\ltimes\mathbb
R^3$. We present the bi-Hamiltonian structure and the corresponding variables
of separation on this phase space for the Steklov-Lyapunov system and it's
gyrostatic deformation.
