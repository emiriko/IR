In a recent paper (Ant\'on et al. 2010) we have derived sets of right and
left eigenvectors of the Jacobians of the relativistic MHD equations, which are
regular and span a complete basis in any physical state including degenerate
ones. We present a summary of the main steps followed in the above derivation
and the numerical experiments carried out with the linearized (Roe-type)
Riemann solver we have developed, and some note on the (non-)convex character
of the relativistic MHD equations.
