The cross sections of the 169Tm({\alpha}, {\gamma})173Lu and
169Tm({\alpha},n)172Lu reactions have been measured first time using a new
method, by detecting the characteristic X-ray radiation following the electron
capturedecay of 172,173Lu. Despite the relatively long half-life of the
reaction products (T1/2 = 500 and 6.7 days, respectively) it was possible to
measure the cross section of the 169Tm({\alpha},{\gamma})173Lu reaction close
to the Gamow window (T9 = 3.5 GK), between Ec.m. = 13.16 and 17.08 MeV. The
169Tm({\alpha},n)172Lu reaction cross section was measured from Ec.m. = 11.21
MeV up to Ec.m. = 17.08 MeV. The experimental results have been compared to
theoretical predictions
