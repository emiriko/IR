We construct flat metrics in a given conformal class with prescribed
singularities of real orders at marked points of a closed real surface. The
singularities can be small conical, cylindrical, and large conical with
possible translation component. Along these lines we give an elementary proof
of the uniformization theorem for the sphere.
