We study the reactions e+e- --> e+e- eta (eta') in the single-tag mode and
measure the gamma gamma* --> eta (eta') transition form factors in the momentum
transfer range from 4 to 40 GeV^2. The analysis is based on 469 fb-1 of
integrated luminosity collected at PEP-II with the BABAR detector at e+e-
center-of-mass energies near 10.6 GeV.
