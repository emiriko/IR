The Delta I = 3/2 K to Pi Pi decay amplitude is calculated on RBC/UKQCD 32^3
x 64, L_s=32 dynamical lattices with 2+1 flavors of domain wall fermions using
the DSDR and Iwasaki gauge action. The calculation is performed with a single
pion mass (m_pi=141.9(2.3) MeV, partially quenched) and kaon mass
(m_K=507.4(8.5) MeV) which are nearly physical, and with nearly energy
conserving kinematics. Antiperiodic boundary conditions in two spatial
directions are used to give the two pions non-zero ground state momentum.
Results for time separations of 20, 24, 28 and 32 between the kaon and two-pion
sources are computed and an error weighted average is performed to reduce the
error. We find prelimenary results for Re(A_2)=1.396(081)_stat(160)_sys x
10^(-8) GeV and Im(A_2) = -8.46(45)_stat(1.95)_sys x 10^(-13) GeV.
