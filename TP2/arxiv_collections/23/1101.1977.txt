After presenting a brief summary of functional approaches to QCD at vanishing
temperatures and densities the application of QCD Green's functions at
non-vanishing temperature and vanishing density is discussed. It is pointed out
in which way the infrared behavior of the gluon propagator reflects the
(de-)confinement transition. Numerical results for the quark propagator are
given thereby verifying the relation between (de-)confinement and dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking (restoration). Last but not least some results of
Dyson-Schwinger equations for the color-superconducting phase at large
densities are shown.
