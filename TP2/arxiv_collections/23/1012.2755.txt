We propose a novel framework for the spontaneous motion of a droplet coupled
with internal dynamic patterns generated in a reaction-diffusion system. The
spatio-temporal order of the chemical reaction gives rise to inhomogeneous
surface tension and results in self-propulsion driven by the surrounding flow
due to the Marangoni effect. Numerical calculations of internal patterns
together with theoretical results of the flow fields at low Reynolds number
well reproduces the experimental results obtained using a droplet of
Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction medium.
