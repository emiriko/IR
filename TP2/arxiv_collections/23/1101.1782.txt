In this paper we study the effects of inclusions and porosities on the
emission properties of silicate grains and compare the model curves with the
observed infrared emission from circumstellar dust.
  We calculate the absorption efficiency of the composite grain, made up of a
host silicate oblate spheroid and inclusions of ice/graphite/or voids, in the
spectral region 5.0-25.0$\mu m$. The absorption efficiencies of the composite
spheroidal oblate grains for three axial ratios are computed using the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We study the absorption as a function of the volume
fraction of the inclusions and porosity. In particular, we study the variation
in the $10\mu m$ and $18\mu m$ emission features with the volume fraction of
the inclusions and porosities. We then calculate the infrared fluxes for these
composite grains at several dust temperatures (T=200-350K) and compare the
model curves with the average observed IRAS-LRS curve, obtained for
circumstellar dust shells around oxygen rich M-type stars. The model curves are
also compared with two other individual stars.
  The results on the composite grains clearly indicate that the silicate
feature at 10$\mu m$ shifts with the volume fraction of graphite inclusions.
The feature does not shift with the porosity. Both the features do not show any
broadening with the inclusions or porosity. The absorption efficiencies of the
composite grains calculated using DDA and Effective Medium Approximation (EMA)
do not agree. The composite grain models presented in this study need to be
compared with the observed IR emission from the circumstellar dust around a few
more stars.
