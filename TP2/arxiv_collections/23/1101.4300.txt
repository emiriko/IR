We propose a scalable neutral atom quantum computer with an on-demand
interaction through a selective two-qubit gate operation. Atoms are trapped by
a lattice of near field Fresnel diffraction lights so that each trap captures a
single atom. One-qubit gate operation is implemented by a gate control laser
beam which is applied to an individual atom. Two-qubit gate operation between
an arbitrary pair of atoms is implemented by sending these atoms to a
state-dependent optical lattice and making them collide so that a particular
two-qubit state acquires a dynamical phase. We give numerical evaluations
corresponding to these processes, from which we estimate the upper bound of a
two-qubit gate operation time and corresponding gate fidelity. Our proposal is
feasible within currently available technology developed in cold atom gas,
MEMS, nanolithography, and various areas in optics.
