In this paper we calculate the energy distribution of the Mu-in Park,
Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS) and L\"u, Mei and Pope (LMP) black holes in the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory of gravity. These black hole solutions correspond to
the standard Einstein-Hilbert action in the infrared limit. For our
calculations we use the Einstein and M{\o}ller prescriptions. Various limiting
and particular cases are also discussed.
