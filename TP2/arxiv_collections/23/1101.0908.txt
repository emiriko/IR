In this essay, I review the importance of languages in the study of reality,
following the well-known aphorisms by Galilei, Bohr and many others. The
emphasis on these aspects helps us to understand that it is not meaningful to
ask if the reality if "digital" or "analog", but we have to search what is the
best language to study some specific aspects of the reality. This problem is
particularly felt in the case of frontier science, like quantum gravity, where,
in front of several theories (syntaxes) available, there are presently neither
observations nor experiments leading to the building of a convincing semantics.
You will not find here recipes for a definitive theory. Just thoughts and
questions.
