As instance of an overarching principle of exclusion an algorithm is
presented that compactly (thus not one by one) generates all models of a Horn
formula. The principle of exclusion can be adapted to generate only the models
of weight $k$. We compare and contrast it with constraint programming, $0,1$
integer programming, and binary decision diagrams.
