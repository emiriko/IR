In this work we consider the entropy-corrected version of interacting
holographic dark energy (HDE), in the non-flat universe enclosed by apparent
horizon. Two corrections of entropy so-called logarithmic 'LEC' and power-law
'PLEC' in HDE model with apparent horizon as an IR-cutoff are studied. The
ratio of dark matter to dark energy densities $u$, equation of state parameter
$w_D$ and deceleration parameter $q$ are obtained. We show that the cosmic
coincidence is satisfied for both interacting models. By studying the effect of
interaction in EoS parameter, we see that the phantom divide may be crossed and
also find that the interacting models can drive an acceleration expansion at
the present and future, while in non-interacting case, this expansion can
happen only at the early time. The graphs of deceleration parameter for
interacting models, show that the present acceleration expansion is preceded by
a sufficiently long period deceleration at past. Moreover, the thermodynamical
interpretation of interaction between LECHDE and dark matter is described. We
obtain a relation between the interaction term of dark components and thermal
fluctuation in a non-flat universe, bounded by the apparent horizon. In
limiting case, for ordinary HDE, the relation of interaction term versus
thermal fluctuation is also calculated.
