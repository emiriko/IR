The helium trimer is studied using two- and three-body soft-core potentials.
Realistic helium-helium potentials present an extremely strong short-range
repulsion and support a single, very shallow, bound state. The description of
systems with more than two helium atoms is difficult due to the very large
cancellation between kinetic and potential energy. We analyze the possibility
of describing the three helium system in the ultracold regime using a gaussian
representation of a widely used realistic potential, the LM2M2 interaction.
However, in order to describe correctly the trimer ground state a three-body
force has to be added to the gaussian interaction. With this potential model
the two bound states of the trimer and the low energy scattering helium-dimer
phase shifts obtained with the LM2M2 potential are well reproduced.
