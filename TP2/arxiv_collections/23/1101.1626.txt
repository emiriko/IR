Starting from the form factor expansion in finite volume, we derive the
multidimensional generalization of the so-called Natte series for the
zero-temperature, time and distance dependent reduced density matrix in the
non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger model. This representation allows one to
\textit{read-off} straightforwardly the long-time/large-distance asymptotic
behavior of this correlator. This method of analysis reduces the complexity of
the computation of the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions in the
so-called interacting integrable models, to the one appearing in free fermion
equivalent models. We compute explicitly the first few terms appearing in the
asymptotic expansion. Part of these terms stems from excitations lying away
from the Fermi boundary, and hence go beyond what can be obtained by using the
CFT/Luttinger liquid based predictions.
