We study gluon condensate in a pion superfluid, through calculating the
equation of state of the system in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. While in mean
field approximation the growing pion condensate leads to an increasing gluon
condensate, meson fluctuations reduce the gluon condensate and the broken
scalar symmetry can be smoothly restored at finite isospin density.
