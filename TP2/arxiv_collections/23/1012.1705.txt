The book examines some of the questions of modern cosmology, the physics of
atmospheric phenomena, the physics of quasi-particles and atomic nuclei in the
Universe. It consists of three parts, each discusses the theoretical problems
of various subjects of cosmic physics.
  The first part examines the physics of the expanding Universe, with emphasis
on the content of the latest revolution in cosmology. It is today well
established that the universe is dominated by a vacuum that exceeds the density
of baryonic forms of cosmic matter, that the dynamics of the cosmic expansion
controls the vacuum antigravity and, finally, that the cosmological expansion
is accelerating.
  In the second part we investigate the processes leading to the electrization
of gas fluxes in the solar atmosphere and the generation of neutrons in the
active regions of its atmosphere, issues of electrization of thunderstorm
clouds in the troposphere of the Earth, the formation and development of
noctilucent clouds in the area of the mesosphere.
  In the third part the methods of calculating the wave functions of cluster
systems in continuous and discrete spectrum for a given intercluster
interaction are proposed. It presents the theoretical study of astrophysical
S-factors in the photonuclear reactions, which are part of the helium
thermonuclear processes cycle which determine the bulk of the energy yield in
stellar systems.
  Although the book is written in Russian, it might have some interest.
