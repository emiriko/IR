We show that the quantum statistical mechanics describing quantum and thermal
properties of objects has only the sense of a particular semiclassical
approximation. We propose a more general (than that theory) microdescription of
objects in a heat bath taking a vacuum into account as an object environment;
we call it $(\hbar,k)-$dynamics ($\hbar kD)$. We introduce a new generative
operator, a Schr\"odingerian or a stochastic action operator, and will show its
fundamental role in the determination of such macroquantities as internal
energy, effective temperature, and effective entropy. We establish that $\hbar
kD$ can serve as an initial microtheory for constructing a modified
thermodynamics. On this ground, we can explain the universality of the ratio
"effective action to effective entropy" at zero temperature and its minimal
value in the form $\hbar/2k$. This result corresponds to experimental data
obtained recently under studying a new matter state - a nearly perfect fluid.
