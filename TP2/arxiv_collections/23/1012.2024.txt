Ferroelectromagnets - compounds with ferroelectric and magnetic orderings -
were discovered about fifty years ago. They are of great interest due to the
possibility of mutual control of electric (magnetic) properties by magnetic
(electric) field. At present such possibility of magnetoelectric control has
become reality which stimulated revival of scientific and practical interest in
ferroelectromagnets. The progress in experimental and theoretical
investigations of magnetoelectric phenomena in ferroelectromagnets for the last
years, especially the colossal magnetoelectric effects observed recently, are
considered. The problems and future prospects of enhancing magnetoelectric
effects in ferroelectromagnets are being discussed. The book is intended for
researchers in ferroelectricity and magnetism and for students of physical
specialities.
