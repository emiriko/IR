We study the Schwinger model at finite temperature and show that a
temperature dependent chiral anomaly may arise from the long distance behavior
of the electric field. At high temperature this anomaly depends linearly on the
temperature $T$ and is present not only in the two point function, but also in
all even point amplitudes.
