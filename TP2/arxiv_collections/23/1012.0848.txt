The Taurus-Auriga association is perhaps the most famous prototype of a
low-mass star forming region, surveyed at almost all wavelengths.
Unfortunately, like several other young clusters/associations, this T
association lacks an extensive abundance analysis determination. We present a
high-resolution spectroscopic study of seven low-mass members of Taurus-Auriga,
including both weak-lined and classical T Tauri stars designed to help robustly
determine their metallicity. After correcting for spectral veiling, we
performed equivalent width and spectral synthesis analyses using the GAIA set
of model atmospheres and the 2002 version of the code MOOG. We find a solar
metallicity, obtaining a mean value of [Fe/H]=$-0.01\pm$0.05. The
$\alpha$-element Si and the Fe-peak one Ni confirm a solar composition. Our
work shows that the dispersion among members is well within the observational
errors at variance with previous claims. As in other star forming regions, no
metal-rich members are found, reinforcing the idea that old planet-host stars
form in the inner part of the Galactic disc and subsequently migrate.
