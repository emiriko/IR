The nonlocal alpha-effect of Babcock-Leighton type is not prone to the
catastrophic quenching due to conservation of magnetic helicity. This is shown
with a dynamo model, which jointly applies the nonlocal alpha-effect, the
diamagnetic pumping, and dynamical equation for the magnetic alpha-effect. The
same model shows catastrophic quenching when the alpha-effect is changed to its
local formulation. The nonlocal model shows the preferred excitation of
magnetic fields of dipolar symmetry, which oscillate with a period of about ten
years and have a toroidal-to-polar fields ratio of about a thousand.
