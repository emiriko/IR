We examine the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a symmetric
double-well potential for a broad range of non-linear couplings. We demonstrate
the existence of a region, beyond those of Josephson oscillations and
self-trapping, which involves the dynamical excitation of the third mode of the
double-well potential. We develop a simple semiclassical model for the coupling
between the second and third modes that describes very satisfactorily the full
time-dependent dynamics. Experimental conditions are proposed to probe this
phenomenon.
