The motion of electrons and positrons in the vacuum magnetosphere of a
neutron star with a surface magnetic field of B~10^12 G is considered.
Particles created in the magnetosphere or falling into it from outside are
virtually instantaneously accelerated to Lorentz factors gamma~10^8. After
crossing the force-free surface, where the projection of the electric field
onto the magnetic field vanishes, a particle begins to undergo
ultra-relativistic oscillations. The particle experiences a regular drift along
the force-free surface simultaneous with this oscillatory motion.
