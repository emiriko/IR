We study in detail the flux properties of a radiofrequency outcoupled
horizontally guided atom laser, following the scheme demonstrated in [Guerin W
et al. 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 200402]. Both the outcoupling spectrum (flux of
the atom laser versus rf frequency of the outcoupler) and the flux limitations
imposed to operate in the quasicontinuous regime are investigated. These
aspects are studied using a quasi-1D model, whose predictions are shown to be
in fair agreement with the experimental observations. This work allows us to
identify the operating range of the guided atom laser and to confirm its good
promises in view of studying quantum transport phenomena.
