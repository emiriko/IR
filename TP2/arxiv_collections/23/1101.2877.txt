We study the Brownian momentum process, a model of heat conduction, weakly
coupled to heat baths. In two different settings of weak coupling to the heat
baths, we study the non-equilibrium steady state and its proximity to the local
equilibrium measure in terms of the strength of coupling. For three and four
site systems, we obtain the two-point correlation function and show it is
generically not multilinear.
