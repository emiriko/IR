We discuss the pion form factor calculation in QCD.We shortly consider the
main points of the nonlocal condensate QCD sum rule approach and show its
results for the pion form factor, $F_\pi(Q^2)$. These results are compared with
predictions of the perturbative and lattice QCD. Then we consider the Local
Duality (LD) approach for the pion FF in QCD and show that for $Q^2\gtrsim 2$
GeV$^2$ the main parameter of the approach, namely, $s_0^{\text{LD}}(Q^2)$
should grow with $Q^2$ rather than be a constant.
