Numerical evaluation of the self-force on a point particle is made difficult
by the use of delta functions as sources. Recent methods for self-force
calculations avoid delta functions altogether, using instead a finite and
extended "effective source" for a point particle. We provide a review of the
general principles underlying this strategy, using the specific example of a
scalar point charge moving in a black hole spacetime. We also report on two new
developments: (i) the construction and evaluation of an effective source for a
scalar charge moving along a generic orbit of an arbitrary spacetime, and (ii)
the successful implementation of hyperboloidal slicing that significantly
improves on previous treatments of boundary conditions used for
effective-source-based self-force calculations. Finally, we identify some of
the key issues related to the effective source approach that will need to be
addressed by future work.
