Magnetoconductance of a gated two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the
inversion layer on p-type HgCdTe crystal is investigated. At strong magnetic
fields, characteristic features such as quantum Hall effect of a 2DEG with
single subband occupation are observed. At weak magnetic fields, weak
antilocalization effect in ballistic regime is observed. Phase coherence time
and zero-field spin-splitting are extracted according to Golub's model. The
temperature dependence of dephasing rate is consistent with Nyquist mechanism
including both singlet and triplet channel interactions.
