We show that a detector acquires a Berry phase due to its motion in
spacetime. The phase is different in the inertial and accelerated case as a
direct consequence of the Unruh effect. We exploit this fact to design a novel
method to measure the Unruh effect. Surprisingly, the effect is detectable for
accelerations 10^9 times smaller than previous proposals sustained only for
times of nanoseconds.
