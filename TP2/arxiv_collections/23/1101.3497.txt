A fully geometrical treatment of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(GRMHD) is developed under the hypotheses of perfect conductivity, stationarity
and axisymmetry. The spacetime is not assumed to be circular, which allows for
greater generality than the Kerr-type spacetimes usually considered in GRMHD.
Expressing the electromagnetic field tensor solely in terms of three scalar
fields related to the spacetime symmetries, we generalize previously obtained
results in various directions. In particular, we present the first relativistic
version of the Soloviev transfield equation, subcases of which lead to fully
covariant versions of the Grad-Shafranov equation and of the Stokes equation in
the hydrodynamical limit. We have also derived, as another subcase of the
relativistic Soloviev equation, the equation governing magnetohydrodynamical
equilibria with purely toroidal magnetic fields in stationary and axisymmetric
spacetimes.
