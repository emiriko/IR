We analytically work out the perturbation induced by the Kehagias-Sfetsos
(KS) space-time solution of the Horava-Lifshitz (HL) modified gravity at long
distances on the two-body range for a pair of test particles A and B orbiting
the same mass M. We apply our results to the most recently obtained
range-residuals \delta\rho for some planets of the solar system (Mercury, Mars,
Saturn) ranged from the Earth to effectively constrain the dimensionsless KS
parameter \psi_0 for the Sun. We obtain \psi_0 >= 7.2 x 10^-10 (Mercury),
\psi_0 >= 9 x 10^-12 (Mars), \psi_0 >= 1.7 x 10^-12 (Saturn). Such lower bounds
are tighter than other ones existing in literature by several orders of
magnitude. We also preliminarily obtain \psi_0 >= 8 x 10^-10 for the system
constituted by the S2 star orbiting the Supermassive Black Hole (SBH) in the
center of the Galaxy.
