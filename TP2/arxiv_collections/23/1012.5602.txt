The Sculptor and Carina Dwarf spheroidal galaxies were observed with the
H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescope array between January 2008 and December 2009. The
data sets consist of a total of 11.8 and 14.8 hours of high quality data,
respectively. No gamma-ray signal was detected at the nominal positions of
these galaxies above 220 GeV and 320 GeV, respectively. Upper limits on the
gamma-ray fluxes at 95% C.L. assuming two forms for the spectral energy
distribution (a power law shape and one derived from dark matter annihilation)
are obtained at the level of 10^-13 to 10^-12 cm^-2s^-1 in the TeV range.
Constraints on the velocity weighted dark matter particle annihilation cross
section for both Sculptor and Carina dwarf galaxies range from <\sigma v> ~
10^-21 cm^3s^-1 down to <\sigma v> ~ 10^-22 cm^3s^-1 depending on the dark
matter halo model used. Possible enhancements of the gamma-ray flux are
studied: the Sommerfeld effect, which is found to exclude some dark matter
particle masses, the internal Bremsstrahlung and clumps in the dark-matter halo
distributions.
