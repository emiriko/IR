After the discovery of a substellar companion to the hot subdwarf HD 149382,
we have started a radial velocity search for similar objects around other
bright sdB stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Our aim is to test the
hypothesis that close substellar companions can significantly affect the
post-main sequence evolution of solar-type stars. It has previously been
proposed that binary interactions in this scenario could lead to the formation
of hot subdwarfs. The detection of such objects will provide strong evidence
that Jupiter-mass planets can survive the interaction with a solar-type star as
it evolves up the Red Giant Branch. We present the first results of our search
here.
