Likelihood ratio tests are performed for the hypothesis that charged-particle
multiplicities measured in proton-(anti)proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9
and 2.36 TeV are distributed according to the negative binomial form. Results
indicate that the hypothesis should be rejected in the all cases of ALICE-LHC
measurements in the limited pseudo-rapidity windows, whereas should be accepted
in the corresponding cases of UA5 data. Possible explanations of that and of
the disagreement with the least-squares fitting method are given.
