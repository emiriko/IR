Effects of viscosity and thermal conductivity on the dynamics of first-order
phase transitions are studied. The nuclear gas-liquid and hadron-quark
transitions in heavy-ion collisions are considered. We demonstrate that at
non-zero thermal conductivity, $\kappa \neq 0$, onset of spinodal instabilities
occurs on an isothermal spinodal line, whereas for $\kappa =0$ instabilities
take place at lower temperatures, on an adiabatic spinodal.
