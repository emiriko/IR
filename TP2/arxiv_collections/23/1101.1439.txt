Two theoretical descriptions of exclusive diffractive jets and Higgs
production at the LHC were implemented into the FPMC generator: the Khoze,
Martin, Ryskin model and the Cudell, Hern\'andez, Ivanov, Dechambre exclusive
model. We then study the uncertainties. We compare their predictions to the CDF
measurement and discuss the possibility of constraining the exclusive Higgs
production at the LHC with early measurements of exclusive jets. We show that
the present theoretical uncertainties can be reduced with such data by a factor
of 5.
