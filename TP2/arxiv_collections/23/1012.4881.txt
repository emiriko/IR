We consider two types of geometric graphs on point sets on the plane based on
a plane set C: one obtained by translates of C, another by positively scaled
translates (homothets) of C. For compact and convex C, graphs defined by scaled
translates of C, i.e., Delaunay graphs based on C, are known to be plane
graphs. We show that as long as C is convex, both types of graphs are plane
graphs.
