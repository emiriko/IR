This paper generalizes the framework for arbitrage-free valuation of
bilateral counterparty risk to the case where collateral is included, with
possible re-hypotecation. We analyze how the payout of claims is modified when
collateral margining is included in agreement with current ISDA documentation.
We then specialize our analysis to interest-rate swaps as underlying portfolio,
and allow for mutual dependences between the default times of the investor and
the counterparty and the underlying portfolio risk factors. We use
arbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models, including also the effect of
interest rate and credit spread volatilities. The impact of re-hypotecation, of
collateral margining frequency and of dependencies on the bilateral
counterparty risk adjustment is illustrated with a numerical example.
