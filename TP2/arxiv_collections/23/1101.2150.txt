A recently developed procedure for a partial wave decomposition of a
three-nucleon force is applied to the pi-pi, pi-rho and rho-rho components of
the Tucson-Melbourne three-nucleon potential. The resulting matrix elements for
the pi-pi and pi-rho components are compared with the values obtained using the
standard approach to the partial wave decomposition, in which the pi-rho
expressions for the matrix elements are also derived and presented. Several
numerical tests and results for the triton binding energy and the correlation
function prove the reliability and efficiency of the new method.
