In this paper, we give the expressions for the bounded spherical functions,
or equivalently the spherical functions of positive type, for the free two-step
nilpotent Lie groups endowed with the actions of orthogonal groups or their
special subgroups. Next we deduce some results about the (Kohn) sub-Laplacian,
and we compute the radial Plancherel measure.
