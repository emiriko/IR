The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer a unique opportunity to study the stellar
evolution and nucleosynthesis of massive Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in
low metallicity environments where distances are known. Rubidium is a key
element to distinguish between high mass AGB stars and low mass AGBs or other
type of astronomical objects such as massive red supergiant stars.
Theoretically, high mass AGBs are predicted to produce a lot of Rb. We present
the discovery of massive Rb-rich AGB stars in the MCs, confirming for the first
time that these stars also exist in other galaxies. Our findings show that
these stars are generally brighter than the standard adopted luminosity limit
(Mbol ~ -7.1) for AGB stars. The observations of massive MC AGBs are
qualitatively predicted by the present theoretical models. However, these
theoretical models are far from matching the extremely high Rb overabundances
observed. This might be related with an incomplete present understanding of the
atmospheres of these stars.
