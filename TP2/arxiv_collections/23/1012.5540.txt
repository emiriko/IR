A method for classifying $n$-species reaction-diffusion models, admitting
shock solutions is presented. The most general one-dimensional two-species
reaction-diffusion model with nearest neighbor interactions admitting uniform
product measures as the stationary states is studied. Satisfying more
constraints, these models may experience single-shock solutions. These models
are generalized to multi-species models. The two-species models are studied in
detail. Dynamical phase transitions of such models are also investigated.
