It is sometimes believed that small quantum gravity corrections to the
Hawking radiation process can encode the correlations required to solve the
black hole information paradox. Recently an inequality on the entanglement
entropy of radiation was derived, which showed that such is not the case; one
needs {\it order unity} corrections to low energy modes at the horizon to
resolve the problem. In this paper we illustrate this inequality by a simple
model where the state of the created Hawking pair at each stage is slightly
modified by the state of the previous pair. The model can be mapped onto the
1-dimensional Ising chain and solved explicitly. In agreement with the general
inequality we find that very little of the entanglement is removed by the
encoded correlations. We then use the general inequality to argue that the
black hole puzzles split into two problems: the `information paradox' and the
`infall problem'. The former addresses the detailed state of low energy modes
at the horizon and asks if these can be modified by order unity, while the
latter asks for a coarse grained effective description of the infall of heavy
observers into the degrees of freedom of the hole.
