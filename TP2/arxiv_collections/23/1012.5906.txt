Let $X$ be a complex manifold and $M\subset X$ a compact, smooth,
pseudoconvex CR manifold of dimension $2n-1$. (Here $n\ge 3$ or, in case $n=2$,
it is made the extra assumption that $\dib_b$ has closed range on functions.)
Assume that there exists a strictly CR-plurisubharmonic function in a
neighborhood of $M$ in $X$. In this situation, there are here proved
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(i)] The global existence of $C^\infty$ solutions to the tangential
Cauchy-Riemann operator $\dib_b$.
  \item[(ii)] The global hypoellipticity of the Kohn-Laplacian $\Box_b$, under
the additional condition of "weak Property (P)".
  \end{enumerate}
