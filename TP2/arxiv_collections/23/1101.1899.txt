In this paper, the CoRoT Exoplanet Science Team announces its 14th discovery.
Herein, we discuss the observations and analyses that allowed us to derive the
parameters of this system: a hot Jupiter with a mass of $7.6 \pm 0.6$ Jupiter
masses orbiting a solar-type star (F9V) with a period of only 1.5 d, less than
5 stellar radii from its parent star. It is unusual for such a massive planet
to have such a small orbit: only one other known exoplanet with a higher mass
orbits with a shorter period.
