Microcrystals of diaquocobalt(II) oxalate have been synthesized by the
coprecipitation reaction of aqueous solutions of Cobalt (II) bromide and oxalic
acid. Chemical analysis and thermal experiments revealed that there is only one
phase present. X-ray powder diffraction studies show that this compound is
orthorhombic with space group Cccm. Molar susceptibility versus temperature
measurements show the existence of an antiferromagnetic ordering, however, the
hysteresis measured in magnetization measurements as a function of magnetic
field reveals a weak ferromagnetic behavior.
