We consider banded block Toeplitz matrices $T_n$ with $n$ block rows and
columns. We show that under certain technical assumptions, the normalized
eigenvalue counting measure of $T_n$ for $n\to\infty$ weakly converges to one
component of the unique vector of measures that minimizes a certain energy
functional. In this way we generalize a recent result of Duits and Kuijlaars
for the scalar case. Along the way we also obtain an equilibrium problem
associated to an arbitrary algebraic curve, not necessarily related to a block
Toeplitz matrix.
  For banded block Toeplitz matrices, there are several new phenomena that do
not occur in the scalar case: (i) The total masses of the equilibrium measures
do not necessarily form a simple arithmetic series but in general are obtained
through a combinatorial rule; (ii) The limiting eigenvalue distribution may
contain point masses, and there may be attracting point sources in the
equilibrium problem; (iii) More seriously, there are examples where the
connection between the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $T_n$ and the
solution to the equilibrium problem breaks down. We provide sufficient
conditions guaranteeing that no such breakdown occurs; in particular we show
this if $T_n$ is a Hessenberg matrix.
