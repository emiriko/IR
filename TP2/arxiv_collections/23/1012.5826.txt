We study a family of generalized slope limiters in two dimensions for
Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) solutions of advection--diffusion
systems. We analyze the numerical behavior of these limiters applied to a pair
of model problems, comparing the error of the approximate solutions, and
discuss each limiter's advantages and disadvantages. We then introduce a series
of coupled $p$-enrichment schemes that may be used as standalone dynamic
$p$-enrichment strategies, or may be augmented via any in the family of
variable-in-$p$ slope limiters presented.
