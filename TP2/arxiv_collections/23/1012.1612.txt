Superpositioning of relaxation data as a function of the product variable
TV^{\gamma}, where T is temperature, V the specific volume, and {\gamma} a
material constant, is an experimental fact demonstrated for approximately 100
liquids and polymers. Such scaling behavior would result from the
intermolecular potential having the form of an inverse power law (IPL),
suggesting that an IPL is a good approximation for certain relaxation
properties over the relevant range of intermolecular distances. However, the
derivation of the scaling property of an IPL liquid is based on reduced
quantities, for example, the reduced relaxation time equal to T^1/2V^-1/3 times
the actual relaxation time. The difference between scaling using reduced rather
than unreduced units is negligible in the supercooled regime; however, at
higher temperature the difference can be substantial, accounting for the
purported breakdown of the scaling and giving rise to different values of the
scaling exponent. Only the {\gamma} obtained using reduced quantities can be
sensibly related to the intermolecular potential.
