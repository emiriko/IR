We discuss a method to construct observables protected against QCD
uncertainties based on the angular distribution of the exclusive Bd -> K(*0}(->
Kpi) l+ l- decay. We focus on the identification and the interpretation of all
the symmetries of the distribution. They constitute a key ingredient to
construct a set of so-called transverse observables. We work in the framework
of QCD factorization at NLO supplemented by an estimate of power-suppressed
Lambda/mb corrections. A discussion of the new physics properties of two of the
transverse asymmetries, AT^{(2)} and AT^{(5)}, is presented. A comparison
between the transverse asymmetry AT^{(2)} and the forward-backward asymmetry
shows that AT^{(2)} emerges as an improved version of it.
