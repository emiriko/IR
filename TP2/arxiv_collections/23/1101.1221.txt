We consider a two-dimensional interacting Fermi system which displays a
nematic phase within mean-field theory. The system is analyzed using a
non-perturbative renormalization-group scheme. We find that order-parameter
fluctuations can suppress the nematic order obtained in mean-field theory even
at zero temperature. For a suitable choice of parameters a quantum critical
point surrounded by a disordered phase can be realized, giving rise to quantum
critical behavior in the absence of an ordered regime in the phase diagram.
