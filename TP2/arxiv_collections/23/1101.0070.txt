Jet shapes have been measured in inclusive jet production in proton-proton
collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV using 3 pb^{-1} of data recorded by the ATLAS
experiment at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm with
transverse momentum 30 GeV < pT < 600 GeV and rapidity in the region |y| < 2.8.
The data are corrected for detector effects and compared to several
leading-order QCD matrix elements plus parton shower Monte Carlo predictions,
including different sets of parameters tuned to model fragmentation processes
and underlying event contributions in the final state. The measured jets become
narrower with increasing jet transverse momentum and the jet shapes present a
moderate jet rapidity dependence. Within QCD, the data test a variety of
perturbative and non-perturbative effects. In particular, the data show
sensitivity to the details of the parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying
event models in the Monte Carlo generators. For an appropriate choice of the
parameters used in these models, the data are well described.
