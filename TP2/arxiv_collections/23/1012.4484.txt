We present recent results from lattice simulations of 2+1 flavors of improved
staggered fermions at zero baryon number density near the high temperature
crossover. Included are new results from simulations of asqtad fermions at Nt =
12 and a nearly physical Goldstone pion mass and from simulations of HISQ
fermions at Nt = 6 and 8. We focus on observables sensitive to chiral symmetry
and confinement. A companion HotQCD talk discusses the effects of
staggered-fermion taste-symmetry breaking on thermodynamic quantities.
