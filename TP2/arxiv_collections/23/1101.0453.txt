The S-wave Sigma_c Dbar and Lambda_c Dbar states with isospin I=1/2 and spin
S=1/2 are dynamically investigated within the framework of a chiral constituent
quark model by solving a resonating group method (RGM) equation. The results
show that the interaction between Sigma_c and Dbar is attractive, which
consequently results in a Sigma_c Dbar bound state with the binding energy of
about 5-42 MeV, unlike the case of Lambda_c Dbar state, which has a repulsive
interaction and thus is unbound. The channel coupling effect of Sigma_c Dbar
and Lambda_c Dbar is found to be negligible due to the fact that the gap
between the Sigma_c Dbar and Lambda_c Dbar thresholds is relatively large and
the Sigma_c Dbar and Lambda_c Dbar transition interaction is weak.
