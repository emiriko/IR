The ANTARES deep-sea neutrino telescope comprises a three-dimensional array
of photomultipliers to detect the Cherenkov light induced by upgoing
relativistic charged particles originating from neutrino interactions in the
vicinity of the detector. The large scattering length of light in the deep sea
facilitates an angular resolution of a few tenths of a degree for neutrino
energies exceeding 10 TeV. In order to achieve this optimal performance, the
time calibration procedures should ensure a relative time calibration between
the photomultipliers at the level of about 1ns. The methods developed to attain
this level of precision are described.
