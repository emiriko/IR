The decay modes of the type $B \rightarrow \pi \, \pi $ are dynamically
different. For the case $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^+ \pi^- $ there is a
substantial factorized contribution which dominates. In contrast, the decay
mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ has a small factorized
contribution, being proportional to a small Wilson coefficient combination.
However, for the decay mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ there
is a sizeable nonfactorizable (color suppressed) contribution due to soft (long
distance) interactions, which dominate the amplitude. We estimate the branching
ratio for the mode $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ in the heavy
quark limit for the $b$- quark. In order to estimate color suppressed
contributions we treat the energetic light ($u,d,s$) quark within a variant of
Large Energy Effective Theory combined with a recent extension of chiral quark
models in terms of model- dependent gluon condensates. We find that our
calculated color suppressed amplitude is suppressed by a factor of order
$\Lambda_{QCD}/m_b$ with respect to the factorizable amplitude, as it should
according to QCD-factorization. Further, for reasonable values of the
constituent quark mass and the gluon condensate, the calculated nonfactorizable
amplitude for $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $ can easily
accomodate the experimental value. Unfortunately, the color suppressed
amplitude is very sensitive to the values of these model dependent parameters.
Therefore fine-tuning is necessary in order to obtain an amplitude compatible
with the experimental result for $\bar{B_{d}^0} \rightarrow \, \pi^0 \pi^{0} $.
A possible link to the triangle anomaly is discussed.
