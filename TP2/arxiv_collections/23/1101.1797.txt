The melting transition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), whereby the strands of
the double helix structure completely separate at a certain temperature, has
been characterized using neutron scattering. A Bragg peak from B-form fibre DNA
has been measured as a function of temperature, and its widths and integrated
intensities have been interpreted using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model
with only one free parameter. The experiment is unique, as it gives spatial
correlation along the molecule through the melting transition where other
techniques cannot.
