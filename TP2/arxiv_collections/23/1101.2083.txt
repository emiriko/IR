Using the Einstein gravitation theory (EGT), we analyze the Lense Thirring
(LT) and the Geodetic effects. In the LT effect the angular orbital momentum L
and the perigeo of a particle, orbiting a sphere with mass M and spin J around
an axis passing by its center of mass, precess around J. In the Geodetic effect
the spin S of a gyroscope orbiting M precess around its orbital angular
momentum L and the spin of J of M. The theoretical predictions are compared
with the experimental results. This article was written to graduate and
postgraduate students of Physics.
