The very high energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) blazar Markarian 501 has a
well-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellent
laboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of active
galactic nuclei. However, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies of
Markarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. A
short-term multiwavelength study of Markarian 501 was coordinated in March
2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the Suzaku X-ray satellite
and including {\gamma}-ray data from VERITAS, MAGIC, and the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelength
baseline measurement of Markarian 501 in the quiescent state. The results of
these quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extreme
outburst of April 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of the
spectral energy distribution between the two states. The derived broadband
spectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. We
find that the X-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photon
energy between the two flux states while the VHE peak varies little. The
limited shift in the VHE peak can be explained by the transition to the
Klein-Nishina regime. Synchrotron self-Compton models are matched to the data
and the implied Klein-Nishina effects are explored.
