Measurements of the total and differential cross sections with respect to
transverse momentum and rapidity for B+ mesons produced in pp collisions at
sqrt(s) = 7 TeV are presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity
of 5.8 inverse picobarns collected by the CMS experiment operating at the LHC.
The exclusive decay B+ to J/psi K+, with the J/psi decaying to an oppositely
charged muon pair, is used to detect B+ mesons and to measure the production
cross section as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the B.
The total cross section for p_t(B) > 5 GeV and |y(B)| < 2.4 is measured to be
28.1 +/- 2.4 +/- 2.0 +/- 3.1 microbarns, where the first uncertainty is
statistical, the second is systematic, and the last is from the luminosity
measurement.
