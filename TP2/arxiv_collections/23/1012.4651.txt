We are searching for the action principle for multiple M0-brane (multiple
M-wave or mM0) system starting from the mM0 equations of motion obtained in the
frame of superembedding approach. Surprisingly, the way from these equations to
the action happens to be hampered by a problem which suggests a possible
generalization of the action principle which we call "hierarchical action
principle".
