The predictive soft-wall AdS/QCD model with a modified 5D metric at the
infrared region is constructed to obtain a non-trivial dilaton solution for
three flavor quarks $u$, $d$ and $s$. Such a model is shown to incorporate both
the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. After considering some
high-order terms including the $U(1)_L\times U(1)_R$ chiral symmetry breaking
term, we find that the resulting predictions for the SU(3) octet and singlet
resonance states of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons agree
well with the experimentally confirmed resonance states. Contributions from the
instanton effects given by the determinant term are also discussed. It is
observed that the chiral symmetry breaking phenomena of $SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R$
and $U(1)_L\times U(1)_R$ can be well described in this model, while the SU(3)
flavor symmetry breaking effect due to quark mass difference in the source term
is not enough to explain all of the current experimental data.
