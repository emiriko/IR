We consider local, stratified, numerical models of isothermal accretion
disks. The novel feature of our treatment is that radial extent L_x and
azimuthal extent L_y satisfy H << L_x, L_y << R, where H is the scale height
and R is the local radius. This enables us to probe mesoscale structure in
stratified thin disks. We evolve the model at several resolutions, sizes, and
initial magnetic field strengths. Consistent with earlier work, we find that
the saturated, turbulent state consists of a weakly magnetized disk midplane
coupled to a strongly magnetized corona, with a transition at |z| ~ 2H. The
saturated \alpha ~ 0.01 - 0.02. A two-point correlation function analysis
reveals that the central 4H of the disk is dominated by small scale turbulence
that is statistically similar to unstratified disk models, while the coronal
magnetic fields are correlated on scales ~ 10 H. Nevertheless angular momentum
transport through the corona is small. A study of magnetic field loops in the
corona reveals few open field lines and predominantly toroidal loops with a
characteristic distance between footpoints that is ~ H. Finally we find
quasi-periodic oscillations with characteristic timescale ~ 30 \Omega^{-1} in
the magnetic field energy density. These oscillations are correlated with
oscillations in the mean azimuthal field; we present a phenomenological,
alpha-dynamo model that captures most aspects of the oscillations.
