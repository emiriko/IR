A continuum model of crack propagation is presented and discussed. We obtain
steady state solutions with a self-consistently selected propagation velocity
and shape of the crack, provided that elastodynamic and viscoelastic effects
are taken into account. Two different mechanism of crack propagation, a first
order phase transition and surface diffusion are considered, and we discuss
different loading modes. The arising free boundary problems are solved by phase
field methods and a sharp interface approach using a multipole expansion
technique.
