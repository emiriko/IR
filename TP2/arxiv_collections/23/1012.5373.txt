Aims. The goal of our survey is to provide accurate and multi-epoch radial
velocities, atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g and [M/H]), distances and space
velocities of faint Red Clump stars. Methods. We recorded high signal-to-noise
(S/N >= 200) spectra of Red Clump stars, over the 4750-5950 Ang range, at a
resolving power 5500. The target stars are distributed over the great circle of
the celestial equator. Radial velocities were obtained via cross-correlation
against IAU radial velocity standards. Atmospheric parameters were derived via
chi^2 fit to a synthetic spectral library. A large number of RC stars from
other surveys were re-observed to check the consistency of our results.
Results. A total of 245 Red Clump stars were observed (60 of them with a second
epoch observation separated in time by about three months), and the results are
presented in an output catalog. None of them is already present in other
surveys of Red Clump stars. In addition to astrometric and photometric support
data from external sources, the catalog provides radial velocities (accuracy
sigma(RV)=1.3 km/s), atmospheric parameters (sigma(Teff)=88 K, sigma(log
g)=0.38 dex and sigma([M/H])=0.17 dex), spectro-photometric distances, (X,Y,Z)
galacto-centric positions and (U,V,W) space velocities.
