Stellar jets can be highly asymmetric and have multiple velocity components.
To clarify the origin of jet asymmetries and constrain their launch mechanism
we study the physical and kinematical structure of the flow emitted by DG Tau
B. The analysis of deep spectra taken at the KECK telescope allows us to infer
the physical properties (the electron and total density, ne and nh, the
ionisation fraction, xe, and the temperature, te) and the spatial distribution
of the velocity components in the two jet lobes. The presence of dust grains in
the jet is investigated by estimating the gas-phase abundance of calcium with
respect to its solar value. At the base of the jet the lines are broad (~100
km/s) and up to three velocity components are detected. At 5" from the source,
however, only the denser and more excited high velocity components survive and
the lines are narrower (~10-30 km/s). The jet is strongly asymmetric both in
velocity and in its physical structure. The red lobe, slower (~140 km/s) and
more collimated, presents low ionisation fractions (xe~0.1-0.4) and
temperatures (te<5e3 K), while the total density is up to ~2.5e4 ccm. The blue
lobe, faster (~-320 km/s) and less collimated, is also less dense (nh~1e4 ccm)
but highly excited (te up to ~5e4 K and xe up to 0.9). The estimated mass loss
rate is similar in the two lobes (~6-8e-9 Msol/yr), suggesting that the
ejection power is comparable on the two sides of the system, as expected from a
magneto-centrifugal ejection mechanism, and that the observed asymmetries are
due to different mass load and propagation properties in an inhomogeneous
environment. Calcium is strongly depleted, indicating that the jet contains
dust grains and, therefore, should originate from a region of the disk
extending beyond the dust sublimation radius. The depletion is lower for higher
velocities, consistent with dust destruction by shocks.
