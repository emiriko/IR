The Zee model generates neutrino masses at the one-loop level by adding
charged SU(2)_L-singlet and extra SU(2)_L-doublet scalars to the standard model
of particle physics. As the origin of the nontrivial structure of the lepton
flavor mixing, we introduce the softly broken A_4 symmetry to the Zee model.
This model is compatible with the tribimaximal mixing which agrees well with
neutrino oscillation measurements. Then, a sum rule m_1 e^{i alpha_12} + 2 m_2
+ 3 m_3 e^{i alpha_32} = 0 is obtained and it results in Delta m^2_31 < 0 and
m_3 > 1.8*10^{-2}eV. The effective mass |(M_nu)_{ee}| for the neutrinoless
double beta decay is predicted as | (M_\nu)_{ee} | > 1.7*10^{-2}eV. The
characteristic particles in this model are SU(2)_L-singlet charged Higgs bosons
s^+_alpha (alpha=xi,eta,zeta) which are made from a 3-representation of A_4.
Contributions of s^+_alpha to the lepton flavor violating decays of charged
leptons are almost forbidden by an approximately remaining Z_3 symmetry; only
BR(tau to ebar mu mu) can be sizable by the flavor changing neutral current
interaction with SU(2)_L-doublet scalars. Therefore, s^+_alpha can be easily
light enough to be discovered at the LHC with satisfying current constraints.
The flavor structures of BR(s^-_alpha to ell nu) are also discussed.
