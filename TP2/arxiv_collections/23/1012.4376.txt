We present a new derivation of the CORS Baade-Wesselink method in the
Walraven photometric system. We solved the complete Baade-Wesselink equation by
calibrating the surface brightness function with a recent grid of atmosphere
models. The new approach was adopted to estimate the mean radii of a sample of
Galactic Cepheids for which are available precise light curves in the Walraven
bands. Current radii agree, within the errors, quite well with Cepheid radii
based on recent optical and near-infrared interferometric measurements. We also
tested the impact of the projection factor on the Period-Radius relation using
two different values (p=1.36, p=1.27) that bracket the estimates available in
the literature. We found that the agreement of our Period-Radius relation with
similar empirical and theoretical Period-Radius relations in the recent
literature, improves by changing the projection factor from p=1.36 to p=1.27.
Our Period-Radius relation is log(R)=(0.75\pm 0.03)log(P)+(1.10 \pm 0.03), with
a rms=0.03 dex. Thanks to accurate estimates of the effective temperature of
the selected Cepheids, we also derived the Period-Luminosity relation in the V
band and we found Mv=(-2.78 \pm 0.11)log(P)+(-1.42 \pm 0.11) with rms=0.13 mag,
for p=1.27. It agrees quite well with recent results in the literature, while
the relation for p=1.36 deviates by more than 2sigma. We conclude that, even
taking into account the intrinsic dispersion of the obtained Period-Luminosity
relations, that is roughly of the same order of magnitude as the effect of the
projection factor, the results of this paper seem to favour the value p = 1.27.
