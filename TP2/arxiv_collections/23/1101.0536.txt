This document is intended as a study of benchmark cross sections at the LHC
(at 7 TeV) at NLO using modern parton distribution functions currently
available from the 6 PDF fitting groups that have participated in this
exercise. It also contains a succinct user guide to the computation of PDFs,
uncertainties and correlations using available PDF sets.
  A companion note, also submitted to the archive, provides an interim summary
of the current recommendations of the PDF4LHC working group for the use of
parton distribution functions and of PDF uncertainties at the LHC, for cross
section and cross section uncertainty calculations.
