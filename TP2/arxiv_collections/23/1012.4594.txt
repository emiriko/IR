We demonstrate through an exactly solvable model that collective coupling to
any thermal bath induces effectively nonlinear couplings in a quantum many-body
(multi-spin) system. The resulting evolution can drive an uncorrelated
large-spin system with high probability into a macroscopic
quantum-superposition state. We discuss possible experimental realizations.
