Conventional kinesin is a two-headed homodimeric motor protein, which is able
to walk along microtubules processively by hydrolyzing ATP. Its neck linkers,
which connect the two motor domains and can undergo a docking/undocking
transition, are widely believed to play the key role in the coordination of the
chemical cycles of the two motor domains and, consequently, in force production
and directional stepping. Although many experiments, often complemented with
partial kinetic modeling of specific pathways, support this idea, the ultimate
test of the viability of this hypothesis requires the construction of a
complete kinetic model. Considering the two neck linkers as entropic springs
that are allowed to dock to their head domains and incorporating only the few
most relevant kinetic and structural properties of the individual heads, here
we develop the first detailed, thermodynamically consistent model of kinesin
that can (i) explain the cooperation of the heads (including their gating
mechanisms) during walking and (ii) reproduce much of the available
experimental data (speed, dwell time distribution, randomness, processivity,
hydrolysis rate, etc.) under a wide range of conditions (nucleotide
concentrations, loading force, neck linker length and composition, etc.).
Besides revealing the mechanism by which kinesin operates, our model also makes
it possible to look into the experimentally inaccessible details of the
mechanochemical cycle and predict how certain changes in the protein affect its
motion.
