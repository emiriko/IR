It is well known that large nonfragmentational contributions to inclusive
production of charmed particles appear at low energies. In the case of charm
production in $B$-meson decays these contributions arise from the participation
of the light valent quark from the $B$-meson and can be easily described
phenomenologically. These contributions affect $D$-meson spectra and
essentially change ratios between yields of different $D$-meson states.
