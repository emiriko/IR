We present the first 2.5-D MHD simulations of protostellar jets that include
both the region in which the jet is launched magnetocentrifugally at scale
lengths $<0.1$ AU, and where the propagating jet is observed at scale lengths
$>10^3$ AU. These simulations, performed with the new AMR-MHD code AZEuS,
reveal interesting relationships between conditions at the disc surface, such
as the magnetic field strength, and direct observables such as proper motion,
jet rotation, jet radius, and mass flux. By comparing these quantities with
observed values, we present direct numerical evidence that the
magnetocentrifugal launching mechanism is capable, by itself, of launching
realistic protostellar jets.
