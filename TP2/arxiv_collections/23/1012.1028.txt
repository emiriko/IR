The dynamics of entanglement in some hybrid qubit-qutrit systems under the
influence of global, collective, local and multilocal depolarizing noise is
studied. It is shown that the depolarizing noise can be used to induce
entanglement. A critical point exists under every coupling of the system with
the environment at which all the states are equally entangled. Furthermore, it
is seen that no ESD occurs when either only the qubit is coupled to its local
environment or the system is coupled to multilocal or global environment. This
is an important result for various quantum information processing tasks and
hence needs further investigation.
