Massive stars play an important role in shaping the structure of galaxies.
Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), with their low temperatures and high densities,
have been identified as the potential birthplaces of massive stars. In order to
understand the formation processes of massive stars the physical and chemical
conditions in infrared dark clouds have to be characterized. The goal of this
paper is to investigate the chemical composition of a sample of southern
infrared dark clouds. One important aspect of the observations is to check, if
the molecular abuncances in IRDCs are similar to the low-mass pre-stellar
cores, or whether they show signatures of more evolved evolutionary stages. We
performed observations toward 15 IRDCs in the frequency range between 86 and 93
GHz using the 22-m Mopra radio telescope. We detect HNC, HCO$^+$ and HNC
emission in all clouds and N$_2$H$^+$ in all IRDCs except one. In some clouds
we detect SiO emission. Complicated shapes of the HCO$^+$ emission line profile
are found in all IRDCs. Both signatures indicates the presence of infall and
outflow motions and beginning of star formation activity, at least in some
parts of the IRDCs. Where possible, we calculate molecular abundances and make
a comparison with previously obtained values for low-mass pre-stellar cores and
high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs). We show a tendency for IRDCs to have
molecular abundances similar to low-mass pre-stellar cores rather than to HMPOs
abundances on the scale of our single-dish observations.
