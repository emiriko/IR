We study the effect of Joule heating from electric currents flowing through
ferromagnetic nanowires on the temperature of the nanowires and on the
temperature of the substrate on which the nanowires are grown. The spatial
current density distribution, the associated heat generation, and diffusion of
heat is simulated within the nanowire and the substrate. We study several
different nanowire and constriction geometries as well as different substrates:
(thin) silicon nitride membranes, (thick) silicon wafers, and (thick) diamond
wafers. The spatially resolved increase in temperature as a function of time is
computed. For effectively three-dimensional substrates (where the substrate
thickness greatly exceeds the nanowire length), we identify three different
regimes of heat propagation through the substrate: regime (i), where the
nanowire temperature increases approximately logarithmically as a function of
time. In this regime, the nanowire temperature is well-described analytically
by You et al. [APL 89, 222513 (2006)]. We provide an analytical expression for
the time t_c that marks the upper applicability limit of the You model. After
t_c, the heat flow enters regime (ii), where the nanowire temperature stays
constant while a hemispherical heat front carries the heat away from the wire
and into the substrate. As the heat front reaches the boundary of the
substrate, regime (iii) is entered where the nanowire and substrate temperature
start to increase rapidly. For effectively two-dimensional substrates (where
the nanowire length greatly exceeds the substrate thickness), there is only one
regime in which the temperature increases logarithmically with time for large
times, before the heat front reaches the substrate boundary. We provide an
analytical expression, valid for all pulse durations, that allows one to
accurately compute this temperature increase in the nanowire on thin
substrates.
