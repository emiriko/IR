Binary systems, in particular eclipsing binaries, are essential sources of
our knowledge of the fundamental properties of stars. The ages of binaries,
members of open clusters, are constrained by their own fundamental properties
and by those of the hosting cluster. The ages of eleven open clusters are here
found by constructing models for the components of twelve eclipsing binaries.
The difference between the ages we found and the ages of the clusters derived
from isochrone fitting is up to 40%. For the binary system V497 Cep in NGC
7160, the difference is about 100%. Binary systems whose primary component is
aboutto complete main-sequence life time, such as V453 Cyg and V906 Sco, are
the most suitable systems for age determination. Using model results for these
stars, we derive an expression for sensitive and uncomplicated relative age
determination of binary systems (age divided by the main-sequence life time of
the primary star). The expression is given as logarithm of radii ratio divided
by a logarithm of mass ratio. Two advantages of this expression are that (i) it
is nearly independent of assumed chemical composition of the models because of
the appearance of the ratio of radii, and (ii) the ratios of radii and masses
are observationally much more precise than their absolute values. We also
derive another expression using luminosities rather than radii and compare
results.
