Recurrence behavior of wave packets in coupled higher dimensional systems and
periodically driven systems is analyzed, which takes place in the realm of
higher coupling/modulation strength. We analyze the wave packet dynamics close
to nonlinear resonances developed in the systems and provide the analytical
understanding of recurrence times.We apply these analytical results to
investigate the recurrence times of matter waves in optical lattice in the
presence of external periodic forcing. The obtained analytical results can
experimentally be observed using currently available experimental setups.
