We investigate theoretically the coupling of a cavity mode to a continuous
distribution of emitters. We discuss the influence of the emitters
inhomogeneous broadening on the existence and on the coherence properties of
the polaritonic peaks. We find that their coherence depends crucially on the
shape of the distribution and not only on its width. Under certain conditions
the coupling to the cavity protects the polaritonic states from inhomogeneous
broadening, resulting in a longer storage time for a quantum memory based on
emitters ensembles. When two different ensembles of emitters are coupled to the
resonator, they support a peculiar collective dark state, also very attractive
for the storage of quantum information.
