Di-hadron correlations have been used to study jets at RHIC and have yielded
rich insight into the properties of the medium. Studies show that the near-side
peak of high-pT triggered correlations can be decomposed into two parts, a
jet-like correlation and the ridge. The jet-like correlation is narrow in both
azimuth and pseudorapidity and has properties consistent with vacuum
fragmentation, while the ridge is narrow in azimuth but broad in pseudorapidity
and roughly independent of pseudorapidity. The energy, system, and particle
composition of the jet-like correlation and the ridge are discussed. Data
indicate that the jet-like correlation is dominantly produced by vacuum
fragmentation. Attempts have been made to explain the production of the ridge
component as coming from recombination, momentum kicks, and QCD magnetic
fields. However, few models have attempted to quantitatively calculate the
characteristics of the ridge. The wealth of data should help distinguish models
for the production mechanism of the ridge. Implications for studies of the
jet-like correlation and the ridge at the LHC are discussed.
