This paper presents a series of general results about the optimal estimation
of physical transformations in a given symmetry group. In particular, it is
shown how the different symmetries of the problem determine different
properties of the optimal estimation strategy. The paper also contains a
discussion about the role of entanglement between the representation and
multiplicity spaces and about the optimality of square-root measurements.
