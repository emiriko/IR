We calculate the scalar semileptonic kaon decay in finite volume at the
momentum transfer $t_{m} = (m_{K} - m_{\pi})^2$, using chiral perturbation
theory. At first we obtain the hadronic matrix element to be calculated in
finite volume. We then evaluate the finite size effects for two volumes with $L
= 1.83 fm$ and $L= 2.73 fm$ and find that the difference between the finite
volume corrections of the two volumes are larger than the difference as quoted
in \cite{Boyle2007a}. It appears then that the pion masses used for the scalar
form factor in ChPT are large which result in large finite volume corrections.
If appropriate values for pion mass are used, we believe that the finite size
effects estimated in this paper can be useful for Lattice data to extrapolate
at large lattice size.
