We present a spectroscopic catalog of 70,841 visually inspected M dwarfs from
the seventh data release (DR7) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For each
spectrum, we provide measurements of the spectral type, a number of molecular
bandheads, and the H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta and Ca II K emission
lines. In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter zeta and
3D space motions for most of the stars in the sample. Our catalog is
cross-matched to Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) infrared data, and contains
photometric distances for each star. Future studies will use these data to
thoroughly examine magnetic activity and kinematics in late-type M dwarfs and
examine the chemical and dynamical history of the local Milky Way.
