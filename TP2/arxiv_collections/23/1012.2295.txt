Nominally pure nanocrystalline KTaO3 was thoroughly investigated by
micro-Raman and magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. In all samples the
defect driven ferroelectricity and magnetism are registered. Both ordering
states are suggested to appear due to the iron atoms and oxygen vacancies. The
concentration of defects was estimated to be 0.04 and 0.06-0.1 mole %,
respectively. Note that undoped single crystals of KTaO3 are nonmagnetic and
have never exhibited ferromagnetic properties. The results enable us to refer a
nanosized KTa(Fe)O3 to the class of multiferroics and assume that it could
perform the magnetoelectric effect at T<29 K. It was also established that the
critical concentration of impurity defects necessary to provoke the appearance
of the new phase states in the material strongly correlates with the size of
the particle; as the size of the particle decreases, the critical concentration
decreases as well.
