We present a stochastic approach for ion transport at the mesoscopic level.
The description takes into account the self-consistent electric field generated
by the fixed and mobile charges as well as the discrete nature of these latter.
As an application we study the noise in the ion transport process, including
the effect of the displacement current generated by the fluctuating electric
field. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the electric current with
and without the displacement current.
