We review some topological effects on the construction of string flux-vacua.
Specifically we study the effects of brane-flux transitions on the stability of
D-branes on a generalized tori compactificaction, the transition that a black
hole suffers in a background threaded with fluxes and the connections among
some Minkowsky vacua solutions.
