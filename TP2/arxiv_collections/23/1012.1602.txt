The black hole in the center of the Milky Way has been observed and modeled
intensely during the last decades. It is also the prime target of a number of
new experiments that aim to zoom into the vicinity of its horizon and reveal
the inner working of its spacetime. In this review we discuss our current
understanding of the gravitational field of Sgr A* and the prospects of testing
the Kerr nature of its spacetime via imaging, astrometric, and timing
observations.
