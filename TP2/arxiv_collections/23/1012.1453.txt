Let X be a homogeneous space, X = G/H, where G is a connected linear
algebraic group over a number field k, and H is a k-subgroup of G (not
necessarily connected). Let S be a finite set of places of k. We compute the
Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation for X in S in terms of Galois
cohomology.
