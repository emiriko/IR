Given that it will take quite some time for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
to reach its desired luminosity, it is important to investigate the most
favorable scenario in which supersymmetry (SUSY) may be discovered at the early
runs at the LHC. Our aim in this work is to find such a scenario within the
gravity mediated SUSY breaking (SUGRA) framework and select a class of final
states that warrant a discovery at the very early runs of the LHC. It turns out
that such a situation can be associated with a scenario where gluinos are
sufficiently light and so are the third generation scalars while the first two
family scalars are heavy. We find that this can be achieved from a high-scale
set-up with scalar mass non-universality in the third family and gaugino mass
non-universality with $M_3 < M_1, M_2$. We show that the final state channels
which are most favorable in such a region of parameter space are
$4b+{E_{T}}\!\!\!\!/$, $4b+\ell+{E_{T}}\!\!\!\!/$ and
$2b+2\ell+{E_{T}}\!\!\!\!/$. We also justify our claim by comparing the results
with a minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) scenario with similar gluino mass.
