Hypothetical color-octet particles of spin 0, pair-produced at hadron
colliders through their QCD coupling, may lead to final states involving three
or four b jets. We analyze kinematic distributions of the 3b final state that
differentiate the scalar octets from supersymmetric Higgs bosons. Studying the
scalar sector that breaks an SU(3) \times SU(3) gauge symmetry down to the QCD
gauge group, we find that the scalar octet is resonantly produced in pairs via
a spin-1 octet (coloron). A scalar octet of mass in the 140 - 150 GeV range can
explain the nonstandard shape of the b-jet transverse energy distributions
reported by the CDF Collaboration, especially when the coloron mass is slightly
above twice the scalar mass. The dominant decay mode of the scalar octet is
into a pair of gluons, so that the production of a pair of dijet resonances is
large in this model, of about 40 pb at the Tevatron. Even when a W boson is
radiated from the initial state, the inclusive cross section for producing a
dijet resonance near the scalar octet mass remains sizable, around 0.15 pb.
