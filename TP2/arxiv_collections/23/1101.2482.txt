The goal of the comprehensive program in Deeply Virtual Exclusive Scattering
at Jefferson Laboratory is to create transverse spatial images of quarks and
gluons as a function of their longitudinal momentum fraction in the proton, the
neutron, and in nuclei. These functions are the Generalized Parton
Distributions (GPDs) of the target nucleus. Cross section measurements of the
Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) reaction {ep -> ep \gamma} in Hall A
support the QCD factorization of the scattering amplitude for Q^2 > 2 GeV^2.
Quasi-free neutron-DVCS measurements on the Deuteron indicate sensitivity to
the quark angular momentum sum rule. Fully exclusive H(e,e' p\gamma)
measurements have been made in a wide kinematic range in CLAS with polarized
beam, and with both unpolarized and longitudinally polarized targets. Existing
models are qualitatively consistent with the JLab data, but there is a clear
need for less constrained models. Deeply virtual vector meson production is
studied in CLAS. The 12 GeV upgrade will be essential for these channels. The
{\rho} and {\omega} channels reactions offer the prospect of flavor sensitivity
to the quark GPDs, while the {\phi}-production channel is dominated by the
gluon distribution.
