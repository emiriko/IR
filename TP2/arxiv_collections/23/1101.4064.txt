We have a comparative study of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effects induced by
non-magnetic and magnetic staggered potentials respectively and show that they
have the same effect in driving the topological phase transition. The result
implies that both time-reversal (${\cal T}$) preserving and breaking systems
can host QSH effect. We also investigate the stability of the resulting QSH
effect to disorder and find that for ${\cal T}$ invariant system the edge
states are always robust while those of ${\cal T}$ breaking system are also
robust if there is additional symmetry in the system.
