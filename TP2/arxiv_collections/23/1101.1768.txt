Papers I and II of this series have extended the radio interferometry
measurement equation (RIME) formalism to the full-sky case, and provided a
RIME-based description of calibration and the problem of direction-dependent
effects (DDEs). This paper aims to provide a practical demonstration of a
RIME-based approach to calibration, via an example of extremely high-dynamic
range calibration of WSRT observations of 3C 147 at 21 cm, with full treatment
of DDEs.
  A version of the RIME incorporating differential gains has been implemented
in MeqTrees, and applied to the 3C 147 data. This was used to perform regular
selfcal, then solve for interferometer-based errors and for differential gains.
The resulting image of the field around 3C 147 is thermal noise-limited, has a
very high dynamic range (1.6 million), and none of the off-axis artefacts that
plague regular selfcal. The differential gain solutions show a high
signal-to-noise ratio, and may be used to extract information on DDEs and
errors in the sky model.
  The differential gain approach can eliminate DDE-related artefacts, and
provide information for iterative improvements of sky models. Perhaps most
importantly, sources as faint as 2 mJy have been shown to yield meaningful
differential gain solutions, and thus can be used as potential calibration
beacons in other DDE-related schemes.
