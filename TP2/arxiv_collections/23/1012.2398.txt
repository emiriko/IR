The measured spectrum of kinetic Alfven wave fluctuations in the turbulent
solar wind plasma is used to calculate the electron and ion distribution
functions resulting from quasi-linear diffusion. The modified ion distribution
function is found to be unstable to long wavelength electromagnetic ion
cyclotron waves. These waves pitch angle scatter the parallel ion velocity into
perpendicular velocity which effectively increases the perpendicular ion
temperature.
