We calculate the dynamical dielectric function of doped double-layer graphene
(DLG), made of two parallel graphene monolayers with carrier densities n 1, n2,
respectively, and an interlayer separation of d at finite temperature. The
results are used to find the dispersion of plasmon modes and loss functions of
DLG for several interlayer separations and layer densities. We show that in the
case of n 2=0, the temperature plasmon modes are dramatically different from
the zero temperature ones.
