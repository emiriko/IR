We present the results of spectroscopic observations in the GOODS-N field
completed using DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope as part of the DEEP3 Galaxy
Redshift Survey. Observations of 370 unique targets down to a limiting
magnitude of R = 24.4 yielded 156 secure redshifts. In addition to redshift
information, we provide sky-subtracted one- and two-dimensional spectra of each
target. Observations were conducted following the procedures of the Team Keck
Redshift Survey (TKRS), thereby producing spectra that augment the TKRS sample
while maintaining the uniformity of its spectral database.
