We propose a scheme for realizing the scalable quantum computation based on
nonidentical quantum dots trapped in a single-mode waveguide. In this system,
the quantum dots simultaneously interact with a large detuned waveguide and
classical light fields. During the process, neither the waveguide mode nor the
quantum dots are excited, while the sub-system composed of any two quantum dots
can acquire phases conditional upon the states of these two quantum dots and
the certain detunings between the waveguide mode and corresponding external
light fields. Therefore, it can be used to realize selective quantum phase
gates, graph states, $N$-qubit controlled phase $\pi $ gates, and cluster
states.
