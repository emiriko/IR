The voids between galaxies are identified with the volumes of the Poisson
Voronoi tessellation. Two new survival functions for the apparent radii of
voids are derived. The sectional normalized area of the Poisson Voronoi
tessellation is modelled by the Kiang function and by the exponential function.
Two new survival functions with equivalent sectional radius are therefore
derived; they represent an alternative to the survival function of voids
between galaxies as given by the self-similar distribution. The spatial
appearance of slices of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey is simulated.
