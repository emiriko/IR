The EDELWEISS-II experiment uses cryogenic heat-and-ionization Germanium
detectors in order to detect the rare interactions from WIMP dark matter
particles of local halo. New-generation detec- tors with an interleaved
electrode geometry were developped and validated, enabling an outstanding
gamma-ray and surface interaction rejection. We present here preliminary
results of a one-year WIMP search carried out with 10 of such detectors in the
Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane. A sensitivity to the spin-independent
WIMP-nucleon cross-section of 5x10-8 pb was achieved using a 322 kg.days
effective exposure. We also present the current status of the experiment and
prospects to improve the present sensitivity by an order of magnitude in the
near future.
