Noisy quantum walks are studied from the perspective of comparing their
quantumness as defined by two popular measures, measurement-induced disturbance
(MID) and quantum discord (QD). While the former has an operational definition,
unlike the latter, it also tends to overestimate non-classicality because of a
lack of optimization over local measurements. Applied to quantum walks, we find
that MID, while acting as a loose upper bound on QD, still tends to reflect
correctly the trends in the behavior of the latter. However, there are regimes
where its behavior is not indicative of non-classicality: in particular, we
find an instance where MID increases with the application of noise, where we
expect a reduction of quantumness.
