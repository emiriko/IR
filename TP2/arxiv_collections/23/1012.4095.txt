Nucleon properties are modified in the nuclear medium. To understand these
modifications and their origin is a central issue in nuclear physics. For
example, a wide variety of QCD-based models, including quark-meson coupling and
chiral-quark soliton models, predict that the nuclear constituents change
properties with increasing density. These changes are predicted to lead to
observable changes in the nucleon structure functions and electromagnetic form
factors.
  We present results from a series of recent experiments at MAMI and Jefferson
Lab, which measured the proton recoil polarization in the 4He(e,e'p)3H reaction
to test these predictions. These results, with the most precise data at Q^2 =
0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and at 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 from E03-104, put strong constraints on
available model calculations, such that below Q^2 = 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 the measured
ratios of polarization-transfer are successfully described in a fully
relativistic calculation when including a medium modification of the proton
form factors or, alternatively, by strong charge-exchange final-state
interactions. We also discuss possible extensions of these studies with
measurements of the 4He(e,e'p)3H and 2H(e,e'p)n reactions as well as with the
neutron knockout in 4He(e,e'n)3He.
