We analyzed the observations of SGR 1806-20 performed with the \textit{Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer} (RXTE) during its 2004 giant flare. We studied the phase
evolution of the sub-pulses identified in the X-ray waveform and found that the
sub-pulses varied in phase with time and then gradually settled, which might
indicate drifts of the emission regions in relative to the neutron star
surface, or changes in the local emission geometry before the magnetic field
became stable. The characteristic e-folding timescale of the phase drifts
measured starting about 15 s following the initial flux spike are in the range
between 37 s and 84 s. This leads to the first measurements of the
characteristic timescale for the magnetic field of the neutron star to settle
after a field reconfiguration during the giant flare.
