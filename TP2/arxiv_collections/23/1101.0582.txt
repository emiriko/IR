The observation of high energy cosmic neutrinos can shed light on the
astrophysical sites and mechanisms involved in the acceleration of protons and
nuclei to the high energies observed at Earth by cosmic ray detectors. More
generally, high energy neutrinos can be a key instrument in the multimessenger
study of the high energy sky. Several neutrino telescopes of different sizes
and capabilities are presently taking data and projects to further increase
their size and sensitivity are underway.In this contribution we review the
present status of neutrino telescopes based on the cherenkov ligh detection
technique, their recent results and the plans to increase their sensitivity.
