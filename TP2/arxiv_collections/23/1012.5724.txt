We investigate the Nernst effect in a mesoscopic two-dimensional electron
system (2DES) at low magnetic fields, before the onset of Landau level
quantization. The overall magnitude of the Nernst signal agrees well with
semi-classical predictions. We observe reproducible mesoscopic fluctuations in
the signal which diminish significantly with an increase in temperature. We
also show that the Nernst effect exhibits an anomalous component which is
correlated with an oscillatory Hall effect. This behavior may be able to
distinguish between different spin-correlated states in the 2DES.
