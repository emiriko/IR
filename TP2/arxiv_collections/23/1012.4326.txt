The designed 2m propane bubble chambers(PBC) with modern power technologies
for PC and high precision digital photographic methods is a unique
multi-propose, competitive capable and higher-informative 4$\pi$ detector for
study of exotic multi-strange events with $V^0$($\Lambda,K^0_s$ and $\gamma$)
particles, light hyper-nucleus, ($V^0, V^0$) interactions and other
correlations (P02 J-PARC LOI). First from all of unbeatable privilege for PBC
are registration of multi-vertex or complex decay modes(with 10-50$\mu$m space
resolution), where is included of the beam area too. The acceptance of beam
area for detectors is crucial important for $\Lambda$ hyperon physics, because
more than 70% from $\Lambda$ hyperons are emitted in the beam area with azimuth
$\beta$ or polar angles $< 15^0$ in p+C reaction at 10 GeV/c.
  The observed well-known resonances $\Sigma^{0}$, $\Sigma^{*\pm}$(1385) and
$K^{*\pm}$(892) from PDG are good tests of this method. The subject of proposed
P02 project allow to explore of multi-strangeness in hadronic systems with
$V^0$ particles what are also included as P05,P07,P18, p22 and p027 approved
experiments by a missing mass method at J-PARC. New developed research
complexes NUCLATRON-M at JINR and J-PARC at JAEA(KEK) on base of progress in
digital technology for BC experimental method allow to obtain of a necessary
statistics in reasonable time, what inspire the optimism for establish exotic
states with $\Lambda$ and $K^0_s$ particles, which were observed more than 30
year historical periods from different old experiments with a poor statistics.
Only with high statistics or from many similarly old photographs without new
necessary acceptance, resolution and methods analysis there will not possible
to obtain of new information about these objects.
