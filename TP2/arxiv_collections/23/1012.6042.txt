Non-Abelian vortices are topologically stable objects in the color-flavor
locked (CFL) phase of dense QCD. We derive a dual Lagrangian starting with the
Ginzburg-Landau effective Lagrangian for the CFL phase, and obtain topological
interactions of non-Abelian vortices with quasiparticles such as $U(1)_B$
Nambu-Goldstone bosons (phonons) and massive gluons. We find that the phonons
couple to the translational zero modes of the vortices while the gluons couple
to their orientational zero modes in the internal space.
