In this work, we investigate wave transmission through an epsilon-near-zero
metamaterial waveguide embedded with defects. We show that by adjusting the
geometric sizes and material properties of the defects, total reflection and
even transmission can be obtained, despite the impedance mismatch of
epsilon-near-zero material with free space. Our work can greatly simplify the
design of zero-index material waveguide applications by removing the dependence
on permeability.
