Self-seeding options for the LCLS baseline were recently investigated using a
scheme which relies on a single-crystal monochromator in Bragg-transmission
geometry. The LCLS low-charge (0.02 nC) mode of operation was considered in
order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The wakefield
effects from the linac and from the undulator vacuum chamber are much reduced
at such low charge, and can be ignored. In this paper we extend our previous
investigations to the case of the LCLS mode of operation with nominal charge.
Based on the LCLS start-to-end simulation for an electron beam charge of 0.25
nC, and accounting for the wakefields from the undulator vacuum chamber we
demonstrate that the same simplest self-seeding system (two undulators with a
single-crystal monochromator in between) is appropriate not only for short (few
femtosecond) bunches, but for longer bunches too.
