This note provides an interim summary of the current recommendations of the
PDF4LHC working group for the use of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and
of PDF uncertainties at the LHC, for cross section and cross section
uncertainty calculations. It also contains a succinct user guide to the
computation of PDF uncertainties and correlations using available PDF sets.
  A companion note (the PDF4LHC Working Group Interim Report) summarizes
predictions for benchmark cross sections at the LHC (7 TeV) at NLO using modern
PDFs currently available from 6 PDF fitting groups.
