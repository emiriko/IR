In an SU(2) lattice gauge theory with a Z2 orbifolded extra dimension, the
new symmetry which is called as a stick symmetry is useful in understanding the
bulk transition. We discuss the relation with the Fradkin-Shenker's phase
diagram as well. A remnant of the extra dimension is remained as two U(1) gauge
symmetries in two 4-dimensional spaces. We also consider more general bulk
gauge groups beyond SU(2).
