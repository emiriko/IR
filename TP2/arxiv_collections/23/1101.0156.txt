Core-collapse supernova models depend on the details of the nuclear and weak
interaction physics inputs just as they depend on the details of the
macroscopic physics (transport, hydrodynamics, etc.), numerical methods, and
progenitors. We present preliminary results from our ongoing comparison studies
of nuclear and weak interaction physics inputs to core collapse supernova
models using the spherically-symmetric, general relativistic, neutrino
radiation hydrodynamics code Agile-Boltztran. We focus on comparisons of the
effects of the nuclear EoS and the effects of improving the opacities,
particularly neutrino--nucleon interactions.
