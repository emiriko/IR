We present results of a long-term spectroscopic monitoring program (since mid
2009) of Luminous Blue Variables with the new HERMES echelle spectrograph on
the 1.2 m Mercator telescope at La Palma (Spain). We investigate
high-resolution (R=80,000) optical spectra of two LBVs, P Cyg and HD 168607,
the LBV candidates MWC 930 and HD 168625, and the LBV binary MWC 314. In P Cyg
we observe flux changes in the violet wings of the Balmer H{\alpha}, H{\beta},
and He I lines between May and Sep 2009. The changes around 200 km/s to 300
km/s are caused by variable opacity at the base of the supersonic wind from the
blue supergiant. We observe in MWC 314 broad double-peaked metal emission lines
with invariable radial velocities over time. On the other hand, we measure in
the photospheric S II {\lambda}5647 absorption line, with lower excitation
energy of ~14 eV, an increase of the heliocentric radial velocity centroid from
37 km/s to 70 km/s between 5 and 10 Sep 2009 (and 43 km/s on 6 Apr 2010). The
increase of radial velocity of ~33 km/s in only 5 days can confirm the binary
nature of this LBV close to the Eddington luminosity limit. A comparison with
VLT-UVES and Keck-Hires spectra observed over the past 13 years reveals strong
flux variability in the violet wing of the H{\alpha} emission line of HD
168625, and in the absorption portion of the H{\beta} line of HD 168607. In HD
168625 we observe H{\alpha} wind absorption at velocities exceeding 200 km/s
which develops between Apr and June 2010.
