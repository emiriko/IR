We have performed the first measurement of the angular power spectrum in the
large-scale diffuse emission at energies from 1-50 GeV. We compared results
from data and a simulated model in order to identify significant differences in
anisotropy properties. We found angular power above the photon noise level in
the data at multipoles greater than ~ 100 for energies 1< E <10 GeV. The excess
power in the data suggests a contribution from a point source population not
present in the model.
