This article discusses the existence of solitary electromagnetic waves
trapped in a self-generated Langmuir wave and embedded in an infinitely long
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma. From
the mathematical point of view they are exact solutions of the 1-dimensional
relativistic cold fluid plasma model with nonvanishing boundary conditions.
Under the assumption of traveling wave solutions with velocity $V$ and vector
potential frequency $\omega$, the fluid model is reduced to a Hamiltonian
system. The solitary waves are homoclinic (grey solitons) or heteroclinic (dark
solitons) orbits to fixed points. By using a dynamical systems description of
the Hamiltonian system and a spectral method, we identify a great variety of
solitary waves, including asymmetric ones, discuss their disappearance for
certain parameter values, and classify them according to: (i) grey or dark
character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector potential envelope and (iii)
their symmetries. The solutions come in continuous families in the parametric
$V-\omega$ plane and extend up to velocities that approach the speed of light.
The stability of certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the
aid of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation for a
few tens of the inverse of the plasma frequency.
