Data on e+e- -> piplus-piminus-Upsilon(1S,2S,3S) show a large increase in
branching fractions near Upsilon(10860). A suggestion of Ali et al. is to
interpret this as evidence for a tetraquark, Yb(10890) = b-bbar. However, it
may also be interpreted in terms of Upsilon(10860) -> B-B*, B*B* and BsB*s
above the open-b threshold, followed by de-excitation processes such as $BB* ->
Upsilon (1S,2S,3S). In the charm sector, a hypothesis open to experimental test
is that X,Y and Z peaks in the mass range 3872 to 3945 MeV may all be due to
regular 3P1 and 3P2 c-cbar states (and perhaps 3P0) mixed with meson-meson.
