We use the secondary infall model described in Del Popolo (2009), which takes
into account the effect of dynamical friction, ordered and random angular
momentum, baryons adiabatic contraction and dark matter baryons interplay, to
study how in- ner slopes of relaxed LCDM dark matter (DM) halos with and
without baryons (baryons+DM, and pure DM) depend on redshift and on halo mass.
We apply the quoted method to structures on galactic scales and clusters of
galaxies scales. We find that the inner logarithmic density slope, of dark
matter halos with baryons has a significant dependence on halo mass and
redshift with slopes ranging from 0 for dwarf galaxies to 0.4 for objects of M
= 10^13M_solar and 0.94 for M = 10^15M_solar clusters of galaxies. Structures
slopes increase with increasing redshift and this trend reduces going from
galaxies to clusters. In the case of density profiles constituted just of dark
matter the mass and redshift dependence of slope is very slight. In this last
case, we used the Merrit et al. (2006) analysis who compared N-body density
profiles with various parametric models finding systematic variation in profile
shape with halo mass. This last analysis suggests that the galaxy-sized halos
obtained with our model have a different shape parameter, i.e. a different mass
distribution, than the cluster-sized halos, obtained with the same model. The
results of the present paper argue against universality of density profiles
constituted by dark matter and baryons and confirm claims of a systematic
variation in profile shape with halo mass, for dark matter halos.
