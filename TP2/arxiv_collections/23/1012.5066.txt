We consider adaptive system identification problems with convex constraints
and propose a family of regularized Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithms. We show
that with a properly selected regularization parameter the regularized LMS
provably dominates its conventional counterpart in terms of mean square
deviations. We establish simple and closed-form expressions for choosing this
regularization parameter. For identifying an unknown sparse system we propose
sparse and group-sparse LMS algorithms, which are special examples of the
regularized LMS family. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed filters in both convergence rate and steady-state error under sparsity
assumptions on the true coefficient vector.
