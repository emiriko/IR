The stability of excited superheavy nuclei (SHN) with $100 \leq Z \leq 134$
against neutron emission and fission is investigated by using a statistical
model. In particular, a systematic study of the survival probability against
fission in the 1n-channel of these SHN is made. In present calculations the
neutron separation energies and shell correction energies are consistently
taken from the calculated results of the finite range droplet model which
predicts an island of stability of SHN around Z=115 and N=179. It turns out
that this island of stability persists for excited SHN in the sense that the
calculated survival probabilities in the 1n-channel of excited SHN at the
optimal excitation energy are maximized around Z=115 and N=179. This indicates
that the survival probability in the 1n-channel is mainly determined by the
nuclear shell effects.
