The growth of world population, limitation of resources, economic problems
and environmental issues force engineers to develop increasingly efficient
solutions for logistic systems. Pure optimization for efficiency, however, has
often led to technical solutions that are vulnerable to variations in supply
and demand, and to perturbations. In contrast, nature already provides a large
variety of efficient, flexible and robust logistic solutions. Can we utilize
biological principles to design systems, which can flexibly adapt to hardly
predictable, fluctuating conditions? We propose a bio-inspired "BioLogistics"
approach to deduce dynamic organization processes and principles of adaptive
self-control from biological systems, and to transfer them to man-made
logistics (including nanologistics), using principles of modularity,
self-assembly, self-organization, and decentralized coordination. Conversely,
logistic models can help revealing the logic of biological processes at the
systems level.
