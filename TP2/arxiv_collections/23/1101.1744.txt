In this paper we apply the equation of state (EOS) of QCD at finite chemical
potential and zero temperature proposed in H. S. Zong and W. M. Sun [Int. J.
Mod. Phys. {\bf A23}, 3591 (2008)] to the study of properties of quark star.
This EOS contains only one adjustable parameter $m_D$ which sets the scale of
chiral symmetry breaking (in our calculation we have chosen two values of
$m_D$: $m_D=244 MeV$ and $m_D=239 MeV$, which is fitted from the value of
$f_\pi$ and determined by $e^+ e^-$ annihilation experiment, respectively).
From this EOS a model of quark star is established by applying the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation under two conditions: with the $P(\mu=0)$
term and without the $P(\mu=0)$ term. Our results show clearly that the
$P(\mu=0)$ term is an important quantity in the study of quark star. A
comparison between our model and other models of quark star is made. In
particular, we have compared our results with the most recent observational
data measured using Shapiro delay reported in P.B. Demorest et al. [Nature
(London) {\bf 467}, 1081 (2010)].
