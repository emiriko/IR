In this contribution we briefly review recent developments in the theory of
long-range integrable spin chains. These spin chains constitute a natural
generalisation of the well-studied integrable nearest-neighbour chains and are
of particular relevance to the integrability in the AdS/CFT correspondence
since the dilatation operator in the asymptotic region is conjectured to be a
Hamiltonian of an integrable long-range psu spin chain.
