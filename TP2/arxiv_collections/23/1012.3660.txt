We propose a hybrid approach to the experimental assessment of the genuine
quantum features of a general system consisting of microscopic and macroscopic
parts. We infer entanglement by combining dichotomic measurements on a
bidimensional system and phase-space inference through the Wigner distribution
associated with the macroscopic component of the state. As a benchmark, we
investigate the feasibility of our proposal in a bipartite-entangled state
composed of a single-photon and a multiphoton field. Our analysis shows that,
under ideal conditions, maximal violation of a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-based
inequality is achievable regardless of the number of photons in the macroscopic
part of the state. The difficulty in observing entanglement when losses and
detection inefficiency are included can be overcome by using a hybrid
entanglement witness that allows efficient correction for losses in the
few-photon regime.
