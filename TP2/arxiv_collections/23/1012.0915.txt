Jets are found in a variety of astrophysical sources, from young stellar
objects to active galactic nuclei. In all the cases the jet propagates with a
supersonic velocity through the external medium, which can be inhomogeneous,
and inhomogeneities could penetrate into the jet. The interaction of the jet
material with an obstacle produces a bow shock in the jet in which particles
can be accelerated up to relativistic energies and emit high-energy photons. In
this work, we explore the active galactic nuclei scenario, focusing on the
dynamical and radiative consequences of the interaction at different jet
heights. We find that the produced high-energy emission could be detectable by
the current gamma-ray telescopes. In general, the jet-clump interactions are a
possible mechanism to produce (steady or flaring) high-energy emission in many
astrophysical sources in which jets are present.
