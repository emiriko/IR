We investigated the homogeneous coexistence of spin-density-wave (SDW) and
superconducting (SC) states via 75As-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in
CaFe(1-x)Co(x)AsF and found that the electronic and magnetic properties of this
compound are intermediate between those of LaFeAsO(1-x)F(x) and
Ba(Fe(1-x)Co(x))2As2. For 6% Co-doped samples, the paramagnetic spectral weight
completely disappears in the crossover regime between the SDW and SC phases
followed by the anomalous behavior of relaxation rate (1/T1), implying that the
two phases are not segregated. The 59Co-NMR spectra show that spin moments are
not commensurate but spatially modulated. These experimental results suggest
that incommensurate SDW (IC-SDW) and SC states are compatible in this compound.
