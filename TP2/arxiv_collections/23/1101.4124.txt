We investigate with the aid of numerical renormalization group techniques the
thermoelectric properties of a molecular quantum dot described by the
negative-U Anderson model. We show that the charge Kondo effect provides a
mechanism for enhanced thermoelectric power via a correlation induced asymmetry
in the spectral function close to the Fermi level. We show that this effect
results in a dramatic enhancement of the Kondo induced peak in the thermopower
of negative-U systems with Seebeck coefficients exceeding 50$\mu V/K$ over a
wide range of gate voltages.
