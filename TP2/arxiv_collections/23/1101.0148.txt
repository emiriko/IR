We present precision results for distributions in global event shapes that
can be measured at hadron colliders within experimental limitations. These
predictions are obtained by combining exact next-to-leading order (NLO) with
the all-order resummation of large logarithms of soft and collinear origin. We
then discuss how event-shape measurements can be used for the tuning of Monte
Carlo event generators, for tests of models of hadronisation and underlying
event, and as discriminatory tools between QCD jet-like and New Physics events.
