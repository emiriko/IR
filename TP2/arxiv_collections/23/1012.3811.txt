We have measured the electrically detected magnetic resonance of
channel-implanted donors in silicon field-effect transistors in resonant X-
($9.7\:$GHz) and W-band ($94\:$GHz) microwave cavities, with corresponding
Zeeman fields of $0.35\:$T and $3.36\:$T, respectively. It is found that the
conduction electron resonance signal increases by two orders of magnitude from
X- to W-band, while the hyperfine-split donor resonance signals are enhanced by
over one order of magnitude. We rule out a bolometric origin of the resonance
signals, and find that direct spin-dependent scattering between the
two-dimensional electron gas and neutral donors is inconsistent with the
experimental observations. We propose a new polarization transfer model from
the donor to the conduction electrons as the main contributer to the spin
resonance signals observed.
