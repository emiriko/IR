The Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA) arises from the relativistic conformal
algebra in the non-relativistic limit. In two dimensions, one can view it as a
limit of linear combinations of the two copies Virasoro algebra. Recently, it
has been argued that Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) realizes the quantum
2d GCA in a particular scaling limit of the gravitational Chern-Simons term. To
add strength to this claim, we demonstrate a matching of correlation functions
on both sides of this correspondence. A priori looking for spatially dependent
correlators seems to force us to deal with high spin operators in the bulk. We
get around this difficulty by constructing the non-relativistic Energy-Momentum
tensor and considering its correlation functions. On the gravity side, our
analysis makes heavy use of recent results of Holographic Renormalization in
Topologically Massive Gravity.
