The symmetry studies of Maxwell equations gave new insight on the nature of
electromagnetic (EM) field. It has in general case quaternion single structure,
consisting of four independent field constituents, which differ with each other
by the parities under space inversion and time reversal. Generalized Maxwell
equations for quaternion four-component EM-field are obtained. Invariants for
EM-field, consisting of dually symmetric parts are found. It is shown, that
there exists physical conserving quantity, which is simultaneously invariant
under both Rainich dual and additional hyperbolic dual symmetry transformation
of Maxwell equations. It is spin in general case and spirality in the geometry,
when electrical and magnetic vectors $\vec{E}$, $\vec{H}$ are directed along
coordinate axes in ($\vec{E}$, $\vec{H}$) functional space. It is additional
proof for quaternion four component structure of EM-field to be a single whole.
Canonical Dirac quantization method is developed in two aspects. The first
aspect is its application the only to observable quantities. The second aspect
is the realization along with well known time-local quantization of space-local
quantization and space-time-local quantization. It is also shown, that Coulomb
field can be quantized in 1D and 2D systems. New model of photons is proposed.
The photons in quantized EM-field are main excitations in oscillator structure
of EM-field, which is equivalent to spin S = 1 "boson-atomic" structure, like
matematically to well known spin S = 1 boson matter structure - carbon atomic
backbone chain structure in many conjugated polymers. They have two kind
nature. The photons of the first kind and the second kind represent themselves
respectively neutral chargeless EM-solitons and charged spinless EM-solitons of
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger family.
