The question how the spin of the nucleon is distributed among its quark and
gluon constituents is still a subject of intense investigations. Lattice QCD
has progressed to provide information about spin fractions and orbital angular
momentum contributions for up- and down-quarks in the proton, at a typical
scale \mu^2~4 GeV^2. On the other hand, chiral quark models have traditionally
been used for orientation at low momentum scales. In the comparison of such
model calculations with experiment or lattice QCD, fixing the model scale and
the treatment of scale evolution are essential. In this paper, we present a
refined model calculation and a QCD evolution of lattice results up to
next-to-next-to-leading order. We compare this approach with the Myhrer-Thomas
scenario for resolving the proton spin puzzle.
