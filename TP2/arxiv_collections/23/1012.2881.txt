We propose the dual gravity of a non conformal gauge theory which has
logarithmic running of couplings in the IR but becomes almost conformal in the
far UV. The theory has matter in fundamental representation, non-zero
temperature and under a cascade of Seiberg dualities, can be described in terms
of gauge groups of lower and lower rank. We outline the procedure of
holographic renormalization and propose a mechanism to UV complete the gauge
theory by modifying the dual geometry at large radial distances. As an example,
we construct the brane configuration and sources required to attach a
Klebanov-Witten type geometry at large r to a Klebanov- Strassler type geometry
at small r. Using the supergravity description for the dual geometry, we
compute thermal mass of a fundamental 'quark' in our theory along with drag and
diffusion coefficients of the gauge theory plasma. We compute the stress tensor
of the gauge theory and formulate the wake a probe leaves behind as it
traverses the medium. Transport coefficient shear viscosity {\eta} and its
ratio to entropy {\eta}/s are calculated and finally we show how confinement of
'quarks' at large separation can occur at low temperatures. We classify the
most general dual geometry that gives rise to linear confinement at low
temperatures and show how quarkonium states can melt at high temperatures to
liberate 'quarks'.
