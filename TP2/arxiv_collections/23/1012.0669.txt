The Gel'fand-Shilov spaces of type S are considered as topological algebras
with respect to the Moyal star product and their corresponding algebras of
multipliers are defined and investigated. In contrast to the well-studied case
of Schwartz's space S, these multipliers are allowed to have nonpolynomial
growth or infinite order singularities. The Moyal multiplication is thereby
extended to certain classes of ultradistributions, hyperfunctions, and analytic
functionals. The main theorem of the paper characterizes those elements of the
dual of a given test function space that are the Moyal multipliers of this
space. The smallest nontrivial Fourier-invariant space in the scale of S-type
spaces is shown to play a special role, because its corresponding Moyal
multiplier algebra contains the largest algebra of functions for which the
power series defining their star products are absolutely convergent.
Furthermore, it contains analogous algebras associated with cone-shaped
regions, which can be used to formulate a causality condition in quantum field
theory on noncommutative space-time.
