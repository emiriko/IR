The magnetic form factor of YbInNi4 has been determined via the flipping
ratios R with polarized neutron diffraction and the scattering function S(Q,w)
was measured in an inelastic neutron scattering experiment. Both experiments
were performed with the aim to determine the crystal-field scheme. The magnetic
form factor clearly excludes the possibility of a \Gamma7 doublet as the ground
state. The inelastic neutron data exhibit two, almost equally strong peaks at
3.2 meV and 4.4 meV which points, in agreement with earlier neutron data,
towards a \Gamma8 quartet ground state. Further possibilities like a
quasi-quartet ground state are discussed.
