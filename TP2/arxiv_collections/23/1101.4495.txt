The main theme of this paper is to study for a symplectomorphism of a compact
surface, the asymptotic invariant which is defined to be the growth rate of the
sequence of the total dimensions of symplectic Floer homologies of the iterates
of the symplectomorphism. We prove that the asymptotic invariant coincides with
asymptotic Nielsen number and with asymptotic absolute Lefschetz number. We
also show that the asymptotic invariant coincides with the largest dilatation
of the pseudo-Anosov components of the symplectomorphism and its logarithm
coincides with the topological entropy. This implies that symplectic zeta
function has a positive radius of convergence.This also establishes a
connection between Floer homology and geometry of 3-manifolds.
