In this letter, we have considered a flat FRW universe. Instead of
considering only one candidate for dark energy, we have considered interaction
between phantom field and modified Chaplygin gas. It has been shown that the
potential of the phantom field increases from a lower value with evolution of
the Universe. It has been observed that, the field has an increasing tendency
and potential has also an increasing tendency with passage of cosmic time. In
the evolution of the universe the crossing of $w=-1$ has been realized by this
interacting model.
