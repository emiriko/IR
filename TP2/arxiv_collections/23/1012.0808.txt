We make a detailed study of the first and second-order SUSY partners of a
one-dimensional free Hamiltonian with a singular perturbation proportional to a
Dirac delta function. It is shown that the second-order transformations
increase the spectral manipulation possibilities offered by the standard
first-order supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
