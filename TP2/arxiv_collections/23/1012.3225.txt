We extend our approach to incorporate the proton-proton (pp) Coulomb force
into the three-nucleon (3N) momentum-space Faddeev calculations of elastic
proton-deuteron (pd) scattering and breakup to the case when also a
three-nucleon force (3NF) is acting. In addition we formulate that approach in
the application to electron- and gamma-induced reactions on 3He. The main new
ingredient is a 3-dimensional screened pp Coulomb t-matrix obtained by a
numerical solution of a 3-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation (LSE). The
resulting equations have the same structure as the Faddeev equations which
describe pd scattering without 3NF acting. That shows the practical feasibility
of both presented formulations.
