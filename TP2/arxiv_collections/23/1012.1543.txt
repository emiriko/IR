Reactions that involve the direct and sudden removal of a pair of like or
unlike nucleons from a fast projectile beam by a light target nucleus are
considered. Specifically, we study the three two-nucleon removal channels from
$^{12}${C} that populate final states in the $^{10}${Be}, $^{10}${B} and
$^{10}${C} reaction residues. The calculated two-nucleon removal cross sections
and the residue momentum distributions are compared with available high energy
data at 250, 1050 and 2010 MeV per nucleon, data that are inclusive with
respect to the bound final-states of the residues. The measured $np$-removal
cross sections only are significantly greater than the values calculated,
suggesting that the reaction mechanism observes enhanced $np$ spatial
correlations compared to those present in the shell-model wave functions.
