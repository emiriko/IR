We are at the verge of a new impact from hypernuclear experiments planned or
already operative at various laboratories all over the world. The complementary
of these different experimental approaches to hypernuclei provides a wide basis
for a comprehensive understanding of strange hadrons in cold hadronic matter.
High precision studies of light $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, spectroscopy of double
$\Lambda\Lambda$ nuclei and the properties of antihyperons in nuclei are
examples for the outstanding challenges for hypernuclei research in the next
decade.
