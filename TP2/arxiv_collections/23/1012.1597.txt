We discuss the effective theory appropriate for studying soft leptogenesis at
temperatures T>10^7 GeV. In this regime, the main source of the B-L asymmetry
is the CP asymmetry of a new anomalous R-charge that couple to generalized
anomalous electroweak processes. Baryogenesis thus occurs mainly through
R-genesis, and with an efficiency that can be up to two orders of magnitude
larger than in usual estimates. Contrary to common belief, a sizeable baryon
asymmetry is generated also when thermal corrections to the CP asymmetries in
sneutrino decays are neglected which, in soft leptogenesis, implyes vanishing
lepton-flavour CP asymmetries. We present general Boltzmann equations for soft
leptogenesis that are valid in all temperature regimes.
