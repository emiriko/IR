Let G_p denote the tail function of Student's distribution with p degrees of
freedom. It is shown that the ratio G_q(x)/G_p(x) is decreasing in x>0 for any
p and q such that 0<p<q\le\infty. Therefore, G_q(x)<G_p(x) for all such p and q
and all x>0. Corollaries on the monotonicity of (generalized) moments and
ratios thereof are also given.
