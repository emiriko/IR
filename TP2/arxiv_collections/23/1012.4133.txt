The cobalt and iron clusters CoN, FeN (20 < N < 150) measured in a cryogenic
molecular beam are found to be bistable with magnetic moments per atom both
{\mu}N/N 2{\mu}B in the ground states and {\mu}N */N {\mu}B in the metastable
excited states (for iron clusters, {\mu}N ~3N{\mu}B and {\mu}N* N{\mu}B). This
energy gap between the two states vanish for large clusters, which explains the
rapid convergence of the magnetic moments to the bulk value and suggests that
ground state for the bulk involves a superposition of the two, in line with the
fluctuating local orders in the bulk itinerant ferromagnetism.
