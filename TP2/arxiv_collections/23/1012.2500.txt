The chirally rotated Schroedinger functional provides a test bed for
universality and automatic O(a) improvement. We here report on extensive
quenched simulations of lattice QCD with Wilson quarks in the massless limit.
We demonstrate that, after proper tuning of a dimension 3 boundary counterterm,
the expected chirally rotated boundary conditions are indeed obtained. This
implies automatic O(a) improvement which we then verify in a few examples.
Universality of properly renormalized correlation functions is confirmed by
comparing to the standard set-up of the Schroedinger functional. As a
by-product of this study the non-singlet current renormalisation constants Z_A
and Z_V are obtained from ratios of 2-point functions.
