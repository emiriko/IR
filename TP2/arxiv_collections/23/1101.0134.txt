We first review the methods for determining gamma from B->D K decays that
appeared after CKM 2008. We then discuss the theoretical errors in gamma
extraction. The errors due to neglected D-Dbar and B_{d,s}-Bbar_{d,s} mixing
can be avoided by including their effects in the fits. The ultimate theoretical
error is then given by electroweak corrections that we estimate to give a shift
delta gamma/gamma O(10^-6).
