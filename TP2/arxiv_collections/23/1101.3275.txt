We discuss a model for quantum computing with initially mixed states.
Although such a computer is known to be less powerful than a quantum computer
operating with pure (entangled) states, it may efficiently solve some problems
for which no efficient classical algorithms are known. We suggest a new
implementation of quantum computation with initially mixed states in which an
algorithm realization is achieved by means of optimal basis independent
transformations of qubits.
