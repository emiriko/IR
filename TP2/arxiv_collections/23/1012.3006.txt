In this paper, we study eigenvalues of the poly-Laplacian with arbitrary
order on a bounded domain in an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space and obtain a
lower bound for eigenvalues, which gives an important improvement of results
due to Levine and Protter. In particular, the result of Melas is included here.
