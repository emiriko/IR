Current experimental data on the neutrino parameters is in good agreement
with tribimaximal mixing and may indicate the presence of an underlying family
symmetry. For 76 flavor groups, we perform a systematic scan for models: The
particle content is that of the Standard Model plus up to three flavon fields,
and the effective Lagrangian contains all terms of mass dimension <=6. We find
that 44 groups can accommodate models that are consistent with experiment at 3
sigma, and 38 groups can have models that are tribimaximal. For one particular
group, we look at correlations between the mixing angles and make a prediction
for theta13 that will be testable in the near future. We present the details of
a model with theta12=33.9, theta23=40.9, theta13=5.1 to show that the recent
tentative hints of a non-zero theta13 can easily be accommodated. The smallest
group for which we find tribimaximal mixing is T7. We argue that T7 and T13 are
as suited to produce tribimaximal mixing as A4 and should therefore be
considered on equal footing. In the appendices, we present some new
mathematical methods and results that may prove useful for future model
building efforts.
