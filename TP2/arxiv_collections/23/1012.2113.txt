We consider the pseudocritical temperatures for the chiral and deconfinement
transitions within a Polyakov-loop Dyson-Schwinger equation approach which
employs a nonlocal rank-2 separable model for the effective gluon propagator.
These pseudocritical temperatures differ by a factor of two when the quark and
gluon sectors are considered separately, but get synchronized and become
coincident when their coupling is switched on. The coupling of the
Polyakov-loop to the chiral quark dynamics narrows the temperature region of
the QCD transition in which chiral symmetry and deconfinement is established.
We investigate the effect of rescaling the parameter T_0 in the Polyakov-loop
potential on the QCD transition for both the logarithmic and polynomial forms
of the potential. While the critical temperatures vary in a similar way, the
width of the transition is stronger affected for the logarithmic potential. For
this potential the character of the transition changes from crossover to a
first order one when T_0 < 210 MeV, but it remains crossover in the whole range
of relevant T_0 values for the polynomial form.
