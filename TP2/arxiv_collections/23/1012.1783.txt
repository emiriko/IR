We study neutrinoless double beta decay of several isotopes with
state-of-the-art beyond self-consistent mean field methods to compute the
nuclear matrix elements (NME). Generating coordinate method with particle
number and angular momentum projection (GCM+PNAMP) is used for finding mother
and granddaughter states and evaluating transition operators between different
nuclei. We analyze explicitly the role of the deformation, pairing and
configuration mixing in the evaluation of the NME.
