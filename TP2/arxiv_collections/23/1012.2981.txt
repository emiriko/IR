We present perturbative and non-perturbative results on the renormalization
constants of the local and one-derivative vector and axial vector operators.
Non-perturbative results are obtained using the twistedmassWilson fermion
formulation employing two degenerate dynamical quarks and the tree-level
Symanzik improved gluon action for pion masses in the range of about 450-260
MeV and at there values of the lattice spacing, namely 0.055 fm, 0.070 fm and
0.089 fm. Subtraction of O(a^2) terms is carried out by performing the
perturbative evaluation of these operators at 1- loop and up to O(a^2). The
renormalization conditions are defined in the RI'-MOM scheme, for both
perturbative and non-perturbative results. The Z-factors, obtained for
different values of the renormalization scale, are evolved perturbatively to a
reference scale set by the inverse of the lattice spacing. In addition, they
are translated to MS-bar at 2 GeV using 3-loop perturbative results for the
conversion factors.
