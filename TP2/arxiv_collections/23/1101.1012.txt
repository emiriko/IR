We derive two new retarded solutions in the teleparallel theory equivalent to
general relativity (TEGR). One of these solutions gives a divergent energy.
Therefore, we used the regularized expression of the gravitational
energy-momentum tensor, which is a coordinate dependent. A detailed analysis of
the loss of the mass of Bondi space-time is carried out using the flux of the
gravitational energy-momentum.
