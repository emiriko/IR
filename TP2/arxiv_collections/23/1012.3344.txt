We fabricate and characterize a three-dimensional polarization-independent
invisibility cloak operating at visible wavelengths of light. The required
drastic miniaturization has become possible by employing
stimulated-emission-depletion inspired direct-laser-writing optical lithography
with conceptually diffraction-unlimited axial and lateral resolution.
