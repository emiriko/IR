We study the elastic scattering of light in pure KDP crystals and KDP
crystals with incorporated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. It is shown that the
optical quality of the crystals decreases insufficiently for the used
concentrations of nanoparticles. A mathematical model of the experimental setup
for light scattering measurements in low-dispersion media is developed and
discussed. The propagation function of the experimental setup is given in
analytical form. The relevance of the model is verified with the use of
experimental scattering data.
