We present the statistical properties of the first version of the Cold Core
Catalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO), in terms of their spatial distribution,
temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. We also describe the statistics of
the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC, delivered with the Early Release Compact
Source Catalogue, ERCSC) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detections
of the complete catalogue. We have used the CoCoCoDeT algorithm to extract
10783 cold sources. Temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} values
are derived using the fluxes in the IRAS 100 \mum band and the three highest
frequency Planck bands. Temperature spans from 7K to 17K, and peaks around 13K.
Data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the all
temperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,
and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(T) and the
effect of multiple T components folded into the measurements. For one third of
the objects the distances are obtained. Most of the detections are within 2 kpc
in the Solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. The
cores are distributed from the deep Galactic plane, despite the confusion, to
high latitudes (>30$^{\circle}$). The associated mass estimates range from 1 to
$10^5$ solar masses. Using their physical properties these cold sources are
shown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structures
between clouds and cores. These cold clumps are not isolated but mostly
organized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. The Cold Core
Catalogue of Planck Objects (C3PO) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue of
cold objects. It gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties of
these potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for their
classification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.
