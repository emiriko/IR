We demonstrate terahertz (THz) imaging and spectroscopy of a 15x15-mm^2
single-layer graphene film on Si using broadband THz pulses. The THz images
clearly map out the THz carrier dynamics of the graphene-on-Si sample, allowing
us to measure sheet conductivity with sub-mm resolution without fabricating
electrodes. The THz carrier dynamics are dominated by intraband transitions and
the THz-induced electron motion is characterized by a flat spectral response. A
theoretical analysis based on the Fresnel coefficients for a metallic thin film
shows that the local sheet conductivity varies across the sample from {\sigma}s
= 1.7x10^-3 to 2.4x10^-3 {\Omega}^-1 (sheet resistance, {\rho}s = 420 - 590
{\Omega}/sq).
