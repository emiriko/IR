The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS) is an ambitious project that
is observing all known Galactic O stars with B < 13 in the blue-violet part of
the spectrum with R-2500. It is based on version 2 of the most complete catalog
to date of Galactic O stars with accurate spectral types (v1, Ma\'iz
Apell\'aniz et al. 2004 ;v2, Sota et al. 2008). Given the large amount of data
that we are getting (more than 150 nights of observations at three different
observatories in the last 4 years) we have developed an automatic spectroscopic
reduction pipeline. This pipeline has been programmed in IDL and automates the
process of data reduction. It can operate in two modes: automatic data
reduction (quicklook) or semi-automatic data reduction (full). In "quicklook",
we are able to get rectified and calibrated spectra of all stars of a full
night just minutes after the observations. The pipeline automatically
identifies the type of image and applies the standard reduction procedure (bias
subtraction, flat field correction, application of bad pixel mask, ...). It
also extracts all spectra of the stars in one image (including close visual
binaries), aligns and merges all spectra of the same star (to increase the
signal to noise ratio and to correct defects such as cosmic rays), calibrates
in wavelength and rectifies the continuum. The same operations are performed in
full mode, but allowing the user to adjust the parameters used in the process.
