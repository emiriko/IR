Results on beam tests of 3D silicon pixel sensors aimed at the ATLAS
Insertable-B-Layer and High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)) upgrades are presented.
Measurements include charge collection, tracking efficiency and charge sharing
between pixel cells, as a function of track incident angle, and were performed
with and without a 1.6 T magnetic field oriented as the ATLAS Inner Detector
solenoid field. Sensors were bump bonded to the front-end chip currently used
in the ATLAS pixel detector. Full 3D sensors, with electrodes penetrating
through the entire wafer thickness and active edge, and double-sided 3D sensors
with partially overlapping bias and read-out electrodes were tested and showed
comparable performance.
