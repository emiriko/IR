Introducing a surface layer of matter on the edge of a neutron star in slow
rigid rotation, we analyze, from an intrinsic point of view, the junction
conditions that must be satisfied between the interior and exterior solutions
of the Einstein equations. In our model the core-\textit{crust} transition
pressure arise as an essential parameter in the description of a configuration.
As an application of this formalism, we describe giant \textit{glitches} of the
Vela pulsar as a result of variations in the transition pressure, finding that
these small changes are compatible with the expected temperature variations of
the inner crust during \textit{glitch} time.
