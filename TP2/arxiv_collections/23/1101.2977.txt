The neutron-deuteron (nd) scattering is solved in the Faddeev formalism,
employing the energy-independent version of the quark-model baryon-baryon
interaction fss2. The differential cross sections and the spin polarization of
the elastic scattering up to the neutron incident energy $E_n=65$ MeV are well
reproduced without reinforcing fss2 with the three-body force. The vector
analyzing-power of the neutron, $A_y(\theta)$, in the energy region $E_n$ < 25
MeV is largely improved in comparison with the predictions by the
meson-exchange potentials, thus yielding a partial solution of the
long-standing $A_y$-puzzle owing to the nonlocality of the short-range
repulsion produced by the quark-model baryon-baryon interaction. The large
Coulomb effect in the vector and tensor analyzing-powers in $E_n$ < 10 MeV is
also analyzed based on the Vincent and Phatak method and recent detailed
studies by other authors.
