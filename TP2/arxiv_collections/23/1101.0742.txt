We propose lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals (LCLCs) as a distinct class of
materials for organic electronics. In water, the chromonic molecules stack on
top of each other into elongated aggregates that form orientationally ordered
phases. The aligned aggregated structure is preserved when the material is
deposited onto a substrate and dried. The dried LCLC films show a strongly
anisotropic electric conductivity of semiconductor type. The field-effect
carrier mobility measured along the molecular aggregates in unoptimized films
of LCLC V20 is 0.03 cm^2 V^(-1) s^(-1). Easy processibility, low cost, and high
mobility demonstrate the potential of LCLCs for microelectronic applications.
