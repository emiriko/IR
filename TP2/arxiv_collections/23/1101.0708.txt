We study a system formed by soft colloidal spheres attracting each other via
a square-well potential, using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of various
nature. The softness is implemented through a reduction of the infinite part of
the repulsive potential to a finite one. For sufficiently low values of the
penetrability parameter we find the system to be Ruelle stable with square-well
like behavior. For high values of the penetrability the system is
thermodynamically unstable and collapses into an isolated blob formed by a few
clusters each containing many overlapping particles. For intermediate values of
the penetrability the system has a rich phase diagram with a partial lack of
thermodynamic consistency.
