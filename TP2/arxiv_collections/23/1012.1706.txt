There have been of late renewed debates on the role of inhomogeneities to
explain the observed late acceleration of the universe. We have looked into the
problem analytically with the help of the well known spherically symmetric but
inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi(LTB) model generalised to higher
dimensions. It is observed that in contrast to the claim made by Kolb et al the
presence of inhomogeneities as well as extra dimensions can not reverse the
signature of the deceleration parameter if the matter field obeys the energy
conditions. The well known Raychaudhuri equation also points to the same
result. Without solving the field equations explicitly it can, however, be
shown that although the total deceleration is positive everywhere nevertheless
it does not exclude the possibility of having radial acceleration, even in the
pure dust universe, if the angular scale factor is decelerating fast enough and
vice versa. Moreover it is found that introduction of extra dimensions can not
reverse the scenario. To the contrary it actually helps the decelerating
process.
