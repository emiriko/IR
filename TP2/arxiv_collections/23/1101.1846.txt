The future of high-performance computing is aligning itself towards the
efficient use of highly parallel computing environments. One application where
the use of massive parallelism comes instinctively is Monte Carlo simulations,
where a large number of independent events have to be simulated. At the core of
the Monte Carlo simulation lies the Random Number Generator (RNG). In this
paper, the massively parallel implementation of a collection of pseudo-random
number generators on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. The results
of the GPU implementation, in terms of samples/s, effective bandwidth and
operations per second, are presented. A comparison with other implementations
on different hardware platforms, in terms of samples/s, power efficiency and
cost-benefit, is also presented. Random numbers generation throughput of up to
~18MSamples/s have been achieved on the graphics hardware used. Efficient
hardware utilization, in terms of operations per second, has reached ~98% of
the possible integer operation throughput.
