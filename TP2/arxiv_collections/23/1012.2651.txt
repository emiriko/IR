Measurements of D0 meson strong-phase parameters in quantum-correlated
psi(3770) -> D0 D0bar decays by the CLEO collaboration are presented. These
measurements play an important role in the determination of the unitarity
triangle angle gamma/phi3 from B-meson decays. Measurements of the strong-phase
parameters for D0->K0 pi+ pi-, D0 -> K0 K+ K-, D0 -> K- pi+ pi0, and D0 -> K-
pi+ pi+ pi- decays are described along with their impact on the determination
of gamma/phi3.
