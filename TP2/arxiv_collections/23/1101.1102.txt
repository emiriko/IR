A kinetic model of gravimagnetic shock waves (GMSW) in a locally anisotropic
plasma is investigated. The equations of a drift approximation are written, and
the moments of the distribution function are calculated. Solutions of the drift
equations for a highly anisotropic ultrarelativistic plasma are found. It is
shown that in this case the GMSW essentially affect the angular characteristics
and the intensity of the magneto - bremsstrahlung of the magnetoactive plasma.
