Recent experiments show that spin thermoelectrics is a promising approach to
generate spin voltages. While spin chemical potentials are often limited to a
surface layer of the order of the spin diffusion length, we show that
thermoelectrically induced spin chemical potentials can extend much further in
itinerant ferromagnets with paramagnetic impurities. In some cases,
conservation laws, e.g., for a combination of spin and heat currents, give rise
to a linear spin voltage profile. More generally, we find quasilinear profiles
involving a spin thermoelectric length scale which far exceeds the spin
diffusion length.
