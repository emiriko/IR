We consider the influence of a noncommutative space on the Klein-Gordon and
the Dirac oscillators. The nonrelativistic limit is taken and the
$\theta$-modified Hamiltonians are determined. The corrections of these
Hamiltonians on the energy levels are evaluated in first-order perturbation
theory. It is observed a total lifting of the degeneracy to the considered
levels. Such effects are similar to the Zeeman splitting in a commutative
space.
