Paper I of the series re-derived the radio interferometry measurement
equation (RIME) from first principles, and extended the Jones formalism to the
full-sky case, incorporating direction-dependent effects (DDEs). This paper
aims to describe both classical radio interferometric calibration (selfcal and
related methods), and the recent developments in the treatment of DDEs, using
the RIME-based mathematical framework developed in Paper I. It also aims to
demonstrate the ease with which the various effects can be described and
understood.
  The first section of this paper uses the RIME formalism to describe
self-calibration, both with a full RIME, and with the approximate equations of
older software packages, and shows how this is affected by DDEs. The second
section gives an overview of real-life DDEs and proposed methods of dealing
with them. This results in a formal RIME-based description and comparison of
existing and proposed approaches to the problem of DDEs.
