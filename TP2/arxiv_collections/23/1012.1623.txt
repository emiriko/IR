This paper presents a creativity support tool, called FreePub, to collect and
organize scientific material using mindmaps. Mindmaps are visual, graph-based
represenations of concepts, ideas, notes, tasks, etc. They generally take a
hierarchical or tree branch format, with ideas branching into their
subsections. FreePub supports creativity cycles. A user starts such a cycle by
setting up her domain of interest using mindmaps. Then, she can browse mindmaps
and launch search tasks to gather relevant publications from several data
sources. FreePub, besides publications, identifies helpful supporting material
(e.g., blog posts, presentations). All retrieved information from FreePub can
be imported and organized in mindmaps. FreePub has been fully implemented on
top of FreeMind, a popular open-source, mindmapping tool.
