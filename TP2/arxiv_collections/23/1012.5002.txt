We treat the bremsstrahlung induced by initial electron beam in converter,
and the production of a desirable radio-isotope due to the photo-nuclear
reaction caused by this bremsstrahlung. By way of illustration, the yield of a
number of some, the most in practice applicable, radio-isotopes is evaluated.
The acquired findings persuade us that usage of modern electron accelerators
offers a practicable way to produce the radio-isotopes needful nowadays for
various valuable applications in the nuclear medicine.
