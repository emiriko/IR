We explore the nature of the bulk transition observed at strong coupling in
the SU(3) gauge theory with Nf=12 fermions in the fundamental representation.
The transition separates a weak coupling chirally symmetric phase from a strong
coupling chirally broken phase and is compatible with the scenario where
conformality is restored by increasing the flavour content of a non abelian
gauge theory. We explore the intriguing possibility that the observed bulk
transition is associated with the occurrence of an ultraviolet fixed point
(UVFP) at strong coupling, where a new theory emerges in the continuum.
