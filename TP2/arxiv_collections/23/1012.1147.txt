VLBI observations carried out by global networks provide the most accurate
values of the precession-nutation angles determining the position of the
celestial pole; as a rule, these results become available two to four weeks
after the observations. Therefore, numerous applications, such as satellite
navigation systems, operational determination of Universal Time, and space
navigation, use predictions of the coordinates of the celestial pole. In
connection with this, the accuracy of predictions of the precession- nutation
angles based on observational data obtained over the last three years is
analyzed for the first time, using three empiric nutation models---namely,
those developed at the US Naval Observatory, the Paris Observatory, and the
Pulkovo Observatory. This analysis shows that the last model has the best of
accuracy in predicting the coordinates of the celestial pole. The rms error for
a one-month prediction proposed by this model is below 100 microarcsecond.
