We use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the kinetics of
the liquid-gas phase separation if the temperature is lowered across the glass
transition of the dense phase. We observe a gradual change from phase separated
systems at high temperatures to nonequilibrium, gel-like structures that evolve
very slowly at low temperatures. The microscopic mechanisms responsible for the
coarsening strongly depend on temperature, and change from diffusive motion at
high temperature to a strongly intermittent, heterogeneous and thermally
activated dynamics at low temperature, leading to logarithmically slow growth
of the typical domain size.
