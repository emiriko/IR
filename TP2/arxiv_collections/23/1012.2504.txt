X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool to determine the protein 3D
structure. However, it is time-consuming and expensive, and not all proteins
can be successfully crystallized, particularly for membrane proteins. Although
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is indeed a very powerful tool in
determining the 3D structures of membrane proteins, it is also time-consuming
and costly. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is little structural
data available on the AGAAAAGA palindrome in the hydrophobic region (113-120)
of prion proteins due to the noncrystalline and insoluble nature of the amyloid
fibril, although many experimental studies have shown that this region has
amyloid fibril forming properties and plays an important role in prion
diseases. In view of this, the present study is devoted to address this problem
from computational approaches such as global energy optimization, simulated
annealing, and structural bioinformatics. The optimal atomic-resolution
structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibils reported in this paper have a value
to the scientific community in its drive to find treatments for prion diseases.
