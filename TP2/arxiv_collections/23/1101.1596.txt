The electrochemical doping transformation in organic semiconductor devices is
studied in application to light-emitting cells. It is shown that the device
performance can be significantly improved by utilizing new fundamental
properties of the doping process. We obtain an instability, which distorts the
doping fronts and increases the doping rate considerably. We explain the
physical mechanism of the instability, develop theory, provide experimental
evidence, and perform numerical simulations. We further show how improved
device design can amplify the instability thus leading to a much faster doping
process and device kinetics.
