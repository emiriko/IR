We report the discovery and initial characterisation of Qatar-1b, a hot
Jupiter orbiting a metal-rich K dwarf star, the first planet discovered by the
Alsubai Project exoplanet transit survey. We describe the strategy used to
select candidate transiting planets from photometry generated by the Alsubai
Project instrument. We examine the rate of astrophysical and other false
positives found during the spectroscopic reconnaissance of the initial batch of
candidates. A simultaneous fit to the follow-up radial velocities and
photometry of Qatar-1b yield a planetary mass of 1.09+/-0.08 Mjup and a radius
of 1.16+/-0.05 Rjup. The orbital period and separation are 1.420033 days and
0.0234 AU for an orbit assumed to be circular. The stellar density, effective
temperature and rotation rate indicate an age greater than 4 Gyr for the
system.
