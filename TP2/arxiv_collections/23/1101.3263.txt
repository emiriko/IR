We address the witnessing of quantum correlations beyond the limits imposed
by an ensemble statistical average. By relying upon the continuous observation
of a single quantum open system under the action of classical or quantum noise,
we show how the statistical distribution of outcomes of physically measurable
quantities provides enough information to detect entanglement in situations
where a simple averaging procedure yields to a vanishing value. In this way, we
are able to specify the meaning of decoherence when single read-out
measurements are available, to demonstrate that these distributions are capable
to predict/detect entanglement well beyond the ensemble average provided by a
dephasing-sensitive mixed state. Few-spin and fluorescent systems are used to
illustrate entanglement survival when a mixed state average predicts none or
under the conditions where the sudden-death of entanglement is expected.
