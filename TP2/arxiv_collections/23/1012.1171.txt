A new approach to EW composite scalars is developed, starting from the
fundamental gauge interaction on high scale. The latter is assumed to have the
group structure $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R\times SU(4)$ where SU(4) is the
Pati-Salam color-lepton group. The topological EW vacuum filled by instantons
is explicitly constructed and the resulting equations for fermion masses
exhibit spontaneous SU(2) flavor symmetry violation with possibility of very
large mass ratios.
