Using the ab initio FLAPW-GGA method we examine the electronic and magnetic
properties of nitrogen-doped non-magnetic sesquioxide La2O3 emphasizing the
role of doping sites in the occurrence of d0-magnetism. We predict the
magnetization of La2O3 induced by nitrogen impurity in both octahedral and
tetrahedral sites of the oxygen sublattice. The most interesting results are
that (i) the total magnetic moments (about 1 {\mu}B per supercells) are
independent of the doping site, whereas (ii) the electronic spectra of these
systems differ drastically: La2O3:N with six-fold coordinated nitrogen behaves
as a narrow-band-gap magnetic semiconductor, whereas with four-fold coordinated
nitrogen is predicted to be a magnetic half-metal. This effect is explained
taking into account the differences in N-2pz versus N-2px,y orbital splitting
for various doping sites. Thus, the type of the doping site is one of the
essential factors for designing of new d0-magnetic materials with promising
properties.
