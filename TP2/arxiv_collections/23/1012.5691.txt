Plasma with a temperature close to the chromospheric one is ejected in solar
eruptions. Such plasma can occult some part of emission of compact sources in
active regions as well as quiet solar areas. Absorption phenomena can be
observed in the microwave range as the so-called 'negative bursts' and also in
the He II 304 A line. The paper considers three eruptive events associated with
rather powerful flares. Parameters of absorbing material of an eruption are
estimated from multi-frequency records of a 'negative burst' in one event.
'Destruction' of an eruptive filament and its dispersion like a cloud over a
huge area observed as a giant depression of the 304 A line emission has been
revealed in a few events. One such event out of three ones known to us is
considered in this paper. Another event is a possibility.
