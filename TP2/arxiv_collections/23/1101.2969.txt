Smoke circle vortexes are a typical dynamic phenomenon in nature. The similar
circle vortexes phenomenon appears in hurricane, turbulence, and many others. A
semi-empirical method is constructed to get some intrinsic understanding about
such circle vortex structures. Firstly, the geometrical motion equations for
smoke circle is formulated based on empirical observations. Based on them, the
mechanic dynamic motion equations are established. Finally, the general dynamic
evolution equations for smoke vortex are formulated. They are dynamic evolution
equations for exact stress field and dynamic evolution equations for average
stress field. For industrial application and experimental data processing,
their corresponding approximation equations for viscous fluid are given. Some
simple discussions are made.
