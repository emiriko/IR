We consider scenarios in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM)
where the CP-odd and charged Higgs bosons are very light. As we demonstrate,
these can be obtained as simple deformations of existing phenomenological MSSM
benchmarks scenarios with parameters defined at the weak scale. This offers a
direct and meaningful comparison to the MSSM case. Applying a wide set of
up-to-date constraints from both high-energy collider and flavour physics, the
Higgs boson masses and couplings are studied in viable parts of parameter
space. The LHC phenomenology of the light Higgs scenario for neutral and
charged Higgs boson searches is discussed.
