The scaling of charged hadron fragmentation functions to the Tsallis
distribution for $0.01 \lessapprox x \lessapprox 0.2$ is presented for various
$e^+e^-$ collision energies. A possible microcanonical generalisation of the
Tsallis distribution is proposed, which gives good agreement with measured data
up to $x\approx1$. The proposal is based on superstatistics and a $KNO$ like
scaling of multiplicity distributions in $e^+e^-$ experiments.
