The reflectivity of photonic cluster is important property for nanophotonic
applications especially when one needs to hide the cluster or to make it
extremely visible. Currently, where are no methods clearly describing how to
create the photonic cluster with the predefined reflectivity. In this paper
several analytical methods are proposed to create the photonic cluster with
minimal or maximal reflectivity. The proposed methods are applicable for the
clusters made of small particles.
