We consider the behaviour of odd-parity perturbations of those self-similar
Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes which admit a naked singularity. We find
that a perturbation which evolves from initially regular data remains finite on
the Cauchy horizon. Finiteness is demonstrated by considering the behaviour of
suitable energy norms of the perturbation (and pointwise values of these
quantities) on natural spacelike hypersurfaces. This result holds for a general
choice of initial data and initial data surface. Finally, we examine the
perturbed Weyl scalars in order to provide a physical interpretation of our
results. Taken on its own, this result does not support cosmic censorship;
however a full perturbation of this spacetime would include even parity
perturbations, so we cannot conclude that this spacetime is stable to all
linear perturbations.
