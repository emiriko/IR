The magnetic phase transitions reported below 230 K in cupric oxide are
analyzed theoretically at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The
incommensurate multiferroic and lock-in commensurate phases are shown to
realize an inverted sequence of symmetry-breaking mechanisms with respect to
the usual sequence occurring in low temperature multiferroic compounds. The
higher temperature spin-spiral phase results from coupled order-parameters
which decouple at the lock-in transition to the commensurate ground state
phase. Expressing the order-parameters in function of the magnetic spins allows
determining the symmetries and magnetic structures of the equilibrium phases
and the microscopic interactions which give rise to the polarization.
