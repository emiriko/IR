Massive planets in very close orbits around their central stars can induce
so-called star-planet interactions (SPI), which may be of magnetic or
gravitational nature. In both cases, SPI can potentially cause recurring
chromospheric emission on the host star visible in Ca II H & K and/or
H$\alpha$. The emission would be bound to the planetary orbit, not to the
rotation period of the star. We searched for SPI in a sample of 7 stars with
massive close-in planets using high-resolution spectroscopic data taken at HRS
(HET) and FEROS (La Silla). We find no periodically recurring emission in the
planet-hosting stars. In the case of HD 41004 AB, a binary system consisting of
a K dwarf and an M dwarf, where the M dwarf is orbited by a brown dwarf
companion, we find signs of cyclic variation in the Ca II K and H$\alpha$
emission lines that could be associated to interactions between the M dwarf and
its companion. We present our first results of this interesting system that may
become an important system for the understanding of SPI.
