Discrepancy between periodic orbit theory and numerical calculation of a
modified Kepler problem is cleared by a quantum mechanical calculation. The
diagonal approximation already gives a good fit for the numerical calculation.
A better result yet is gained by considering the coherent interference between
the classical periodic orbits and the Balian-Bloch term. This approach produces
improved results for the rectangular billiards as well.
