Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the 29Si spin-lattice
relaxation time T1 were used to probe the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain
compound BaCu2(Si(1-x)Gex)2O7. Remarkable differences between the pure (x = 0)
and the fully random (x = 0.5) case are observed, indicating that randomness
generates a distribution of local magnetic relaxations. This distribution,
which is reflected in a stretched exponential NMR relaxation, exhibits a
progressive broadening with decreasing temperature, caused by a growing
inequivalence of magnetic sites. Compelling independent evidence for the
influence of randomness is also obtained from magnetization data and Monte
Carlo calculations. These results suggest the formation of random-singlet
states in this class of materials, as previously predicted by theory.
