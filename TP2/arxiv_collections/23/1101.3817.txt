We perform a functional expansion of the fidelity between two unitary
matrices in order to find the necessary conditions for the robust
implementation of a target gate. Comparison of these conditions with those
obtained from the Magnus expansion and Dyson series shows that they are
equivalent in first order. By exploiting techniques from robust design
optimization, we account for issues of experimental feasibility by introducing
an additional criterion to the search for control pulses. This search is
accomplished by exploring the competition between the multiple objectives in
the implementation of the NOT gate by means of evolutionary multi-objective
optimization.
