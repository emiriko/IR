We investigate the orbital diamagnetism of a weak-doped bilayer graphene
(BLG) in spatially smoothly varying magnetic field and obtain the general
analytic expression of the orbital susceptibility of BLG, with finite wave
number and Fermi energy, at zero temperature. We find that the magnetic field
screening factor of BLG is dependent with the wave number, which results in a
more complicated screening behavior compared with that of monolayer graphene
(MLG). We also study the induced magnetization, electric current in BLG, under
nonuniform magnetic field, and find that they are qualitatively different from
that in MLG and two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). However, similar to the
MLG, the magnetic object placed above BLG is repelled by a diamagnetic force
from BLG, approximately equivalent to a force produced by its mirror image on
the other side of BLG with a reduced amplitude dependent with the typical
length of the systems. BLG shows crossover behaviors in the responses to the
external magnetic field as the intermediate between MLG and 2DEG.
