We study cluster formation in strongly deformed states for $^{28}$Si and
$^{32}$S using a macroscopic-microscopic model. The study is based on
calculated total-energy surfaces, which are the sums of deformation-dependent
macroscopic-microscopic potential-energy surfaces and rotational-energy
contributions. We analyze the angular-momentum-dependent total-energy surfaces
and identify the normal- and super-deformed states in $^{28}$Si and $^{32}$S,
respectively. We show that at sufficiently high angular momenta strongly
deformed minima appear. The corresponding microscopic density distributions
show cluster structure that closely resemble the $^{16}$O+$^{12}$C and
$^{16}$O+$^{16}$O configurations. At still higher deformations, beyond the
minima, valleys develop in the calculated surfaces. These valleys lead to mass
divisions that correspond to the target-projectile configurations for which
molecular resonance states have been observed. We discuss the relation between
the one-body deformed minima and the two-body molecular-resonance states.
