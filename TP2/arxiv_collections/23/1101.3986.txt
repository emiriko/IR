We study the effect of decoherence on a qubit-qutrit system under the
influence of global, local and multilocal decoherence in non-inertial frames.
We show that the entanglement sudden death can be avoided in non-inertial
frames in the presence of amplitude damping, depolarizing and phase damping
channels. However, degradation of entanglement is seen due to Unruh effect. It
is shown that for lower level of decoherence, the depolarizing channel degrades
the entanglement more heavily as compared to the amplitude damping and phase
damping channels. However, for higher values of decoherence parameters,
amplitude damping channel heavily degrades the entanglement of the hybrid
system. Further more, no ESD is seen for any value of Rob's acceleration.
