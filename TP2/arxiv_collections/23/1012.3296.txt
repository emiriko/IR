The Toda chains take a particular place in the theory of integrable systems,
in contrast with the linear group structure for the Gaudin model this system is
related to the corresponding Borel group and mediately to the geometry of flag
varieties. The main goal of this paper is to reconstruct a "spectral curve" in
a wider context of the generic Toda system. This appears to be an efficient way
to find its quantization which is obtained here by the technique of quantum
characteristic polynomial for the Gaudin model and an appropriate AKS
reduction. We discuss also some relations of this result with the recent
consideration of the Drinfeld Zastava space, the monopole space and
corresponding Borel Yangian symmetries.
