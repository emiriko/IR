We study, by numerical methods, the time evolution of scalar perturbations in
radiation era of Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology. Our results confirm an
existence of the enhancement of perturbation amplitudes (near horizon
crossing), discovered recently. We suggest the approximate solution of
equations of the perturbation theory in the high energy regime, which predicts
that the enhancement factor is asymptotically constant, as a function of scale.
We discuss the application of this result for the problem of primordial black
hole production in braneworld cosmology.
