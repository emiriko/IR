Unique-sink orientations (USOs) are an abstract class of orientations of the
n-cube graph. We consider some classes of USOs that are of interest in
connection with the linear complementarity problem. We summarise old and show
new lower and upper bounds on the sizes of some such classes. Furthermore, we
provide a characterisation of K-matrices in terms of their corresponding USOs.
