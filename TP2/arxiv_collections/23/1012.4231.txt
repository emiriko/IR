The 2010 Workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets (MMDS 2010) was
held at Stanford University, June 15--18. The goals of MMDS 2010 were (1) to
explore novel techniques for modeling and analyzing massive, high-dimensional,
and nonlinearly-structured scientific and Internet data sets; and (2) to bring
together computer scientists, statisticians, applied mathematicians, and data
analysis practitioners to promote cross-fertilization of ideas. MMDS 2010
followed on the heels of two previous MMDS workshops. The first, MMDS 2006,
addressed the complementary perspectives brought by the numerical linear
algebra and theoretical computer science communities to matrix algorithms in
modern informatics applications; and the second, MMDS 2008, explored more
generally fundamental algorithmic and statistical challenges in modern
large-scale data analysis.
