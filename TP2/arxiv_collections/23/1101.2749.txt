We propose how to implement precision neutrino mass spectroscopy using
radiative neutrino pair emission (RNPE) from a macro-coherent decay of a new
form of target state, a large number of activated atoms interacting with static
condensate field. This method makes it possible to measure still undetermined
parameters of the neutrino mass matrix, two CP violating Majorana phases, the
unknown mixing angle and the smallest neutrino mass which could be of order a
few meV, determining at the same time the Majorana or Dirac nature of masses.
The twin process of paired superradiance (PSR) is also discussed.
