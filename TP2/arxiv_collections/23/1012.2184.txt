For many decades, statisticians have made attempts to prepare the Bayesian
omelette without breaking the Bayesian eggs; that is, to obtain probabilistic
likelihood-based inferences without relying on informative prior distributions.
A recent example is Murray Aitkin's recent book, {\em Statistical Inference},
which presents an approach to statistical hypothesis testing based on
comparisons of posterior distributions of likelihoods under competing models.
Aitkin develops and illustrates his method using some simple examples of
inference from iid data and two-way tests of independence. We analyze in this
note some consequences of the inferential paradigm adopted therein, discussing
why the approach is incompatible with a Bayesian perspective and why we do not
find it relevant for applied work.
