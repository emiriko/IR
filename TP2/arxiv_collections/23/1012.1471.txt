The universal density-force relation is analyzed and the correspondent
universal amplitude ratio $B_{real}$ is obtained using the massive field theory
approach in fixed space dimensions d=3 up to one-loop order. The layer monomer
density profiles of ideal chains and real polymer chains with excluded volume
interaction in a good solvent between two parallel repulsive walls, one
repulsive and one inert wall are obtained. Besides, taking into account the
Derjaguin approximation the layer monomer density profiles for dilute polymer
solution confined in semi-infinite space containing mesoscopic spherical
particle of big radius are calculated. The last mentioned situation is analyzed
for both cases when wall and particle are repulsive and for the mixed case of
repulsive wall and inert particle. The obtained results are in good agreement
with previous theoretical results and with the results of Monte Carlo
simulations.
