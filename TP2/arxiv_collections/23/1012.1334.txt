We define the block neighborhood of a reversible CA, which is related both to
its decomposition into a product of block permutations and to quantum
computing. We give a purely combinatorial characterization of the block
neighborhood, which helps in two ways. First, it makes the computation of the
block neighborhood of a given CA relatively easy. Second, it allows us to
derive upper bounds on the block neighborhood: for a single CA as function of
the classical and inverse neighborhoods, and for the composition of several
CAs. One consequence of that is a characterization of a class of "elementary"
CAs that cannot be written as the composition of two simpler parts whose
neighborhoods and inverse neighborhoods would be reduced by one half.
