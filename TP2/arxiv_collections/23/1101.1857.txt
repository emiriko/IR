We briefly review the turbulent mean-field dynamo action in protoneutron
stars that are subject to convective and neutron finger instabilities during
the early evolutionary phase. By solving the mean-field induction equation with
the simplest model of $\alpha$-quenching we estimate the strength of the
generated magnetic field. If the initial period of the protoneutron star is
short, then the generated large-scale field is very strong ($> 3 \times
10^{13}$G) and exceeds the small-scale field at the neutron star surface, while
if the rotation is moderate, then the pulsars are formed with more or less
standard dipole fields ($< 3 \times 10^{13}$G) but with surface small-scale
magnetic fields stronger than the dipole field. If rotation is very slow, then
the mean-field dynamo does not operate, and the neutron star has no global
field.
