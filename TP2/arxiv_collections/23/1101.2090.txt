Since the anyonic excitations in the Kitaev toric model are perfectly
localized quasiparticles, it is possible to generate dynamically the ground
state and the excitations of the model Hamiltonian to simulate the anyonic
interferometry. We propose a scheme in circuit QED to simulate the
interferometry. The qubit-cavity interaction can be engineered to realize
effective state control as well as the controlled dynamics of qubits, which are
sufficient to prepare the ground states, create and remove the anyonic
excitation, and simulate the anyonic interferometry. The simplicity and high
fidelity of the operations used open the very promising possibility of
simulating fractional statistics of anyons in a macroscopic material in the
near future.
