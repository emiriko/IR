New Physics scenarios generally predict the existence of very heavy quantum
states that can possibly manifest themselves as peaks in the cross sections at
the LHC. For values of the parameters in certain domains, different nonstandard
models can generate peaks with the same mass and same number of events. In this
case, the spin determination of a peak, requiring the angular analysis of the
events, becomes crucial in order to identify the relevant nonstandard source.
We here discuss, using a particularly suitable symmetrically integrated angular
asymmetry applied to Drell-Yan dilepton and diphoton events at LHC, the
identification reach on the exchanges in these reactions of the following heavy
bosons: spin-2 Randall-Sundrum graviton excitations; spin-1 heavy neutral gauge
bosons Z^\prime; and spin-0 SUSY R-parity violating sneutrinos.
