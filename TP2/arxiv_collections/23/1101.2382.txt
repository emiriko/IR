We show that simple laser configurations can give rise to "optical flux
lattices", in which optically dressed atoms experience a periodic effective
magnetic flux with high mean density. These potentials lead to narrow energy
bands with non-zero Chern number. Optical flux lattices will greatly facilitate
the achievement of the quantum Hall regime for ultracold atomic gases.
