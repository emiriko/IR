Studies of Cr-doped III-V nitrides, dilute magnetic alloys, in the
zinc-blende crystal structure are presented. The objective of the work is to
investigate half-metallicity in Al(0.75)Cr(0.25)N, Ga(0.75)Cr(0.25)N and
In(0.75)Cr(0.25)N for their possible application in the spin based electronic
devices. The calculated spin polarized band structures, electronic properties
and magnetic properties of these compounds reveal that Al0.75Cr0.25N and
Ga0.75Cr0.25N are half-metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors while
In0.75Cr0.25N is metallic in nature. The present theoretical predictions
provide evidence that some Cr doped III-V nitrides can be used in spintronics
devices.
