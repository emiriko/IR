There are many fields where the transition from diffusive to ballistic motion
is important. Here we deal with relaxation processes in nmr in gases.
Correlation functions for trajectory variables (position and velocity) valid
across this transition are known for several geometries in the case of specular
wall reflections. In this work we show that the conditional probability density
p(r,t|r_0,t_0) for a random walk satisfies the telegrapher's equation and
present an analytic solution for this function. We will use it for calculating
the relaxation due to an axion mediated force and a magnetic dipole impurity.
