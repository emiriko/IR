The PDPTW is an optimization vehicles routing problem which must meet
requests for transport between suppliers and customers satisfying precedence,
capacity and time constraints. We present, in this paper, a genetic algorithm
for multi-objective optimization of a dynamic multi pickup and delivery problem
with time windows (Dynamic m-PDPTW). We propose a brief literature review of
the PDPTW, present our approach based on Pareto dominance method and lower
bounds, to give a satisfying solution to the Dynamic m-PDPTW minimizing the
compromise between total travel cost and total tardiness time. Computational
results indicate that the proposed algorithm gives good results with a total
tardiness equal to zero with a tolerable cost.
