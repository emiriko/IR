As a second part of a previous paper, here the calculated electronic band
structure of ideal Pt(100) and Pt(110) surfaces, studied using density
functional theory and the empirical tight-binding method, is presented. A
detailed discussion of the surface- and resonance--states is given. It is shown
that the calculated surface- and resonance--states of ideal Pt(100) surfaces
agree very well with the available experimental data. For Pt(110), some of the
surface- and resonance-states are characteristic of the low degree of symmetry
of the surface and are identified as being independent of surface
reconstruction effects. As in the previous paper, the density functional
calculations were performed using the full potential linearized augmented plane
wave method, and the empirical calculations were performed using the
tight-binding method and Surface Green's Function Matching Method.
