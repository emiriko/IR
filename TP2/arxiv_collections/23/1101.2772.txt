Given X a K3 surface, a mirror dual to X can be identified with a component
of the moduli space of semistable sheaves on X. We consider fibrations by K3
surfaces over a one dimensional base that are Calabi-Yau and we obtain a dual
fibration that turns to be derived equivalent to the original one and we relate
the problem to mirror symmetry.
