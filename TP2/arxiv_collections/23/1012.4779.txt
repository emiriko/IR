This paper presents an assessment of the new Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager channel 3 - 4 brightness temperature
difference (BTD) product for two early cold season severe convective storm
events that occurred over the Mid-Atlantic region on 17 November and 1 December
2010. Both of these events involved squall lines that produced strong
downbursts as they tracked over the Tidal Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay
regions. It has been found recently that the BTD between GOES infrared channel
3 (water vapor) and channel 4 (thermal infrared) can highlight regions where
severe outflow wind generation (i.e. downbursts, microbursts) is likely due to
the channeling of dry mid-tropospheric air into the precipitation core of a
deep, moist convective storm. These two cases demonstrate effective operational
use of this image product for cold-season convective storm events.
