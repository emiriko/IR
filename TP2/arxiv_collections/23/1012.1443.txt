In this work, we have considered a model of the flat FRW universe filled with
cold dark matter and Chameleon field where the scale function is taken as, (i)
Intermediate Expansion and (ii) Logamediate Expansion. In the both cases we
find the expressions of Chameleon field, Chameleon potential, statefinder
parameters and slow-roll parameters. Also it has been shown that the potential
is always decreases with the chameleon field in both the scenarios. The nature
of slow-roll parameters have been shown diagrammatically.
