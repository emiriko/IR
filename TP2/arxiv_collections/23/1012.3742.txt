We show that a bulk Higgs with a mass saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman
bound can naturally generate and stabilize an exponential hierarchy on a nearly
AdS background. The physical Higgs boson in this class of models emerges as the
lightest eigenstate of the Higgs/radion system and has a mass strictly lighter
than the Kaluza-Klein scale. These theories are dual to strongly coupled CFTs
deformed by a marginally relevant Higgs mass operator. On the 5D side, the
marginally relevant nature of the Higgs mass operator implies that the Higgs
VEV is maximally spread in the bulk. This feature significantly decreases the
lower bound on the new physics scale in models that address the SM flavor
problem. The collider phenomenology interpolates between Randall-Sundrum
scenarios with a heavy Higgs and a light radion, and composite Higgs models.
