The magnetic dipole interaction played a central role in the development of
QED, and continued in that role for the Standard Model. The muon anomalous
magnetic moment has served as a benchmark for models of new physics, and the
present experimental value is larger than the standard-model value by more than
three standard deviations. The electric dipole moment (EDM) violates parity
({$P$}) and time-reversal ({$T$}) symmetries, and in the context of the $CPT$
theorem, the combination of charge conjugation and parity ($CP$). Since a new
source of {$ CP$} violation outside of that observed in the $K$ and $B$ meson
systems is needed to help explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe,
searches for EDMs are being carried out worldwide on a number of systems. The
standard-model value of the EDM is immeasurably small, so any evidence for an
EDM would signify the observation of new physics. Unique opportunities exist
for EDM searches using polarized proton, deuteron or muon beams in storage
rings. This talk will provide an overview of the theory of dipole moments, and
the relevant experiments. The connection to the transition dipole moment that
could produce lepton flavor violating interactions such as $\mu^+ \rightarrow
e^+ \gamma$ is also mentioned.
