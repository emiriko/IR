The creation of superpositions of hole states via single-photon ionization
using attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses is studied with the time-dependent
configuration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. Specifically, the degree of
coherence between hole states in atomic xenon is investigated. We find that
interchannel coupling not only affects the hole populations, it also enhances
the entanglement between the photoelectron and the remaining ion, thereby
reducing the coherence within the ion. As a consequence, even if the spectral
bandwidth of the ionizing pulse exceeds the energy splittings among the hole
states involved, perfectly coherent hole wave packets cannot be formed. For
sufficiently large spectral bandwidth, the coherence can only be increased by
increasing the mean photon energy.
