We investigate spin relaxation in graphene spin valves and observe strongly
contrasting behavior for single layer graphene (SLG) and bilayer graphene
(BLG). In SLG, the spin lifetime ({\tau}s) varies linearly with the momentum
scattering time ({\tau}p) as carrier concentration is varied, indicating the
dominance of Elliot-Yafet (EY) spin relaxation at low temperatures. In BLG,
{\tau}s and {\tau}p exhibit an inverse dependence, which indicates the
dominance of Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation at low temperatures. The different
behavior is due to enhanced screening and/or reduced surface sensitivity of
BLG, which greatly reduces the impurity-induced EY spin relaxation.
