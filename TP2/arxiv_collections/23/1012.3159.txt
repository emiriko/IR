Recently a new type of cosmological singularity has been postulated for
infinite barotropic index $w$ in the equation of state $p=w \rho$ of the
cosmological fluid, but vanishing pressure and density at the singular event.
Apparently the barotropic index $w$ would be the only physical quantity to blow
up at the singularity. In this talk we would like to discuss the strength of
such singularities and compare them with other types. We show that they are
weak singularities.
