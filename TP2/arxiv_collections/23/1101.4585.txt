We present a catalogue of 4098 photometrically selected galaxy clusters with
a median redshift <z> = 0.32 in the 270 square degree 'Stripe 82' region of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), covering the celestial equator in the Southern
Galactic Cap (-50 < RA < 59 deg, |Dec| < 1.25 deg). Owing to the multi-epoch
SDSS coverage of this region, the ugriz photometry is ~2 magnitudes deeper than
single scans within the main SDSS footprint. We exploit this to detect clusters
of galaxies using an algorithm that searches for statistically significant
overdensities of galaxies in a Voronoi tessellation of the projected sky. 32%
of the clusters have at least one member with a spectroscopic redshift from
existing public data (SDSS Data Release 7, 2SLAQ & WiggleZ), and the remainder
have a robust photometric redshift (accurate to ~5-9% at the median redshift of
the sample). The weighted average of the member galaxies' redshifts provides a
reasonably accurate estimate of the cluster redshift. The cluster catalogue is
publicly available for exploitation by the community to pursue a range of
science objectives. In addition to the cluster catalogue, we provide a linked
catalogue of 18,295 V<21 mag quasar sight-lines with impact parameters within
<3 Mpc of the cluster cores selected from the catalogue of Veron et al. (2010).
The background quasars cover 0.25 < z < 2, where MgII absorption-line systems
associated with the clusters are detectable in optical spectra.
