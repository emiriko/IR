We report for several solar energetic particle events intensity and
anisotropy measurements of energetic electrons in the energy range ~ 27 to ~
500 keV as observed with the Wind and ACE spacecraft in June 2000. The
observations onboard Wind show bimodal pitch angle distributions (PAD), whereas
ACE shows PADs with one peak, as usually observed for impulsive injection of
electrons at the Sun. During the time of observation Wind was located upstream
of the Earth's bow shock, in the dawn - noon sector, at distances of ~ 40 to ~
70 Earth radii away from the Earth, and magnetically well connected to the
quasi-parallel bow shock, whereas ACE, located at the libration point L1, was
not connected to the bow shock. The electron intensity-time profiles and energy
spectra show that the backstreaming electrons observed at Wind are not of
magnetospheric origin. The observations rather suggest that the bi-modal
electron PADs are due to reflection or scattering at an obstacle located at a
distance of less than ~ 150 Earth radii in the anti-sunward direction,
compatible with the bow shock or magnetosheath of the magnetosphere of the
Earth.
