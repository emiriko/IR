We calculate the network fluid regime and phase diagrams of binary mixtures
of patchy colloids, using Wertheim's first order perturbation theory and a
generalization of Flory-Stockmayer's theory of polymerization. The colloids are
modelled as hard spheres with the same diameter and surface patches of the same
type, $A$. The only difference between species is the number of their patches
-or functionality-, $f_A^{(1)}$ and $f_A^{(2)}$ (with $f_A^{(2)}>f_A^{(1)}$).
We have found that the difference in functionality is the key factor
controlling the behaviour of the mixture in the network (percolated) fluid
regime. In particular, when $f_A^{(2)}\ge2f_A^{(1)}$ the entropy of bonding
drives the phase separation of two network fluids which is absent in other
mixtures. This changes drastically the critical properties of the system and
drives a change in the topology of the phase diagram (from type I to type V)
when $f_A^{(1)}>2$. The difference in functionality also determines the
miscibility at high (osmotic) pressures. If $f_A^{(2)}-f_A^{(1)}=1$ the mixture
is completely miscible at high pressures, while closed miscibility gaps at
pressures above the highest critical pressure of the pure fluids are present if
$f_A^{(2)}-f_A^{(1)}>1$. We argue that this phase behaviour is driven by a
competition between the entropy of mixing and the entropy of bonding, as the
latter dominates in the network fluid regime.
