We update present bounds on the helicity of the neutrinos produced in muon
decay, including e+ e- -> fbar f LEP 2 data. These significantly reduce the
limits derived from all the other electroweak precision data. In Standard Model
extensions designed to maximize the RH neutrino production in such a decay the
neutrino deficit eventually observable in a near detector at a neutrino factory
can be of the order of 5 %. Motivated by the current LHC run at 7 TeV, we also
update previous work providing discovery limits on see-saw mediators at this
centre of mass energy. Lepton triplets with 200 GeV could be discovered with
luminosities of 1 - 1.5 fb^-1. Scalar triplets of the same mass might be seen
with 0.75 - 3 fb^-1. What makes their search also attractive in the first LHC
analyses.
