Individuals interact with conspecifics in a number of behavioural contexts or
dimensions. Here, we formalise this by considering a social network between n
individuals interacting in b behavioural dimensions as a nxnxb multidimensional
object. In addition, we propose that the topology of this object is driven by
individual needs to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of interactions in
one or more dimension. The proposal grounds social network dynamics and
evolution in individual selection processes and allows us to define the
uncertainty of the social network as the joint entropy of its constituent
interaction networks. In support of these propositions we use simulations and
natural 'knock-outs' in a free-ranging baboon troop to show (i) that such an
object can display a small-world state and (ii) that, as predicted, changes in
interactions after social perturbations lead to a more certain social network,
in which the outcomes of interactions are easier for members to predict. This
new formalisation of social networks provides a framework within which to
predict network dynamics and evolution under the assumption that it is driven
by individuals seeking to reduce the uncertainty of their social environment.
