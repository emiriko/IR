In our previous work [1], a divide-and-conquer approach was proposed for
cooperative tasking among multi-agent systems. The basic idea is to decompose a
requested global specification into subtasks for individual agents such that
the fulfillment of these subtasks by each individual agent leads to the
satisfaction of the global specification as a team. It was shown that not all
tasks can be decomposed. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition was
proposed for the decomposability of a task automaton between two cooperative
agents. The current paper continues the results in [1] and proposes necessary
and sufficient conditions for task decomposability with respect to arbitrary
finite number of agents. It is further shown that the fulfillment of local
specifications can guarantee the satisfaction of the global specification. This
work provides hints for the designers on how to rule out the indecomposable
task automata and enforce the decomposability conditions. The result therefore
may pave the way towards a new perspective for decentralized cooperative
control of multi-agent systems.
