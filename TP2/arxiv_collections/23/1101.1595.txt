Here we present an angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), x-ray
absorption spec-troscopy (XAS), and density-functional theory (DFT)
investigations of water and ammonia ad-sorption on graphene/Ni(111). Our
results on graphene/Ni(111) reveal the existence of interface states,
originating from the strong hybridization of the graphene {\pi} and
spin-polarized Ni 3d valence band states. ARPES and XAS data of the H2O
(NH3)/graphene/Ni(111) system give an information about the kind of interaction
between adsorbed molecules and graphene on Ni(111). The presented experimental
data are compared with the results obtained in the framework of the DFT
approach.
