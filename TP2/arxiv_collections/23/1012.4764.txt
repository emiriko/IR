DARWIN (DARk matter WImp search with Noble liquids) is an R&D and design
study towards the realization of a multi-ton scale dark matter search facility
in Europe, based on the liquid argon and liquid xenon time projection chamber
techniques. Approved by ASPERA in late 2009, DARWIN brings together several
European and US groups working on the existing ArDM, XENON and WARP experiments
with the goal of providing a technical design report for the facility by early
2013. DARWIN will be designed to probe the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross
section region below 10-47cm^2 and to provide a high-statistics measurement of
WIMP interactions in case of a positive detection in the intervening years.
After a brief introduction, the DARWIN goals, components, as well as its
expected physics reach will be presented.
