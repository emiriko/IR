We derive a general relation between the fine structure splitting (FSS) and
the exciton polarization angle of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) under
uniaxial stress. We show that the FSS lower bound under external stress can be
predicted by the exciton polarization angle and FSS under zero stress. The
critical stress can also be determined by monitoring the change in exciton
polarization angle. We confirm the theory by performing atomistic
pseudopotential calculations for the InAs/GaAs QDs. The work provides a deep
insight into the dots asymmetry and their optical properties, and a useful
guide in selecting QDs with smallest FSS which are crucial in entangled photon
sources applications.
