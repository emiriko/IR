The structure of graphite-like BCx phases (x = 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 32) has been
studied using conventional X-ray diffraction. The results have been obtained,
which unambiguously point to turbostratic (one- dimensionally disordered)
structure of all phases under study. The crystal lattice parameters, sizes of
coherent scattering domains, and microstrain values have been defined, which
have allowed us to find a correlation between the structure and stoichiometry
of the phases synthesized at the same temperature.
