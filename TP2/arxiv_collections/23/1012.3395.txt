The non-vanishing of naive T-odd parton distributions function can be
explained by the existence of the gauge link which emerges from the factorized
description of the deep inelastic scattering cross section into perturbatively
calculable and non-perturbative factors. This path ordered exponential
describes initial / final-state interactions of the active parton due to soft
gluon exchanges with the target remnants. Although these interactions are
non-perturbative, studies of final state interactions have been approximated by
perturbative one-gluon exchange in Abelian models. We include higher-order
gluonic contributions from the gauge link by applying non-perturbative eikonal
methods, incorporating color degrees of freedom in a calculation of the Sivers
function. In this context we study the effects of color by considering the FSIs
with Abelian and non-Abelian gluon interactions. We confirm the large $N_c$ QCD
scaling behavior of Sivers functions and further uncover the deviations for
finite $N_c$. Within this framework of FSIs we perform a quantitative check of
approximate relations between T-odd TMDs and GPD which goes beyond the
discussion of overall signs.
