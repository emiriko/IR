We derive the analytical eigenvalues and eigenstates of a family of
potentials wells with exponential form (FPWEF). We provide a brief summary of
the supersymmetry formalism applied to quantum mechanics and illustrate it by
producing from the FPWEF another class of exact solutions made of their
isospectral partners. Interestingly, a subset of the supersymmetric partners
provides a class of exactly solvable double well potentials. We use the exact
solutions of the FPWEF to test the robustness and accuracy of different
approximation schemes. We determine (i) the ground state through variational
method applied to an approriate set of trial functions and (ii) the whole
spectrum using three semiclassical quantization formula: the WKB, JWKB and its
supersymmetric extension, the SWKB quantization formula. We comment on the
importance of Maslov index and on the range of validity of these different
semiclassical approaches.
