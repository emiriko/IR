Cavity cooling via quantum backaction force can extract thermal fluctuations
from a mechanical resonator to reach the quantum ground state. Surface or bulk
two-level-system (TLS) defects in a mechanical resonator can couple with the
mechanical mode via deformation potential and affect the cooling process
significantly. Here, we develop a theory to study the cavity cooling of a
mechanical mode in the presence of a TLS defect using the adiabatic elimination
technique. Our result shows that the cooling process depends strongly on the
resonance and the damping rate of the TLS.
