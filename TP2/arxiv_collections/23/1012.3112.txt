We report on the dielectric properties of epitaxial [001] and [100]-textured
thin films of antiferromagnetic orthorhombic YMnO3 and their variation under
compressive epitaxial strain. It is found that weakly strained YMnO3 films are
ferroelectric with a polarization along c-axis switchable by 90 degrees by an
external magnetic field. When reducing film thickness and increasing epitaxial
strain, the ferroelectric order is progressively suppressed. Analysis of
structural, dielectric and magnetic data indicates that suppression of
ferroelectricity when reducing thickness is accompanied by an enlarged ratio
a/b of the in-plane cell parameters of the orthorhombic structure and the
appearance of a net magnetization. All results can be well described by
considering the multiferroic phase diagram of orthorhombic manganites.
