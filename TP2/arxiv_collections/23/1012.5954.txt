We shall show that the stable categories of graded Cohen-Macaulay modules
over quotient singularities have tilting objects. In particular, these
categories are triangle equivalent to derived categories of finite dimensional
algebras. Our method is based on higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory,
which gives cluster tilting objects in the stable categories of (ungraded)
Cohen-Macaulay modules.
