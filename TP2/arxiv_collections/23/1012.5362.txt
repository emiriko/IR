In this work, we proposed a nonresonant explanation for the Y(4260) structure
observed in the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ process, i.e., Y(4260) is not a
genuine resonance. Our result indicates that the Y(4260) structure can be
reproduced by the interference of production amplitudes of the $e^+e^-\to
J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ processes via direct $e^+e^-$ annihilation and through
intermediate charmonia $\psi(4160)/\psi(4415)$. Besides describing Y(4260) line
shape in $e^+e^-\to J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ well, such a nonresonant explanation for
the Y(4260) structure naturally answers why there is no evidence of Y(4260) in
the exclusive open-charm decay channel and $R$-value scan.
