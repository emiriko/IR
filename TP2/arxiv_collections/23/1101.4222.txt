Reversible logic has promising applications in emerging nanotechnologies,
such as quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata and optical computing,
etc. Faults in reversible logic circuits that result in multi-bit error at the
outputs are very tough to detect, and thus in literature, researchers have only
addressed the problem of online testing of faults that result single-bit error
at the outputs based on parity preserving logic. In this work, we propose a
methodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to
detect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The
methodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed
as 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible
logic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the
original inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits
can be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in
reversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology
results in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder
that can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is
illustrated as the application of the proposed scheme. Finally, we showed the
application of the proposed scheme of concurrent error detection towards fault
detection in quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) emerging nanotechnology.
