We analyze the Michelson-Morley experiment in a reference frame moving with
constant proper acceleration. Interestingly, we find an expected fringe shift
which depends not only on the interferometer's rate of acceleration, but also
on its speed relative to a preferred absolute reference frame. While it has
been repeatedly shown that no experiment performed in an inertial reference
frame can detect that frame's absolute speed, the analysis in this paper
suggests that by considering experiments in accelerated reference frames it may
be possible to measure absolute speed after all.
