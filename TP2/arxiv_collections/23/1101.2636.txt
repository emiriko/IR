Using a large-N approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance
and quasi-particle interference pattern measured in recent scanning tunneling
spectroscopy experiments (A.R. Schmidt et al. Nature 465, 570 (2010); P.
Aynajian et al., PNAS 107, 10383 (2010)) in URu2Si2 are consistent with the
emergence of a coherent Kondo lattice below its hidden order transition (HOT).
Its formation is driven by a significant increase in the quasi-particle
lifetime, which could arise from the emergence of a yet unknown order parameter
at the HOT.
