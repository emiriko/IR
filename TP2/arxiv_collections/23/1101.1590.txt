Direct imaging of the HR8799 system was a major achievement in the study of
exoplanets. HR8799 is a $\gamma$\,Doradus variable and asteroseismology can
provide an independent constraint on the inclination. Using 650 high
signal-to-noise, high resolution, full visual wavelength spectroscopic
observations obtained over two weeks at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP)
with the SOPHIE spectrograph we find that the main frequency in the radial
velocity data is 1.9875 d$^{-1}$. This frequency corresponds to the main
frequency as found in previous photometric observations. Using the FAMIAS
software to identify the pulsation modes, we find this frequency is a prograde
$\ell$=1 sectoral mode and obtain the constraint that inclination
$i\gtrsim$40$^{\circ}$.
