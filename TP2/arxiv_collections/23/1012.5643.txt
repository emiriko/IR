A non-compact version of the Weyl equation is proposed, based on the infinite
dimensional spin zero representation of the sl_2 algebra. Solutions of the
aforementioned equation are obtained in terms of the Kummer functions. In this
context, we discuss the ADHMN approach in order to construct the corresponding
non-compact BPS monopoles.
