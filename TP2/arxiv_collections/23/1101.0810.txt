The production of new particles at a hadron collider like the LHC is always
accompanied by QCD radiation attributable to the initial state (i.e. ISR). This
tends to complicate analyses, so ISR is normally regarded as a nuisance.
Nevertheless, we show that ISR can also be valuable, yielding information that
can help in the discovery and interpretation of physics beyond the Standard
Model. To access this information we will introduce new techniques designed to
identify ISR jets on an event-by-event basis, a process we term ISR tagging. As
a demonstration of their utility, we will apply these techniques to SUSY
di-squark (di-gluino) production to show that they can be used to identify ISR
jets in roughly 40% (15%) of the events, with a mistag rate of around 10%
(15%). We then show that, through the application of a new method which we will
introduce, knowledge of an ISR jet allows us to infer the squark (gluino) mass
to within roughly 20% of its true value.
