A model of color particle confinement is considered. The model is based on
the Snyder-Yang algebra, which takes into account a non-commutativity of
generalized momenta and coordinates of a color particle and contains two new
constants. An extended kinematical invariance in a quantum phase space of a
color particle gives rise to an invariant equation with an oscillator rising
potential. The presence of the oscillator rising potential can simulate a
confinement of a color particle. Mass and lenght parameters involved in the
Snyder-Yang commutation relations along with parameters of current and
constituent quarks are estimated.
