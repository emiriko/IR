We investigated a scenario in which M31 could be the remnant of a major
merger and at the origin of the LMC. Galaxy merger simulations were run in
order to reproduce some M31 properties. We succeeded in reproducing some of the
most important M31 large-scale features like the thick disk or the polar ring,
and gave a possible explanation for the formation of the Giant Stream. We also
found that the LMC could be expelled by this high energetic phenomenon.
