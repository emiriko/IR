We present results from the QCDSF/UKQCD collaboration for the electromagnetic
and semi-leptonic form factors for the hyperons. The simulations are performed
on our new ensembles generated with 2+1 flavours of dynamical O(a)-improved
Wilson fermions. A unique feature of these configurations is that the quark
masses are tuned so that the singlet quark mass is held fixed at its physical
value. We use 5 such choices of the individual quark masses on 24^3x48 lattices
with a lattice spacing of about 0.078 fm.
