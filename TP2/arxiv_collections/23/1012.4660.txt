The aim of the present paper is to propose experiments for observing the
significant features of Berry's phases for S>1, generated by spin-Hamiltonians
endowed with two couplings, a magnetic dipole and an electric quadrupole one
with external B and E fields, as theoretically studied in our previous work.
The fields are assumed orthogonal, this mild restriction leading to geometric
and algebraic simplifications. Alkali atoms appear as good candidates for
interferometric measurements but there are challenges to be overcome. The only
practical way to generate a suitable E-field is to use the ac Stark effect
which induces an instability of the dressed atom. Besides atom loss, this might
invalidate Berry's phase derivation but this latter problem can be solved by an
appropriate detuning. The former puts an upper limit to the cycle duration,
which is bounded below by the adiabatic condition. By relying upon our previous
analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections, we have been able to reach a
compromise for the $^{87}$Rb hf level F=2, m=0 state, which is our candidate
for an interferometric measurement of the exotic Berry's phase generated by a
rotation of the E-field around the fixed B-field. By a numerical simulation we
have shown that the non-adiabatic corrections can be kept below the 0.1% level.
As an alternative candidate, we discuss the chromium ground state J=S=3, where
the instability problem is easily solved. We make a proposal to extend the
measurement of Aharonov-Anandan's phase beyond S=1/2 to the $^{87}$Rb hf level
F=m=1, by constructing, with the help of light-shifts, a Hamiltonian able to
perform a parallel transport along a closed circuit upon the density matrix
space, without any adiabatic constraint. In Appendix A, Berry's phase
difference for S=3/2 and 1/2, m=1/2 states is used to perform an entanglement
of 3 Qbits.
