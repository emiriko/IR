We report the entanglement of topological features, namely, isolated, linked
optical vortex loops in the light from spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC). In three dimensions, optical vortices are lines of phase singularity
and vortices of energy flow which percolate through all optical fields. This
example of entanglement is between features that extend over macroscopic and
finite volumes, furthermore, topological features are robust to perturbation .
The entanglement of photons in complex three-dimensional(3D) topological states
suggests the possibility of entanglement of similar structures in other quantum
systems describable by complex scalar functions, such as superconductors,
superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates.
