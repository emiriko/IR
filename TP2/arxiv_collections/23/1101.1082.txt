We present a spectroscopic catalog of 70,841 visually inspected M dwarfs from
the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For each
spectrum, we provide measurements of the spectral type, a number of molecular
bandheads, and the H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta and Ca II K emission
lines. In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter zeta and
identify a relationship between zeta and the g-r and r-z colors of M dwarfs. We
assess the precision of our spectral types (which were assigned by individual
examination), review the bulk attributes of the sample, and examine the
magnetic activity properties of M dwarfs, in particular those traced by the
higher order Balmer transitions. Our catalog is cross-matched to Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS) infrared data, and contains photometric distances for each
star. Lastly, we identify eight new late-type M dwarfs that are possibly within
25 pc of the Sun. Future studies will use these data to thoroughly examine
magnetic activity and kinematics in late-type M dwarfs and examine the chemical
and dynamical history of the local Milky Way.
