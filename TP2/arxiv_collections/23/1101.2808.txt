The determination of the stellar parameters of M dwarfs is of prime
importance in the fields of galactic, stellar and planetary astronomy. M stars
are the least studied galactic component regarding their fundamental
parameters. Yet, they are the most numerous stars in the galaxy and contribute
to most of its total (baryonic) mass. In particular, we are interested in their
metallicity in order to study the star-planet connection and to refine the
planetary parameters. As a preliminary result we present a test of the
metallicity calibrations of Bonfils et al. (2005), Johnson & Apps (2009), and
Schlaufman & Laughlin (2010) using a new sample of 17 binaries with precise V
band photometry.
