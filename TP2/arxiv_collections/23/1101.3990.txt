We estimate the sensitivity to nano-Hertz gravitational waves of pulsar
timing experiments in which two highly-stable millisecond pulsars are tracked
simultaneously with two neighboring radio telescopes that are referenced to the
same time-keeping subsystem (i.e. "the clock"). By taking the difference of the
two time-of-arrival residual data streams we can exactly cancel the clock noise
in the combined data set, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to gravitational
waves. We estimate that, in the band ($10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$) Hz, this
"interferometric" pulsar timing technique can potentially improve the
sensitivity to gravitational radiation by almost two orders of magnitude over
that of single-telescopes. Interferometric pulsar timing experiments could be
performed with neighboring pairs of antennas of the forthcoming large arraying
projects.
