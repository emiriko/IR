Springs are used in simple demonstrations for the students of Physics classes
to illustrate the Hooke's Law and harmonic oscillations. The spring is usually
considered as a light object that does not possess a mass. What happens if the
spring is heavy, that is, if its mass is not negligible? This paper aims to
discuss this problem as plainly as possible.
