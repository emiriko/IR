In this paper, we discuss returning arrows with respect to the Nakayama
translation appearing in the quivers of some important algebras when we
construct extensions. When constructing twisted trivial extensions for a graded
self-injective algebra, we show that the returning arrows appear in the quiver,
that the complexity increases by 1 in Koszul cases, and the representation
dimension also increases by 1 under certain additional conditions. By applying
Koszul duality, for each Koszul Artin-Schelter regular algebra of global
dimension l and Gelfand-Kirilov dimension $c$, we construct a family of Koszul
Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension $l+1$ and Gelfand-Kirilov
dimension $c+1$, among them one is central extension and one is
$l+1$-Calabi-Yau.
