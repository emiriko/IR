In the present course, an overview is presented of the fundamentals of
continuum-polaron physics, which provide the basis of the analysis of polaron
effects in ionic crystals and polar semiconductors. These Lecture Notes deal
with "large", or "continuum", polarons, as described by the Fr\"ohlich
Hamiltonian. The emphasis is on the polaron optical absorption, with detailed
mathematical derivations.
