Let $G$ be an unramified group over a $p$-adic field. This article introduces
a base change homomorphism for Bernstein centers of depth-zero principal series
blocks for $G$ and proves the corresponding base change fundamental lemma. This
result is used in the approach to Shimura varieties with $\Gamma_1(p)$-level
structure initiated by M. Rapoport and the author in [HR2].
