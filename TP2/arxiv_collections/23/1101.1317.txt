The reaction $e^+ e^- \to (D_s^{*+} D_s^- + {\rm c.c.})$ has been used with
great success at the CLEO-c detector, and will be a source of valuable future
data from the BES-III detector, to obtain information about the properties and
decays of the $D_s$ and $D_s^*$. The angular distributions of the $D_s^*$ and
the final-state particles in $D_s^* \to D_s \gamma$ are needed to model the
decays properly, to confirm the spin-parity assignment $J^P(D_s^*) = 1^-$, and
to model the acceptance for the rare process $D_s^* \to D_s e^+ e^-$. This note
presents some of the necessary expressions.
