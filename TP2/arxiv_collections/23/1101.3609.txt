Hidden Fermi liquid theory explicitly accounts for the effects of Gutzwiller
projection in the t-J Hamiltonian, widely believed to contain the essential
physics of the high-Tc superconductors. We derive expressions for the entire
"strange metal", normal state relating angle-resolved photoemission,
resistivity, Hall angle, and by generalizing the formalism to include the Fermi
surface topology - angle-dependent magnetoresistance. We show this theory to be
the first self-consistent description for the normal state of the cuprates
based on transparent, fundamental assumptions. Our well-defined formalism also
serves as a guide for further experimental confirmation.
