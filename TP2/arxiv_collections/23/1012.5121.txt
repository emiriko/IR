It is well known that global symmetries protect local supersymmetry and a
zero value for the cosmological constant in no--scale supergravity. The
breakdown of these symmetries, which ensure the vanishing of the vacuum energy
density, results in a set of degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken
supersymmetry leading to the natural realisation of the multiple point
principle (MPP). Assuming the degeneracy of vacua with broken and unbroken SUSY
in the hidden sector we estimate the value of the cosmological constant. We
argue that the observed value of the dark energy density can be reproduced in
the split-SUSY scenario if the SUSY breaking scale is of the order of 10^{10}
GeV.
