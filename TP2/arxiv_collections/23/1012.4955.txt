Quantum transport properties of disordered graphene with structural defects
(Stone-Wales and divacancies) are investigated using a realistic {\pi}-{\pi}*
tight-binding model elaborated from ab initio calculations. Mean free paths and
semiclassical conductivities are then computed as a function of the nature and
density of defects (using an order-N real-space Kubo-Greenwood method). By
increasing of the defect density, the decay of the semiclassical conductivities
is predicted to saturate to a minimum value of 4e^2/{\pi}h over a large range
(plateau) of carrier density (> 0.5 10^{14}cm^{-2}). Additionally, strong
contributions of quantum interferences suggest that the Anderson localization
regime could be experimentally measurable for a defect density as low as 1%.
