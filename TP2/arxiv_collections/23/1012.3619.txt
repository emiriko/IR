The Pixel 2010 conference focused on semiconductor pixel detectors for
particle tracking/vertexing as well as for imaging, in particular for
synchrotron light sources and XFELs. The big LHC hybrid pixel detectors have
impressively started showing their capabilities. X-ray imaging detectors, also
using the hybrid pixel technology, have greatly advanced the experimental
possibilities for diiffraction experiments. Monolithic or semi-monolithic
devices like CMOS active pixels and DEPFET pixels have now reached a state such
that complete vertex detectors for RHIC and superKEKB are being built with
these technologies. Finally, new advances towards fully monolithic active pixel
detectors, featuring full CMOS electronics merged with efficient signal charge
collection, exploiting standard CMOS technologies, SOI and/or 3D integration,
show the path for the future. This r\'esum\'e attempts to extract the main
statements of the results and developments presented at this conference.
