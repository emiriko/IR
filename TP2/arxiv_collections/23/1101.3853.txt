The combined effect of viscosity and vorticity on the growth rate of the
bubble associated with single mode Rayleigh -Taylor instability is
investigated. It is shown that the effect of viscosity on the motion of the
lighter fluid associated with vorticity accumulated inside the bubble due to
mass ablation may be such as to reduce the net viscous drag on the bubble
exerted by the upper heavier fluid as the former rises through it.
