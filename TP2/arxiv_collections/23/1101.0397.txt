We discuss functional-integral approaches to far-from-equilibrium quantum
many-body dynamics. Specific techniques considered include the
two-particle-irreducible effective action and the real-time flow-equation
approach. Different applications, including equilibration after a sudden
parameter change and non-equilibrium critical phenomena, illustrate the
potential of these methods.
