The neutron pair correlation in nuclei near the neutron drip-line is
investigated using the selfconsistent continuum Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
theory formulated with the coordinate-space Green's function technique.
Numerical analysis is performed for even-even N = 86 isotones in the Mo-Sn
region, where the 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 orbits lying near the Fermi energy are either
weakly bound or unbound. The quasiparticle states originating from the l = 1
orbits form resonances with large widths, which are due to the low barrier
height and the strong continuum coupling caused by the pair potential.
Analyzing in detail the pairing properties and roles of the quasiparticle
resonances, we found that the l = 1 broad quasiparticle resonances persist to
feel the pair potential and contribute to the pair correlation even when their
widths are comparable with the resonance energy.
