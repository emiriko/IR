In the third part of the series presenting the Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment (OGLE) microlensing studies of the dark matter halo compact objects
(MACHOs) we describe results of the OGLE-III monitoring of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). This unprecedented data set contains almost continuous photometric
coverage over 8 years of about 35 million objects spread over 40 square
degrees. We report a detection of two candidate microlensing events found with
the automated pipeline and an additional two, less probable, candidate events
found manually. The optical depth derived for the two main candidates was
calculated following a detailed blending examination and detection efficiency
determination and was found to be tau=(0.16+-0.12)10^-7.
  If the microlensing signal we observe originates from MACHOs it means their
masses are around 0.2 M_Sun and they compose only f=3+-2 per cent of the mass
of the Galactic Halo. However, the more likely explanation of our detections
does not involve dark matter compact objects at all and rely on natural effect
of self-lensing of LMC stars by LMC lenses. In such a scenario we can almost
completely rule out MACHOs in the sub-solar mass range with an upper limit at
f<7 per cent reaching its minimum of f<4 per cent at M=0.1 M_Sun. For masses
around M=10 M_Sun the constraints on the MACHOs are more lenient with f ~ 20
per cent. Owing to limitations of the survey there is no reasonable limit found
for heavier masses, leaving only a tiny window of mass spectrum still available
for dark matter compact objects.
