We are developing fast photon-counter instruments to study the rapid
variability of astrophysical sources by time tagging photon arrival times with
unprecedented accuracy, making use of a Rubidium clock and GPS receiver. The
first realization of such optical photon-counters, dubbed Aqueye (the Asiago
Quantum Eye), was mounted in 2008 at the 182cm Copernicus Observatory in
Asiago. Aqueye observed the Crab pulsar several times and collected data of
extraordinary quality that allowed us to perform accurate optical timing of the
Crab pulsar and to study the pulse shape stability on a timescale from days to
years with an excellent definition. Our results reinforce the evidence for
decadal stability of the inclination angle between the spin and magnetic axis
of the Crab pulsar. Future realizations of our instrument will make use of the
Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) time signal.
