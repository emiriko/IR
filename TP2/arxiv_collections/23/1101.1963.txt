In recent years many models of supersymmetry have implied a large production
rate for events including a high multiplicity of third generation quarks, such
as four top quarks. It is arguably the best-motivated channel for early LHC
discovery. A particular example is generic string theories compactified to four
dimensions with stabilized moduli which typically have multi-TeV squarks and
lighter gluinos (below a TeV) with a large pair production rate and large
branching ratios to four tops. We update and sharpen the analysis 4-top signals
and background to 7 TeV LHC energy. For 1 fb-1 integrated luminosity, gluinos
up to about 650 GeV in mass can be detected, with larger masses accessible for
higher luminosities or at higher energies. More than one signature is likely to
be accessible, with one charged lepton plus two or more b-jets, and/or
same-sign dileptons plus b-jets being the best channels. A non-Standard Model
signal from counting is robust, and provides information on the gluino mass,
cross section, and spin.
