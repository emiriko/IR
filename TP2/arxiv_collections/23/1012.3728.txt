Within the variational approach of Bose liquids we analyze the g.s. energy of
charge neutral alpha matter at $T$=0. As a prerequisite for such calculation we
take from the literature or propose new $\alp-\alp$ potentials that are
particularly suitable for this task, i.e. posses a repulsive core and/or
reproduce the low energy scattering data and the resonance properties of the
$\alp-\alp$ system. The alpha matter EOS is then obtained with the HNC method
using Pandharipande-Bethe correlation derived variationally in the lowest order
expansion of the energy functional or a simple gaussian function with a healing
range determined by the normalization of the radial distribution function in
the lowest order. We show that saturation is achieved only via repulsive and
shallow potentials that are not consistent with the scattering and resonance
constraints.
