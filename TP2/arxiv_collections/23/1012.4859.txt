With the launch of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), a new era
of detecting planetary debris around white dwarfs has begun with the WISE
InfraRed Excesses around Degenerates (WIRED) Survey. The WIRED Survey will be
sensitive to substellar objects and dusty debris around white dwarfs out to
distances exceeding 100 pc, well beyond the completeness level of local WDs and
covering a large fraction of known WDs detected with the SDSS DR4 white dwarf
catalogue. In this paper we report an initial result of the WIRED survey, the
detection of the heavily polluted hydrogen white dwarf (spectral type DAZ)
GALEX J193156.8+011745 at 3.35 and 4.6 \micron. We find that the excess is
consistent with either a narrow dusty ring with an inner radius of 29 $R_{\rm
WD}$, outer radius of 40 $R_{\rm WD}$, and a face-on inclination, or a disk
with an inclination of 70$^\circ$, an inner radius of 23 $R_{\rm WD}$, and an
outer radius of 80 $R_{\rm WD}$. We also report initial optical spectroscopic
monitoring of several metal lines present in the photosphere and find no
variability in the line strengths or radial velocities of the lines. We rule
out all but planetary mass companions to GALEX1931 out to 0.5 AU.
