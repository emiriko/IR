First exclusive data for the $pp \to nn\pi^+\pi^+$ reaction have been
obtained at CELSIUS with the WASA detector setup at a beam energy of $T_p$ =
1.1 GeV. Total and differential cross sections disagree with theoretical
calculations, which predict the $\Delta\Delta$ excitation to be the dominant
process at this beam energy. Instead the data require the excitation of a
higher-lying $\Delta$ state, most likely the $\Delta(1600)$, to be the leading
process.
