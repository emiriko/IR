We summarize the higher-loop perturbative computation of the ghost and gluon
propagators in SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory. Our final aim is to compare with
results from lattice simulations in order to expose the genuinely
non-perturbative content of the latter. By means of Numerical Stochastic
Perturbation Theory we compute the ghost and gluon propagators in Landau gauge
up to three and four loops. We present results in the infinite volume and $a
\to 0$ limits, based on a general fitting strategy.
