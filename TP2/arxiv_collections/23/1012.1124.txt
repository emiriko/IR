We provide a generalization of the reduction and Robertson positive maps in
matrix algebras. They give rise to a new class of optimal entanglement
witnesses. Their structural physical approximation is analyzed. As a byproduct
we provide a new examples of PPT (Positive Partial Transpose) entangled states.
