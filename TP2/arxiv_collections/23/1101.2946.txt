In this paper, a representation of the information-disturbance theorem based
on the quantum Kolmogorov complexity that was defined by P. Vitanyi has been
examined. In the quantum information theory, the information-disturbance
relationship, which treats the trade-off relationship between information gain
and its caused disturbance, is a fundamental result that is related to
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The problem was formulated in a
cryptographic setting and quantitative relationships between complexities have
been derived.
