The channeling of the recoiling nucleus in crystalline detectors after a WIMP
collision would produce a larger scintillation or ionization signal in direct
detection experiments than otherwise expected. I present estimates of the
importance of this effect in NaI, Si and Ge crystals, using analytic models
developed from the 1960's onwards to describe channeling and blocking effects.
