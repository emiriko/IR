Some one-neutron halo nuclei can emit a proton in a beta decay of the halo
neutron. The branching ratio towards this rare decay mode is calculated within
a two-body potential model of the initial core+neutron bound state and final
core+proton scattering states. The decay probability per second is evaluated
for the $^{11}$Be, $^{19}$C and $^{31}$Ne one-neutron halo nuclei. It is very
sensitive to the neutron separation energy.
