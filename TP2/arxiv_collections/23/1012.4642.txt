We study the prospects of observing the presence of a relatively light Elko
particle as a possible dark matter candidate, by pointing out a typical
signature for the process encompassing the Elko non-locality, exploring some
consequences of the unusual Elko propagator behavior when analyzed outside the
Elko axis of propagation. We also consider the production of a light Elko
associated to missing energy and isolated leptons at the LHC, with center of
mass energy of 7 and 14 TeV and total luminosity from $1 fb^{-1}$ to $10
fb^{-1}$. Basically, the Elko non locality engenders a peculiar signal in the
missing energy turning it sensible to the angle of detection.
