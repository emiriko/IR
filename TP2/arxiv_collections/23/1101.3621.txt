In the present paper, we give an explicit description of the affine analogs
of Berenstein-Zelevinsky data constructed in our previous paper: Toward
Berenstein-Zelevinsky data in affine type $A$, I: Construction of affine
analogs (arXiv:1009.4526), in terms of certain collections of nonnegative
integers, which we call Lusztig data of type $A_{l-1}^{(1)}$.
