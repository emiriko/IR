The QCD analysis of hadronic tau decays is reviewed and a summary of the
present phenomenological status is presented. The following topics are
discussed: the determination of alpha_s(m_tau) = 0.338 +- 0.012 from the
inclusive tau hadronic width, the measurement of |V_us| through the
Cabibbo-suppressed decays of the tau, and the extraction of
chiral-perturbation-theory couplings from the spectral tau data.
