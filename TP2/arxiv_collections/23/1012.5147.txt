Layered-antiferromagnetic compound CuCrS2 has been prepared by different
methods. The analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns of different samples gave
significant amount of vacancy-disorder of Cr-atoms within the layers. Extended
period of sintering above 9000C increases the transfer of Cr-atoms to the
interstitial sites between the layers. This disorder has marginal effect on the
Antiferromagnetic properties. The electrical conductivity is increased and the
thermoelectric power remains positive and quite high between 150-400\muV/K in
the paramagnetic state around room temperature with increase in disorder in
different samples. We interpret the temperature dependence of electrical
resistivity and thermoelectric power due to the localization of carriers by
interstitial defects and the formation of magnetic polarons in the paramagnetic
phase of CuCrS2.
