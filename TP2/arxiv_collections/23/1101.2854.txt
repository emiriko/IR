Systems consisting of identical bosons with a large scattering length satisfy
universal relations determined by 2-body physics that are similar to those for
fermions with two spin states. They require the momentum distribution to have a
large-momentum 1/k^4 tail and the radio-frequency transition rate to have a
high-frequency 1/omega^{3/2} tail, both of which are proportional to the 2-body
contact. Identical bosons also satisfy additional universal relations that are
determined by 3-body physics and involve the 3-body contact, which measures the
probability of 3 particles being very close together. The coefficients of the
3-body contact in the 1/k^5 tail of the momentum distribution and in the
1/omega^2 tail of the radio-frequency transition rate are log-periodic
functions of k and omega that depend on the Efimov parameter.
