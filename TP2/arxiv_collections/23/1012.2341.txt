Let $\UT_n(q)$ denote the group of unipotent $n\times n$ upper triangular
matrices over a field with $q$ elements. The degrees of the complex irreducible
characters of $\UT_n(q)$ are precisely the integers $q^e$ with $0\leq e\leq
\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor$, and it has been
conjectured that the number of irreducible characters of $\UT_n(q)$ with degree
$q^e$ is a polynomial in $q-1$ with nonnegative integer coefficients (depending
on $n$ and $e$). We confirm this conjecture when $e\leq 8$ and $n$ is arbitrary
by a computer calculation. In particular, we describe an algorithm which allows
us to derive explicit bivariate polynomials in $n$ and $q$ giving the number of
irreducible characters of $\UT_n(q)$ with degree $q^e$ when $n>2e$ and $e\leq
8$. When divided by $q^{n-e-2}$ and written in terms of the variables $n-2e-1$
and $q-1$, these functions are actually bivariate polynomials with nonnegative
integer coefficients, suggesting an even stronger conjecture concerning such
character counts. As an application of these calculations, we are able to show
that all irreducible characters of $\UT_n(q)$ with degree $\leq q^8$ are
Kirillov functions. We also discuss some related results concerning the problem
of counting the irreducible constituents of individual supercharacters of
$\UT_n(q)$.
