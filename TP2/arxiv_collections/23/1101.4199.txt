We present a summary of a recent workshop held at Duke University on Partonic
Transverse Momentum in Hadrons: Quark Spin-Orbit Correlations and Quark-Gluon
Interactions. The transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions
(TMDs), parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions, and multi-parton correlation
functions, were discussed extensively at the Duke workshop. In this paper, we
summarize first the theoretical issues concerning the study of partonic
structure of hadrons at a future electron-ion collider (EIC) with emphasis on
the TMDs. We then present simulation results on experimental studies of TMDs
through measurements of single spin asymmetries (SSA) from semi-inclusive
deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) processes with an EIC, and discuss the
requirement of the detector for SIDIS measurements. The dynamics of parton
correlations in the nucleon is further explored via a study of SSA in D (`D)
production at large transverse momenta with the aim of accessing the unexplored
tri-gluon correlation functions. The workshop participants identified the SSA
measurements in SIDIS as a golden program to study TMDs in both the sea and
valence quark regions and to study the role of gluons, with the Sivers
asymmetry measurements as examples. Such measurements will lead to major
advancement in our understanding of TMDs in the valence quark region, and more
importantly also allow for the investigation of TMDs in the sea quark region
along with a study of their evolution.
