Unconventional peak structure in the Raman spectra due to magnon excitation
at low temperature is observed in spinel magnet ${\rm MnV_2O_4}$, where a
noncollinear spin state is realized by geometrical frustration. We propose a
new mechanism to induce such a Raman scattering process due to a one-magnon
excitation of the noncollinear spin state. Novel features of the scattering
such as selection rules and peak position observed experimentally in ${\rm
MnV_2O_4}$ can be explained quite naturally by considering the present
one-magnon process. We also discuss that such one-magnon process may exist in
various materials with noncollinear spin structures.
