In this work we study collapse of a general matter in a most general
spacetime i.e., a spacetime with any matter and without (assuming) any
symmetry. We show that the energy is completely trapped inside the null
singularity and therefore they cannot be experimentally observed. This most
general result implies, there is no physical significance of the null naked
singularities irrespective of their existence. This conclusion strongly
supports the essence of cosmic censorship hypothesis.
