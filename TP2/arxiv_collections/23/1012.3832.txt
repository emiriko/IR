The implementation of the dynamics in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is still an
open problem. Here, we discuss a tentative dynamics for the simplest class of
graphs in LQG: Two vertices linked with an arbitrary number of edges. We use
the recently introduced U(N) framework in order to construct SU(2) invariant
operators and define a global U(N) symmetry that will select the
homogeneous/isotropic states. Finally, we propose a Hamiltonian operator
invariant under area-preserving deformations of the boundary surface and we
identify possible connections of this model with Loop Quantum Cosmology.
