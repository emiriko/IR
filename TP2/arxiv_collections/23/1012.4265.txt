Quasielastic double differential neutrino cross sections can be obtained in a
phenomenological model based on the superscaling behavior of electron
scattering data. In this talk the superscaling approach (SuSA) is reviewed and
its validity is tested in a relativistic shell model. Results including meson
exchange currents for the kinematics of the MiniBoone experiment are presented.
