The large center-of-mass energies available to the heavy-ion program at the
LHC and recent experimental advances at RHIC will enable QCD matter at very
high temperatures and energy densities, that is, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP),
to be probed in unprecedented ways. Fully-reconstructed inclusive jets and the
away-side hadron showers associated with electroweak bosons, that is, tagged
jets, are among these exciting new probes. Full jet reconstruction provides an
experimental window into the mechanisms of quark and gluon dynamics in the QGP
which is not accessible via leading particles and leading particle
correlations. Theoretical advances in these exciting new fields of research can
help resolve some of the most controversial points in heavy ion physics today
such as the significance of the radiative, collisional and dissociative
processes in the QGP and the applicability of strong versus weak coupling
regimes to describe jet production and propagation. In this proceedings, I will
present results on the production and subsequent suppression of high energy
jets tagged with Z bosons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC
energies using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) parton energy loss approach.
