We discuss the Nakamura's conjecture stating that the Tomimatsu-Sato black
hole solution with integer deformation parameter $n$ is composed of the special
solutions of the Toda molecule equation at the $n$-th lattice site. From the
previous work, in which the conjecture was partly analytically proved, we go
further towards final full proof by rearranging the rotation parameter. The
proof is explicitly performed for the highest and lowest orders. Though the
proof for all orders remains still unsolved, the prospect to the full proof
becomes transparent and workable by our method.
