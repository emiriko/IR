The gravitational field of an isolated, axisymmetric flat disk of spinning
dust is calculated approximately in the weak-field limit of quasi-metric
gravity. Boundary conditions single out the exponential disk as a "preferred"
physical surface density profile. Besides, collective properties of the disk,
in the form of an extra "associated induced" surface density playing the role
of "dark matter", also emerge. Taken as an idealized model of spiral galaxy
thin disks, it is shown that including this "dark matter" into the model as a
gravitating source, yields asymptotically flat rotation curves and a
correspondence with MOND.
