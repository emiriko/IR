We consider a supersymmetric model with extra $U(1)_B \times U(1)_L$ gauge
symmetry that are broken spontaneously. Salient features of this model are that
there are three different types of cold dark matter (CDM) candidates, and
neutral scalar sector has a rich structure. Light CDM with $\sigma_{\rm SI}
\sim 10^{-3\pm 1}$ pb can be easily accommodated by leptophobic dark matter
($\chi_B$) with correct relic density, if the $U(1)_B$ gauge boson mass is
around $2 m_{\chi_B}$. Also the PAMELA and Fermi/LAT data can be fit by
leptophilic CDM with mass $\sim 1$ TeV. There could be interesting signatures
of new fermions and new gauge bosons at the LHC.
