A sufficient condition for the uniqueness of multinomial sequential unbiased
estimators is provided generalizing a classical result for binomial samples.
Unbiased estimators are applied to infer the parameters of multidimensional or
multinomial Random Walks which are observed until they reach a boundary. An
application to clinical trials is presented.
