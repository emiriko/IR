The form factors for the transitions pi-photon, eta-photon, eta'-photon and
etac-photon are analyzed within the modified perturbative approach in which
quark transverse degrees of freedom are retained. The results for the form
factors are compared to experiment in detail. As compared to previous
calculations within the same approach only little modifications of the meson
distribution amplitudes are required in general in order to achieve agreement
with experiment. Only for the pi-photon form factor a strong contribution from
the second Gegenbauer term is found. It is also commented on the case of two
virtual photons and on the transition form factors in the time-like region.
