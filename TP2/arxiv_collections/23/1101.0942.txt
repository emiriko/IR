One of the longstanding unsolved problems of planet formation is how solid
bodies of a few decimeters in size can "stick" to form large planetesimals.
This is known as the "meter size barrier". In recent years it has become
increasingly clear that some form of "particle trapping" must have played a
role in overcoming the meter size barrier. Particles can be trapped in
long-lived local pressure maxima, such as those in anticyclonic vortices, zonal
flows or those believed to occur near ice lines or at dead zone boundaries.
Such pressure traps are the ideal sites for the formation of planetesimals and
small planetary embryos. Moreover, they likely produce large quantities of such
bodies in a small region, making it likely that subsequent N-body evolution may
lead to even larger planetary embryos. The goal of this Letter is to show that
this indeed happens, and to study how efficient it is. In particular, we wish
to find out if rocky/icy bodies as large as 10 M_earth can form within 1 Myr,
since such bodies are the precursors of gas giant planets in the core accretion
scenario.
