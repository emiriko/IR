The null search for the Higgs boson at the Tevatron implies strong
constraints on heavy colored particles that increase the gluon-fusion induced
production rate of the Higgs. We investigate the implications of the Tevatron
exclusion limit on example extensions of the Standard Model that contain a new
scalar state transforming as either an adjoint or a fundamental under the QCD
gauge group. The bounds on the adjoint (fundamental) scalar mass exceed 200 GeV
(100 GeV) for natural choices of scalar-sector parameters.
