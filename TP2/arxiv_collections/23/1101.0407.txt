A typical complex system should be described by a supernetwork or a network
of networks, in which the networks are coupled to some other networks. As the
first step to understanding the complex systems on such more systematic level,
scientists studied interdependent multilayer networks. In this letter, we
introduce a new kind of interdependent multilayer networks, i.e.,
interconnecting networks, for which the component networks are coupled each
other by sharing some common nodes. Based on the empirical investigations, we
revealed a common feature of such interconnecting networks, namely, the
networks with smaller averaged topological differences of the interconnecting
nodes tend to share more nodes. A very simple node sharing mechanism is
proposed to analytically explain the observed feature of the interconnecting
networks.
