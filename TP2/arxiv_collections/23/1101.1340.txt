We report on recent measurements, from the BaBar and Belle experiments, of
B-meson decays to purely hadronic final states that do not contain charm. The
studies are based on large samples of BBbar pairs collected at the Upsilon(4S)
or B_s(*)B_s(*) pairs collected at the Upsilon(5S) by the BaBar and Belle
detectors at the asymmetric energy e+e- colliders at SLAC and KEK-B,
respectively. This paper includes the following results: measurements of
branching fractions and charge asymmetries of B meson decays to eta' rho, eta'
f0, and eta' K*, where the K* stands for a vector, tensor, or scalar strange
meson; a search for B0 ->K+ pi- K+/- pi+/-, including the K*0 resonance; a
search for B+ -> a_1+ K*0, an axial-vector vector final state; a measurement of
B_s0 -> hh branching fractions, where h = K+, Ks0, or pi+; and inclusive
branching fraction measurements of B+ -> K+ pi0 pi0 and B0 -> pi+ Ks0 K-.
