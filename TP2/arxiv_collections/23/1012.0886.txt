Traditional black-hole binary puncture initial data is conformally flat. This
unphysical assumption is coupled with a lack of radiation signature from the
binary's past life. As a result, waveforms extracted from evolutions of this
data display an abrupt jump. In Kelly et al. [Class.Quant.Grav.27:114005,2010],
a new binary black-hole initial data with radiation contents derived in the
post-Newtonian (PN) calculation was adapted to puncture evolutions in numerical
relativity. This data satisfies the constraint equations to the 2.5PN order,
and contains a transverse-traceless "wavy" metric contribution, violating the
standard assumption of conformal flatness. Although the evolution contained
less spurious radiation, there were undesired features; the unphysical horizon
mass loss and the large initial orbital eccentricity. Introducing a hybrid
approach to the initial data evaluation, we significantly reduce these
undesired features.
