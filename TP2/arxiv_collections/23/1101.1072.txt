We discuss perturbative O(g^2a) matching with static heavy quarks and
domain-wall light quarks for lattice operators relevant to B-meson decays and
$B^0$-$\bar{B}^0$ mixing. The chiral symmetry of the light domain-wall quarks
does not prohibit operator mixing at O(a) for these operators. The O(a)
corrections to physical quantities are non-negligible and must be included to
obtain high-precision simulation results for CKM physics. We provide results
using plaquette, Symanzik, Iwasaki and DBW2 gluon actions and applying APE,
HYP1 and HYP2 link-smearing for the static quark action.
