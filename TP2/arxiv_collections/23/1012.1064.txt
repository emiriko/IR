We study the single spin asymmetry (SSA) for the D-meson production $A_N^D$
in the $pp$ collision, $p^\uparrow p\to DX$, in the framework of the collinear
factorization. Since the charm quark is mainly produced through the
$c\bar{c}$-pair creation from the gluon-fusion process, this is an ideal
process to probe the twist-3 triple-gluon correlation functions in the
polarized nucleon. We derive the corresponding cross section formula for the
contribution of the triple-gluon correlation function to $A_N^D$ in $p^\uparrow
p\to DX$, applying the method developed for $ep^\uparrow\to eDX$ in our
previous study. As in the case of $ep^\uparrow\to eDX$, our result differs from
a previous study in the literature. We will also present a simple estimate of
the triple-gluon correlation functions based on the preliminary data on $A_N^D$
by RHIC.
