Thermodynamic properties of the helical spins with magnetoelectric coupling
is simulated by Monte Carlo algorithm. It is shown that the spin-spin
correlations are affected by the thermal fluctuations and the electric field.
Results for the temperature-dependence of ferroelectric polarization and the
susceptibility are also presented in connection with the multiferroic phase
transition.
