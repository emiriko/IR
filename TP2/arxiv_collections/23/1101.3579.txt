We show how a robust high-fidelity universal set of quantum gates can be
implemented using a single form of non-adiabatic rapid passage whose parameters
are optimized to maximize gate fidelity and reward gate robustness. Each gate
in the universal set is found to operate with a fidelity F in the range 0.99988
< F < 0.99999, and to require control parameters with no more than 14-bit (1
part in 10,000) precision. Such precision is within reach of commercially
available arbitrary waveform generators, so that an experimental study of this
approach to high-fidelity universal quantum control appears feasible.
