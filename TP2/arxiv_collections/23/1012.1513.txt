Detection and quantification of entanglement in quantum resources are two key
steps in the implementation of various quantum-information processing tasks.
Here, we show that Bell-type inequalities are not only useful in verifying the
presence of entanglement but can also be used to bound the entanglement of the
underlying physical system. Our main tool consists of a family of
Clauser-Horne-like Bell inequalities that cannot be violated maximally by any
finite-dimensional maximally entangled state. Using these inequalities, we
demonstrate the explicit construction of both lower and upper bounds on the
concurrence for two-qubit states. The fact that these bounds arise from
Bell-type inequalities also allows them to be obtained in a
semi-device-independent manner, that is, with assumption of the dimension of
the Hilbert space but without resorting to any knowledge of the actual
measurements being performed on the individual subsystems.
