Several approaches to photonuclear reactions, based on the time-dependent
density-functional theory, have been developed recently. The standard
linearization leads to the random-phase approximation (RPA) or the
quasiparticle-random-phase approximation (QRPA). We have developed a
parallelized QRPA computer program for axially deformed nuclei. We also present
a feasible approach to the (Q)RPA calculation, that is the finite amplitude
method (FAM). We show results of photoabsorption cross sections for deformed
nuclei using the QRPA and FAM calculations. Finally, the canonical-basis
approach to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method is presented, to
demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness.
