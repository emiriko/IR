We phenomenologically developed a propagation model of high energy galactic
cosmic rays. We derived the analytical solutions by adopting the semi-empirical
diffusion equation, proposed by Berezinskii {\it et al.}(1990) and the
diffusion tensor proposed by Ptuskin {\it et al.}(1993). This model takes into
account both the symmetric diffusion and the antisymmetric diffusion due to the
particle Hall drift. Our solutions are an extension of the model developed by
Ptuskin {\it et al.} (1993) to a two-dimensional two-layer (galactic disk and
halo) model, and they coincide completely with the solution derived by
Berezinskii {\it et al.} (1990) in the absence of antisymmetric diffusion due
to Hall drift. We showed that this relatively simple toy model can be used to
explain the variation in the exponent of the cosmic ray energy spectrum,
$\gamma$, around the knee $E \approx 10^{15}$ eV.
