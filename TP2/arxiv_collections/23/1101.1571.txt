The microscopic structure of neutron-rich sd-shell nuclei is investigated by
using the spherical shell-model in the sd-pf valence space with the extended
pairing plus quadrupole-quadrupole forces accompanied by the monopole
interaction (EPQQM). The calculation reproduces systematically the known energy
levels for even-even and odd-mass nuclei including the recent data for 43S, 46S
and 47Ar. In particular, the erosion of the N=28 shell closure in 42Si can be
explained. Our EPQQM results are compared with other shell-model calculations
with the SDPF-NR and SDPF-U effective interactions.
