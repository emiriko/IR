A quantum-kinetic theory of direct and phonon mediated indirect optical
transitions is developed within the framework of the non-equilibrium Green's
function formalism. After validation against the standard Fermi-Golden-Rule
approach in the bulk case, it is used in the simulation of photocurrent
generation in ultra-thin crystalline silicon p-i-n-junction devices.
