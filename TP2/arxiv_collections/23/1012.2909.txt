The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) will be producing 2.2 terabyte HI
spectral-line cubes for each 8 hours of observation by 2013. Global views of
spectral data cubes are vital for the detection of instrumentation errors, the
identification of data artefacts and noise characteristics, and the discovery
of strange phenomena, unexpected relations, or unknown patterns. We have
previously presented the first framework that can render ASKAP-sized cubes at
interactive frame rates. The framework provides the user with a real-time
interactive volume rendering by combining shared and distributed memory
architectures, distributed CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs), using the
ray-casting algorithm. In this paper we present two main extensions of this
framework which are: using a multi-panel display system to provide a high
resolution rendering output, and the ability to integrate automated data
analysis tools into the visualization output and to interact with its output in
place.
