We show that a quantum scalar particle in the gravitational field of a
massive body of radius R which slightly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius r_s,
possesses a dense spectrum of narrow resonances. Their lifetimes and density
tend to infinity in the limit R -> r_s. We determine the cross section of the
particle capture into these resonances and show that it is equal to the
absorption cross section for a Schwarzschild black hole. Thus, a non-singular
static metric acquires black-hole properties before the actual formation of a
black hole.
