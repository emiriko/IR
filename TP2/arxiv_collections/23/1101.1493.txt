We apply the generic dynamical scaling theory (GDST) to the surfaces of CdTe
polycrystalline films grown in glass substrates. The analysed data were
obtained with a stylus profiler with an estimated resolution lateral resolution
of $l_c=0.3 \mu$m. Both real two-point correlation function and power spectrum
analyses were done. We found that the GDST applied to the surface power spectra
foresees faceted morphology in contrast with the self-affine surface indicated
by the local roughness exponent found via the height-height correlation
function. This inconsistency is explained in terms of convolution effects
resulting from the finite size of the probe tip used to scan the surfaces. High
resolution AFM images corroborates the predictions of GDST.
