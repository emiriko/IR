We present results of direct numerical simulations of passive scalar
advection and diffusion in turbulent rotating flows. Scaling laws and the
development of anisotropy are studied in spectral space, and in real space
using an axisymmetric decomposition of velocity and passive scalar structure
functions. The passive scalar is more anisotropic than the velocity field, and
its power spectrum follows a spectral law consistent with $\sim
k_\perp^{-3/2}$. This scaling is explained with phenomenological arguments that
consider the effect of rotation. Intermittency is characterized using scaling
exponents and probability density functions of velocity and passive scalar
increments. In the presence of rotation, intermittency in the velocity field
decreases more noticeably than in the passive scalar. The scaling exponents
show good agreement with Kraichnan's prediction for passive scalar
intermittency in two-dimensions, after correcting for the observed scaling of
the second order exponent.
