Entanglement witnesses (EWs) constitute one of the most important
entanglement detectors in quantum systems. Nevertheless, their complete
characterization, in particular with respect to the notion of optimality, is
still missing, even in the decomposable case. Here we show that for any
qubit-qunit decomposable EW (DEW) W the three statements are equivalent: (i)
the set of product vectors obeying \bra{e,f}W\ket{e,f}=0 spans the
corresponding Hilbert space, (ii) W is optimal, (iii) W=Q^{\Gamma} with Q
denoting a positive operator supported on a completely entangled subspace (CES)
and \Gamma standing for the partial transposition. While, implications
$(i)\Rightarrow(ii)$ and $(ii)\Rightarrow(iii)$ are known, here we prove that
(iii) implies (i). This is a consequence of a more general fact saying that
product vectors orthogonal to any CES in C^{2}\otimes C^{n} span after partial
conjugation the whole space. On the other hand, already in the case of
C^{3}\otimes C^{3} Hilbert space, there exist DEWs for which (iii) does not
imply (i). Consequently, either (i) does not imply (ii), or (ii) does not imply
(iii), and the above transparent characterization obeyed by qubit-qunit DEWs,
does not hold in general.
