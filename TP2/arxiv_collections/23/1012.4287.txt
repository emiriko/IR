Black hole entropy has been shown by 't Hooft to diverge at the horizon,
whereas entanglement entropy in general does not. We show that because the
region near the horizon is a thermal state, entropy is linear to energy, and
energy at a barrier is inversely proportional to barrier slope, and diverges at
an infinitely sharp barrier as a result of position/momentum uncertainty. We
show that 't Hooft's divergence at the black hole is also an example of
momentum/position uncertainty, as seen by the fact that the "brick wall" which
corrects it in fact smooths the sharp boundary into a more gradual slope. This
removes a major obstacle to identification of black hole entropy with
entanglement entropy.
