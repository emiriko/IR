We consider a particle in one dimension submitted to amplitude and phase
disorder. It can be mapped onto the complex Burgers equation, and provides a
toy model for problems with interplay of interferences and disorder, such as
the NSS model of hopping conductivity in disordered insulators and the
Chalker-Coddington model for the (spin) quantum Hall effect. The model has
three distinct phases: (I) a {\em high-temperature} or weak disorder phase,
(II) a {\em pinned} phase for strong amplitude disorder, and (III) a {\em
diffusive} phase for strong phase disorder, but weak amplitude disorder. We
compute analytically the renormalized disorder correlator, equivalent to the
Burgers velocity-velocity correlator at long times. In phase III, it assumes a
universal form. For strong phase disorder, interference leads to a logarithmic
singularity, related to zeroes of the partition sum, or poles of the complex
Burgers velocity field. These results are valuable in the search for the
adequate field theory for higher-dimensional systems.
