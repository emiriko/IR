Since its launch in 1990, HST has played a leading role in optical studies of
isolated neutron stars, both radio-loud pulsars and radio-silent ones, paving
the way to follow-up observations performed with 8m-class telescopes, like the
VLT, the Gemini, and Subaru. Here, I present the last results obtained mostly
by the WFPC2, before its de-commissioning during the last refurbishment mission
in May 2009, from the observations of the rotation-powered pulsars PSR
B0540-69, PSR B1055-52 and of the CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 in the PKS 1209-52 SNR.
