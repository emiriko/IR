A significant amount of high-impact contemporary scientific research occurs
where biology, computer science, engineering and chemistry converge. Although
programmes have been put in place to support such work, the complex dynamics of
interdisciplinarity are still poorly understood. In this paper we interrogate
the nature of interdisciplinary research and how we might measure its
"success", identify potential barriers to its implementation, and suggest
possible mechanisms for removing these impediments.
