We have studied boron nitride monolayer and bilayer band structures. For
bilayers, the ground state energies of the different five stackings are
computed using DFT in order to determine the most stable configuration. Also,
the interlayer distance for the five different types of stacking in which
boron-nitride bilayers can be found is determined. Using a minimal tight
binding model for the band structures of boron nitride bilayers, the hopping
parameters and the onsite energies have been extracted by fitting a tight
binding empirical model to the DFT results.
