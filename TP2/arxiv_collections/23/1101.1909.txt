The JEM-EUSO mission explores the origin of the extreme energy cosmic rays
(EECRs) above 100 EeV and explores the limits of the fundamental physics
through the observations of their arrival directions and energies. It is
designed to achieve an exposure larger than 1 million km^2 sr year to open a
new particle astronomy channel. This super-wide-field (60 degrees) telescope
with a diameter of about 2.5 m looks down from space onto the night sky to
detect near UV photons (330-400nm, both fluorescent and Cherenkov photons)
emitted from the giant air showers produced by EECRs. The arrival direction map
with more than five hundred events will tell us the origin of the EECRs and
allow us to identify the nearest EECR sources with known astronomical objects.
It will allow them to be examined in other astronomical channels. This is
likely to lead to an understanding of the acceleration mechanisms, perhaps
producing discoveries in astrophysics and/or fundamental physics. The
comparison of the energy spectra among the spatially resolved individual
sources will help to clarify the acceleration/emission mechanism, and also
finally confirm the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min process for the validation of
Lorentz invariance up to {\gamma}~10^{11}. Neutral components (neutrinos and
gamma rays) can also be detected as well, if their fluxes are high enough. The
JEM-EUSO mission is planned to be launched by a H2B rocket about JFY 2015-2016
and transferred to ISS by H2 Transfer Vehicle (HTV). It will be attached to the
Exposed Facility external experiment platform of "KIBO".
