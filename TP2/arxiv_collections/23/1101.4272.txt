We show that non-Hermitian and nearest-neighbor-interacting perturbations to
the Fritzsch textures of lepton and quark mass matrices can make both of them
fit current experimental data very well. In particular, we obtain \theta_{23}
\simeq 45^\circ for the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and predict
\theta_{13} \simeq 3^\circ to 6^\circ for the smallest neutrino mixing angle
when the perturbations in the lepton sector are at the 20% level. The same
level of perturbations is required in the quark sector, where the Jarlskog
invariant of CP violation is about 3.7 \times 10^{-5}. In comparison, the
strength of leptonic CP violation is possible to reach about 1.5 \times 10^{-2}
in neutrino oscillations.
