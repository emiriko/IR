Worm algorithms have been very successful with the simulation of sigma models
with fixed length spins which result from scalar field theories in the limit of
infinite quartic coupling lambda. Here we investigate closer their algorithmic
efficiency at finite and even vanishing lambda for the one component model in
dimensions D = 2, 3, 4.
