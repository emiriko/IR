We present a catalogue of positions and correlated flux densities of 410
flat-spectrum, compact extragalactic radio sources, previously detected in the
AT20G survey. The catalogue spans the declination range -90deg, -40deg and was
constructed from four 24 hour VLBI observing sessions with the Australian Long
Baseline Array made at 8.3 GHz. The detection rate in these experiments is 97%.
The median uncertainty of source positions is 2.6 mas, the median correlated
flux density at baseline projections lengths longer than 1000 km is 0.14 Jy.
The goal of this work is 1) to provide a pool of sources with positions known
at the milliarcsecond level of accuracy that are needed for phase referencing
observations, for geodetic VLBI, and for space navigation; 2) to extend the
complete flux-limited sample of compact extragalactic sources to the southern
hemisphere; and 3) to investigate parsec-scale properties of high-frequency
selected sources from the AT20G survey. As a result of the campaign, the number
of compact radio sources with declinations < -40deg detectable with VLBI with
measured correlated flux densities and positions known with the milliarcsec
level of accuracies increased by a factor of 3.5. The catalogue and supporting
material is available at http://astrogeo.org/lcs1 .
