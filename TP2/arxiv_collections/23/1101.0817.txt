Microwave Fabry-Perot resonators containing nonlinear mesoscopic elements
(such as superconducting nanowires) can be used to explore many-body circuit
QED. Here, we report on observations of a superconductor-normal pulsing regime
in microwave (GHz) coplanar waveguide resonators consisting of superconducting
MoGe films interrupted by a gap that is bridged by one or more suspended
superconducting nanowires. This regime, which involve MHz-frequency
oscillations in the amplitude of the supercurrent in the resonator, are
achieved when the steady-state amplitude of the current in the driven resonator
exceeds the critical current of the nanowires. Thus we are able to determine
the temperature dependence of the critical current, which agrees well with the
corresponding Bardeen formula. The pulsing regime manifests itself as an
apparent "crater" on top of the fundamental Lorentzian peak of the resonator.
Once the pulsing regime is achieved at a fixed drive power, however, it remains
stable for a range of drive frequencies corresponding to subcritical steady
state currents in the resonator. We develop a phenomenological model of
resonator-nanowire systems, from which we are able to obtain a quantitative
description of the amplitude oscillations and also, inter alia, to investigate
thermal relaxation processes in superconducting nanowires. For the case of
resonators comprising two parallel nanowires and subject to an external
magnetic field, we find field-driven oscillations of the onset power for the
amplitude oscillations, as well as the occurrence (for values of the magnetic
field that strongly frustrate the nanowires) of a distinct steady state in
which the pulsing is replaced by stochastic amplitude-fluctuations. We conclude
by giving a brief discussion of how circuit-QED-based systems have the
potential to facilitate understanding of quantum phase-slips in superconducting
nanowires.
