We propose a stochastic map model of economic dynamics. In the last decade,
an array of observations in economics has been investigated in the econophysics
literature, a major example being the universal features of inequality in terms
of income and wealth. Another area of inquiry is the formation of opinion in a
society. The proposed model attempts to produce positively skewed distributions
and the power law distributions as has been observed in the real data of income
and wealth. Also, it shows a non-trivial phase transition in the opinion of a
society (opinion formation). A number of physical models also generates similar
results. In particular, the kinetic exchange models have been especially
successful in this regard. Therefore, we compare the results obtained from
these two approaches and discuss a number of new features and drawbacks of this
model.
