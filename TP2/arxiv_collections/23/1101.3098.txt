Convex support, the mean values of a set of random variables, is central in
information theory and statistics. Equally central in quantum information
theory are mean values of a set of observables in a finite-dimensional
C*-algebra A, which we call (quantum) convex support. The convex support can be
viewed as a projection of the state space of A and it is a projection of a
spectrahedron.
  Spectrahedra are increasingly investigated at least since the 1990's boom in
semidefinite programming. We recall the geometry of the positive semi-definite
cone and of the state space. We write a convex duality for general self-dual
convex cones. This restricts to projections of state spaces and connects them
to results on spectrahedra.
  Really new in this article is an analysis of the face lattice of convex
support by mapping this lattice to a lattice of orthogonal projections, using
natural isomorphisms. The result encodes the face lattice of the convex support
into a set of projections in A and enables the integration of convex geometry
with matrix calculus or algebraic techniques.
