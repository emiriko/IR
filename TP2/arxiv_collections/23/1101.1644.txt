We revisit the role of attractions in liquids and apply these concepts to
colloidal suspensions. Two means are used to investigate the structure; the
pair correlation function and a recently developed topological method. The
latter identifies structures topologically equivalent to ground state clusters
formed by isolated groups of 5 < m < 13 particles, which are specific to the
system under consideration. Our topological methodology shows that, in the case
of Lennard-Jones, the addition of attractions increases the system's ability to
form larger (m>8) clusters, although pair-correlation functions are almost
identical. Conversely, in the case of short-ranged attractions, pair
correlation functions show a significant response to adding attraction, while
the liquid structure exhibits a strong decrease in clustering upon adding
attractions. Finally, a compressed, weakly interacting system shows a similar
pair structure and topology.
