We show that geometrical scaling exhibited by the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra
measured by the CMS collaboration at the LHC is substantially improved if the
exponent $\lambda$ of the saturation scale depends on $p_{\rm T}$. This
dependence is shown to be the same as the dependence of small $x$ exponent of
$F_2$ structure function in deep inelastic scattering taken at the scale
$Q=p_{\rm T}/2$
