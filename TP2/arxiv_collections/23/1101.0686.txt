We investigate the operation of pyramidal magneto-optical traps (MOTs)
microfabricated in silicon. Measurements of the loading and loss rates give
insight into the role of the nearby surface in the MOT dynamics. Studies of the
fluorescence versus laser frequency and intensity allow us to develop a simple
theory of operation. The number of $^{85}$Rb atoms trapped in the pyramid is
approximately $L^6$, where $L \lesssim 6$ is the size in mm. This follows quite
naturally from the relation between capture velocity and size and differs from
the $L^{3.6}$ often used to describe larger MOTs. Our results constitute
substantial progress towards fully integrated atomic physics experiments and
devices.
