Conditions are studied under which there can exist a quasiequilibrium mixture
of itinerant and localized bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, even at zero
temperature and at integer filling factor, when such a coexistence is
impossible for an equilibrium lattice. The consideration is based on a model
having the structure of a two-band, or two-component, boson Hubbard
Hamiltonian. The minimal value for the ratio of on-site repulsion to tunneling
parameter, necessary for the occurrence of such a mixture, is found.
