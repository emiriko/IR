The hydrogen-poor, helium-rich and carbon-rich character of the gas around R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars has been suggested to be a site for formation of
C60 molecules. This suggestion is not supported by observations reported here
showing that infrared transitions of C60 are not seen in a large sample of RCB
stars observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The infrared C60 transitions are seen, however, in emission and blended with
PAH-features in spectra of DY Cen and possibly also of V854 Cen, the two least
hydrogen-deficient (hydrogen deficiency of only ~10-100) RCB stars. The
speculation is offered that C60 (and the PAHs) in the moderately H-deficient
circumstellar envelopes may be formed by the decomposition of hydrogenated
amorphous carbon but fullerene formation is inefficient in the highly
H-deficient environments of most RCBs.
