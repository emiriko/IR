We address the issue of glueball masses in a holographic dual field theory on
the boundary of an AdS space deformed by a four-dimensional cosmological
constant. These glueballs are related to scalar and tensorial fluctuations of
the bulk fields on this space. In the Euclidean AdS4 case the allowed masses
are discretized and are related to distinct inflaton masses on a 3-brane with
several states of inflation. We then obtain the e-folds number in terms of the
glueball masses. In the last part we focus on the Lorentzian dS4 case to focus
on the QCD equation of state in dual field theory.
