The Gas Electron Multiplier detectors with wire and metallic electrodes, with
a gas filling in the gap between them were proposed and tested. The main
advantage of these Gas Electron Multipliers compared to standard ones consists
in their increased stability and reliability. The experimental results on
testing of such detectors with gaps between the electrodes of 1 and 3 mm are
reported. It is demonstrated, that the best gas filling for the gas electron
multipliers is neon with small admixture of quenching gases (for example,
(N2+H2O) at ~100ppm). This filling offers the greatest coefficient of
proportional multiplication as compared with other gases, at small electric
potential difference between the GEM electrodes, in absence of streamer
discharges in the proportional region. The results on operation of the
multi-channel gas electron multiplier with wire cathode and continuous anode
filled with Ne, Ar, Ar+CH4 and Ar+1%Xe are presented also. Based on the
experimental observations, the explanation of the mechanism of formation of
streamers is given.
