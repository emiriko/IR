In a recent Reply [arXiv:1012.4361] to our Comment [arXiv:0906.2389, accepted
to PRL], Serbyn, Skvortsov, and Varlamov raised a question of microscopic
description, which we did not touch in Comment, and criticized our work [Phys.
Rev. B 77, 064501 (2008)]. They hopefully agreed with one of our key result
that the effective heat current vertex for fluctuating Cooper pairs (the
Aslamzov-Larkin block in the diagram technique) is modified in the magnetic
field, so "the heat current is proportional to the gauge-invariant momentum".
However, they stated that we have overlooked the same correction to the
electric current vertex and in this way we lost their huge thermomagnetic
effect that does not require any particle-hole asymmetry and, therefore,
prevails over the ordinary thermomagnetic effects by at least five orders in
magnitude in ordinary superconductors near T_c and strongly dominates in the
temperature range up to ~ 100 T_c. Here we address their criticism with all
details and show that our calculations are correct.
