I present arguments in favor of the dyon mechanism of confinement and
deconfinement. Dyons may be those real physical objects that are revealed as
lattice monopoles in the Abelian gauges, and as central vortices in the central
gauges. I suggest a lattice calculation of the effective action as function of
the gauge invariant eigenvalues of the Polyakov line, which is of general
interest but in particular may support or refute the importance of dyons in the
Yang--Mills vacuum.
