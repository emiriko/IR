We investigate the QCD phase diagram based on the strong coupling expansion
of the lattice QCD with one species of the staggered fermions at finite
temperature (T) and chemical potential (mu). We analytically derive an
effective potential including both chiral and deconfinement (Z_3) dynamics with
finite coupling effects in mean-field approximations. We focus on Polyakov loop
properties in whole T-mu plane, and study relations between the chiral and
deconfinement crossovers. At a fixed large mu, sequencial rapid variations of
the Polyakov loop are observed with increasing T. It is natural to interprete
them as the "chiral induced" and "Z_3 induced" deconfinement crossovers.
