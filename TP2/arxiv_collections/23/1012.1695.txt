Using tunnelling approach, Hawking radiation is derived for a general class
of non-static spherically symmetric space time. The standard tunnelling rate
formula is obtained using the unified first law of thermodynamics on the
trapping horizon and Hawking temperature is measured by an Kodama observer
inside the horizon.
