Using Suzaku and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, we have conducted a series
of four simultaneous observations of the galactic black hole candidate Cyg X-1
in what were historically faint and spectrally hard low states. Additionally,
all of these observations occurred near superior conjunction with our line of
sight to the X-ray source passing through the dense phases of the focused wind
from the mass donating secondary. One of our observations was also simultaneous
with observations by the Chandra-High Energy Transmission Grating. These latter
spectra are crucial for revealing the ionized absorption due to the secondary's
focused wind. Such absorption is present and must be accounted for in all four
spectra. These simultaneous data give an unprecedented view of the 0.8-300 keV
spectrum of Cyg X-1, and hence bear upon both corona and X-ray emitting jet
models of black hole hard states. Three models fit the spectra well: coronae
with thermal or mixed thermal/non-thermal electron populations, and jets. All
three models require a soft component that we fit with a low temperature disk
spectrum with an inner radius of only a few tens of GM/c^2. All three models
also agree that the known spectral break at 10\,keV is not solely due to the
presence of reflection, but each gives a different underlying explanation for
the augmentation of this break. Thus whereas all three models require that
there is a relativistically broadened Fe line, the strength and inner radius of
such a line is dependent upon the specific model, {thus making premature
line-based estimates of the black hole spin in the Cyg X-1 system. We look at
the relativistic line in detail, accounting for the narrow Fe emission and
ionized absorption detected by HETG. Although the specific relativistic
parameters of the line are continuum-dependent, none of the broad line fits
allow for an inner disk radius that is >40 GM/c^2.
