Compound nucleus effective moment of inertia has been calculated for several
fission reaction systems induced by nucleons, light particles, and heavy ions.
Determination of this quantity for these systems is based upon the comparison
between the experimental data of the fission fragment angular distributions as
well as the prediction of the standard saddle-point statistical model (SSPSM).
For the systems, the two cases, namely with and without neutron emission
corrections were considered. In these calculations, it is assumed that all the
neutrons are emitted before reaching the saddle point.It should be noted that
the above method for determining of the effective moment of inertia had not
been reported until now and this method is used for the first time to determine
compound nucleus effective moment of inertia. Hence, our calculations are of
particular importance in obtaining this quantity, and have a significant rule
in the field of fission physics. Afterwards, our theoretical results have been
compared with the data obtained from the rotational liquid drop model as well
as the Sierk model, and satisfactory agreements were found. Finally, we have
considered the effective moment of inertia of compound nuclei for the systems
that formed similar compound nuclei at similar excitation energies.
