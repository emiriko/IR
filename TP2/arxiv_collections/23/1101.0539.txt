An implementation of full self-consistency over the electronic density in the
DFT+DMFT framework on the basis of a plane wave-projector augmented wave (PAW)
DFT code is presented. It allows for an accurate calculation of the total
energy in DFT+DMFT within a plane wave approach. In contrast to frameworks
based on the maximally localized Wannier function, the method is easily applied
to f electron systems, such as cerium, cerium oxide (Ce2O3) and plutonium oxide
(Pu2O3). In order to have a correct and physical calculation of the energy
terms, we find that the calculation of the self-consistent density is
mandatory. The formalism is general and does not depend on the method used to
solve the impurity model. Calculations are carried out within the Hubbard I
approximation, which is fast to solve, and gives a good description of strongly
correlated insulators. We compare the DFT+DMFT and DFT+U solutions, and
underline the qualitative differences of their converged densities. We
emphasize that in contrast to DFT+U, DFT+DMFT does not break the spin and
orbital symmetry. As a consequence, DFT+DMFT implies, on top of a better
physical description of correlated metals and insulators, a reduced occurrence
of unphysical metastable solutions in correlated insulators in comparison to
DFT+U.
