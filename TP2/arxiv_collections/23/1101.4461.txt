By means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations implemented with a two-loop
update scheme, the finite-temperature phase diagram of a three-body constrained
attractive Bose lattice gas is investigated. The nature of the thermal phase
transitions around the dimer superfluid and the atomic superfluid is unveiled.
We find that the $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking transitions between these two
superfluid phases are of first order even at nonzero temperatures. More
interestingly, the thermal transition from the dimer superfluid to the normal
fluid is found to be consistent with the Kosterlitz-Thouless type but giving an
anomalous universal stiffness jump. It demonstrates that this transition is
driven by unbinding of pairs of fractional vortices.
