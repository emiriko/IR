We discuss that the results coming from the central experiments confirm the
results which had been obtained for the behavior of the K+-meson's temperature
behavior as a function of the energy in SPS energy range. To see the "horn" for
the behavior of the ratio for average values of K+- to pi+- mesons as a
function of centrality the new more rich experimental data are required. The
data can be obtained with NICA/MPD setup. The existing of the QCD critical
point could be identified by using the nuclear transparency effect as a
function of the centrality.
