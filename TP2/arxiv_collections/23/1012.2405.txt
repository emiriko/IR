A continuous-time quantum walk is investigated on complex networks with the
characteristic property of community structure, which is shared by most
real-world networks. Motivated by the prospect of viable quantum networks, I
focus on the effects of network instabilities in the form of broken links, and
examine the response of the quantum walk to such failures. It is shown that the
reconfiguration of the quantum walk is determined by the community structure of
the network. In this context, quantum walks based on the adjacency and
Laplacian matrices of the network are compared, and their responses to link
failures is analyzed.
