Fortran subroutines to calculate helicity amplitudes with goldstinos, which
appear as the longitudinal modes of massive gravitinos in high energy
processes, are added to the HELAS (HELicity Amplitude Subroutines) library.
They are coded in such a way that arbitrary amplitudes with external goldstinos
can be generated automatically by MadGraph, after slight modifications. All the
codes have been tested carefully by making use of the goldstino equivalence
theorem and the gauge invariance of the helicity amplitudes. Hadronic total
cross sections for associated gravitino productions with a gluino and a squark
are also presented.
