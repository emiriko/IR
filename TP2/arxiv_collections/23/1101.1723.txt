In close binary systems the atmosphere of one or both components can be
significantly influenced by irradiation from the companion. Often the
irradiated atmosphere is simulated with a single-temperature approximation for
the entire half-sphere. We present a scheme to take the varying irradiation
angle into account by combining several separate 1D models. This is independent
of the actual code which provides the separate stellar spectra. We calculate
the projected area of zones with given irradiation angle and use this
geometrical factor to scale separate 1D models. As an example we calculate two
different irradiation scenarios with the PHOENIX code. The scheme to calculate
the projected area is applicable independent of the physical mechanism that
forms these zones. In the case of irradiation by a primary with T=125000 K, the
secondary forms ions at different ionisation states for different irradiation
angles. No single irradiation angle exists which provides an accurate
description of the spectrum. We show a similar simulation for weaker
irradiation, where the profile of the H$\alpha$ line depends on the irradiation
angle.
