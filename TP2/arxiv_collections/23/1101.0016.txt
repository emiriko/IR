In this work we propose a microwave photon detector which successfully
reaches 100% efficiency with only one absorber. Our design consists of a
metastable quantum circuit coupled to a semi-infinite transmission line which
performs highly efficient photodetection in a simplified manner as compared to
previous proposals. We extensively study the scattering properties of realistic
wavepackets against this device, thereby computing the efficiency of the
detector. We find that the detector has many operating modes, can detect
detuned photons, is robust against design imperfections and can be made
broadband by using more than one absorbing element in the design.
