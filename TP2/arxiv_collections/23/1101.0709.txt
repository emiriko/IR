A new experimental investigation of decaying turbulence generated by a
low-blockage space-filling fractal square grid is presented. We find agreement
with previous works by Seoud & Vassilicos (2007) and Mazellier & Vassilicos
(2010) but also extend the length of the assessed decay region and consolidate
the results by repeating the experiments with different probes of increased
spatial resolution. It is confirmed that this moderately high Reynolds number
Re{\lambda} turbulence (up to Re{\lambda} {\simeq}350 here) does not follow the
classical high Reynolds number scaling of the dissipation rate {\epsilon} ~
u'^3/L and does not obey the equivalent proportionality between the
Taylor-based Reynolds number Re{\lambda} and the ratio of integral scale L to
Taylor micro-scale {\lambda}. Instead we observe an approximate proportionality
between L and {\lambda} during decay. This non-classical behaviour is
investigated by studying how the energy spectra evolve during decay and
examining how well they can be described by self-preserving single-length scale
forms. A detailed study of homogeneity and isotropy is also presented which
reveals the presence of transverse energy transport and pressure transport in
the part of the turbulence decay region where we take data (even though
previous studies found mean flow and turbulence intensity profiles to be
approximately homogeneous in much of the decay region). The exceptionally fast
turbulence decay observed in the part of the decay region where we take data is
consistent with the non-classical behaviour of the dissipation rate.
Measurements with a regular square mesh grid as well as comparisons with active
grid experiments by Mydlarski & Warhaft (1996) and Kang, Chester & Meveneau
(2003) are also presented to highlight the similarities and differences between
these turbulent flows and the turbulence generated by our fractal square grid.
