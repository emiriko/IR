Electric double layer transistor configurations have been employed to
electrostatically dope single crystals of insulating SrTiO_{3}. Here we report
on the results of such doping over broad ranges of temperature and carrier
concentration employing an ionic liquid as the gate dielectric. The surprising
results are, with increasing carrier concentration, an apparent carrier-density
dependent conductor-insulator transition, a regime of anomalous Hall effect,
suggesting magnetic ordering, and finally the appearance of superconductivity.
The possible appearance of magnetic order near the boundary between the
insulating and superconducting regimes is reminiscent of effects associated
with quantum critical behavior in some complex compounds.
