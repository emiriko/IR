Refraction, interference, and diffraction serve as distinguishing features
for wave-like phenomena. While they are normally associated only with a purely
spatial wave-propagation pattern, analogs to interference and diffraction
involving the spatio-temporal dynamics of waves in one dimension (1D) have been
pointed out. Here we complete the triplet of analogies by discussing how
spatio-temporal analogs to refraction are exhibited by a quantum particle in 1D
that is scattering off a step barrier. Similarly, birefringence in spacetime
occurs for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. These examples serve to
illustrate basics of quantum time evolution from a new perspective.
