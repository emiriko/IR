In this work we definitely prove a possibility that Milgrom's modified
Newtonian dynamics, MOND, can be consistently interpreted as a theory with the
modified kinetic terms of the usual Newtonain dynamics, simply called k-MOND.
Precisely, we suggest only a functional dependence between inertial and
gravitational mass tending toward identity in the limit of large accelerations
(characteristic for Newtonian dynamics and its relativistic generalizations)
but which behaves as a principal non-identity in the limit of small
accelerations (smaller than Milgrom's acceleration constant). This functional
dependence implies a generalization of the kinetic terms (without any change of
the gravitational potential energy terms) in the usual Newtonain dynamics
including generalization of corresponding Lagrange formalism. Such generalized
dynamics, k-MOND, is identical to Milgrom's MOND. Also, mentioned k-MOND
distinction between inertial and gravitational mass would be formally treated
as "dark matter".
