We present new nuclear matter calculations based on low-momentum interactions
derived from chiral effective field theory potentials. The current calculations
use an improved treatment of the three-nucleon force contribution that includes
a corrected combinatorial factor beyond Hartree-Fock that was omitted in
previous nuclear matter calculations. We find realistic saturation properties
using parameters fit only to few-body data, but with larger uncertainty
estimates from cutoff dependence and the 3NF parametrization than in previous
calculations.
