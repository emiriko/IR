We investigate the issue of finding common entanglement witness for certain
class of states and extend this study to the case of Schmidt number witnesses.
We also introduce the notion of common decomposable and non-decomposable
witness operators which is specially useful for constructing a common witness
where one of the entangled states is with a positive partial transpose. Our
approach is illustrated with the help of suitable examples of qutrit systems.
