This paper presents results of comparison between observations of coronal
holes in the UV (SOHO EIT) and microwave emission (17, 5.7 GHz, 327 and 150.9
MHz, NoRH, SSRT and Nancy radioheliographs), and solar wind parameters,
according to the ACE spacecraft data over the period 12 March--31 May 2007.
Increase in the solar wind velocity up to ~600 km/s was found to correlate with
decrease in the UV flux in the central parts of the solar disk. The connection
between parameters of the microwave emission at three different solar
atmosphere levels and the solar wind velocity near the Earth's orbit was
determined. This connection suggests existence of common mechanisms of solar
wind acceleration from chromospheric altitudes to the upper corona. We also
suppose existence of two different mechanisms of the solar wind acceleration at
altitudes of less and more than one solar radius.
