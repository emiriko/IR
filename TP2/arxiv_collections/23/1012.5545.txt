The Upsilon production cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) =
7 TeV is measured using a data sample collected with the CMS detector at the
LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.1 +/- 0.3 inverse
picobarns. Integrated over the rapidity range |y|<2, we find the product of the
Upsilon(1S) production cross section and branching fraction to dimuons to be
sigma(pp to Upsilon(1S) X) B(Upsilon(1S) to mu+ mu-) = 7.37 +/-
0.13^{+0.61}_{-0.42}\pm 0.81 nb, where the first uncertainty is statistical,
the second is systematic, and the third is associated with the estimation of
the integrated luminosity of the data sample. This cross section is obtained
assuming unpolarized Upsilon(1S) production. If the Upsilon(1S) production
polarization is fully transverse or fully longitudinal the cross section
changes by about 20%. We also report the measurement of the Upsilon(1S),
Upsilon(2S), and Upsilon(3S) differential cross sections as a function of
transverse momentum and rapidity.
