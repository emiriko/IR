We propose three ways to determine the CP eigenvalue of the Higgs boson at
the hadron collider as follows: 1. We determine the Higgs CP eigenvalue from
the production cross section which is affected by the CP eigenvalue of the
Higgs boson. 2. We adopt the CP selection rules to determine the Higgs CP
eigenvalue. 3. We determine the CP property by the momentum distribution of the
decay products of the Higgs boson. Our methods can be applied for a wide range
of the Higgs mass.
