Comparison of theory of Rabi oscillations with experiment [M. Wilczewski and
M. Czachor, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79}, 033836 (2009)] suggests that cavity lifetime
parameters obtained in measurements with many photons may be much smaller than
those applicable to almost vacuum states of light. In this context we show that
the conclusion remains unchanged even if one takes a more realistic description
of the initial state of light in cavity.
