A magnetic tunnel junction Fe3O4/MgO/Fe with (001) layer orientation is
considered. The junction magnetic energy is analyzed as a function of the angle
between the layer magnetization vectors under various magnetic fields. The
tunnel magnetoresistance is calculated as a function of the external magnetic
field. In contrast with junctions with unidirectional anisotropy, a
substantially lower magnetic field is required for the junction switching.
