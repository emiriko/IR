Photons couple to Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) or more generally to any pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson in the presence of an external electromagnetic field.
Mixing between photons and ALPs in the strong magnetic field of a Gamma-Ray
Burst (GRB) jet during the prompt emission phase can leave observable imprints
on the gamma-ray polarization and spectrum. Mixing in the intergalactic medium
is not expected to modify these signatures for ALP mass > 10^(-14) eV and/or
for < nG magnetic field. We show that the depletion of photons due to
conversion to ALPs changes the linear degree of polarization from the values
predicted by the synchrotron model of gamma ray emission. We also show that
when the magnetic field orientation in the propagation region is perpendicular
to the field orientation in the production region, the observed synchrotron
spectrum becomes steeper than the theoretical prediction and as detected in a
sizable fraction of GRB sample. Detection of the correlated polarization and
spectral signatures from these steep-spectrum GRBs by gamma-ray polarimeters
can be a very powerful probe to discover ALPs. Measurement of gamma-ray
polarization from GRBs in general, with high statistics, can also be useful to
search for ALPs.
