We demonstrate the flexibility that a wavelength selective switch could offer
to bandwidth provisioning of potential multi-user quantum key distribution
networks based on entangled pair sources. We derive an analytical expression
relating the coincidence detection rates of the photon pairs to the switch
bandwidth characteristics. Experimentally measured coincidence rates verify the
theory in three distinct network configurations.
