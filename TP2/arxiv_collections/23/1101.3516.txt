Multiple charge density wave (CDW) phases in 2H-TaSe2 are investigated by
high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction. In a narrow temperature range
immediately above the commensurate CDW transition, we observe a multi-q
superstructure with coexisting commensurate and incommensurate order
parameters, clearly distinct from the fully incommensurate state at higher
temperatures. This multi-q ordered phase, characterized by a temperature
hysteresis, is found both during warming and cooling, in contrast to previous
reports. In the normal state, the incommensurate superstructure reflection
gives way to a broad diffuse peak that persists nearly up to room temperature.
Its position provides a direct and accurate estimate of the Fermi surface
nesting vector, which evolves non-monotonically and approaches the commensurate
position as the temperature is increased. This behavior agrees with our recent
observations of the temperature-dependent Fermi surface in the same compound
[Phys. Rev. B 79, 125112 (2009)].
