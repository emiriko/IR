The purpose of this paper is to present a simple micromechanics-based model
to estimate the effective thermal conductivity of real-world macroscopically
isotropic materials of matrix-inclusion type. The methodology is based on the
well-established Mori-Tanaka method for composite media reinforced with
ellipsoidal inclusions, extended to account for imperfect thermal contact at
the matrix-inclusion interface, random orientation of particles and particle
size distribution. Using simple ensemble averaging arguments, we show that the
original Mori-Tanaka relations are still applicable for these complex systems,
provided that the inclusion conductivity is appropriately modified. Such
conclusion is supported by the verification of the model against a detailed
finite-element study as well as its validation against experimental data for a
wide range of engineering material systems.
