Suppose that multiple experts (or learning algorithms) provide us with
alternative Bayesian network (BN) structures over a domain, and that we are
interested in combining them into a single consensus BN structure.
Specifically, we are interested in that the consensus BN structure only
represents independences all the given BN structures agree upon and that it has
as few parameters associated as possible. In this paper, we prove that there
may exist several non-equivalent consensus BN structures and that finding one
of them is NP-hard. Thus, we decide to resort to heuristics to find an
approximated consensus BN structure. In this paper, we consider the heuristic
proposed in
\citep{MatzkevichandAbramson1992,MatzkevichandAbramson1993a,MatzkevichandAbramson1993b}.
This heuristic builds upon two algorithms, called Methods A and B, for
efficiently deriving the minimal directed independence map of a BN structure
relative to a given node ordering. Methods A and B are claimed to be correct
although no proof is provided (a proof is just sketched). In this paper, we
show that Methods A and B are not correct and propose a correction of them.
