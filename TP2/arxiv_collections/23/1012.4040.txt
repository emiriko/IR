The spectroscopy of 21O has been investigated using a radioactive 20O beam
and the (d,p) reaction in inverse kinematics. The ground and first excited
states have been determined to be Jpi=5/2+ and Jpi=1/2+ respectively. Two
neutron unbound states were observed at excitation energies of 4.76 +- 0.10 and
6.16 +- 0.11. The spectroscopic factor deduced for the lower of these
interpreted as a 3/2+ level, reveals a rather pure 0d3/2 single-particle
configuration. The large energy difference between the 3/2+ and 1/2+ states is
indicative of the emergence of the N=16 magic number. For the higher lying
resonance, which has a character consistent with a spin-parity assignment of
3/2+ or 7/2-, a 71% branching ratio to the first 2+ state in 20O has been
observed. The results are compared with new shell model calculations.
