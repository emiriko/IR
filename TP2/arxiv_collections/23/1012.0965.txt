We study the interaction of highly nonlinear solitary waves in granular
crystals, with an adjacent linear elastic medium. We investigate the effects of
interface dynamics on the reflection of incident waves and on the formation of
primary and secondary reflected waves. Experimental tests are performed to
correlate the linear medium geometry, materials, and mass with the formation
and propagation of the reflected waves. We compare the experimental results
with theoretical analysis based on the long-wavelength approximation and with
numerical predictions obtained from discrete particle models. Studying
variations of the reflected wave's velocity and amplitude, we describe how the
propagation of primary and secondary reflected waves responds sensitively to
the states of the adjacent linear media. Experimental results are found to be
in agreement with the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. This
preliminary study establishes the foundation for utilizing reflected solitary
waves as novel information carriers in nondestructive evaluation of elastic
material systems.
