We review X-ray plasma diagnostics based on the line ratios of He-like ions.
Triplet/singlet line intensities can be used to determine electronic
temperature and density, and were first developed for the study of the solar
corona. Since the launches of the X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton,
these diagnostics have been extended and used (from CV to Si XIII) for a wide
variety of astrophysical plasmas such as stellar coronae, supernova remnants,
solar system objects, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries. Moreover, the
intensities of He-like ions can be used to determine the ionization process(es)
at work, as well as the distance between the X-ray plasma and the UV emission
source for example in hot stars. In the near future thanks to the next
generation of X-ray satellites (e.g., Astro-H and IXO), higher-Z He-like lines
(e.g., iron) will be resolved, allowing plasmas with higher temperatures and
densities to be probed. Moreover, the so-called satellite lines that are formed
closed to parent He-like lines, will provide additional valuable diagnostics to
determine electronic temperature, ionic fraction, departure from ionization
equilibrium and/or from Maxwellian electron distribution.
