Aimed at understanding the evolution of galaxies in clusters, the GLACE
survey is mapping a set of optical lines ([OII]3727, [OIII]5007, Hbeta and
Halpha/[NII] when possible) in several galaxy clusters at redshift around 0.40,
0.63 and 0.86, using the Tuneable Filters (TF) of the OSIRIS instrument (Cepa
et al. 2005) at the 10.4m GTC telescope. This study will address key questions
about the physical processes acting upon the infalling galaxies during the
course of hierarchical growth of clusters. GLACE is already ongoing: we present
some preliminary results on our observations of the galaxy cluster Cl0024+1654
at z = 0.395; on the other hand, GLACE@0.86 has been approved as ESO/GTC large
project to be started in 2011.
