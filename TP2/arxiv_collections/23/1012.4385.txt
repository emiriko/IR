Lepton flavor violation in tau and mu processes is studied in the littlest
Higgs model with T-parity. We consider various asymmetries defined in polarized
tau and mu decays. Correlations among branching ratios and asymmetries are
shown in the following lepton flavor violation processes: mu+ --> e+ gamma, mu+
--> e+ e+ e-, mu- A --> e- A (A = Al, Ti, Au and Pb), tau+ --> mu+ gamma, tau+
--> mu+ mu+ mu-, tau+ --> mu+ e+ e-, tau+ --> mu+ P (P = pi0, eta and eta'),
tau+ --> mu+ V (V = rho0, omega and phi), tau+ --> e+ gamma, tau+ --> e+ e+ e-,
tau+ --> e+ mu+ mu-, tau+ --> e+ P, tau+ --> e+ V, tau+ --> mu+ mu+ e- and tau+
--> e+ e+ mu-. It is shown that large parity asymmetries and time-reversal
asymmetries are allowed in mu+ --> e+ e+ e-. For tau lepton flavor violation
processes, sizable asymmetries are possible reflecting characteristic chirality
structure of lepton flavor violating interactions in this model.
