The static spheroidal solutions of Jordan-Brands-Dicke theory (JBD) are
studied. We consider the effect of the anisotropic stresses of scalar field on
the shape of JBD self-graviting objects. It is shown that scalar fields can
have significant effect on the structure and properties of self-graviting
objects. In contrast with general relativity in JBD theory there are nonflat
static spheroidal solutions.
