We have analyzed the atomic rearrangements underlying self-diffusion in
amorphous Si during annealing using tight-binding molecular dynamics
simulations. Two types of amorphous samples with different structural features
were used to analyze the influence of coordination defects. We have identified
several types of atomic rearrangement mechanisms, and we have obtained an
effective migration energy of around 1 eV. We found similar migration energies
for both types of samples, but higher diffusivities in the one with a higher
initial percentage of coordination defects.
