We extend our formulation of relativistic three-nucleon Faddeev equations to
include both pairwise interactions and a three-nucleon force. Exact Poincare
invariance is realized by adding interactions to the mass Casimir operator
(rest Hamiltonian) of the non-interacting system without changing the spin
Casimir operator. This is achieved by using interactions defined by
rotationally invariant kernels that are functions of internal momentum
variables and single-particle spins that undergo identical Wigner rotations. To
solve the resulting equations one needs matrix elements of the three-nucleon
force with these properties in a momentum-space partial-wave basis. We present
two methods to calculate matrix elements of three-nucleon forces with these
properties. For a number of examples we show that at higher energies, where
effects of relativity and of three-nucleon forces are non-negligible, a
consistent treatment of both is required to properly analyze the data.
