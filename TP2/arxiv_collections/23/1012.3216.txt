In this paper, we show how to efficiently and effectively extract a class of
"low-rank textures" in a 3D scene from 2D images despite significant
corruptions and warping. The low-rank textures capture geometrically meaningful
structures in an image, which encompass conventional local features such as
edges and corners as well as all kinds of regular, symmetric patterns
ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to finding
these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex
optimization that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix
despite gross sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant
affine or projective deformation, our method can accurately recover both the
intrinsic low-rank texture and the precise domain transformation, and hence the
3D geometry and appearance of the planar regions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that this new technique works effectively for many regular
and near-regular patterns or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as
symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed texts, and human faces.
