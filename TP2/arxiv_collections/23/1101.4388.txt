Targeting at sparse learning, we construct Banach spaces B of functions on an
input space X with the properties that (1) B possesses an l1 norm in the sense
that it is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space of integrable functions
on X with respect to the counting measure; (2) point evaluations are continuous
linear functionals on B and are representable through a bilinear form with a
kernel function; (3) regularized learning schemes on B satisfy the linear
representer theorem. Examples of kernel functions admissible for the
construction of such spaces are given.
