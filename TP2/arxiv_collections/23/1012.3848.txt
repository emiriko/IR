The criticality of self-assembled rigid rods on triangular lattices is
investigated using Monte Carlo simulation. We find a continuous transition
between an ordered phase, where the rods are oriented along one of the three
(equivalent) lattice directions, and a disordered one. We conclude that
equilibrium polydispersity of the rod lengths does not affect the critical
behavior, as we found that the criticality is the same as that of monodisperse
rods on the same lattice, in contrast with the results of recently published
work on similar models.
