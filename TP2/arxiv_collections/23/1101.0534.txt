Recently, a silicon micromachining method to produce tetrahedral silicon
particles was discovered. In this report we determine, using band structure
calculations, the optical properties of diamond-lattice photonic crystals when
assembled from such particles. We show that crystal structures built from
silicon tetrahedra are expected to display small stop gaps. Wide photonic band
gaps appear when truncated tetrahedral particles are used to build the photonic
crystals. With truncated tetrahedral particles a band gap with a width of 23.6%
can be achieved, which is more than twice as wide compared to band gaps in
self-assembled diamond-lattices of hard-spheres. The width of the band gap is
insensitive to small deviations from the optimal amount of truncation. This
work paves the way to a novel class of silicon diamond-lattice band gap
crystals that can be obtained through self-assembly. Such a self-assembly
approach would allow for easy integration of these highly photonic crystals in
existing silicon microfluidic and -electronic systems.
