An initial investigation of two poorly studied eclipsing binaries separated
by ~3' in the sky is presented. The first star (GSC 2576-01248) was discovered
by the TrES exoplanet search project. The second one (GSC 2576-02071) was
identified by the authors during CCD observations of GSC 2576-01248. We combine
our dedicated CCD photometry with the archival TrES observations and data from
the digitized photographic plates of the Moscow collection to determine periods
of the two variable stars with high precision. For GSC 2576-01248, addition of
historical photographic data provides a major improvement in accuracy of period
determination. No evidence for period change in these binary systems was found.
The lightcurve of GSC 2576-01248 is characterized by a prominent variable
O'Connell effect suggesting the presence of a dark starspot and asynchronous
rotation of a binary component. GSC 2576-02071 shows a shift of the secondary
minimum from the phase =0.5 indicating a significant orbit eccentricity.
