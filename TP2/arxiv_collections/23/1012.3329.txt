The issue of how epistemic uncertainties affect the outcome of Monte Carlo
simulation is discussed by means of a concrete use case: the simulation of the
longitudinal energy deposition profile of low energy protons. A variety of
electromagnetic and hadronic physics models is investigated, and their effects
are analyzed. Possible systematic effects are highlighted. The results identify
requirements for experimental measurements capable of reducing epistemic
uncertainties in the physics models.
