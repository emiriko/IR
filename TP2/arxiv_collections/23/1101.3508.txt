We propose a new scheme for solid-state photonic quantum computation in which
trapped photons in optical cavities are taken as a quantum bit. Quantum gates
can be realized by coupling the cavities with quantum dots through waveguides.
The proposed scheme allows programmable and deterministic gate operations and
the system can be scaled up to many quantum bits.
