The anomalous Hall effect for type-II superconductors is investigated by
random walk theorem. It is shown that the origin of Hall anomaly is induced by
the thermally activated vortex bundle flow (TAVBF) over the
directional-dependent energy barrier formed by the Magus force, random
collective pinning force, and strong pinning force inside the vortex bundles.
The directional-dependent potential barrier of the vortex bundles renormalizes
the Hall and longitudinal resistivities strongly. Under the framework of
present theory, it is also shown that the Hall anomaly is universal for type-II
superconductors, either high- or conventional as well as bulk materials or thin
films. The conditions for Hall anomaly and reentry phenomenon are derived, the
Hall and longitudinal resistivities as well as Hall angle for type-II
superconducting films and bulk materials versus temperature and applied
magnetic field are calculated. All the results are in agreement with the
experiments.
