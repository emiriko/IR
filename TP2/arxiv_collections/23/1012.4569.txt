Itinerant ferromagnetism in cold Fermi gases with repulsive interactions is
studied applying the Jastrow-Slater approximation generalized to finite
polarization and temperature. For two components at zero temperature a second
order transition is found at $ak_F\simeq0.90$ compatible with QMC.
Thermodynamic functions and observables such as the compressibility and spin
susceptibility and the resulting fluctuations in number and spin are
calculated. For trapped gases the resulting cloud radii and kinetic energies
are calculated and compared to recent experiments. Spin polarized systems are
recommended for effective separation of large ferromagnetic domains. Collective
modes are predicted and tri-critical points are calculated for multi-component
systems.
