The diversity of cell populations is regulated by extracellular and
intracellular variability. The latter includes genetic, epigenetic and
stochastic variability, all contributing to the experimentally observed
heterogeneity in response to external death-inducing stimuli. Studies of
sources and regulation of variability in commitment to apoptotic cancer cell
death are likely to identify the fundamental features of apoptotic protein
networks that are responsible for determining the ultimate cell fate. Systems
biology approaches, involving computer simulations of the biochemical reactions
accompanied, if possible, by experimental verification of selected components
of the model, are proving useful in determining the origins of cell-to-cell
variability in response to external stress stimuli. Here we summarize our
current understanding of the origins of stochastic variability in cells'
commitment to apoptosis, and its implications in the field on cancer therapy.
