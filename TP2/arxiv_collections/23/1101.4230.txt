Observations of AGN have suggested a possible delay between the peak of star
formation (on some scale) and AGN activity. Inefficient fueling (and/or
feedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we
argue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We
show that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical
reasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will
quickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.
However, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively
inefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the
stars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.
Moreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk
instabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the
BH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can
therefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has
significantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of
these effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of
BH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale
corresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local
dynamical times). This predicts that the inferred delay will vary in a specific
manner with the radius over which the star formation rate is measured. We
discuss possible implications for the role of AGN feedback in suppressing star
formation activity.
