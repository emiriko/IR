The spin and orbital Kondo effects and the related shot noise for a laterally
coupled double quantum dot are studied taking account of coherent indirect
coupling via a reservoir. We calculate the linear conductance and shot noise
for various charge states to distinguish between the spin and orbital Kondo
effects. We find that a novel antiferromagnetic exchange coupling can be
generated by the coherent indirect coupling, and it works to suppress the spin
Kondo effect when each quantum dot holds just one electron. We also show that
we can capture the feature of the pseudospin Kondo effect from the shot noise
measurement.
