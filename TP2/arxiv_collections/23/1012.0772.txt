Randomly poled nonlinear crystals are shown to be able to emit intense
ultra-broadband photon-pair fields with properties comparable to those coming
from chirped periodically-poled crystals. Their intensities scale linearly with
the number of domains. Also photon pairs extending over intervals with
durations comparable to one optical cycle can be generated in these crystals.
