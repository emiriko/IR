Based on the isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model
and the scaling model according to nucleon effective mass, effects of elastic
and inelastic NN scattering cross sections on pion-/pion+ in the neutron-rich
reaction of Ca48+Ca48 at a beam energy of 400 MeV/nucleon are studied. It is
found that cross-section effects of both NN elastic and inelastic scatterings
affect Delta_1232, pion- and pion+ production, as well as the value of
pion-/pion+.
