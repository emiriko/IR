Collective states of interacting non-Abelian anyons have recently been
studied mostly in the context of certain fractional quantum Hall states, such
as the Moore-Read state proposed to describe the physics of the quantum Hall
plateau at filling fraction v = 5/2. In this manuscript, we further expand this
line of research and present non-unitary generalizations of interacting anyon
models. In particular, we introduce the notion of Yang-Lee anyons, discuss
their relation to the so-called `Gaffnian' quantum Hall wave function, and
describe an elementary model for their interactions. A one-dimensional version
of this model -- a non-unitary generalization of the original golden chain
model -- can be fully understood in terms of an exact algebraic solution and
numerical diagonalization. We discuss the gapless theories of these chain
models for general su(2)_k anyonic theories and their Galois conjugates. We
further introduce and solve a one-dimensional version of the Levin-Wen model
for non-unitary Yang-Lee anyons.
