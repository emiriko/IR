The production length l_p of a leading (large z_h) hadron produced in
hadronization of a highly virtual high-p_T parton is short because of the very
intensive vacuum gluon radiation and dissipation of energy at the early stage
of process. Therefore, the main part of nuclear suppression of high-p_T hadrons
produced in heavy ion collisions is related to the survival probability of a
colorless dipole propagating through a dense medium. This is subject to color
transparency, which leads to a steep rise with p_T of the nuclear ratio
R_{AA}(p_T), in good agreement with the recent data from the ALICE experiment
at LHC, CERN. No adjustment, except the medium density is made, and the
transport coefficient is found to be \hat q_0=0.8 GeV^2/fm. This is close to
the value extracted from the analysis of RHIC data for J/Psi suppression, but
is an order of magnitude smaller than the value found from jet quenching data
within the energy loss scenario. Although the present calculations have a
status of a postdiction, the mechanism and all formulas have been published,
and are applied here with no modification, except the kinematics. At the same
time, p_T-dependence of R_{AA} at the energy of RHIC is rather flat due to the
suppression factor steeply falling with rising x_T, related to the energy
conservation constraints. This factor is irrelevant to the LHC data, since x_T
is much smaller.
