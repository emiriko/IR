We present CCD photometric distance estimates of 100 SCR (SuperCOSMOS RECONS)
systems with $\mu$ $\geq$ 0$\farcs$18/yr, 28 of which are new discoveries
previously unpublished in this series of papers. These distances are estimated
using a combination of new $VRI$ photometry acquired at CTIO and $JHK$
magnitudes extracted from 2MASS. The estimates are improvements over those
determined using photographic plate $BRI$ magnitudes from SuperCOSMOS plus
$JHK$, as presented in the original discovery papers. In total, 77 of the 100
systems investigated are predicted to be within 25 pc. If all 77 systems are
confirmed to have $\pi$$_{trig}$ $\ge$ 40 milliarcseconds, this sample would
represent a 23% increase in M dwarf systems nearer than 25 pc in the southern
sky.
