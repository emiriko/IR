The depth profile of the intrinsic magnetic properties in an Fe/Sm-Co bilayer
fabricated under nearly optimal spring-magnet conditions was determined by
complementary studies of polarized neutron reflectometry and micromagnetic
simulations. We found that at the Fe/Sm-Co interface the magnetic properties
change gradually at the length scale of 8 nm. In this intermixed interfacial
region, the saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy are lower and the
exchange stiffness is higher than values estimated from the model based on a
mixture of Fe and Sm-Co phases. Therefore, the intermixed interface yields
superior exchange coupling between the Fe and Sm-Co layers, but at the cost of
average magnetization.
