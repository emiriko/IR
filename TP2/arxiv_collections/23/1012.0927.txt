A new conception of the wavelength division multiplexing on the basis of the
two-dimensional photonic crystal was developed. The photonic crystals band
structures were investigated in details. The method for the synthesis of the
two-channel wavelength division multiplexer on the basis of two dimensional
photonic crystals was developed using this method the device was synthesized.
The spectral characteristics of the device and its dynamic pulse pattern
response were investigated.
