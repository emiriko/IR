We have successfully grown epitaxial, superconducting films of
Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 (Ba-122)with x ~ 0.1. The films grow without observable
correlated defects parallel to the c-axis, as confirmed by TEM. This is also
reflected in the absence of a caxis peak in Jc({\theta}). In contrast to
cuprate high-Tc superconductors such as YBa2Cu3O7-d or even Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-d,
the pnictides show a rather low anisotropic behavior in their Jc({\theta})
behavior as well as in their upper critical fields, Hc2. As a multiband
superconductor, Ba-122 exhibits a temperature dependent electronic mass
anisotropy.
