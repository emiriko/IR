Operation results are presented of a UV-sensitive gaseous photomultiplier
(GPM) coupled through a MgF2 window to a liquid-xenon scintillator. It
consisted of a reflective CsI photocathode deposited on top of a THick Gaseous
Electron Multiplier (THGEM); further multiplication stages were either a second
THGEM or a Parallel Ionization Multiplier (PIM) followed by a MICROMEsh GAseous
Structure (MICROMEGAS). The GPM operated in gas-flow mode with non-condensable
gas mixtures. Gains of 10^4 were measured with a CsI-coated double-THGEM
detector in Ne/CH4 (95:5), Ne/CF4 (95:5) and Ne/CH4/CF4 (90:5:5), with soft
X-rays at 173 K. Scintillation signals induced by alpha particles in liquid
xenon were measured here for the first time with a double-THGEM GPM in He/CH4
(92.5:7.5) and a triple-structure THGEM/PIM/MICROMEGAS GPM in Ne/CH4 (90:10)
with a fast-current preamplifier.
