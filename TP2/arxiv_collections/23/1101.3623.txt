We develop a practical method to analyze the mixing structure of hadrons
consisting of two components of quark-composite and hadronic composite. As an
example we investigate the properties of the axial vector meson a1(1260) and
discuss its mixing properties quantitatively. We also make reference to the
large Nc procedure and its limitation for the classification of such a mixed
state.
