Generalized Bose-Einstein condensation (GBEC) involves condensates appearing
simultaneously in multiple states. We review examples of the three types in an
ideal Bose gas with different geometries. In Type I there is a discrete number
of quantum states each having macroscopic occupation; Type II has condensation
into a continuous band of states, with each state having macroscopic
occupation; in Type III each state is microscopically occupied while the entire
condensate band is macroscopically occupied. We begin by discussing Type I or
"normal" BEC into a single state for an isotropic harmonic oscillator
potential. Other geometries and external potentials are then considered: the
{}"channel" potential (harmonic in one dimension and hard-wall in the other),
which displays Type II, the {}"cigar trap" (anisotropic harmonic potential),
and the "Casimir prism" (an elongated box), the latter two having Type III
condensations. General box geometries are considered in an appendix. We
particularly focus on the cigar trap, which Van Druten and Ketterle first
showed had a two-step condensation: a GBEC into a band of states at a
temperature $T_{c}$ and another "one-dimensional" transition at a lower
temperature $T_{1}$ into the ground state. In a thermodynamic limit in which
the ratio of the dimensions of the anisotropic harmonic trap is kept fixed,
$T_{1}$ merges with the upper transition, which then becomes a normal BEC.
However, in the thermodynamic limit of Beau and Zagrebnov, in which the ratio
of the boundary lengths increases exponentially, $T_{1}$ becomes fixed at the
temperature of a true Type I phase transition. The effects of interactions on
GBEC are discussed and we show that there is evidence that Type III
condensation may have been observed in the cigar trap.
