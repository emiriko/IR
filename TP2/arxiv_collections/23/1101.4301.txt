In this paper, we explore the use of the diffusion geometry framework for the
fusion of geometric and photometric information in local and global shape
descriptors. Our construction is based on the definition of a diffusion process
on the shape manifold embedded into a high-dimensional space where the
embedding coordinates represent the photometric information. Experimental
results show that such data fusion is useful in coping with different
challenges of shape analysis where pure geometric and pure photometric methods
fail.
