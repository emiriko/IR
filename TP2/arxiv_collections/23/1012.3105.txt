Uncertainty relations are fundamental in quantum mechanics. Here I propose
state-independent variance-based uncertainty relations for two or more
arbitrary observables in finite dimensional spaces. The uncertainty relations
provide near-optimal lower bounds in some typical examples, and are useful for
entanglement detection.
