There are many clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering method.
Most of the approaches to the clustering of variables encountered in the
literature are of hierarchical type. The great majority of hierarchical
approaches to the clustering of variables are of agglomerative nature. The
agglomerative hierarchical approach to clustering starts with each observation
as its own cluster and then continually groups the observations into
increasingly larger groups. Higher Learning Institution (HLI) provides training
to introduce final-year students to the real working environment. In this
research will use Euclidean single linkage and complete linkage. MATLAB and HCE
3.5 software will used to train data and cluster course implemented during
industrial training. This study indicates that different method will create a
different number of clusters.
