IAU 2000 resolutions on the reference frames set up a solid theoretical
foundation for implementing general relativity in astronomical data processing
algorithms and for unambiguous interpretation of measured relativistic effects.
We discuss possible directions for further theoretical development of the IAU
resolutions aimed to take into account the decadal progress in observational
techniques and computer-based technologies. We address the following subjects:
1) space-time transformations and the structure of the metric tensor; -2) PPN
parameters and gauge invariance of equations of motion; -3) astronomical
reference frames for cosmological applications.
