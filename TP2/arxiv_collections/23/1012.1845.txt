We study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on the spin and charge
distribution across a quantum wire. Using momentum resolved tunneling between
two parallel wires we measure the dispersion relation for different
perpendicular magnetic fields. We find that as the magnetic field increases, a
strip of spin polarized electrons separates in the cross section of the wire.
We provide a quantitative description of the emerging structure within a
Hartree-Fock approximation, showing that it results from exchange interaction
between electrons in the wire. We discuss the relation of these results to the
structure of Quantum Hall edge states.
