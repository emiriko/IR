In this paper I will show how to use Python programming with a computer
interface such as Phoenix-M 1 to drive simple robots. In my quest towards
Artificial Intelligence(AI) I am experimenting with a lot of different
possibilities in Robotics. This one will try to mimic the working of a simple
insect's nervous system using hard wiring and some minimal software usage. This
is the precursor to my advanced robotics and AI integration where I plan to use
a new paradigm of AI based on Machine Learning and Self Consciousness via
Knowledge Feedback and Update Process.
