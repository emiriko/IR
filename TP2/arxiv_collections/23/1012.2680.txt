In Weinberg's asymptotic safety approach, a finite dimensional critical
surface for a UV stable fixed point generates a theory of quantum gravity with
a finite number of physical parameters. We argue that, in an extension of
Feynman's original formulation of the theory, we recover this fixed-point UV
behavior from an exact re-arrangement of the respective perturbative series.
Our results are consistent with the exact field space Wilsonian renormalization
group results of Reuter {\it et al.} and with recent Hopf- algebraic
Dyson-Schwinger renormalization theory results of Kreimer. We obtain the first
"first principles" predictions of the dimensionless gravitational and
cosmological constants and our results support the Planck scale cosmology of
Bonanno and Reuter. We conclude with an estimate for the currently observed
value of the cosmological constant.
