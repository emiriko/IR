We rigorously analyze the low temperature non-equilibrium dynamics of the
East model, a special example of a one dimensional oriented kinetically
constrained particle model, when the initial distribution is different from the
reversible one and for times much smaller than the global relaxation time. This
setting has been intensively studied in the physics literature to analyze the
slow dynamics which follows a sudden quench from the liquid to the glass phase.
In the limit of zero temperature (i.e. a vanishing density of vacancies) and
for initial distributions such that the vacancies form a renewal process we
prove that the density of vacancies, the persistence function and the two-time
autocorrelation function behave as staircase functions with several plateaux.
Furthermore the two-time autocorrelation function displays an aging behavior.
We also provide a sharp description of the statistics of the domain length as a
function of time, a domain being the interval between two consecutive
vacancies. When the initial renewal process has finite mean our results confirm
(and generalize) previous findings of the physicists for the restricted case of
a product Bernoulli measure. However we show that a different behavior appears
when the initial domain distribution is in the attraction domain of a
$\alpha$-stable law. All the above results actually follow from a more general
result which says that the low temperature dynamics of the East model is very
well described by that of a certain hierarchical coalescence process, a
probabilistic object which can be viewed as a hierarchical sequence of suitably
linked coalescence processes and whose asymptotic behavior has been recently
studied in [14].
