We investigate the influence of the boundary conditions of minimal
supergravity (mSUGRA) on the supersymmetric mechanism for lepton flavour
violation (LFV) proposed recently [1], within the framework of the MSSM
extended by TeV-scale singlet heavy neutrinos. We find that the consideration
of the mSUGRA boundary condition may increase the branching ratios of the muon
and tauon decaying into three charged leptons by up to a factor of 5, whereas
the corresponding branching ratio for their photonic decays remains almost
unchanged.
