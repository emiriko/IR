We use the permutational symmetry group $S_{3}$ as a symmetry of flavour,
which leads to a unified treatment of masses and mixings of the quarks and
leptons. In this framework all mass matrices of the fermions in the theory have
the same form with four texture zeroes of class of I. Also, with the help of
six elements of real matrix representation of $S_ {3}$ as transformation
matrices of similarity classes, we make a classification of the sets of mass
matrices with texture zeroes in equivalence classes. This classification reduce
the number of phenomenologically viable textures for the non-singulars mass
matrices of $3\times3$, from thirty three down to only eleven independent sets
of matrices. Each of these sets of matrices has exactly the same physical
content.
