In this paper we discuss the QCD contribution to the Abelian Debye and
magnetic screening masses in a deconfined QCD plasma at finite temperature in
the presence of an external magnetic field B. We use a holographic AdS/QCD
setup in an AdS Schwarzschield black hole background and show that the electric
screening mass has a form similar to the one-loop result in QED. Moreover, we
calculate the corrections due to the magnetic field to all orders of B and
demonstrate that in the case when magnetic field is large the Debye mass grows
linearly with B, while the magnetic screening mass vanishes. The whole effect
of the magnetic field turns out to stem from the Chern-Simons action. We also
discuss the zero temperature case in the chiral perturbation theory.
