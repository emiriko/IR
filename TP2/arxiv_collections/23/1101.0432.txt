If it is commonly agreed that the presence of a (moderately) close stellar
companion affects the formation and the dynamical evolution of giant planets,
the frequency of giant planets residing in binary systems separated by less
than 100 AU is unknown. To address this issue, we have conducted with VLT/NACO
a systematic adaptive optics search for moderately close stellar companions to
130 nearby solar-type stars. According to the data from Doppler surveys, half
of our targets host at least one planetary companion, while the other half show
no evidence for short-period giant planets. We present here the final results
of our survey, which include a new series of second-epoch measurements to test
for common proper motion. The new observations confirm the physical association
of two companion candidates and prove the unbound status of many others. These
results strengthen our former conclusion that circumstellar giant planets are
slightly less frequent in binaries with mean semimajor axes between 35 and 100
AU than in wider systems or around single stars.
