We considered Q-state Potts model on Bethe lattice in presence of external
magnetic field for Q<2 by means of recursion relation technique. This allows to
study the phase transition mechanism in terms of the obtained one dimensional
rational mapping. The convergence of Feigenabaum $\alpha$ and $\delta$
exponents for the aforementioned mapping is investigated for the period
doubling and three cyclic window. We regarded the Lyapunov exponent as an order
parameter for the characterization of the model and discussed its dependence on
temperature and magnetic field. Arnold tongues analogs with winding numbers
w=1/2, w=2/4 and w=1/3 (in the three cyclic window) are constructed for Q<2.
The critical temperatures of the model are discussed and their dependence on Q
is investigated. We also proposed an approximate method for constructing Arnold
tongues via Feigenbaum $\delta$ exponent.
