A new model for graphene, epitaxially grown on silicon carbide is proposed.
Density functional theory modelling of epitaxial graphene functionalization by
hydrogen, fluorine and phenyl groups has been performed with hydrogen and
fluorine showing a high probability of cluster formation in high adatom
concentration. It has also been shown that the clusterization of fluorine
adatoms provides midgap states in formation due to significant flat distortion
of graphene. The functionalization of epitaxial graphene using larger species
(methyl and phenyl groups) renders cluster formation impossible, due to the
steric effect and results in uniform coverage with the energy gap opening.
