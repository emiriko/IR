Particle IDentification (PID) is fundamental to particle physics experiments.
This paper reviews PID strategies and methods used by the large LHC
experiments, which provide outstanding examples of the state-of-the-art. The
first part focuses on the general design of these experiments with respect to
PID and the technologies used. Three PID techniques are discussed in more
detail: ionization measurements, time-of-flight measurements and Cherenkov
imaging. Four examples of the implementation of these techniques at the LHC are
given, together with selections of relevant examples from other experiments and
short overviews on new developments. Finally, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
(AMS 02) experiment is briefly described as an impressive example of a
space-based experiment using a number of familiar PID techniques.
