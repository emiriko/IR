Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a technique based on linear projection
theory, which has been frequently used for data analysis. It constitutes an
optimal (in the sense of least squares) decomposition of a matrix in the most
relevant directions of the data variance. Usually, this information is used to
reduce the dimensionality of the data set in a few principal projection
directions, this is called Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). In
situations where the data is continuously changing the projection might become
obsolete. Since the change rate of data can be fast, it is an interesting
question whether the TSVD projection of the initial data is reliable. In the
case of complex networks, this scenario is particularly important when
considering network growth. Here we study the reliability of the TSVD
projection of growing scale free networks, monitoring its evolution at global
and local scales.
