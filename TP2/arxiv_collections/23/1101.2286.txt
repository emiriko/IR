This paper constructs translation invariant operators on L2(R^d), which are
Lipschitz continuous to the action of diffeomorphisms. A scattering propagator
is a path ordered product of non-linear and non-commuting operators, each of
which computes the modulus of a wavelet transform. A local integration defines
a windowed scattering transform, which is proved to be Lipschitz continuous to
the action of diffeomorphisms. As the window size increases, it converges to a
wavelet scattering transform which is translation invariant. Scattering
coefficients also provide representations of stationary processes. Expected
values depend upon high order moments and can discriminate processes having the
same power spectrum. Scattering operators are extended on L2 (G), where G is a
compact Lie group, and are invariant under the action of G. Combining a
scattering on L2(R^d) and on Ld (SO(d)) defines a translation and rotation
invariant scattering on L2(R^d).
