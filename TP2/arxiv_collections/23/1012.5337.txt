This volume contains selected papers from the proceedings of the First
International Workshop on Strategies in Rewriting, Proving, and Programming
(IWS 2010), which was held on July 9, 2010, in Edinburgh, UK. Strategies are
ubiquitous in programming languages, automated deduction and reasoning systems.
In the two communities of Rewriting and Programming on one side, and of
Deduction and Proof engines (Provers, Assistants, Solvers) on the other side,
workshops have been launched to make progress towards a deeper understanding of
the nature of strategies, their descriptions, their properties, and their
usage, in all kinds of computing and reasoning systems. Since more recently,
strategies are also playing an important role in rewrite-based programming
languages, verification tools and techniques like SAT/SMT engines or
termination provers. Moreover strategies have come to be viewed more generally
as expressing complex designs for control in computing, modeling, proof search,
program transformation, and access control. IWS 2010 was organized as a
satellite workshop of FLoC 2010. FLoC 2010 provided an excellent opportunity to
foster exchanges between the communities of Rewriting and Programming on one
side, and of Deduction and Proof engines on the other side. IWS2010 was a joint
follow-up of two series of worshops, held since 1997: the Strategies workshops
held by the CADE-IJCAR community and the Workshops on Reduction Strategies
(WRS) held by the RTA-RDP community.
