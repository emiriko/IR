The cross section through gluon fusion is calculated for the production of
the light neutral Higgs boson through next-to-leading order QCD within the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The quark-mediated contributions are
taken into account exactly, while for the genuinely supersymmetric terms we use
expressions obtained in the limit of large squark, gluino and top quark masses.
We present numerical results for the total inclusive cross section as well as
for kinematical distributions of the Higgs boson. We also consider the effect
of an MSSM-like fourth generation on the total Higgs production cross section.
