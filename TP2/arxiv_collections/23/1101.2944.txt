Commutator-based entropic uncertainty relations in multidimensional position
and momentum spaces are derived, twofold generalizing previous entropic
uncertainty relations for one-mode states. They provide optimal lower bounds
and imply the multidimensional variance-based uncertainty principle. The
article concludes with an open conjecture.
