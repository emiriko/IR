The quantum degeneracy point approach [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886
(2002)] effectively protects superconducting qubits from low-frequency noise
that couples with the qubits as transverse noise. However, low-frequency noise
in superconducting qubits can originate from various mechanisms and can couple
with the qubits either as transverse or as longitudinal noise. Here, we present
a quantum circuit containing a universal quantum degeneracy point that protects
an encoded qubit from arbitrary low-frequency noise. We further show that
universal quantum logic gates can be performed on the encoded qubit with high
gate fidelity. The proposed scheme is robust against small parameter spreads
due to fabrication errors in the superconducting qubits.
