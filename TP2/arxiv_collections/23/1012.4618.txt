The quantum dynamics of interacting bosons in a one-dimensional system is
investigated numerically. We consider dissipative and conservative two-particle
interactions, and integrate the master equation describing the system dynamics
via a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) algorithm. Our numerical
simulations directly apply to stationary-light polaritons in systems where
atoms and photons are confined to the hollow core of a photonic crystal fibre.
We show that a two-particle loss term can drive an initially uncorrelated state
into a regime where correlations effectively inhibit the dissipation of
particles. The correlations induced by two-particle losses are compared with
those generated by an elastic repulsion. For the considered time range, we find
a similar behaviour in local density-density correlations but differences in
non-local correlations.
