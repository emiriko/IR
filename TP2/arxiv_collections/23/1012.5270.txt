We report experimental results obtained with a circuit possessing dynamic
logic architecture based on one of the theoretical schemes proposed by H. Peng
and collaborators in 2008. The schematic diagram of the electronic circuit and
its implementation to get different basic logic gates are displayed and
discussed. In particular, we show explicitly how to get the electronic NOR,
NAND, and XOR gates. The proposed electronic circuit is easy to build because
it employs only resistors, operational amplifiers and comparators
