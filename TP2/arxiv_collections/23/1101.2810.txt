Bilinear R-parity violating supersymmetric model is a viable model which can
explain the smallness of neutrino masses and the mixing pattern in the lepton
sector. In this model, there is a common set of parameters which determine the
neutralino and chargino masses, also determine the neutrino masses and the
anomalous magnetic moment of muon, $(g-2)_\mu$. From the experimental data on
neutrino masses and mixing angles, and also from the fact that the
experimentally measured value of $(g-2)_\mu$ differs from the corresponding
standard model value by 3$\sigma$, we have analyzed some constraints on these
model parameters. Constraints on these model parameters are obtained for some
values of supersymmetry breaking soft parameters. These constraints can set
upper and lower bounds on the chargino masses of this model.
