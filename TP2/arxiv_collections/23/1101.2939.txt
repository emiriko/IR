Lattice distortion induced by high concentration of H is believed to be
precursor of H blistering in single crystalline W (SCW) during H isotope
irradiation. However, the critical H concentration needed to trigger
bond-breaking of metal atoms presents a challenge to measure. Using density
functional theory, we have calculated the formation energy of a vacancy and a
self-interstitial atom (SIA) in supersaturated defect-free SCW with various H
concentrations. When the ratio of H:W exceeds 1:2, the formation of both
vacancies and self-interstitials becomes exothermic, meaning that spontaneous
formation of micro-voids which can accommodate molecular H2 will occur.
Molecular H2 is not allowed to form, and it is not needed either at the very
initial stage of H blistering in SCW. With supersaturated H, the free volume at
the vacancy or SIA is greatly smeared out with severe lattice distortion and
more H can be trapped than in the dilute H case.
