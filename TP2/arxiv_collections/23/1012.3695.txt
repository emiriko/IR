We consider the relation of symmetries and subspace controllability for spin
networks with XXZ coupling subject to control of a single node by a local
potential (Z-control). Such networks decompose into excitation subspaces.
Focusing on the single excitation subspace it is shown that for single-node
Z-controls external symmetries are characterized by eigenstates of the system
Hamiltonian that have zero overlap with the control node, and there are no
internal symmetries. It is further shown that there are symmetries that persist
even in the presence of random perturbations. For uniformly coupled XXZ chains
a characterization of all possible symmetries is given, which shows a strong
dependence on the position of the node we control. Finally, it is shown
rigorously for uniform Heisenberg and XX chains subject to single-node
Z-control that the lack of symmetry is not only necessary but sufficient for
subspace controllability. The latter approach is then generalized to establish
controllability results for simple branched networks.
