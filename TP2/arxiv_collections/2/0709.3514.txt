A novel type of hybrid colloids is presented, based on the association of
several polymeric systems and ferrofluids. On the one hand, we use inorganic
nanoparticles made of magnetic iron oxide prepared at the LI2C, which response
to a magnetic field of low intensity. On the other hand the organic part is
made either of long linear polyacrylamide chains or of mesoscopic structures
(vesicles and micelles) self-assembled from amphiphile
polybutadiene-b-poly(glutamic acid) di-block copolymers, which conformation is
pH-sensitive.
