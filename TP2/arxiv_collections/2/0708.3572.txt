We study spin-flavor oscillations of Dirac neutrinos with mixing and having
non-zero matrix of magnetic moments in magnetic fields of various
configurations. We discuss constant transversal and twisting magnetic fields.
To describe the dynamics of Dirac neutrinos we use relativistic quantum
mechanics approach based on the exact solutions to the Dirac-Pauli equation in
an external electromagnetic field. We derive transition probabilities for
different neutrino magnetic moments matrices.
