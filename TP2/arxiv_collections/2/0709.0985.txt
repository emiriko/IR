Classically it is impossible to have transport without transit, i.e., if the
points one, two and three lie sequentially along a path then an object moving
from one to three must, at some point in time, be located at two. However, for
a quantum particle in a three-well system it is possible to transport the
particle between wells one and three such that the probability of finding it at
any time in the classically accessible state in well two is negligible. We
consider theoretically the analogous scenario for a Bose-Einstein condensate
confined within a three well system. In particular, we predict the adiabatic
transportation of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of 2000 Li atoms from
well one to well three without transiting the allowed intermediate region. To
an observer of this macroscopic quantum effect it would appear that, over a
timescale of the order of one second, the condensate had transported, but not
transited, a macroscopic distance of 20 microns between wells one and three.
