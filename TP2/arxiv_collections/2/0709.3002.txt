In this paper we bring to light an hitherto undisclosed richness of this
Theory, namely its admitting a consistent reformulation which is able to
provide a unified scenario for all kinds of particles, be they lightlike or
not. This result hinges on a "generalized" Principle of Relativity which is
{intrinsic} to Einstein's Theory. The road leading to this generalization
starts, in the very spirit of Relativity, from enhancing full equivalence
between the four spacetime directions by requiring full equivalence between the
"motions" along these four spacetime directions as well. So far, no measurable
spatial velocity in the direction of the time axis has ever been defined, on
the same footing of the usual velocities in the local three-space of a given
observer. In this paper, we show how Relativity allows such a "time-velocity"
to be defined in a very natural way, for any particle and in any reference
frame. As a consequence of this natural definition, it also follows that the
time- and space-velocity vectors sum up to define a spacelike "world-velocity"
vector, the modulus of which turns out to be equal to the Maxwell's constant c,
irrespective of the observer who measures it. This {measurable} world-velocity
therefore represents the speed at which "all" kinds of particles move in
spacetime, according to any observer. As remarked above, the unifying scenario
thus emerging is intrinsic to Einstein's Theory; it extends the role
traditionally assigned to Maxwell's constant c, and can therefore justly be
referred to as "a generalized Principle of Relativity".
