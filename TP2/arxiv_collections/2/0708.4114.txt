Mutually unbiased bases in Hilbert spaces of finite dimensions are closely
related to the quantal notion of complementarity. An alternative proof of
existence of a maximal collection of N+1 mutually unbiased bases in Hilbert
spaces of prime dimension N is given by exploiting the finite Heisenberg group
(also called the Pauli group) and the action of SL(2,Z_N) on finite phase space
Z_N x Z_N implemented by unitary operators in the Hilbert space. Crucial for
the proof is that, for prime N, Z_N is also a finite field.
