In order to elucidate the nature of ferromagnetic signatures observed in
(Zn,Co)O we have examined experimentally and theoretically magnetic properties
and spin-dependent quantum localization effects that control low-temperature
magnetoresistance. Our findings, together with a through structural
characterization, substantiate the model assigning spontaneous magnetization of
(Zn,Co)O to uncompensated spins at the surface of antiferromagnetic nanocrystal
of Co-rich wurtzite (Zn,Co)O. The model explains a large anisotropy observed in
both magnetization and magnetoresistance in terms of spin hamiltonian of Co
ions in the crystal field of the wurtzite lattice.
