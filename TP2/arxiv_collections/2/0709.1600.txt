The angular momentum is conserved in fluids with a few exceptions such as
ferrofluids. However it can be violated locally in fluid simulations to reduce
computational costs. The effects of this violation are investigated using a
particle-based simulation method, multi-particle collision dynamics, which can
switch on or off angular-momentum conservation. To this end, we study circular
Couette flows between concentric and eccentric cylinders, where non-physical
torques due to the lack of the angular-momentum conservation are found whereas
the velocity field is not affected. In addition, in simulations of fluids with
different viscosities in contact and star polymers in solvent, incorrect
angular velocities occur. These results quantitatively agree with the
theoretical predictions based on the macroscopic stress tensor.
