Paring correlations in weakly bound halo nuclei $^{6}$He and $^{11}$Li are
studied by using a three-body model with a density-dependent contact
interaction. We investigate the spatial structure of two-neutron wave function
in a Borromean nucleus $^{11}$Li.The behavior of the neutron pair at different
densities is simulated by calculating the two-neutron wave function at several
distances between the core nucleus $^9$Li and the center of mass of the two
neutrons. With this representation, a strong concentration of the neutron pair
on the nuclear surface is quantitatively established for neutron-rich nuclei.
Dipole excitations in $^{6}$He and $^{11}$Li are also studied within the same
three-body model and compared with experimental data. The small open angles
between the two neutrons from the core are extracted empirically by the B(E1)
sum rule together with the rms mass radii, indicating the strong di-neutron
correlation in the halo nuclei.
