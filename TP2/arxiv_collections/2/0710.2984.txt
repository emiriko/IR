The in-plane polarizational stopping power of heavy-ion diclusters in a
two-dimensional strongly coupled electron liquid is studied. Analytical
expressions for the stopping power of both fast and slow projectiles are
derived. To go beyond the random-phase approximation we make use of the inverse
dielectric function obtained by means of the method of moments and some recent
analytical expressions for the static local-field correction factor.
