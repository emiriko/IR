Calculations of microscopic optical potentials (OP's) (their real and
imaginary parts) are performed to analyze the $^6$He+p elastic scattering data
at a few tens of MeV/nucleon (MeV/N). The OP's and the cross sections are
calculated using three model densities of $^6$He. Effects of the regularization
of the NN forces and their dependence on nuclear density are investigated.
Also, the role of the spin-orbit terms and of the non-linearity in the
calculations of the OP's, as well as effects of their renormalization are
studied. The sensitivity of the cross sections to the nuclear densities was
tested and one of them that gives a better agreement with the data was chosen.
