I consider the two-body decay of a particle at a hadron collider into a
visible and an invisible particle, generalizing $W \to e \nu$, where the masses
of the decaying particle and the invisible decay particle are, {\em a priori},
unknown. I prove that the transverse mass, when maximized over possible
kinematic configurations, can be used to determine both of the unknown masses.
I argue that the proof can be generalized to cover cases such as decays of
pair-produced superpartners to the lightest, stable superpartner at the Large
Hadron Collider.
