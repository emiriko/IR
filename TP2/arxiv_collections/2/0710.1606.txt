A mathematical framework for Continuous Time Finance based on operator
algebraic methods offers a new direct and entirely constructive perspective on
the field and leads to new numerical analysis techniques. This is partly a
review paper as it covers and expands on the mathematical framework underlying
a series of more applied articles. In addition, this article also presents a
few key new theorems that make the treatment self-contained. Stochastic
processes with continuous time and continuous space variables are defined
constructively by establishing new convergence estimates for Markov chains on
simplicial sequences. We emphasize high precision computability by numerical
linear algebra methods as opposed to the ability of arriving to analytically
closed form expressions in terms of special functions. Path dependent processes
adapted to a given Markov filtration are associated to an operator algebra. If
this algebra is commutative, the corresponding process is named Abelian, a
concept which provides a far reaching extension of the notion of stochastic
integral. We recover the classic Cameron-Dyson-Feynman-Girsanov-Ito-Kac-Martin
theorem as a particular case of a broadly general block-diagonalization
algorithm. This technique has many applications ranging from the problem of
pricing cliquets to target-redemption-notes and volatility derivatives.
Non-Abelian processes are also relevant and appear in several important
applications to for instance snowballs and soft calls. We show that in these
cases one can effectively use block-factorization algorithms. Finally, we
discuss the method of dynamic conditioning that allows one to dynamically
correlate over possibly even hundreds of processes in a numerically noiseless
framework while preserving marginal distributions.
