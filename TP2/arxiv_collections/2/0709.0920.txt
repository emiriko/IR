We polarize nuclear spins in a GaAs double quantum dot by controlling
two-electron spin states near the anti-crossing of the singlet (S) and m_S=+1
triplet (T+) using pulsed gates. An initialized S state is cyclically brought
into resonance with the T+ state, where hyperfine fields drive rapid rotations
between S and T+, 'flipping' an electron spin and 'flopping' a nuclear spin.
The resulting Overhauser field approaches 80 mT, in agreement with a simple
rate-equation model. A self-limiting pulse sequence is developed that allows
the steady-state nuclear polarization to be set using a gate voltage.
