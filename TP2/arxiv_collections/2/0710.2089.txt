We show that the angular spectrum of type-II SPDC contains a continuum of
maximally entangled states. For the realization of a bright source of entangled
two-photon states, a standard technique is to compensate for the transverse
walk-off in the production crystal. We demonstrate that polarization entangled
states can be effectively engineered by generalizing this approach. Our method
allows to considerably enrich the set of generated entangled states with a
controlled tailoring them.
