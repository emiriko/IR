We study the disorder driven superconductor to insulator transition in
amorphous films of high carrier-concentration indium-oxide. Using thin films
with various sizes and aspect ratios we show that the `critical'
sheet-resistance $R_{{\small \square}}$ depends systematically on sample
geometry; superconductivity disappears when $R_{{\small \square}}$ exceeds
$\approx6 $k$\Omega$ in large samples. On the other hand, wide and sufficiently
short samples of the same batch exhibit superconductivity (judged by
conductivity versus temperature) up to $R_{{\small \square}}$ which is
considerably larger. These results support the inhomogeneous scenario for the
superconductor-insulator transition.
