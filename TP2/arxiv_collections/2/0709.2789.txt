PT-symmetric solutions of Schrodinger equation are obtained for the Scarf and
generalized harmonic oscillator potentials with the position-dependent mass. A
general point canonical transformation is applied by using a free parameter.
Three different forms of mass distributions are used. A set of the energy
eigenvalues of the bound states and corresponding wave functions for target
potentials are obtained as a function of the free parameter.
