In this note we set-up an explicit 5D construction of AdS-fragmentation,
whereby a single black ring splits-up into a multi-black ring configuration.
Furthermore it is seen that these fragmented rings are equivalent to a direct
5D lift of 4D multi-center black holes. Along the way we also determine the
4D/5D transformations relevant for multi-center charges. It is seen that the
physical charges involved in black ring fragmentation are Page charges arising
due to 5D Chern-Simons terms. As an application of these methods, we reproduce
the total angular momentum of concentric black rings, originally due to
Gauntlett and Gutowski. Finally we provide a geometric interpretation of
fragmented black rings using the idea of split-spectral flows, which seeks to
study charge shifts of a given black ring due to fluxes generated in a
multi-ring background.
