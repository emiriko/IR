A study of the charge and matter densities and the corresponding rms radii
for even-even isotopes of Ni, Kr, and Sn has been performed in the framework of
deformed self-consistent mean field Skyrme HF+BCS method. The resulting charge
radii and neutron skin thicknesses of these nuclei are compared with available
experimental data, as well as with other theoretical predictions. The formation
of a neutron skin, which manifests itself in an excess of neutrons at distances
greater than the radius of the proton distribution, is analyzed in terms of
various definitions. Formation of a proton skin is shown to be unlikely. The
effects of deformation on the neutron skins in even-even deformed nuclei far
from the stability line are discussed.
