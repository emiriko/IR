We construct a family of BCS paired composite fermion wavefunctions that
generalize, but remain in the same topological phase as, the Moore-Read
Pfaffian state for the half-filled Landau level. It is shown that for a wide
range of experimentally relevant inter-electron interactions the groundstate
can be very accurately represented in this form.
