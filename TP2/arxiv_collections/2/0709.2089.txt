The current noise through a mesoscopic quantum dot is calculated and analyzed
in the Fermi liquid regime of the SU(N) Kondo model. Results connect the
Johnson-Nyquist noise to the shot noise for an arbitrary ratio of voltage and
temperature, and show that temperature corrections are sizeable in usual
experiments. For the experimentally relevant SU(4) case, quasiparticle
interactions are shown to increase the shot noise.
