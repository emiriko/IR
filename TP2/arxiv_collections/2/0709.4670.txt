The spin precession frequency of muons stored in the $(g-2)$ storage ring has
been analyzed for evidence of Lorentz and CPT violation. Two Lorentz and CPT
violation signatures were searched for: a nonzero $\Delta\omega_{a}$
(=$\omega_{a}^{\mu^{+}}-\omega_{a}^{\mu^{-}}$); and a sidereal variation of
$\omega_{a}^{\mu^{\pm}}$. No significant effect is found, and the following
limits on the standard-model extension parameters are obtained: $b_{Z} =-(1.0
\pm 1.1)\times 10^{-23}$ GeV; $(m_{\mu}d_{Z0}+H_{XY}) = (1.8 \pm 6.0 \times
10^{-23})$ GeV; and the 95% confidence level limits
$\check{b}_{\perp}^{\mu^{+}}< 1.4 \times 10^{-24}$ GeV and
$\check{b}_{\perp}^{\mu^{-}} < 2.6 \times 10^{-24}$ GeV.
