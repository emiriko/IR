The relativistic corrections in the Hamiltonian for a particle in a uniformly
rotating frame are discussed. They are shown to be negligible in the case of
ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) in the Earth's gravity. The effect, on the energy
levels of UCN, of the main term due to the Earth's rotation, i.e. the
angular-momentum term, is calculated. The energy shift is found proportional to
the energy level itself.
