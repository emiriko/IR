While the Higgs model is the best studied scenario of electroweak symmetry
breaking, a number strongly-coupled models exist, predicting new signatures.
Recent studies of WW and WZ final states at the ATLAS and CMS experiments are
summarized and expected sensitivities are presented within the frameworks of
the technicolor straw-man model and the electroweak chiral Lagrangian.
