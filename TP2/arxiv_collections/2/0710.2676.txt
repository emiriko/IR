Silicon stripixel sensors which were developed at BNL will be installed as
part of the RHIC-PHENIX silicon vertex tracker (VTX). RHIC II operations
provide luminosity up to 2x10^32 /cm2/s so the silicon stripixel sensors will
be exposed to a significant amount of radiation. The most problematic radiation
effect for VTX is the increase of leakage current, which degrades the signal to
noise ratio and may saturate the readout electronics.
  We studied the radiation damage using the same diodes as CERN-RD48. First,
the proportionality between the irradiation fluence and the increase of leakage
current of CERN-RD48 was reproduced. Then beam experiments with stripixel
sensor were done in which leakage current was found to increase in the same way
as that of thereference diode.
  A stripixel sensor was also irradiated at the PHENIX interaction region (IR)
during the 2006 run. We found the same relation between the integrated
luminosity and determined fluence from increase of leakage current. The
expected fluence is 3-6x10^12 Neq/cm2 (1 MeV neutron equivalent) in RHIC II
operations for 10 years. Due to this expected exposure, setting the operating
temperature in PHENIX to T< 0 deg. C to suppress leakage current is needed to
avoid saturation of preamplifiers.
