We report on the microwave surface resistance of two polycrystalline Mg11B2
samples; one consists of pristine material, the other has been irradiated at
very high neutron fluence. It has already been reported that in the strongly
irradiated sample the two gaps merge into a single value. The mw surface
resistance has been measured in the linear regime as a function of the
temperature and the DC magnetic field, at increasing and decreasing fields. The
results obtained in the strongly irradiated sample are quite well justified in
the framework of a generalized Coffey and Clem model, in which we take into
account the field distribution inside the sample due to the critical state. The
results obtained in the pristine sample show several anomalies, especially at
low temperatures, which cannot be justified in the framework of standard models
for the fluxon dynamics. Only at temperatures near Tc and for magnetic fields
greater than 0.5Hc2(T) the experimental data can quantitatively be accounted
for by the Coffey and Clem model, provided that the upper-critical-field
anisotropy is taken into due account.
