We have investigated the magnetotransport properties of a single-layer
graphene Hall bar with additional graphene side gates. The side gating in the
absence of a magnetic field can be modeled by considering two parallel
conducting channels within the Hall bar. This results in an average penetration
depth of the side gate created field of approx. 90 nm. The side gates are also
effective in the quantum Hall regime, and allow to modify the longitudinal and
Hall resistances.
