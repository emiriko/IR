Generalized Super-Cerenkov Radiations (SCR), as well as their SCR-signatures
are investigated and classified. Two general SCR- coherence conditions are
found as two natural extremes of the same spontaneous particles decay in
(dielectric, nuclear or hadronic) media The main results on the quantum theory
of the SCR-phenomena as well as the results of the first experimental test of
the super-coherence conditions, obtained by using the experimental data from
BNL are presented. The new concepts such as: SCR-gluons, SCR-W-bosons and
SCR-Z-bosons, all three suggested by elementary particle classification, are
introduced. The gluonic Super-Cerenkov-like radiation, first introduced here,
is schematically described. The interpretation of some recent RHIC results as
signature of the SCR-gluons is suggested.
