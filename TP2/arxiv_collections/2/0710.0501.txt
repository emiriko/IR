In this paper we carry out the boundary form factor program for the
A(2)-affine Toda field theory at the self-dual point. The latter is an
integrable model consisting of a pair of particles which are conjugated to each
other and possessing two bound states resulting from the scattering processes 1
+1 -> 2 and 2+2-> 1. We obtain solutions up to four particle form factors for
two families of fields which can be identified with spinless and spin-1 fields
of the bulk theory. Previously known as well as new bulk form factor solutions
are obtained as a particular limit of ours. Minimal solutions of the boundary
form factor equations for all A(n)-affine Toda field theories are given, which
will serve as starting point for a generalisation of our results to higher rank
algebras.
