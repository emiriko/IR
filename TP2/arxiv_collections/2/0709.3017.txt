We study the gapped phase of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice using
perturbative continuous unitary transformations. The effective low-energy
Hamiltonian is found to be an extended toric code with interacting anyons.
High-energy excitations are emerging free fermions which are composed of
hardcore bosons with an attached string of spin operators. The excitation
spectrum is mapped onto that of a single particle hopping on a square lattice
in a magnetic field. We also illustrate how to compute correlation functions in
this framework. The present approach yields analytical perturbative results in
the thermodynamical limit without using the Majorana or the Jordan-Wigner
fermionization initially proposed to solve this problem.
