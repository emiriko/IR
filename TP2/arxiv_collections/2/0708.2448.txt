Experimental study of quantum Hall corrals reveals Aharonov-Bohm-Like (ABL)
oscillations. Unlike the Aharonov-Bohm effect which has a period of one flux
quantum, $\Phi_{0}$, the ABL oscillations possess a flux period of
$\Phi_{0}/f$, where $f$ is the integer number of fully filled Landau levels in
the constrictions. Detection of the ABL oscillations is limited to the low
magnetic field side of the $\nu_{c}$ = 1, 2, 4, 6... integer quantum Hall
plateaus. These oscillations can be understood within the Coulomb blockade
model of quantum Hall interferometers as forward tunneling and backscattering,
respectively, through the center island of the corral from the bulk and the
edge states. The evidence for quantum interference is weak and circumstantial.
