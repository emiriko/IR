We simulate from first-principles the energetic, structural, and electronic
properties of ferroelectric domains in ultrathin capacitors made of a few unit
cells of BaTiO$_3$ between two metallic SrRuO$_3$ electrodes in short circuit.
The domains are stabilized down to two unit cells, adopting the form of a
domain of closure, common in ferromagnets but only recently detected
experimentally in ferroelectric thin films. The domains are closed by the
in-plane relaxation of the atoms in the first SrO layer of the electrode, that
behaves more like SrO in highly polarizable SrTiO$_3$ than in metallic
SrRuO$_3$. Even if small, these lateral displacements are essential to
stabilize the domains, and might provide some hints to explain why some systems
break into domains while others remain in a monodomain configuration. An
analysis of the electrostatic potential reveals preferential points of pinning
for charged defects at the ferroelectric-electrode interface, possibly playing
a major role in films fatigue.
