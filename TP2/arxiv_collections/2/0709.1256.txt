Three (or four) straightforward experiments would contribute greatly to
completing the spectroscopy of baryons and light mesons. In the baryon sector,
data are needed on inelastic reactions from a polarised target with pi and kaon
beams up to 3 GeV/c. Similar data are needed in the light meson sector for
pbar-p interactions in the momentum range 0.3 to 2 GeV/c. In both cases,
valuable information is to be obtained from longitudinal (L) and sideways (S)
target polarisations as well as the conventional normal (N) polarisation.
Thirdly, 3S_1 and 3D_1 mesons in the mass range 1 to 2.4 GeV/c could probably
be separated either by diffractive dissociation of transversely polarised
photons or by radiative return experiments using transversely and
longitudinally polarised electrons.
