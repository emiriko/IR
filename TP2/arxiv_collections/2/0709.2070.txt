In this work, we aim to gain a better understanding of the volatility smile
observed in options markets through microsimulation (MS). We adopt two types of
active traders in our MS model: speculators and arbitrageurs, and call and put
options on one underlying asset. Speculators make decisions based on their
expectations of the asset price at the option expiration time. Arbitrageurs
trade at different arbitrage opportunities such as violation of put-call
parity. Difference in liquidity among options is also included. Notwithstanding
its simplicity, our model can generate implied volatility (IV) curves similar
to empirical observations. Our results suggest that the volatility smile is
related to the competing effect of heterogeneous trading behavior and the
impact of differential liquidity.
