It is shown that the ground-state and the lowest excited-states of
two-dimensional electron system (2DES), with ion jellium background, correspond
to partial crystal-like (with the period $L_{x}^{\square}=\sqrt{2 m \pi}
\ell_{0}$) correlation order among $N$ electrons of the main region (MR; $L_{x}
\times L_{y}$). Many-body variational ground-state wave function of 2DES is
presented at the fractional and the integral filling factors $\nu=1/m$;
$m=2\ell+1$ and $\ell=0, 1, 2,...$. The ground-state manifests the broken
symmetry liquid-crystal state with 2DES density that is periodic along the $y-$
direction, with the period $L_{x}^{\square}/m$, and independent of $x$. At
$m=3, 5$, the ground-state has essentially lower energy per electron than the
Laughlin, uniform liquid, ground-state; the same holds at $m=1$. At $m \geq 3$,
the compound form of the many-body ground-state wave function leads to the
compound structure of each electron within the main strip (MS; $L_{x}^{\square}
\times L_{y}$). Obtained compound exciton and compound spin-exciton states show
finite excitation gaps. The excited compound electron (hole) is composed,
within MS, from $m$ strongly correlated quasielectrons (quasiholes) of the
total charge $e/m$ ($-e/m$) each. The activation gap is obtained: it is given
by the excitation gap of relevant compound exciton, at $m \geq 3$, and by the
gap of pertinent compound spin-exciton, at $m=1$. Quantized Hall conductance
$\sigma_{H}=e^{2}/(2 m \pi \hbar)$ is obtained. The theory is in good agreement
with experiments.
