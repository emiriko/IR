We present a detailed study of the production of a high transverse-momentum
lepton pair at hadron colliders, which includes the exact O(alpha) electroweak
corrections properly matched with leading logarithmic effects due to multiple
photon emission, as required by the experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron and
the CERN LHC. Numerical results for the relevant observables of single Z-boson
production at hadron colliders are presented. The impact of the radiative
corrections is discussed in detail. The presence in the proton of a photon
density is considered and the effects of the photon-induced partonic
subprocesses are analyzed. The calculation has been implemented in the new
version of the event generator HORACE, which is available for precision
simulations of the neutral and charged current Drell-Yan processes.
