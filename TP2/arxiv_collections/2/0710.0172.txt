The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC studies the
new state of matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions and the spin
structure of the nucleon in collisions of polarized protons. In order to
improve the capabilities for heavy flavor measurements and the reconstruction
of charged vector bosons an upgrade of the tracking system both in the central
and the forward region is pursued. The challenging environments of high track
multiplicity in heavy ion collisions and of high luminosity in polarized proton
collisions require the use of new technologies. The proposed inner tracking
system, optimized for heavy flavor identification, is using active pixel
sensors close to the collision point and silicon strip technology further
outward. Charge sign determination for electrons and positrons from the decay
of W bosons will be provide by 6 large-area triple GEM disks currently under
development. A prototype of the active pixel detectors has been tested in the
STAR experiment, and an extensive beam test of triple GEM detectors using GEM
foils produced by Tech-Etch of Plymouth, MA has been done at Fermilab.
