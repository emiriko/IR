Ground state energies and chemical potentials of parahydrogen clusters are
calculated from 3 to 40 molecules using the diffusion Monte Carlo technique
with two different pH2-pH2 interactions. This calculation improves a previous
one by the inclusion of three-body correlations in the importance sampling, by
the time step adjustement and by a better estimation of the statistical errors.
Apart from the cluster with 13 molecules, no other magic clusters are
predicted, in contrast with path integral Monte Carlo results.
