Pseudogap regime for the prototype high-Tc compounds hole doped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-x (Bi2212) and electron doped Nd2-xCexCuO4 (NCCO) is described by
means of novel generalized LDA+DMFT+Sk approach. Here conventional dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) equations are supplied with additional (momentum
dependent) self-energy Sk. In the present case Sk describes non-local dynamical
correlations induced by short-ranged collective Heisenberg-like
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Material specific model parameters of two
neighboring CuO2 layers of Bi2212 and single CuO2 layer of NCCO were obtained
within local density approximation (LDA) and constrained LDA method. We show
that Fermi surface in presence of the pseudogap fluctuations have perfectly
visible "hot-spots" for NCCO while in Bi2212 there is just rather broad region
with strong antiferromagnetic scattering. Results obtained are in good
agreement with recent ARPES and optical experiments.
