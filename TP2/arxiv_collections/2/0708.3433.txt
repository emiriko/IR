A molecular wire coupled to two electron reservoirs is investigated within a
tight-binding approach including spin and Coulomb interaction. Under the
assumption of weak coupling to the electron reservoirs a quantum master
equation can be derived for the electron transport through the wire. Motivated
by the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling for monochromatic laser
fields, the influence of Gaussian laser pulses on the transport through the
wires is studied. For situations in which the maximum amplitude of the electric
field fulfills the conditions for the destructive quantum effect the average
current through the system can be suppressed even for a wire consisting of only
one site. Turning on the electron correlation does not destroy the suppression
of the current by the laser.
