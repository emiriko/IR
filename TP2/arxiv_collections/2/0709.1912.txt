We discuss the limitations of the standard collinear approach. The
kinematical approximations necessary to derive the collinear factorization are
insufficient for the description of the exclusive final states. We argue that
for a proper treatment of the final states one needs to use fully unintegrated
parton correlation functions. We introduce the gauge invariant definitions of
these objects and the factorization theorem for one jet production in deep
inelastic scattering.
