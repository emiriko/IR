Using first principles molecular dynamics simulations, we have determined the
threshold displacement energies and the associated created defects in cubic
silicon carbide. Contrary to previous studies using classical molecular
dynamics, we found values close to the experimental consensus, and also created
defects in good agreement with recent works on interstitials stability in
silicon carbide. We carefully investigated the limits of this approach. Our
work shows that it is possible to calculate displacement energies with first
principles accuracy in silicon carbide, and suggests that it may be also the
case for other covalent materials.
