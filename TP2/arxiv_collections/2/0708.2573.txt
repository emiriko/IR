The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) was used in conjunction with a large-gap
dipole magnet (Sweeper) to measure neutron-unbound states in oxygen isotopes
close to the neutron dripline. While no excited states were observed in 24O, a
resonance at 45(2) keV above the neutron separation energy was observed in 23O.
