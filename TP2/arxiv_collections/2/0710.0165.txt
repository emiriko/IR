Using the CLEO-c detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we have
measured inclusive and exclusive cross sections for the production of $D^+$,
$D^0$ and $D_s^+$ mesons in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilations at thirteen
center-of-mass energies between 3.97 and 4.26 GeV. Exclusive cross sections are
presented for final states consisting of two charmed mesons ($D\bar{D}$,
$D^{*}\bar{D}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, $D_s^+ D_s^-$, $D_s^{*+} D_s^-$, and
$D_s^{*+} D_s^{*-}$) and for processes in which the charmed meson pair is
accompanied by a pion.
