We present a quenched lattice calculation of the weak nucleon form factors:
vector (F_V(q^2)), induced tensor (F_T(q^2)), axial-vector (F_A(q^2)) and
induced pseudo-scalar (F_P(q^2)) form factors. Our simulations are performed on
three different lattice sizes L^3 x T=24^3 x 32, 16^3 x 32 and 12^3 x 32 with a
lattice cutoff of 1/a = 1.3 GeV and light quark masses down to about 1/4 the
strange quark mass (m_{pi} = 390 MeV) using a combination of the DBW2 gauge
action and domain wall fermions. The physical volume of our largest lattice is
about (3.6 fm)^3, where the finite volume effects on form factors become
negligible and the lower momentum transfers (q^2 = 0.1 GeV^2) are accessible.
The q^2-dependences of form factors in the low q^2 region are examined. It is
found that the vector, induced tensor, axial-vector form factors are well
described by the dipole form, while the induced pseudo-scalar form factor is
consistent with pion-pole dominance. We obtain the ratio of axial to vector
coupling g_A/g_V=F_A(0)/F_V(0)=1.219(38) and the pseudo-scalar coupling
g_P=m_{mu}F_P(0.88m_{mu}^2)=8.15(54), where the errors are statistical erros
only. These values agree with experimental values from neutron beta decay and
muon capture on the proton. However, the root mean squared radii of the vector,
induced tensor and axial-vector underestimate the known experimental values by
about 20%. We also calculate the pseudo-scalar nucleon matrix element in order
to verify the axial Ward-Takahashi identity in terms of the nucleon matrix
elements, which may be called as the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation.
