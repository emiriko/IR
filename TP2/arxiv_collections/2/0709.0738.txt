In this article we introduce a new complexity class called PQMA_log(2).
Informally, this is the class of languages for which membership has a
logarithmic-size quantum proof with perfect completeness and soundness which is
polynomially close to 1 in a context where the verifier is provided a proof
with two unentangled parts. We then show that PQMA_log(2) = NP. For this to be
possible, it is important, when defining the class, not to give too much power
to the verifier. This result, when compared to the fact that QMA_log = BQP,
gives us new insight on the power of quantum information and the impact of
entanglement.
