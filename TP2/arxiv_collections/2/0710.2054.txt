After years of research into colossal magnetoresistant (CMR) manganites using
bulk techniques, there has been a recent upsurge in experiments directly
probing the electronic states at or near the surface of the bilayer CMR
materials La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ using angle-resolved photoemission
or scanning probe microscopy. Here we report new, temperature dependent, angle
resolved photoemission data from single crystals with a doping level of
$x=0.36$. The first important result is that there is no sign of a pseudogap in
the charge channel of this material for temperatures below the Curie
temperature $T_C$. The second important result concerns the temperature
dependence of the electronic states. The temperature dependent changes in the
Fermi surface spectra both at the zone face and zone diagonal regions in
$k$-space indicate that the coherent quasiparticle weight disappears for
temperatures significantly above $T_C$, and that the $k$-dependence of the
T-induced changes in the spectra invalidate an interpretation of these data in
terms of the superposition of a `universal' metallic spectrum and an insulating
spectrum whose relative weight changes with temperature. In this sense, our
data are not compatible with a phase separation scenario.
