We apply the methods of Chiral Perturbation Theory to the analysis of the
first moments of the Generalized Parton Distributions in a Nucleon, usually
known as generalized form factors. These quantities are currently also under
investigation in Lattice QCD analyses of baryon structure, providing simulation
results at large quark masses to be extrapolated to the "real world" via Chiral
Effective Field Theory. We have performed a leading-one-loop calculation in the
covariant framework of Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (BChPT), predicting
both the momentum and the quark-mass dependence for all the vector and axial
(generalized) form factors. In particular we discuss the results for the limit
of vanishing four-momentum transfer where the GPD-moments reduce to the well
known moments of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). We fit our results to
available lattice QCD data, extrapolating down to the physical point. We
conclude by presenting outstanding results from a combined fit to different
GPDs-moments.
