We study flavor-changing neutral current and CP violations in the minimal
supersymmetric left-right model. We calculate the beyond-standard-model
contributions to the neutral kaon mixing $\Delta M_K$ and $\epsilon$, and find
possible to have a numerical cancelation between the contributions from the
right-handed gauge boson and supersymmetric box diagram. With the cancelation,
the right-handed $W$-boson mass scale can be lowered to about 2 TeV, well
within the search limit of LHC.
