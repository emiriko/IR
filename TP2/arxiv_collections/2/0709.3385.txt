The main thesis of this paper deals with the interactions of a set of
fermions which are described by one basic type of bilinear interactions,two
symmetric semiobjects,three embedded shells and four fundamental (strong)
gravito-electro-magnetic forces between left and right semiobjects,i.e
semifermions.
