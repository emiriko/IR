Using Schroedinger functional techniques, we determine the coefficient of the
clover term necessary for non-perturbative O(a) improvement of hypercubic
smeared Wilson fermions on a quenched plaquette action background. Unlike for
unsmeared Wilson fermions, the resulting clover coefficients are close to the
tree-level value even at coarse lattice spacings, indicating the absence of
large cutoff effects. A number of exploratory tests are also performed with the
improved action.
