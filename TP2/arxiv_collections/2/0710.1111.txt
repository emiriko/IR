We present a calculation of the form factor for B -> D* l nu using a 2+1
improved staggered action for the light quarks (on the MILC configurations),
and the Fermilab action for the heavy quarks. The form factor is computed at
zero recoil using a new double ratio method which yields the form factor more
directly than previous approaches.
