Using electron-phonon mechanism, we explains very well the spatial
anti-orrelation between the energy-gap and the energy of phonon mode for
cuprate superconductor found in d^2I/dV^2 spectrum by STM measurements [Jinho
Lee, et.al Nature {\bf 442},546 (2006)], which is the direct effect of a
relation $M<\omega^{2}>\lambda=const$. We calculate T$_{C}$ maps on
$\lambda-\Omega_{P}$ plane which help us understanding the relation
M<\omega^{2}>\lambda=const$ and the superconductivity of superconductors.
