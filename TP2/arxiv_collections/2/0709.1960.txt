We consider the $W$-pair production for both $e^+e^-$ and hadron colliders in
the context of unparticle physics associated with the scale invariant sector
proposed by Georgi. We have shown that the unparticle contributions are quite
comparable with standard model (SM) specially for low values of non-integral
scaling dimension $ (d_{\cal U}) $ and hence it is worthwhile to explore in
future colliders.
