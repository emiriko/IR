A high significance observation of two muon signals, the shadow of the sun
and moon, have been seen by the \unit[5.4]{kt} MINOS Far Detector, at a depth
of \unit[2070]{mwe}. The distribution of angular separation of muons near the
moon was well described by a Gaussian, which was used to determine the angular
resolution ($0.34^{\circ}\pm0.07^{\circ}$) and pointing
($0.3^{\circ}\pm0.05^{\circ}$) of the detector.
