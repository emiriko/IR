In this paper, the regulating effect of guiding filters on the energies of
solitons in wave-length division multiplexing (WDM) transmission systems is
rigorously studied. More precisely, it is shown that guiding filters prevent
the energies of solitons from decaying to zero in long distances. This goal is
achieved by studying a mathematical model of the evolution of energies of
solitons in transmission systems. The approach is mathematical and does not use
numerical or experimental results available in the literature; nevertheless, it
reaffirms such results.
