We show several examples were the tensor interaction of the lowest order G
matrix in a nucleus is too strong. The examples include the quadrupole moment
of $^{6}$Li, the isosplitting of the lowest 0$^{-}$ states in $^{16}$O, the
near vanishing Gamow-Teller matrix element in the weak decay of the J=0 T=1
state of $^{14}$O to the J=1 T=0 ground state of $^{14}$N, and the magnitude of
the deformation of $^{12}$C. It would appear that we could get better results
by decreasing the tensor interaction strength by about a factor of two. We then
examine the simple estimates of Gerry Brown concerning second order tensor
effects. We note that for the triplet even channel the combination of first and
second order tensor does indeed yield an effective weaker tensor interaction
and helps to get better agreement with experiment.
