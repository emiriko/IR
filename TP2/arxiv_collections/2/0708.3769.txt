Ultraviolet and visible radiation is observed from the contacts of a scanning
tunneling microscope with Si(100) and (111) wafers. This luminescence relies on
the presence of hot electrons in silicon, which are supplied, at positive bias
on n- and p-type samples, through the injection from the tip, or, at negative
bias on p-samples, by Zener tunneling. Measured spectra reveal a contribution
of direct optical transitions in Si bulk. The necessary holes well below the
valence band edge are injected from the tip or generated by Auger processes.
