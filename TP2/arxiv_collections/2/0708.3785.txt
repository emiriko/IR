We investigate the usefulness of a recently introduced five qubit state by
Brown $\it et al. \normalfont$ \cite{Brown} for quantum teleportation, quantum
state sharing and superdense coding. It is shown that this five-qubit state can
be utilized for perfect teleportation of arbitrary single and two qubit
systems. We devise various schemes for quantum state sharing of an arbitrary
single and two particle state via cooperative teleportation. We later show that
this state can be used for superdense coding as well. It is found that five
classical bits can be sent by sending only three quantum bits.
