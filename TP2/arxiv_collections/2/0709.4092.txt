We report on a program for the numerical evaluation of divergent multi-loop
integrals. The program is based on iterated sector decomposition. We improve
the original algorithm of Binoth and Heinrich such that the program is
guaranteed to terminate. The program can be used to compute numerically the
Laurent expansion of divergent multi-loop integrals regulated by dimensional
regularisation. The symbolic and the numerical steps of the algorithm are
combined into one program.
