One of the main endeavors at future high-energy colliders is the search for
the Higgs boson(s) and, once found, the probe of the fundamental properties. In
particular, the charge conjugation and parity (CP) quantum numbers have to be
determined. We show that these are unambiguously accessible at future $e^+e^-$
colliders through the measurement of the total cross section and the top
polarization in associated Higgs production with top quark pairs.
