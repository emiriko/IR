Cross sections for supersymmetric particles production at hadron colliders
have been extensively studied in the past at leading order and also at
next-to-leading order of perturbative QCD. The radiative corrections include
large logarithms which have to be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling
constant in order to get reliable perturbative results. In this work, we
perform a first and extensive study of the resummation effects for
supersymmetric particle pair production at hadron colliders. We focus on
Drell-Yan like slepton-pair and slepton-sneutrino associated production in
minimal supergravity and gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking scenarios, and
present accurate transverse-momentum and invariant-mass distributions, as well
as total cross sections.
  In non-minimal supersymmetric models, novel effects of flavour violation may
occur. In this case, the flavour structure in the squark sector cannot be
directly deduced from the trilinear Yukawa couplings of the fermion and Higgs
supermultiplets. We perform a precise numerical analysis of the experimentally
allowed parameter space in the case of minimal supergravity scenarios with
non-minimal flavour violation, looking for regions allowed by low-energy,
electroweak precision, and cosmological data. Leading order cross sections for
the production of squarks and gauginos at hadron colliders are implemented in a
flexible computer program, allowing us to study in detail the dependence of
these cross sections on flavour violation.
