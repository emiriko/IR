A trial wave function for two-dimensional quantum dot helium in an arbitrary
perpendicular magnetic field (a system of two interacting electrons in a
two-dimensional parabolic confinement potential) is introduced. A key
ingredient of this trial wave function is a Jastrow pair correlation factor
that has a displaced Gaussian form. The above choice of the pair correlation
factor is instrumental on assuring the overall quality of the wave function at
all values of the magnetic field.Exact numerical diagonalization results are
used to gauge the quality of the proposed trial wave function.We find out that
this trial wave function is an excellent representation of the true ground
state at all values of the magnetic field including weak (or zero) and strong
magnetic fields.
