We show that ionization and dissociation can be influenced separately in a
molecule with appropriate external noise. Specifically we investigate the
hydrogen molecular ion under a stochastic force quantum mechanically beyond the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that up to 30% of dissociation without
ionization can be achieved by suitably tuning the forcing parameters.
