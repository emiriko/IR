The immunity of microwave-induced magneto-resistance oscillations and
corresponding zero resistance regions to the direction of (circular)
polarization of microwave is studied in this paper. We propose that a
spontaneous circular motion of the whole electron fluid would stabilize the
system and minimize the polarization sensitivity of the oscillatory DC
resistance. Results of a self-consistent calculation capture the qualitative
features of the experimental observation.
