Certain exact relations among transverse momentum dependent parton
distribution functions due to QCD equations of motion turn into approximate
ones upon the neglect of pure twist-3 terms. On the basis of available data
from HERMES we test the practical usefulness of one such
``Wandzura-Wilczek-type approximation'', namely of that connecting
h_{1L}^{\perp(1)a}(x) to h_L^a(x), and discuss how it can be further tested by
future CLAS and COMPASS data.
