On the basis of the competing cubic-quintic nonlinearity model, stability
(instability) of continuous waves in nonlocal random non-Kerr nonlinear media
is studied analytically and numerically. Fluctuating media parameters are
modeled by the Gaussian white noise. It is shown that for different response
functions of a medium nonlocality suppresses, as a rule, both the growth rate
peak and bandwidth of instability caused by random parameters. At the same
time, for a special form of the response functions there can be an
''anomalous'' subjection of nonlocality to the instability development which
leads to further increase of the growth rate. Along with the second-order
moments of the modulational amplitude, higher-order moments are taken into
account.
