Aiming at the link between confinement and chiral symmetry the Polyakov loop
represented as a spectral sum of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator was subject
of recent studies. We analyze the volume dependence as well as the continuum
behavior of this quantity for quenched QCD using staggered fermions.
Furthermore, we present first results using dynamical configurations.
