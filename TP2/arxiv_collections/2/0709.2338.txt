Basic properties of symplectic reflection algebras over an algebraically
closed field k of positive characteristic are laid out. These algebras are
always finite modules over their centres, in contrast to the situation in
characteristic 0. For the subclass of rational Cherednik algebras, we determine
the PI-degree and the Goldie rank, and show that the Azumaya and smooth loci of
the centre coincide.
