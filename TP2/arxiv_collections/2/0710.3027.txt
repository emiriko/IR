We determine the capacity of compound classical-quantum channels. As a
consequence we obtain the capacity formula for the averaged classical-quantum
channels. The capacity result for compound channels demonstrates, as in the
classical setting, the existence of reliable universal classical-quantum codes
in scenarios where the only a priori information about the channel used for the
transmission of information is that it belongs to a given set of memoryless
classical-quantum channels. Our approach is based on the universal classical
approximation of the quantum relative entropy which in turn relies on the
universal hypothesis testing results.
