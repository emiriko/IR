It is well established that neutrinos have mass, yet it is very difficult to
measure those masses directly. Within the standard model of particle physics,
neutrinos will have an intrinsic magnetic moment proportional to their mass. We
examine the possibility of detecting the magnetic moment using a conducting
loop. According to Faraday's Law of Induction, a magnetic dipole passing
through a conducting loop induces an electromotive force, or EMF, in the loop.
We compute this EMF for neutrinos in several cases, based on a fully covariant
formulation of the problem. We discuss prospects for a real experiment, as well
as the possibility to test the relativistic formulation of intrinsic magnetic
moments.
