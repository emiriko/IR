A track finding algorithm has been developed for reconstruction of e+e-
pairs. It combines the information of the electromagnetic calorimeter with the
information provided by the Tracker. Results on reconstruction efficiency of
converted photons, as well as on fake rate are shown for single isolated
photons and for photons from H->gamma gamma events with pile-up events at 10^33
cm^-2 s^-1 LHC luminosity.
