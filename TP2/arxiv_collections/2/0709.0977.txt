Resonant magnetic x-ray diffraction experiments on the Shastry-Sutherland
lattice TbB$_4$ were carried out under strong pulsed magnetic fields up to 30
T. TbB$_4$ exhibits a multi-step magnetization process above 16 T when magnetic
fields are applied along the c-axis. We examined the intensity of the 010
magnetic reflection as a function of magnetic field and found that the
magnetization plateau phases are accompanied by large XY components of magnetic
moments, in contrast to normal fractional magnetization plateau phases. The
magnetization was calculated using a simple spin model deduced from the above
result. Finally we propose that frustration is the key to understanding the
observed multi-step magnetization.
