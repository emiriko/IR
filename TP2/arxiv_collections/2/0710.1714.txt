The extra dimensional defects that are introduced to generate the lattice
chiral zero modes are not simply a computational trick, but have interesting
physical consequences. After reviewing what is known about the layered phase
they can generate, I argue how it is possible to simulate Yang-Mills theories
with reduced systematic errors and speculate on how it might be possible to
study the fluctuations of the layers' topological charge.
