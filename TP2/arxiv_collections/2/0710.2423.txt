Some of the centrality experiments indicate regime change and saturation in
the behaviour of characteristics of the secondary particles produced in
relativistic nuclear interactions. We discuss that the responsible mechanism to
explain the phenomena could be the percolation cluster formation and we expect
appearance of deconfinement in the cluster.
