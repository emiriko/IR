Studying the extent to which realism is compatible with quantum mechanics
teaches us something about the quantum mechanical universe, regardless of the
validity of such realistic assumptions. It has also recently been appreciated
that these kinds of studies are fruitful for questions relating to quantum
information and computation. Motivated by this, we extend the ontological model
formalism for realistic theories to describe a set of theories emphasizing the
role of measurement and preparation devices by introducing `hidden variables'
to describe them. We illustrate both the ontological model formalism and our
generalization of it through a series of example models taken from the
literature. Our extension of the formalism allows us to quantitatively analyze
the meaning contextuality (a constraint on successful realistic theories),
finding that - taken at face-value - it can be realized as a natural
interaction between the configurations of a system and measurement device.
However, we also describe a property that we call deficiency, which follows
from contextuality, but does not admit such a natural interpretation. Loosely
speaking, deficiency breaks a symmetry between preparations and measurements in
quantum mechanics. It is the property that the set of ontic states which a
system prepared in quantum state psi may actually be in, is strictly smaller
than the set of ontic states which would reveal the measurement outcome psi
with certainty.
