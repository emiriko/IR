In the present article, we discuss one of the basic relations of Quantum
Mechanics - the Uncertainty Relation (UR). In 1930, few years after Heisenberg,
Erwin Schrodinger generalized the famous Uncertainty Relation in Quantum
Mechanics, making it more precise than the original. The present study
discusses recent generalizations of Schrodinger's work and explains why his
paper remains almost forgotten in the last century.
