High quality vanadium sesquioxide V2O3 films (170-1100 {\AA}) were grown
using the pulsed laser deposition technique on (0001)-oriented sapphire
substrates, and the effects of film thickness on the lattice strain and
electronic properties were examined. X-ray diffraction indicates that there is
an in-plane compressive lattice parameter (a), close to -3.5% with respect to
the substrate and an out-of-plane tensile lattice parameter (c) . The thin film
samples display metallic character between 2-300 K, and no metal-to-insulator
transition is observed. At low temperature, the V2O3 films behave as a strongly
correlated metal, and the resistivity (\rho) follows the equation \rho =\rho_0
+ A T^2, where A is the transport coefficient in a Fermi liquid. Typical values
of A have been calculated to be 0.14 \mu\Omega cm K^{-2}, which is in agreement
with the coefficient reported for V2O3 single crystals under high pressure.
Moreover, a strong temperature-dependence of the Hall resistance confirms the
electronic correlations of these V2O3 thin films samples.
