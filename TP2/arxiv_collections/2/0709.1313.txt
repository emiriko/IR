We study how the entanglement of an entangled pair of particles is affected
when one or both of the pair is uniformly accelerated, while the detector
remains in an inertial frame. We find that the entanglement is unchanged if all
degrees of freedom are considered. However, particle pairs are produced when a
relativistic particle is accelerated, and more bipartite systems emerge, the
entanglements of some of which may change as the acceleration. In particular,
the entanglement of a pair of accelerating fermions is transferred
preferentially to the produced antiparticles when the acceleration is large,
and the entanglement transfer is complete when the acceleration approaches
infinity. However, no such entanglement transfer to the antiparticles is
observed for scalar particles.
