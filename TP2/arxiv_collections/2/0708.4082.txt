The observation that novice users seldom consult online help was made over
twenty years ago. This observation still holds nowadays, although online help
to the use of software for the general public has greatly improved in usability
during this period. The paper first demonstrates the necessity of online help
to the use of new software whatever the transparency of the user interface, as
whether online help systems are meant to compensate for interface design
weaknesses or actually do provide necessary assistance to the discovery of a
new software package functionalities is still an unsolved issue. The discussion
relies on results of empirical and experimental studies and theoretical
arguments. In the second part, we analyse the specific difficulties raised by
the design of effective online help systems for current software intended for
the general public so as to try and understand the reluctance of novice users
to use online help. In the last part, we present and discuss the possible
contributions of various approaches to solving this issue. Recent interaction
paradigms and techniques are considered, such as, static and dynamic
personalisation, contextual online help and new forms of multimodality.
