We develop a nonperturbative approach to the quantum Hall bilayer (QHB) at
\nu=1 using trial wave functions. We predict phases of the QHB for arbitrary
distance d and, our approach, in a dual picture, naturally introduces a new
kind of quasiparticles - neutral fermions. Neutral fermion is a composite of
two merons of the same vorticity and opposite charge. For small d (i.e. in the
superfluid phase), neutral fermions appear as dipoles. At larger d dipoles
dissociate into the phase of the two decoupled Fermi-liquid-like states. This
scenario is relevant for the experimental situation where impurities lock
charged merons. In a translation invariant (clean) system, continuous creation
and annihilation of meron-antimeron pairs evolves the QHB toward a paired
phase. The quantum fluctuations fix the form of the pairing function to
g(z)=1/z^*. A part of the description of the paired phase is the 2D
superconductor i.e. BF Chern-Simons theory. The paired phase is not very
distinct from the superfluid phase.
