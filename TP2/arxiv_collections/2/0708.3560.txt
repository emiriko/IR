The amplitude for production of a single photon associated with quark pair in
the fusion of two off-shell gluons is calculated. The matrix element found is
applied to the inclusive prompt photon hadroproduction at high energies in the
framework of kt-factorization QCD approach. The total and differential cross
sections are calculated in both central and forward pseudo-rapidity regions.
The conservative error analisys is performed. We used the unintegrated gluon
distributions in a proton which were obtained from the full CCFM evolution
equation as well as from the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. Theoretical
results were compared with recent experimental data taken by the D0 and CDF
collaborations at Fermilab Tevatron. Theoretical predictions for the LHC
energies are given.
