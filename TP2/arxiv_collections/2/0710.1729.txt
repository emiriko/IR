We apply the potential force estimation method to artificial time series of
market price produced by a deterministic dealer model. We find that dealers'
feedback of linear prediction of market price based on the latest mean price
changes plays the central role in the market's potential force. When markets
are dominated by dealers with positive feedback the resulting potential force
is repulsive, while the effect of negative feedback enhances the attractive
potential force.
