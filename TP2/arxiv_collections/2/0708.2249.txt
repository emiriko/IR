We present the first calculation of the transverse spin structure of the pion
in lattice QCD. Our simulations are based on two flavors of non-perturbatively
improved Wilson fermions, with pion masses as low as 400 MeV in volumes up to
(2.1 fm)^3 and lattice spacings below 0.1 fm. We find a characteristic
asymmetry in the spatial distribution of transversely polarized quarks. This
asymmetry is very similar in magnitude to the analogous asymmetry we previously
obtained for quarks in the nucleon. Our results support the hypothesis that all
Boer-Mulders functions are alike.
