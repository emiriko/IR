We analyse the decay $\tau\to\pi\pi\pi\nu$ based on the recently developed
techniques to generate axial-vector resonances dynamically. Under the
assumption that the a1 is a coupled-channel meson-molecule, the spectral
function is described surprisingly well by adjusting only one free parameter.
Including, in addition, an elementary a1 corrupts the results.
