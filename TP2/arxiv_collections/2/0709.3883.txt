We study non-linear rheology of a simple theoretical model developed to mimic
layered systems such as lamellar structures under shear. In the present work we
study a 2-dimensional version of the model which exhibits a Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition in equilibrium at a critical temperature Tc. While the system
behaves as Newtonain fluid at high temperatures T > Tc, it exhibits shear
thinning at low temperatures T < Tc. The non-linear rheology in the present
model is understood as due to motions of edge dislocations and resembles the
non-linear transport phenomena in superconductors by vortex motions.
