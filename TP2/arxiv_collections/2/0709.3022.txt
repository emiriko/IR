This paper outlines the issues related to RF MEMS packaging and low actuation
voltage. An original approach is presented concerning the modeling of
capacitive contacts using multiphysics simulation and advanced
characterization. A similar approach is used concerning packaging development
where multi-physics simulations are used to optimize the process. A devoted
package architecture is proposed featuring very low loss at microwave range.
