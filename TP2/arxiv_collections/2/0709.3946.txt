We discuss a possible interpretation of the Ds1(2460) meson as a hadronic
molecule - a bound state of D* and K mesons. Using a phenomenological
Lagrangian approach we determine the strong Ds1 to Ds* pi0 and radiative Ds1 to
Ds gamma decays. In order of magnitude our results for the partial strong and
radiative decay widths are consistent with previous calculations.
