The paper develops techniques in order to construct computer programs,
pseudorandom number generators (PRNG), that produce uniformly distributed
sequences. The paper exploits an approach that treats standard processor
instructions (arithmetic and bitwise logical ones) as continuous functions on
the space of 2-adic integers. Within this approach, a PRNG is considered as a
dynamical system and is studied by means of the non-Archimedean ergodic theory.
