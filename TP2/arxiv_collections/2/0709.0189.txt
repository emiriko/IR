We study both experimentally and theoretically the driven motion of domain
walls in extended amorphous magnetic films patterned with a periodic array of
asymmetric holes. We find two crossed ratchet effects of opposite sign that
change the preferred sense for domain wall propagation, depending on whether a
flat or a kinked wall is moving. By solving numerically a simple $\phi^4$-model
we show that the essential physical ingredients for this effect are quite
generic and could be realized in other experimental systems involving elastic
interfaces moving in multidimensional ratchet potentials.
