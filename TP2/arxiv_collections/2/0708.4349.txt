The method of detection of the unstable periodic spatio-temporal states of
spatial extended chaotic systems has been proposed. The application of this
method is illustrated by the consideration of two different systems: i) the
fluid model of Pierce diode being one of the fundamental system of the physics
of plasmas and microwave electronics and ii) the complex one-dimensional
Ginzburg-Landau equation demonstrating different regimes of spatio-temporal
chaos.
