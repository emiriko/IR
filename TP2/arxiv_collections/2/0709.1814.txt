Thermal measurement and modeling of multi-die packages became a hot topic
recently in different fields like RAM chip packaging or LEDs / LED assemblies,
resulting in vertical (stacked) and lateral arrangement. In our present study
we show results for a mixed arrangement: an opto-coupler device has been
investigated with 4 chips in lateral as well as vertical arrangement. In this
paper we give an overview of measurement and modeling techniques and results
for stacked and MCM structures, describe our present measurement results
together with our structure function based methodology of validating the
detailed model of the package being studied. Also, we show how to derive
junction-to-pin thermal resistances with a technique using structure functions.
