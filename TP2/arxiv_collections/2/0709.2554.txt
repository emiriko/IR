This paper is concerned with the physics of meson decays to J/psi and
phi.These decays have been observed at the Tevatron [7] and, in particular,
should be copiously observed at the LHCb detector. This paper gives a concise
presentation of the basic physics analysis and a general formalism for
analyzing the signals of CP violation.
