Visualizations that adopt a first-person point of view allow observation and,
in the case of interactive simulations, experimentation with relativistic
scenes. This paper gives examples of three types of first-person
visualizations: watching objects that move at nearly the speed of light, being
a high-speed observer looking at a static environment and having a look-around
near a compact object. I illustrate and explain the main aspects of the visual
observations, outline their use in teaching relativity and report on teaching
experiences. For teaching purposes, our visualization work is available on the
web site http://www.spacetimetravel.org and its German counterpart
http://www.tempolimit-lichtgeschwindigkeit.de . This paper assumes some basic
knowledge about relativity on the part of the reader. It addresses instructors
of physics at the undergraduate and advanced secondary school level as well as
their students.
