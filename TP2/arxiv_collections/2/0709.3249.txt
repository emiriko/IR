We discuss the inclusive production of jets in the central region of rapidity
in the context of k_T-factorization at next-to-leading order (NLO).
Calculations are performed in the Regge limit making use of the NLO BFKL
results. We introduce a jet cone definition and carry out a proper phase--space
separation into multi-Regge and quasi-multi-Regge kinematic regions. We discuss
two situations: scattering of highly virtual photons, which requires a
symmetric energy scale to separate impact factors from the gluon Green's
function, and hadron-hadron collisions, where a non-symmetric scale choice is
needed.
