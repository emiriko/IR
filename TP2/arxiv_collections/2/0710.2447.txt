We investigate theoretically the light reflectance of a graphene layer
prepared on the top of one-dimensional Si/SiO2 photonic crystal (1DPC). It is
shown that the visibility of the graphene layers is enhanced greatly when 1DPC
is added, and the visibility can be tuned by changing the incident angle and
light wavelengths. This phenomenon is caused by the absorption of the graphene
layer and the enhanced reflectance of the 1DPC.
