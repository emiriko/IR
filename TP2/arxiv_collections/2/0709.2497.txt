The model of Zhao and Suo can be readily generalized to predict the critical
breakdown electric field $E_c$ value of elastomers with arbitrary elastic
strain energy function. An explicit expression for $E_c$ is presented for
elastomeric thin films under biaxial strain and comparisons are made with
experimental data using a two term Ogden rubber elasticity model. Simplified
results for uniaxial and for equi-biaxial stress provide further insight into
the findings of Zhao and Suo.
