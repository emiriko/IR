Recent experiments on He3 bilayers adsorbed on Graphite have shown striking
quantum critical properties at the point where the first layer localizes. We
model this system with the Anderson lattice plus inter-layer Coulomb repulsion
in two dimensions. Assuming that quantum critical fluctuations come from a
vanishing of the effective hybridization, we can reproduce several features of
the system, including the apparent occurrence of two quantum critical points
(QCP), the variation of the effective mass and coherence temperature with
coverage.
