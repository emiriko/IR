Techniques for data-mining, latent semantic analysis, contextual search of
databases, etc. have long ago been developed by computer scientists working on
information retrieval (IR). Experimental scientists, from all disciplines,
having to analyse large collections of raw experimental data (astronomical,
physical, biological, etc.) have developed powerful methods for their
statistical analysis and for clustering, categorising, and classifying objects.
Finally, physicists have developed a theory of quantum measurement, unifying
the logical, algebraic, and probabilistic aspects of queries into a single
formalism. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first to show that when
formulated at an abstract level, problems from IR, from statistical data
analysis, and from physical measurement theories are very similar and hence can
profitably be cross-fertilised, and, secondly, to propose a novel method of
fuzzy hierarchical clustering, termed \textit{semantic distillation} --
strongly inspired from the theory of quantum measurement --, we developed to
analyse raw data coming from various types of experiments on DNA arrays. We
illustrate the method by analysing DNA arrays experiments and clustering the
genes of the array according to their specificity.
