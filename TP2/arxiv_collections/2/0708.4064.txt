The ball lightning phenomenon is explained in the frame of a
self-organization scenario suggested by experiments performed on the
spontaneously generated complex spherical space charge configuration in plasma.
Originated in a hot plasma, suddenly created in a point where a lightning flash
strikes the Earth surface, the ball lightning appearance proves the ability of
nature to generate, by self-organization, complex structures able to ensure
their own existence by exchange of matter and energy with the surroundings.
Their subsequent evolution depends on the environment where they are born.
Under contemporary Earth conditions the lifetime of such complexities is
relatively short. A similar self-organization mechanism, produced by simple
sparks in the earl Earth's atmosphere (chemically reactive plasma) is suggested
to explain the genesis of complexities able to evolve into prebiotic
structures.
