We review recent work on the Hawking radiation of rotating brane black holes,
as may be produced at the LHC. We outline the methodology for calculating the
fluxes of particles, energy and angular momentum by spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1
quantum fields on the brane. We briefly review some of the key features of the
emission, in particular the changes in the spectra as the number of extra
dimensions or the angular velocity of the black hole increases. These
quantities will be useful for accurate simulations of black hole events at the
LHC.
