A polynomial-time algorithm for computing the permanent in any field of
characteristic 3 is presented in this article. The principal objects utilized
for that purpose are the Cauchy and Vandermonde matrices, the discriminant
function and their generalizations of various types. Classical theorems on the
permanent such as the Binet-Minc identity and Borchadt's formula are widely
applied, while a special new technique involving the notion of limit re-defined
for fields of finite characteristics and corresponding computational methods
was developed in order to deal with a number of polynomial-time reductions. All
the constructions preserve a strictly algebraic nature ignoring the structure
of the basic field, while applying its infinite extensions for calculating
limits.
  A natural corollary of the polynomial-time computability of the permanent in
a field of a characteristic different from 2 is the non-uniform equality
between the complexity classes P and NP what is equivalent to RP=NP (Ref. [1]).
