The frequency-moment expansion method is developed to analyze the validity of
the Luttinger sum rule within the Mott-Hubbard insulator, as represented by the
generalized Hubbard model at half filling and large $U$. For the particular
case of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping on a triangular lattice
lacking the particle-hole symmetry results reveal substantial violation of the
sum rule.
