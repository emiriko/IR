We propose the enhancement of $\Lambda_{c}$ as a novel QGP signal in heavy
ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Assuming a stable bound diquark state in the
strongly coupled QGP near the critical temperature, we argue that the direct
two-body collision between a $c$ quark and a $[ud]$ diquark would lead to an
enhanced $\Lambda_{c}$ production in comparison with the normal three-body
collision among independent $c$, $u$ and $d$ quarks. In the coalescence model,
we find that the $\Lambda_{c}/D$ yield ratio is enhanced substantially due to
the diquark correlation.
