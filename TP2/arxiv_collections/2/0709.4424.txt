The phase diagrams of low density Fermi-Fermi mixtures with equal or unequal
masses and equal or unequal populations are described at zero and finite
temperatures in the strong attraction limit. In this limit, the Fermi-Fermi
mixture can be described by a weakly interacting Bose-Fermi mixture, where the
bosons correspond to Feshbach molecules and the fermions correspond to excess
atoms. First, we discuss the three and four fermion scattering processes, and
use the exact boson-fermion and boson-boson scattering lengths to generate the
phase diagrams in terms of the underlying fermion-fermion scattering length. In
three dimensions, in addition to the normal and uniform superfluid phases, we
find two stable non-uniform states corresponding to (1) phase separation
between pure unpaired (excess) and pure paired fermions (molecular bosons); and
(2) phase separation between pure excess fermions and a mixture of excess
fermions and molecular bosons. Lastly, we also discuss the effects of the
trapping potential in the density profiles of condensed and non-condensed
molecular bosons, and excess fermions at zero and finite temperatures, and
discuss possible implications of our findings to experiments involving mixtures
of ultracold fermions.
