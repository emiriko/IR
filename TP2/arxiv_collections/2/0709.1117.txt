We formulate a theory on the dynamics of conduction electrons in the presence
of moving magnetic textures in ferromagnetic materials. We show that the
variation of local magnetization in both space and time gives rise to
topological fields, which induce electromotive forces on the electrons.
Universal results are obtained for the emf induced by both transverse and
vortex domain walls traveling in a magnetic film strip, and their measurement
may provide clear characterization on the motion of such walls.
