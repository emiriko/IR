We describe a recent multiscale approach based on the concurrent coupling of
constrained molecular dynamics for long biomolecules with a mesoscopic lattice
Boltzmann treatment of solvent hydrodynamics. The multiscale approach is based
on a simple scheme of exchange of space-time information between the atomistic
and mesoscopic scales and is capable of describing self-consistent hydrodynamic
effects on molecular motion at a computational cost which scales linearly with
both solute size and solvent volume. For an application of our multiscale
method, we consider the much studied problem of biopolymer translocation
through nanopores: we find that the method reproduces with remarkable accuracy
the statistical scaling behavior of the translocation process and provides
valuable insight into the cooperative aspects of biopolymer and hydrodynamic
motion.
