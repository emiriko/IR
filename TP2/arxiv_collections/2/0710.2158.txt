The physical representation of the general double-Reissner-Nordstrom solution
is obtained by rewriting the N=2 Breton-Manko-Aguilar electrostatic solution in
the Varzugin-Chistyakov parametrization (M_i, Q_i, R). A concise analytical
formula is derived for the interaction force between two arbitrary
Reissner-Nordstrom constituents, and an example of the equilibrium
configuration involving two oppositely charged particles which confirms earlier
Bonnor's prediction of the existence of such configurations is given.
