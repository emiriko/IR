We introduce a new quantum protocol for solving detectable Byzantine
agreement (also called detectable broadcast) between three parties, and also
for solving the detectable liar detection problem. The protocol is suggested by
the properties of a four-qubit entangled state, and the classical part of the
protocol is simpler than that of previous proposals. In addition, we present an
experimental implementation of the protocol using four-photon entanglement.
