Electroproduction of light vector mesons is analyzed on the basis of handbag
factorization. The required generalized parton distributions are constructed
from the CTEQ6 parton distributions with the help of double distributions. The
partonic subprocesses are calculated within the modified perturbative approach.
The present work extends our previous analysis of the longitudinal cross
section to the transverse one and other observables related to both the
corresponding amplitudes. Our results are compared to recent experimental
findings in detail.
