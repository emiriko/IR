We study relaxation dynamics of a three dimensional elastic manifold in
random potential from a uniform initial condition by numerically solving the
Langevin equation.We observe growth of roughness of the system up to larger
wavelengths with time.We analyze structure factor in detail and find a compact
scaling ansatz describing two distinct time regimes and crossover between them.
We find short time regime corresponding to length scale smaller than the Larkin
length $L_c$ is well described by the Larkin model which predicts a power law
growth of domain size $L(t)$. Longer time behavior exhibits the random manifold
regime with slower growth of $L(t)$.
