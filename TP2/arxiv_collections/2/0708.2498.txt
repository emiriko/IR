There is a growing consensus that physics majors need to learn computational
skills, but many departments are still devoid of computation in their physics
curriculum. Some departments may lack the resources or commitment to create a
dedicated course or program in computational physics. One way around this
difficulty is to include computation in a standard upper-level physics course.
An intermediate classical mechanics course is particularly well suited for
including computation. We discuss the ways we have used computation in our
classical mechanics courses, focusing on how computational work can improve
students' understanding of physics as well as their computational skills. We
present examples of computational problems that serve these two purposes. In
addition, we provide information about resources for instructors who would like
to include computation in their courses.
