We infer that soft-x-ray absorption spectroscopy is a versatile method for
the determination of the crystal-field ground state symmetry of rare earth
Heavy Fermion systems, complementing neutron scattering. Using realistic and
universal parameters, we provide a theoretical mapping between the polarization
dependence of Ce $M_{4,5}$ spectra and the charge distribution of the Ce $4f$
states. The experimental resolution can be orders of magnitude larger than the
$4f$ crystal field splitting itself. To demonstrate the experimental
feasibility of the method, we investigated CePd$_2$Si$_2$, thereby settling an
existing disagreement about its crystal-field ground state.
