We study the Josephson-like interlayer tunneling signature of the strongly
correlated $\nu_T = 1$ quantum Hall phase in bilayer two-dimensional electron
systems as a function of the layer separation, temperature and interlayer
charge imbalance. Our results offer strong evidence that a finite temperature
phase transition separates the interlayer coherent phase from incoherent phases
which lack strong interlayer correlations. The transition temperature is
dependent on both the layer spacing and charge imbalance between the layers.
