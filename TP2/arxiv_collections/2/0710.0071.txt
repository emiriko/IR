We give a classification into conjugacy classes of subalgebras of the
symmetry algebra generated by the Zabolotskaya-Khokhlov equation, and obtain
all similarity reductions of this equation into $(1+1)$-dimensional equations.
We thus show that Lie classical reduction approach may also give rise to more
general reduced equations as those expected from the direct method of Clarkson
and Kruskal. By transforming the determining system for the similarity
variables into the equivalent adjoint system of total differential equations,
similarity reductions to {\sc ode}s which are independent of the three
arbitrary functions defining the symmetries are also obtained. These results
are again compared with those obtained by the direct method of Clarkson and
Kruskal, by finding in particular equivalence transformations mapping some of
the reduced equations to each other. Various families of new exact solutions
are also derived.
