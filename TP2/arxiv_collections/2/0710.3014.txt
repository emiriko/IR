We explore `benchmark planes' in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM) that are in agreement with the measured cold dark matter (CDM) density,
electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and B physics observables (BPO). The
M_A-tan_beta planes are specified assuming that gaugino masses m_{1/2}, soft
trilinear supersymmetry-breaking parameters A_0 and the soft
supersymmetry-breaking contributions m_0 to the squark and slepton masses are
universal, but not those associated with the Higgs multiplets (the NUHM
framework). We discuss the prospects for probing experimentally these benchmark
surfaces at the Tevatron collider, the LHC and the ILC.
