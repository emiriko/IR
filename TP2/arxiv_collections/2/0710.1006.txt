We study the thermophysical properties of warm dense hydrogen using quantum
molecular dynamics simulations. New results are presented for the pair
distribution functions, the equation of state, the Hugoniot curve, and the
reflectivity. We compare with available experimental data and predictions of
the chemical picture. Especially, we discuss the nonmetal-to-metal transition
which occurs at about 40 GPa in the dense fluid.
