Empirical analysis of the foreign exchange market is conducted based on
methods to quantify similarities among multi-dimensional time series with
spectral distances introduced in [A.-H. Sato, Physica A, 382 (2007) 258--270].
As a result it is found that the similarities among currency pairs fluctuate
with the rotation of the earth, and that the similarities among best quotation
rates are associated with those among quotation frequencies. Furthermore it is
shown that the Jensen-Shannon spectral divergence is proportional to a mean of
the Kullback-Leibler spectral distance both empirically and numerically. It is
confirmed that these spectral distances are connected with distributions for
behavioral parameters of the market participants from numerical simulation.
This concludes that spectral distances of representative quantities of
financial markets are related into diversification of behavioral parameters of
the market participants.
