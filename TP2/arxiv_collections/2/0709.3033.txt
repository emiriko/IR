We compare the charges transported in two systems, a spatially periodic and
an open quantum pump, both depending periodically and adiabatically on time.
The charge transported in a cycle was computed by Thouless, respectively by
Buttiker et al. in the two cases. We show that the results agree in the limit
where the two physical situations become the same, i.e., that of a large open
pump.
