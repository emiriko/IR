We investigate the behavior of a weakly interacting nearly one-dimensional
(1D) trapped Bose gas at finite temperature. We perform in situ measurements of
spatial density profiles and show that they are very well described by a model
based on exact solutions obtained using the Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism,
in a regime where other, approximate theoretical approaches fail. We use
  Bose-gas focusing [Shvarchuck etal., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 270404 (2002)] to
probe the axial momentum distribution of the gas, and find good agreement with
the in situ results.
