This paper investigates the Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (hereafter ADM) form of
spherically symmetric gravity with variable Newton parameter G and cosmological
term Lambda(c). The Newton parameter is here treated as a dynamical variable,
rather than being merely an external parameter as in previous work on closely
related topics. The resulting Hamilton equations are obtained; interestingly, a
static solution exists, that reduces to Schwarzschild geometry in the limit of
constant G, describing a Newton parameter ruled by a nonlinear differential
equation in the radial variable r. A remarkable limiting case is the one for
which the Newton parameter obeys an almost linear growth law at large r. An
exact solution for G as a function of r is also obtained in the case of
vanishing cosmological constant. Some observational implications of these
solutions are obtained and briefly discussed.
