The gauge theory approach to the geometric Langlands program is extended to
the case of wild ramification. The new ingredients that are required, relative
to the tamely ramified case, are differential operators with irregular
singularities, Stokes phenomena, isomonodromic deformation, and, from a
physical point of view, new surface operators associated with higher order
singularities.
