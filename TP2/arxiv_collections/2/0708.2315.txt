In this note we present a more detailed and explicit exposition of the
definition of a conformal representation of a Leibniz algebra. Recall
(arXiv:math/0611501v3) that Leibniz algebras are exactly Lie dialgebras. The
idea is based on the general fact that every dialgebra that belongs to a
variety $\Var $ can be embedded into a conformal algebra of the same variety.
In particular, we prove that an arbitrary (finite dimensional) Leibniz algebra
has a (finite) faithful conformal representation. As a corollary, we deduce the
analogue of the PBW-theorem for Leibniz algebras.
