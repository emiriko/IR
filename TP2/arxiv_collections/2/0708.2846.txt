The approach unifying all the internal degrees of freedom--proposed by one of
us--is offering a new way of understanding families of quarks and leptons: A
part of the starting Lagrange density in d(=1+13), which includes two kinds of
spin connection fields--the gauge fields of two types of Clifford algebra
objects--transforms the right handed quarks and leptons into the left handed
ones manifesting in d=1+3 the Yukawa couplings of the Standard model. We study
the influence of the way of breaking symmetries on the Yukawa couplings and
estimate properties of the fourth family--the quark masses and the mixing
matrix, investigating the possibility that the fourth family of quarks and
leptons appears at low enough energies to be observable with the new generation
of accelerators.
