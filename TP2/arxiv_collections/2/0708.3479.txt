We measured the resistivity, diamagnetization, and low-temperature specific
heat of the newly discovered noncentrosymmetric superconductor
Mg_(12-delta)Ir_19B_16. The temperature dependence of specific heat is
consistent with the model of an isotropic s-wave gap with value Delta_0 = 0.94
meV for the sample Tc = 5.7 K, and the ratio Delta_0/k_BTc = 1.91 indicates a
slightly moderate coupling for the superconductivity. The correlations among
the normal state Sommerfeld constant gamma_n, the slope -dHc2(T)/dT near Tc,
and the condensation energy Ec are all consistent with the slightly moderate
coupling picture. Based on the data of phonon contribution, Tc and the McMillan
formula, we obtained an electron-phonon coupling strength lambda_(e-ph) = 0.66,
which suggests that the superconductivity here is induced by the
electron-phonon coupling.
