In 2002 a measurement of the effect of solar gravity upon the phase of
coherent microwave beams passing near the Sun has been carried out with the
Cassini mission, allowing a very accurate measurement of the PPN parameter
$\gamma$. The data have been analyzed with NASA's Orbit Determination Program
(ODP) in the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, in which the Sun moves
around the centre of mass of the solar system with a velocity $v_\odot$ of
about 10 m/sec; the question arises, what correction this implies for the
predicted phase shift. After a review of the way the ODP works, we set the
problem in the framework of Lorentz (and Galilean) transformations and evaluate
the correction; it is several orders of magnitude below our experimental
accuracy. We also discuss a recent paper \cite{kopeikin07}, which claims wrong
and much larger corrections, and clarify the reasons for the discrepancy.
