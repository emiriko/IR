Neutral pion transverse momentum spectra were measured in p+C and p+Pb
collisions at sqrt{s_NN} = 17.4 GeV at mid-rapidity 2.3 < eta_lab < 3.0 over
the range 0.7< p_T < 3.5 GeV/c. The spectra are compared to pi0 spectra
measured in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt{s_NN} = 17.3 GeV in the same experiment.
For a wide range of Pb+Pb centralities (N_part < 300) the yield of pi0's with
p_T > 2 GeV/c is larger than or consistent with the p+C or p+Pb yields scaled
with the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions (N_coll), while for central Pb+Pb
collisions with N_part > 350 the pi0 yield is suppressed.
