Unparticle physics from a hidden conformal sector can alter the evolution of
the Standard Model (SM) gauge couplings via TeV scale threshold corrections. We
discuss how this may lead to gauge coupling unification at M_{GUT}\approx 2
\times 10^{15} GeV -- 5 \times 10^{17} GeV without introducing new particles in
the SM sector.
