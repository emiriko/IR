We investigate the results of recently published experiments on the quantum
behavior of Josephson circuits in terms of the classical modelling based on the
resistively and capacitively-shunted (RCSJ) junction model. Our analysis shows
evidence for a close analogy between the nonlinear behavior of a pulsed
microwave-driven Josephson junction at low temperature and low dissipation and
the experimental observations reported for the Josephson circuits.
Specifically, we demonstrate that Rabi-oscillations, Ramsey-fringes, and
spin-echo observations are not phenomena with a unique quantum interpretation.
In fact, they are natural consequences of transients to phase-locking in
classical nonlinear dynamics and can be observed in a purely classical model of
a Josephson junction when the experimental recipe for the application of
microwaves is followed and the experimental detection scheme followed. We
therefore conclude that classical nonlinear dynamics can contribute to the
understanding of relevant experimental observations of Josephson response to
various microwave perturbations at very low temperature and low dissipation.
