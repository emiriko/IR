We study the persistence phenomenon in a socio-econo dynamics model using
computer simulations at a finite temperature on hypercubic lattices in
dimensions up to 5. The model includes a ` social\rq local field which contains
the magnetization at time $t$. The nearest neighbour quenched interactions are
drawn from a binary distribution which is a function of the bond concentration,
$p$. The decay of the persistence probability in the model depends on both the
spatial dimension and $p$. We find no evidence of ` blocking\rq in this model.
We also discuss the implications of our results for possible applications in
the social and economic fields. It is suggested that the absence, or otherwise,
of blocking could be used as a criterion to decide on the validity of a given
model in different scenarios.
