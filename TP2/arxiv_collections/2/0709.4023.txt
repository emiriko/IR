Local oscillations of the brane world are manifested as masssive vector
fields. Their coupling to the Standard Model can be obtained using the method
of nonlinear realizations of the spontaneously broken higher dimensional
space-time symmetries, and to an extent, are model independent.
Phenomenological limits on these vector field parameters are obtained using LEP
collider data and dark matter constraints.
