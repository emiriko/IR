We determine the rank generating function, the zeta polynomial and the
Moebius function for the poset NC^B(p,q) of annular non-crossing partitions of
type B, where p and q are two positive integers. We give an alternative
treatment of some of these results in the case q=1, for which this poset is a
lattice. We also consider the general case of multiannular non-crossing
partitions of type B, and prove that this reduces to the cases of non-crossing
partitions of type B in the annulus and in the disc.
