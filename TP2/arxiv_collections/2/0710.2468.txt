An approach towards a statistical survey of four dimensional supersymmetric
vacua in the string theory landscape is described and illustrated with three
examples of ensembles of intersecting D-brane models. The question whether it
is conceivable to make predictions based on statistical distributions is
discussed. Especially interesting in this context are possible correlations
between low energy observables. As an example we look at correlations between
properties of the gauge sector of intersecting D-brane models and Gepner model
constructions.
