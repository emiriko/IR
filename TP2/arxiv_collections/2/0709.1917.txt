The 1972 and 1973 launched Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first missions to
explore the outer solar system. They achieved stunning breakthroughs in
deep-space exploration. But around 1980 an unmodeled force of \sim 8 \times
10^{-8} cm/s^2, directed approximately towards the Sun, appeared in the
tracking data. It later was unambiguously verified as not being an artifact.
The origin remains unknown (although radiant heat remains a likely cause).
Increasing effort has gone into understanding this anomaly. We review the
situation and describe programs to resolve the issue.
