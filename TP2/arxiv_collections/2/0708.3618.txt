Conventional transport theory focuses on either the diffusive or ballistic
regimes and neglects the crossover region between the two. In the presence of
spin-orbit coupling, the transport equations are known only in the diffusive
regime, where the spin precession angle is small. In this paper, we develop a
semiclassical theory of transport valid throughout the diffusive - ballistic
crossover of a special SU(2) symmetric spin-orbit coupled system. The theory is
also valid in the physically interesting regime where the spin precession angle
is large. We obtain exact expressions for the density and spin structure
factors in both 2 and 3 dimensional samples with spin-orbit coupling.
