We investigate correlation functions of the Polyakov loop and static
meson/diquark systems with the chiral condensate and the quark number density
at finite temperature. In particular the latter observable can give insight in
the mechanism of screening and string breaking at finite temperature. We use
for our analysis gauge field configurations generated in 2+1 flavor QCD with an
improved staggered fermion action with almost physical light quark masses and a
physical value of the strange quark mass on lattices with temporal extent Nt=4
and 6.
