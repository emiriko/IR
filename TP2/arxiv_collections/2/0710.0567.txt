This talk was in response to the conference injunction to present "one bold
but half-baked idea that you have been thinking about recently.. .". After a
brief introduction to the ideas and formalism of the CSL theory of dynamical
wave function collapse, some possible cosmological effects associated with
applying it to the creation of the universe are discussed.
