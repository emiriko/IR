A general principle called "conservation of the ellipsoid of concentration"
is introduced and a generalized entropic form of order 'alpha' is optimized
under this principle. It is shown that this can produce a density which can act
as a pathway to multivariate Gaussian density. The resulting entropic pathway
contains as special cases the Boltzmann-Gibbs (Shannon) and Tsallis
(Havrda-Charvat) entropic forms.
