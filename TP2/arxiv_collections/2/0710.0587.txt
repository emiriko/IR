(Abridged) We report on a complete study of the single top-quark production
by direct supersymmetric flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) processes at
the LHC. The total cross section for pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c is computed at
the 1-loop order within the unconstrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). The present study extends the results of the supersymmetric strong
effects (SUSY-QCD), which were advanced by some of us in a previous work, and
includes the computation of the full supersymmetric electroweak corrections
(SUSY-EW). Our analysis of pp(gg)->t\bar{c}+\bar{t}c in the MSSM has been
performed in correspondence with the stringent low-energy constraints from b->s
gamma. In the most favorable scenarios, the SUSY-QCD contribution can give rise
to production rates of around 10^5 events per 100 fb^{-1} of integrated
luminosity. Furthermore, we show that there exist regions of the MSSM parameter
space where the SUSY-EW correction becomes sizeable. In the SUSY-EW favored
regions, one obtains lower, but still appreciable, event production rates that
can reach the 10^3 level for the same range of integrated luminosity. We study
also the possible reduction in the maximum event rate obtained from the full
MSSM contribution if we additionally include the constraints from
B^0_s-\bar{B}^0_s. In view of the fact that the FCNC production of heavy quark
pairs of different flavors is extremely suppressed in the SM, the detection of
a significant number of these events could lead to evidence of new physics --
of likely supersymmetric origin.
