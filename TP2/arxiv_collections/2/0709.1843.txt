We study many interacting Brownian particles under a tilted periodic
potential. We numerically measure the linear response coefficient of the
density field by applying a slowly varying potential transversal to the tilted
direction. In equilibrium cases, the linear response coefficient is related to
the intensity of density fluctuations in a universal manner, which is called a
fluctuation-response relation. We then report numerical evidence that this
relation holds even in non-equilibrium cases. This result suggests that
Einstein's formula on density fluctuations can be extended to driven diffusive
systems when the slowly varying potential is applied in a direction transversal
to the driving force.
