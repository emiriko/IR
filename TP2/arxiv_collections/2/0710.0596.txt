We define analogs of the Jucys-Murphy elements for the affine Temperley-Lieb
algebra and give their explicit expansion in terms of the basis of planar
Brauer diagrams. These Jucys-Murphy elements are a family of commuting elements
in the affine Temperley-Lieb algebra, and we compute their eigenvalues on the
generic irreducible representations. We show that they come from Jucys-Murphy
elements in the affine Hecke algebra of type A, which in turn come from the
Casimir element of the quantum group $U_h\mathfrak{gl}_n$. We also give the
explicit specializations of these results to the finite Temperley-Lieb algebra.
