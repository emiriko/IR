We discuss the azimuthal angle decorrelation of Mueller-Navelet jets at
hadron colliders and forward jets in Deep Inelastic Scattering within the BFKL
framework with a NLO kernel. We stress the need of collinear improvements to
obtain good perturbative convergence. We provide estimates of these
decorrelations for large rapidity differences at the Tevatron, LHC and HERA.
