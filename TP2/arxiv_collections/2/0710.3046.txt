In this paper we characterize foams and tetrahedral structures in a unified
way, by a simplified representation of both that conserves the system topology.
The paper presents a workflow for an automated characterization of the topology
of the void space, using a partition of the void space into polyhedral cells
connected by windows. This characterization serves as the basic input for the
Edwards entropic formalism that deals with the statistical characterization of
configurational disorder in granular aggregates and argued to work for foams.
The Edwards formalism is introduced and simplified expectation values are
calculated.
