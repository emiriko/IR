Phases of SU(N) gauge theories in which the global Z(N) symmetry breaks
spontaneously to a subgroup Z(L) can be realized by adding appropriate Wilson
line terms to the gauge action. These phases are partially confining, in the
sense that quarks are confined but bound states of L quarks are not. At
temperatures large compared to the normal deconfinement temperature, the phase
diagram, pressure, string tensions, and 't Hooft loop surface tensions can be
calculated analytically. Approximate scaling laws emerge naturally for both
string tensions and surface tensions.
