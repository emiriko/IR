In this article we show how to set up initial states in ${\cal N} =4$ SYM
theory that correspond to high energy graviton collisions, leading to black
hole formation in $AdS_5\times S^5$. For this purpose, we study states in the
gauge theory that are dual to graviton wavepackets localized at the center of
$AdS_5$, and carrying large angular momentum along the $S^5$. These states are
created by exciting only the s-wave mode of one of the complex adjoint scalars
of SYM. For a single graviton, the state is 1/2 BPS and one can show that it is
dual to a linearized 1/2 BPS geometry in the bulk. Exploiting this dictionary,
we show how to localize the particle's wavefunciton so that the dual linearized
metric has the form of a Aichelburg-Sexl shock wave. One can then put two such
shock waves into a head-on collision, which is known to produce a trapped
surface. Finally, we discuss the prospect of studying graviton scattering
directly at strong coupling in the gauge theory using a reduced model of matrix
quantum mechanics.
