A stabilization theorem for processes of opinion dynamics is presented. The
theorem is applicable to a wide class of models of continuous opinion dynamics
based on averaging (like the models of Hegselmann-Krause and
Weisbuch-Deffuant). The analysis detects self-confidence as a driving force of
stabilization.
