Nonlocal currents, in devices where two normal metal terminals are contacted
to a superconductor, are determined using the circuit theory of mesoscopic
superconductivity. We calculate the conductance associated with crossed Andreev
reflection and electron transfer between the two normal metal terminals, in
addition to the conductance from direct Andreev reflection and quasiparticle
tunneling. Dephasing and proximity effect are taken into account.
