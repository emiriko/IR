We report the destabilization of the charge ordered insulating (COI) state in
a localized region of Pr_0.63Ca_0.37MnO_3 single crystal by current injection
using a scanning tunneling microscope tip. This leads to controlled phase
separation and formation of localized metallic nanoislands in the COI matrix
which have been detected by local tunneling conductance mapping. The metallic
regions thus created persist even after reducing the injected current to lower
values. The original conductance state can be restored by injecting a current
of similar magnitude but of opposite polarity. We thus achieve reversible
nanoscale phase separation that gives rise to the possibility to "write, read,
and erase" nanosized conducting regions in an insulating matrix with high
spatial resolution.
