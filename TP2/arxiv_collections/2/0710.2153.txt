We have performed a scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy study of
potassium-doped C60 monolayers (KxC60) on Ag(001) in the regime of x ~ 1. Low
temperature annealing (640 K) leads to the formation of two well-ordered KxC60
phases that exhibit differing levels of electron charge transfer. Further
annealing (710 K) distills out the higher electron-doped phase from the lower
electron-doped phase, leaving behind a third C60 phase completely devoid of K.
Spectroscopic measurements indicate that the electron-doping level of the
higher electron-doped KC60 phase is anomalously large.
