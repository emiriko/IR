In this paper we investigate periodic FPU chains with an even number of
particles. We show that near the equilibrium point, any such chain admits a
\emph{resonant} Birkhoff normal form of order four which is \emph{completely
integrable} - an important fact which helps explain the numerical experiments
of Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam. We analyze the moment map of the integrable
approximation of an even FPU chain. Unlike in the case of odd FPU chains these
integrable systems (generically) exhibit hyperbolic dynamics. As an application
we prove that any FPU chain with Dirichlet boundary conditions admits a
Birkhoff normal form up to order four and show that a KAM theorem applies.
