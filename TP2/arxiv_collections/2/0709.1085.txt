The interpretation of experimental and numerical data describing
off-equilibrium aging dynamics crucially depends on the connection between
spontaneous and induced fluctuations. The hypothesis that linear response
fluctuations are statistically subordinated to irreversible outbursts of
energy, so-called quakes, leads to predictions for averages and fluctuations
spectra of physical observables in reasonable agreement with experimental
results [see e.g. Sibani et al., Phys. Rev. B74:224407, 2006]. Using
simulational data from a simple but representative Ising model with plaquette
interactions, direct statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis is
presented and discussed in this work.
  A strict temporal correlation between quakes and intermittent magnetization
fluctuations is demonstrated. The external magnetic field is shown to bias the
pre-existent intermittent tails of the magnetic fluctuation distribution, with
little or no effect on the Gaussian part of the latter. Its impact on energy
fluctuations is shown to be negligible.
  Linear response is thus controlled by the quakes and inherits their temporal
statistics. These findings provide a theoretical basis for analyzing
intermittent linear response data from aging system in the same way as thermal
energy fluctuations, which are far more difficult to measure.
