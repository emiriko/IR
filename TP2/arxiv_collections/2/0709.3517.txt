In this paper we study the spectral (temporal) properties of heralded single
photon wavepackets, triggered by the detection of an idler photon in the
process of parametric downconversion. The generated single photons are studied
within the framework of the chronocyclic Wigner function, from which the single
photon spectral width and temporal duration can be computed. We derive specific
conditions on the two-photon joint spectral amplitude which result in both pure
and Fourier- transform limited heralded single photons. Likewise, we present
specific source geometries which lead to the fulfilment of these conditions and
show that one of these geometries leads, for a given pump bandwidth, to the
temporally shortest possible heralded single photon wavepackets.
