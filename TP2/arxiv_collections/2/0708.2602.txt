We present a phenomenological model qualitatively explaining negative
magnetoresistance in quasi-one-dimensional superconducting channels in the
resistive state. The model is based on the assumption that fluctuations of the
order parameter (phase slips) are responsible for the finite effective
resistance of a narrow superconducting wire sufficiently close to the critical
temperature. Each fluctuation is accompanied by an instant formation of a
quasi-normal region of the order of the non-equilibrium quasiparticle
relaxation length 'pinned' to the core of the phase slip. The effective
time-averaged voltage measured in experiment is a sum of two terms. First one
is the conventional contribution linked to the rate of the fluctuations via the
Josephson relation. Second term is the Ohmic contribution of this quasi-normal
region. Depending on material properties of the wire, there might be a range of
magnetic fields where the first term is not much affected, while the second
term is effectively suppressed contributing to the experimentally observed
negative magnetoresistance.
