High resolution satellite image sequences are multidimensional signals
composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various
phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu,
2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph
representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this
paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics
associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.
It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.
Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal
processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.
Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between
graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to
spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental
definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern
examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,
probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This
enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph
patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior
probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar
spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image
sequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence
illustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.
