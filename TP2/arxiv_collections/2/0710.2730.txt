We report on the status of the dynamical overlap QCD simulation project by
the JLQCD collaboration. After completing two-flavor QCD simulation on a
16^3x32 lattice at lattice spacing a 0.12 fm, we started a series of runs with
2+1 flavors. In this report, we describe an outline of our algorithms,
parameter choices, and some early physics results of this second phase of our
project.
