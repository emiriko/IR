While developing a liquid argon detector for dark matter searches we
investigate the influence of air contamination on the VUV scintillation yield
in gaseous argon at atmospheric pressure. We determine with a radioactive
alpha-source the photon yield for various partial air pressures and different
reflectors and wavelength shifters. We find for the fast scintillation
component a time constant tau1= 11.3 +- 2.8 ns, independent of gas purity.
However, the decay time of the slow component depends on gas purity and is a
good indicator for the total VUV light yield. This dependence is attributed to
impurities destroying the long-lived argon excimer states. The population ratio
between the slowly and the fast decaying excimer states is determined for
alpha-particles to be 5.5 +-0.6 in argon gas at 1100 mbar and room temperature.
The measured mean life of the slow component is tau2 = 3.140 +- 0.067 microsec
at a partial air pressure of 2 x 10-6 mbar.
