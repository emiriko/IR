The knot model is extended by assuming that the trefoils are realized as
either chiral fermions or as scalar bosons. There are then four scalar trefoils
with electric charges (0, -1,2/3,-1/3) that may be classified in the same way
as the chiral fermions: as two isotopic doublets where the two doublets have
different hypercharge and the two members of the doublets have different t_3.
Only the neutral scalar plays the role of the standard Higgs in fixing the mass
ratios of the vector bosons, wile the charged scalars, in addition to having
the usual electromagnetic interactions of scalar particles, fix the mass
spectrum of the fermions. The extended model would suggest a search for the
charged scalars.
