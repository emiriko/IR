Parity games are combinatorial representations of closed Boolean mu-terms. By
adding to them draw positions, they have been organized by Arnold and one of
the authors into a mu-calculus. As done by Berwanger et al. for the
propositional modal mu-calculus, it is possible to classify parity games into
levels of a hierarchy according to the number of fixed-point variables. We ask
whether this hierarchy collapses w.r.t. the standard interpretation of the
games mu-calculus into the class of all complete lattices. We answer this
question negatively by providing, for each n >= 1, a parity game Gn with these
properties: it unravels to a mu-term built up with n fixed-point variables, it
is semantically equivalent to no game with strictly less than n-2 fixed-point
variables.
