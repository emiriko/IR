In this work we present measurements of vegetation cover over parabolic dunes
with different degree of activation along the north-eastern Brazilian coast. We
are able to extend the local values of the vegetation cover density to the
whole dune by correlating measurements with the gray-scale levels of a high
resolution satellite image of the dune field. The empirical vegetation
distribution is finally used to validate the results of a recent continuous
model of dune motion coupling sand erosion and vegetation growth.
