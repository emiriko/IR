Possible signatures of a super-Tonks-Girardeau gas in bosonic systems of
trapped quasi-one-dimensional dipoles are discussed at zero temperature. We
provide estimation of the frequency of the lowest compressional mode and
compare it to analytical results derived using harmonic approach in the high
density regime. We construct an exact mapping of the ground-state wave function
of one-dimensional dipolar system of bosons, fermions and Bose-Fermi mixture
and conclude that local properties and energy are the same at zero temperature.
A question of to which extent the dipolar potential can be treated long- or
short- range is discussed.
