An experimental study of current fluctuations through a tunable transmission
barrier, a quantum point contact, are reported. We measure the probability
distribution function of transmitted charge with precision sufficient to
extract the first three cumulants. To obtain the intrinsic quantities,
corresponding to voltage-biased barrier, we employ a procedure that accounts
for the response of the external circuit and the amplifier. The third cumulant,
obtained with a high precision, is found to agree with the prediction for the
statistics of transport in the non-Poissonian regime.
