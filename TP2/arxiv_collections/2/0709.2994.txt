Recently Osland and Vereshagin noticed, based on sample calculations of some
box diagrams, that in unpolarised e+e- collisions CP-odd effects in the
non-diagonal chargino-pair production process are generated at one-loop. Here
we perform a full one-loop analysis of these effects and point out that in some
cases the neglected vertex and self-energy contributions may play a dominant
role. We also show that CP asymmetries in chargino production are sensitive not
only to the phase of mu parameter in the chargino sector but also to the phase
of stop trilinear coupling A_t.
