Galliumnitride has become a strategic superior material for space, defense
and civil applications, primarily for power amplification at RF and mm-wave
frequencies. For AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMT), an
outstanding performance combined together with low cost and high flexibility
can be obtained using a System-in-a-Package (SIP) approach. Since thermal
management is extremely important for these high power applications, a hybrid
integration of the HEMT onto an AlN carrier substrate is proposed. In this
study we investigate the temperature performance for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs integrated
onto AlN using flip-chip mounting. Therefore, we use thermal simulations in
combination with experimental results using micro-Raman spectroscopy and
electrical dc-analysis.
