We report the distribution of a cryptographic key, secure from photon number
splitting attacks, over 35 km of optical fiber using single photons from an
InAs quantum dot emitting ~1.3 microns in a pillar microcavity. Using below
GaAs-bandgap optical excitation, we demonstrate suppression of multiphoton
emission to 10% of the Poissonian level without detector dark count
subtraction. The source is incorporated into a phase encoded interferometric
scheme implementing the BB84 protocol for key distribution over standard
telecommunication optical fiber. We show a transmission distance advantage over
that possible with (length-optimized) uniform intensity weak coherent pulses at
1310 nm in the same system.
