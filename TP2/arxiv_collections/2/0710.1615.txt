In measurement-based quantum computation, quantum algorithms are implemented
via sequences of measurements. We describe a translationally invariant
finite-range interaction on a one-dimensional qudit chain and prove that a
single-shot measurement of the energy of an appropriate computational basis
state with respect to this Hamiltonian provides the output of any quantum
circuit. The required measurement accuracy scales inverse polynomially with the
size of the simulated quantum circuit. This shows that the implementation of
energy measurements on generic qudit chains is as hard as the realization of
quantum computation. Here a ''measurement'' is any procedure that samples from
the spectral measure induced by the observable and the state under
consideration. As opposed to measurement-based quantum computation, the
post-measurement state is irrelevant.
