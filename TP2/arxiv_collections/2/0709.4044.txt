We compute the O(alpha_s) QCD corrections to the partonic process gg ->
t-tbar-Z at the LHC. This partonic channel is the dominant component of the
scattering process pp -> t-tbar-Z, which will be important for measuring the
t-tbar-Z electroweak couplings. The O(alpha_s) corrections increase the total
cross section by up to 75% for reasonable choices of the renormalization and
factorization scales. Inclusion of these contributions descreases the residual
scale dependence of the cross section coming from uncalculated higher order
terms to +-5%.
