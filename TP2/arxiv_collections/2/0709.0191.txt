AT HERA heavy quarks may contribute up to 30% of the structure function
$F_2$. The introduction of heavy quarks requires an extension of the DGLAP
formalism. The effect of using different heavy flavour number schemes, and
different approaches to the running of $\alpha_s$, are compared using the ZEUS
PDF fit formalism. The potential of including charm data in the fit is
explored, using $D^*$ double differential cross-sections rather than the
inclusive quantity $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$.
