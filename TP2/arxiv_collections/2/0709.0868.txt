This paper presents Monte Carlo simulations of language populations and the
development of language families, showing how a simple model can lead to
distributions similar to the ones observed empirically. The model used combines
features of two models used in earlier work by phycisists for the simulation of
competition among languages: the "Viviane" model for the migration of people
and propagation of languages and the "Schulze" model, which uses bitstrings as
a way of characterising structural features of languages.
