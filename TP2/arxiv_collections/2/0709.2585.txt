Stimulated globular scattering (SGS) characteristics (frequency shifts,
threshold, conversion efficiency) have been studied in photonic crystals
(synthetic opal matrices and opal nanocomposites) at different temperatures.
Results have been compared with stimulated Raman scattering investigations in
calcite single crystals. In both cases temperature lowering from +20 C to -196
C resulted in the stimulated scattering energy increase and its redistribution
to the higher order components.
