The chemical potential $\mu$ of a many-body system is valuable since it
carries fingerprints of phase changes. Here, we summarize results for $\mu$ for
a thre e-dimensional electron liquid in terms of average kinetic and potential
energie s per particle. The difference between $\mu$ and the energy per
particle is fou nd to be exactly the electrostatic potential step at the
surface. We also prese nt calculations for an integrable one-dimensional
many-body system with delta f unction interactions, exhibiting a BCS-BEC
crossover. It is shown that in the B CS regime the chemical potential can be
expressed solely in terms of the ground -state energy per particle. A brief
discussion is also included of the strong c oupling BEC limit.
