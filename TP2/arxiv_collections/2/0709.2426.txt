In this paper, I propose a realistic interpretation (RI) of quantum
mechanics, that is, an interpretation according to which a particle follows a
definite path in spacetime. The path is not deterministic but it is rather a
random walk. However, the probability of each step of the walk is found to
depend from some average properties of the particle that can be interpreted as
its propensity to have a certain macroscopic momentum and energy. The proposed
interpretation requires spacetime to be discrete. Prediction of standard
quantum mechanics coincide with predictions of large ensembles of particles in
the RI.
