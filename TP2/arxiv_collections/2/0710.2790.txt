We extend the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model for two degenerate
flavours by including the effect of the SU(3) measure with a Van der Monde
(VdM) term. This ensures that the Polyakov loop always remains in the domain
[0,1]. The pressure, energy density, specific heat, speed of sound and
conformal measure show small or negligible effects from this term. However
various quark number and isospin susceptibilities are all found to approach
their respective ideal gas limits around 2 $T_c$. We compare our methods with
other similar approaches in PNJL model and also present a quantitative
comparison with Lattice QCD data.
