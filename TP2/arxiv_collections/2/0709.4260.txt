In the radiation field of an optical waveguide, the Rayleigh scattering of
photons is shown to result in a strongly velocity-dependent force on atoms. The
pump field, which is injected in the fundamental branch of the waveguide, is
favorably scattered by a moving atom into one of the transversely excited
branches of propagating modes. All fields involved are far detuned from any
resonances of the atom. For a simple polarizable particle, a linear friction
force coefficient comparable to that of cavity cooling can be achieved.
