Gauge unification is widely considered to be a desirable feature for
extensions of the standard model. Unfortunately the standard model itself does
not exhibit a unification of its running gauge couplings but it is required by
grand unified theories as well as the noncommutative version of the standard
model [2].
  We will consider here the extension of the noncommutative standard model by
vector doublets as proposed in [6]. Two consequences of this modification are:
1. the relations of the coupling constants at unification energy are altered
with respect to the well known relation from grand unified theories. 2. The
extended model allows for unification of the gauge couplings at ~10^(13) GeV.
