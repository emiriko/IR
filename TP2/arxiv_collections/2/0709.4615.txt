One of the most fundamental quantities associated with polymer translocation
through a nanopore is the translocation time $\tau$ and its dependence on the
chain length $N$. Our simulation results based on both the bond fluctuation
Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods confirm the original prediction
$\tau\sim N^{2\nu+1}$, which scales in the same manner as the Rouse relaxation
time of the chain except for a larger prefactor, and invalidates other scaling
claims.
