We study Kramers-Wannier dualities for Wess-Zumino-Witten theories and
(super-)minimal models in the Cardy case, i.e. the case with bulk partition
function given by charge conjugation. Using the TFT approach to full rational
conformal field theories, we classify those dualities that preserve all chiral
symmetries. Dualities turn out to exist for small levels only.
