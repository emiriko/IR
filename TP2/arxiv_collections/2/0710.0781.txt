Recent interest in exploring local vacuum structure of QCD through the
properties of the eigenmodes of the lattice Dirac operators rises again the
challenge to visualize four-dimensional objects and structures which appear in
lattice field theories. In spite of complex and powerful commercial
visualization software packages on the market, there are reasons to develop
Interactive Visualization Package (IVP). We believe that an apprehension of the
complex structures is possible only through the interactive approach, with the
user being able to manipulate data representations and slices through the
lattice in real-time. Further insight should also be gained by an interactive
parallel examination of different physical quantities, e.g. eigenmode density
with topological charge or action densities. Finally, thanks to constantly
falling hardware prices, IVP makes it possible to use almost any Linux PC as a
visualization tool for research in lattice field theory.
