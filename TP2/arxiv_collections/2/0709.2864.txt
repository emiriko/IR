A complete scheme for production, cooling, acceleration, and ring for a 1.5
TeV center of mass muon collider is presented, together with parameters for two
higher energy machines. The schemes starts with the front end of a proposed
neutrino factory that yields bunch trains of both muon signs. Six dimensional
cooling in long-period helical lattices reduces the longitudinal emittance
until it becomes possible to merge the trains into single bunches, one of each
sign. Further cooling in all dimensions is applied to the single bunches in
further helical lattices. Final transverse cooling to the required parameters
is achieved in 50 T solenoids.
