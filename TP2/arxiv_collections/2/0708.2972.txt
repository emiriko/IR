In the present article we consider the inverse fallacy, a well known
cognitive heuristic experimentally tested in cognitive science, which occurs
for intuitive judgments in situations of bounded rationality. We show that the
quantum formalism can be used to describe in a very simple and general way this
fallacy within the quantum formalism. Thus we suggest that in cognitive science
the formalism of quantum mechanics can be used to describe a quantum regime,
the bounded-rationality regime, where the cognitive heuristics are valid.
