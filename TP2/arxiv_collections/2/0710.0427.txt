Properties of effective interactions in neutron-rich matter are reflected in
the medium's equation of state (EOS), which is a relationship among several
state variables. Spin and isospin asymmetries play an important role in the
energy balance and could alter the stability conditions of the nuclear EOS. The
EOS has far-reaching consequences for numerous nuclear processes in both the
terrestrial laboratories and the cosmos. Presently the EOS, especially for
neutron-rich matter, is still very uncertain. Heavy-ion reactions provide a
unique means to constrain the EOS, particularly the density dependence of the
nuclear symmetry energy. On the other hand, microscopic, self-consistent, and
parameter-free approaches are ultimately needed for understanding nuclear
properties in terms of the fundamental interactions among the basic
constituents of nuclear systems. In this talk, after a brief review of our
recent studies on spin-polarized neutron matter, we discuss constraining the
changing rate of the gravitational constant $G$ and properties of (rapidly)
rotating neutron stars by using a nuclear EOS partially constrained by the
latest terrestrial nuclear laboratory data.
