We demonstrate, in the context of quadratic fermion lattice models in one and
two spatial dimensions, the potential of entanglement renormalization (ER) to
define a proper real-space renormalization group transformation. Our results
show, for the first time, the validity of the multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA) to describe ground states in two dimensions, even
at a quantum critical point. They also unveil a connection between the
performance of ER and the logarithmic violations of the boundary law for
entanglement in systems with a one-dimensional Fermi surface. ER is recast in
the language of creation/annihilation operators and correlation matrices.
