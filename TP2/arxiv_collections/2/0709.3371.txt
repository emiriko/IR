Using 14.0\times 10^6 \psi(2S) events collected with the BES-II detector, the
C-parity violating process J/psi->gamma gamma via psi(2S)->pi+pi- J/psi is
studied. We determine a new upper limit for the J/psi->gamma gamma branching
ratio of B(J/psi->gamma gamma)<2.2\times 10^{-5} at the 90% C.L., which is
about 20 times lower than the previous measurement.
