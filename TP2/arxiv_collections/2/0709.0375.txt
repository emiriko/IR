Great potential of photonic band-gap (PBG) structures for the development of
continuous wave ultraviolet all-solid-state laser, including UV femtosecond
pulse source, as well as for increase of output laser power at short-wave
optical range is shown. The basic idea is a decrease of the laser threshold via
suppression of the spontaneous emission in the active medium by means of
embedding it into 2D or 3D PBG structure having the midgap frequency close to
the frequency of the laser transition. Different schemes of 2D and 3D photonic
crystal laser for ultraviolet range are proposed.
