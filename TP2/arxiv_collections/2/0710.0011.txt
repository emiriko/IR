The paper establishes explicit lower bounds for the lattice cell size of
periodic structures (metamaterials and photonic crystals) capable of supporting
backward waves and producing negative refraction. At optical frequencies, this
result implies strong inhomogeneity, in the sense that the cell size cannot be
negligible relative to the vacuum wavelength and the Bloch wavelength.
