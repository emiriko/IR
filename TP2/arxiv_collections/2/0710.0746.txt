The order of the phase transition in finite-temperature QCD with two
degenerate light quarks is still an open problem and corresponds to the last
question mark in the zero-density phase diagram of QCD. We argue that
establishing the nature of the transition in this case is also a crucial test
for numerical simulations of lattice QCD, allowing precise estimates of
possible systematic errors related e.g. to the choice of fermion-simulation
algorithm or of discretized formulation for fermions.
