We present an algorithm to perform a simultaneous modular reduction of
several residues. This algorithm is applied fast modular polynomial
multiplication. The idea is to convert the $X$-adic representation of modular
polynomials, with $X$ an indeterminate, to a $q$-adic representation where $q$
is an integer larger than the field characteristic. With some control on the
different involved sizes it is then possible to perform some of the $q$-adic
arithmetic directly with machine integers or floating points. Depending also on
the number of performed numerical operations one can then convert back to the
$q$-adic or $X$-adic representation and eventually mod out high residues. In
this note we present a new version of both conversions: more tabulations and a
way to reduce the number of divisions involved in the process are presented.
The polynomial multiplication is then applied to arithmetic in small finite
field extensions.
