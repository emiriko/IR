Intracellular transport along microtubules or actin filaments, powered by
molecular motors such as kinesins, dyneins or myosins, has been recently
modeled using one-dimensional driven lattice gases. We discuss some
generalizations of these models, that include extended particles and defects.
We investigate the feasibility of single molecule experiments aiming to measure
the average motor density and to locate the position of traffic jams by mean of
a tracer particle. Finally, we comment on preliminary single molecule
experiments performed in living cells.
