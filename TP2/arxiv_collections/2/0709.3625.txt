A quantum Hall system which is divided into two laterally coupled subsystems
by means of a tunneling barrier exhibits a complex Landau level dispersion.
Magnetotunneling spectroscopy is employed to investigate the small energy gaps
which separate subsequent Landau bands. The control on the Fermi level permits
to trace the anticrossings for varying magnetic fields. The band structure
calculation predicts a magnetic shift of the band gaps on the scale of the
cyclotron energy. This effect is confirmed experimentally by a displacement of
the conductance peaks on the axis of the filling factor. Tunneling centers
within the barrier are responsible for quantum interferences between opposite
edge channels. Due to the disorder potential, the corresponding Aharonov-Bohm
interferometers generate additional long-period and irregular conductance
features. In the regime of strong localization, conductance fluctuations occur
at small magnetic fields before the onset of the regular Landau oscillations.
The Landau dispersion is obtained by a dedicated algorithm which solves the
Schroedinger equation exactly for a single electron residing in a quantum Hall
system with an arbitrary unidirectional, threefold staircase potential.
