We study the formulation of quantum statistical mechanics in noncommutative
spaces. We construct microcanonical and canonical ensemble theory in
noncommutative spaces. We consider for illustration some basic and important
examples in the framework of noncommutative statistical mechanics : (i). An
electron in a magnetic field. (ii). A free particle in a box. (iii). A linear
harmonic oscillator.
