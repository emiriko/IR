Different strategies for the computation of QCD low-energy couplings by
matching lattice QCD with the chiral effective theory are reviewed. After
recalling the main features of the chiral effective theory in the epsilon- and
p- regimes, the current status of the determination of leading order (Sigma, F)
and next-to-leading order (l_i, L_i) low-energy constants is summarised,
focusing in particular on recent results obtained with N_f=2 and N_f=2+1
simulations.
