We present an extension of the Monte Carlo Event Generator Whizard which
includes chargino production at the ILC at NLO. We include photons using both a
fixed order and a resummation approach. While the fixed order approach suffers
from negative event weights, the resummation method solves this problem and
automatically includes leading higher order corrections. We present results for
cross sections and event generation for both methods and evaluate the
systematic errors due to soft and collinear approximations. In the resummation
approach, the residual uncertainty can be brought down to the per-mil level.
