Perturbative unitarity for $\wlwl$ scattering is discussed within the
Randall-Sundrum model. It is shown that the exchange of massive 4D Kaluza-Klein
gravitons leads to amplitudes growing linearly with the CM energy squared.
Summing over KK gravitons up to a scale $\lbar$ and testing unitarity at
$\rts=\lbar$, one finds that unitarity is violated for $\lbar$ below the 'naive
dimensional analysis' scale, $\lnda$. It is also shown that the exchange of
gravitons can substantially relax the upper limit from unitarity on the mass of
the Standard Model Higgs boson - consistency with unitarity for all $\rts$
below $\lbar$ is possible for $\mh$ as large as $ 1.4\tev$, depending on the
curvature of the background metric. Observation of the mass and width (or cross
section) of one or more KK gravitons at the LHC will directly determine the
curvature and the scale $\lw$ specifying the couplings of matter to the KK
gravitons. With this information and a measurement of the Higgs boson mass it
will be possible to determine the precise $\rts$ value below which unitarity
will remain valid.
