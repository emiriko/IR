This is a review of Lee Smolin's "The Trouble with Physics". The main gist of
the review is that the physics of the past three decades has been rich with new
discoveries in a large number of domains. The Standard Model, while providing a
successful framework for the electroweak and strong interactions still needs to
be developed further to fully account fot the mass of strong interaction data
collected over the decades. A multitude of new phenomena have been discovered
however, or predicted theoretically, in the physics of very low temperatures
(e.g. fractional Hall effect, Bose-Einstein condensation) and quantum
macroscopic effects (liquid crystals, high temperature superconductivity), some
of which remain to be fully explained. Therefore if there is any "Trouble with
Physics", as implied by the author of this book, it mainly concerns speculative
work on Superstring theory, which may or may not turn out to agree with the
results of observation. The subject as a whole does not appear to be in
trouble.
