The magnetization of semiconductor quantum dots in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and interactions is investigated numerically. When the dot is occupied
by two electrons we find that a level crossing between the two lowest many-body
eigenstates may occur as a function of the spin-orbit coupling strength. This
level crossing is accompanied by a non-vanishing magnetization of the
ground-state. Using first order perturbation theory as well as exact numerical
diagonalization of small clusters we show that the tendency of interactions to
cause Stoner-like instability is enhanced by the SO coupling. The resulting
g-factor can have a significant value, and thus may influence g-factor
measurements. Finally we propose an experimental method by which the predicted
phenomenon can be observed.
