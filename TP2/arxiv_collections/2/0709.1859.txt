We present the noise free escape of a chain of linearly interacting units
from a metastable state over a cubic on-site potential barrier. The underlying
dynamics is conservative and purely deterministic. The mutual interplay between
nonlinearity and harmonic interactions causes an initially uniform lattice
state to become unstable, leading to an energy redistribution with strong
localization. As a result a spontaneously emerging localized mode grows into a
critical nucleus. By surpassing this transition state, the nonlinear chain
manages a self-organized, deterministic barrier crossing. Most strikingly,
these noise-free, collective nonlinear escape events proceed generally by far
faster than transitions assisted by thermal noise when the ratio between the
average energy supplied per unit in the chain and the potential barrier energy
assumes small values.
