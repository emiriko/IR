Strongly correlated two-dimensional electronic systems subject to a
perpendicular magnetic field at lowest Landau level (LLL) filling factors: 1/2,
1/4 and 1/6 are believed to be composite fermion (CF) Fermi liquid phases. Even
though a Bose Laughlin wave function cannot describe these filling factors we
investigate whether such a wave function provides a lower energy bound to the
true CF Fermi liquid energies. By using Monte Carlo simulations in disk
geometry we compute the Bose Laughlin energies and compare them to
corresponding results for the spin-polarized LLL CF Fermi liquid state and
avalable data from literature.We find the unexpected result that, for filling
factors 1/4 and 1/6, the Bose Laughlin ground state energy is practically
identical to the true CF liquid energy while this is not the case at 1/2 where
the Bose Laughlin ground state energy is sizeably lower than the energy of the
CF Fermi liquid state.
