We report the results of a $^{63,65}$Cu NMR/NQR study probing the
intermetallic compound PrCu$_2$. The previously claimed onset of magnetic order
at 65 K, indicated in a $\mu$SR study, is not confirmed. Based on our data we
discuss different possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy, including a
non negligible influence of the implanted muons on their environment. Competing
dipolar and quadrupolar interactions lead to unusual features of the
magnetic-ion/conduction-electron system, different from those of common
intermetallics exhibiting structural or magnetic instabilities.
