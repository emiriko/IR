We show that the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved in the framework of
scalar-tensor theories of gravity very much in the same way as it is solved in
the Randall-Sundrum scenario. Our solution involves a fine-tuning of the
gravitational sector. However our mechanism does not require the introduction
of extra-dimensions or new physics strongly coupled to the standard model in
the low energy regime. We do introduce a new scalar field which is however
coupled only gravitationally to regular matter. The physical reason for the
splitting between the weak scale and the Planck scale is a violation of the
Einstein's equivalence principle.
