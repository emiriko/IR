We construct a model of direct gauge mediation of metastable SUSY breaking by
simply deforming the Intriligator, Seiberg and Shih model in terms of a dual
meson superpotential mass term. No extra matter field is introduced. The
deformation explicitly breaks a U(1)_R symmetry and a pseudo moduli have a
nonzero VEV at one-loop. Our metastable SUSY breaking vacuum turns out to be
sufficiently long-lived. By gauging a subgroup of flavor symmetry, our model
can directly couple to the standard model, which leads to nonvanishing gaugino
mass generation. It is also shown that our model can evade the Landau pole
problem. We show the parameters in the SUSY breaking sector are
phenomenologically constrained.
