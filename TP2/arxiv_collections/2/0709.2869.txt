The universal scaling behavior for the electron-impact excitation cross
sections of the $2s$ states of hydrogen- and helium-like multicharged ions is
deduced. The study is performed within the framework of non-relativistic
perturbation theory, taking into account the one-photon exchange diagrams.
Special emphasis is laid on the near-threshold energy domain. The parametrical
relationship between the cross sections for excitation of multicharged ions
with different number of electrons is established.
