The aim of this work is to present the details of the finite element approach
we developed for solving the Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equations in order to be
able to treat problems involving complex geometries. There are several
possibilities to solve the complex Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equations
numerically. Our method is based on a Galerkin-type finite element approach. We
start with the dynamic Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert equations, the associated
boundary condition and the constraint on the magnetization norm. We derive the
weak form required by the finite element method. This weak form is afterwards
integrated on the domain of calculus. We compared the results obtained with our
finite element approach with the ones obtained by a finite difference method.
The results being in very good agreement, we can state that our approach is
well adapted for 2D micromagnetic systems.
