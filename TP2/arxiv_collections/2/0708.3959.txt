Nonlinear properties of Surface Plasmon Polaritons stemming from the inherent
electron plasma nonlinearity of the metal layers are investigated. A
fluid-mechanics plasma model is used to describe the electron motion in metals.
The nonlinear ponderomotive force repels the electrons from the high field
intensity region, effectively reducing the local plasma frequency and the
corresponding real part of the refractive index results in Kerr like
self-focusing. The field confinement to the low carrier density region also
assists also in reducing the propagation losses, which usually inhibit
practical nanoplasmonic circuits. Surface plasmon self focusing and nonlinear
spectrum modifications, predicted by our model, are demonstrated by preliminary
experiments.
