We present a method for the measurement of a temperature differential across
a single quantum dot that has transmission resonances that are separated in
energy by much more than the thermal energy. We determine numerically that the
method is accurate to within a few percent across a wide range of parameters.
The proposed method measures the temperature of the electrons that enter the
quantum dot and will be useful in experiments that aim to test theory which
predicts quantum dots are highly-efficient thermoelectrics.
