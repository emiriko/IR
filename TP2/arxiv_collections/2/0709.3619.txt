A class of $(n+1)$-dimensional topological black hole solutions in
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with Liouville-type potentials for the dilaton
field is presented. In these spacetimes, black hole horizon and cosmological
horizon can be an $(n-1)$-dimensional positive, zero or negative constant
curvature hypersurface. Because of the presence of the dilaton field, these
topological black holes are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter.
We calculate the charge, mass, temperature, entropy and electric potential of
these solutions. We also analyze thermodynamics of these topological black
holes and disclose the effect of the dilaton field on the thermal stability of
the solutions.
