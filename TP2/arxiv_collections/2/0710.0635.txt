Let $\Phi$ be a root system and let $\Phi(\Zp)$ be the standard Chevalley
$\Zp$-Lie algebra associated to $\Phi$. For any integer $t\geq 1$, let $G$ be
the uniform pro-$p$ group corresponding to the powerful Lie algebra $p^t
\Phi(\Zp)$ and suppose that $p\geq 5$. Then the Iwasawa algebra $\Omega_G$ has
no nontrivial reflexive two-sided ideals. This was previously proved by the
authors for the root system $A_1$.
