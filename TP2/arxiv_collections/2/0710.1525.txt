Minimal-interval semantics associates with each query over a document a set
of intervals, called witnesses, that are incomparable with respect to inclusion
(i.e., they form an antichain): witnesses define the minimal regions of the
document satisfying the query. Minimal-interval semantics makes it easy to
define and compute several sophisticated proximity operators, provides snippets
for user presentation, and can be used to rank documents. In this paper we
provide algorithms for computing conjunction and disjunction that are linear in
the number of intervals and logarithmic in the number of operands; for
additional operators, such as ordered conjunction and Brouwerian difference, we
provide linear algorithms. In all cases, space is linear in the number of
operands. More importantly, we define a formal notion of optimal laziness, and
either prove it, or prove its impossibility, for each algorithm. We cast our
results in a general framework of antichains of intervals on total orders,
making our algorithms directly applicable to other domains.
