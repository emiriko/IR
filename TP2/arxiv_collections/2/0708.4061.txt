The goal of this paper is the identification of the physical processes at the
origin of the nonlinear behavior of a plasma conductor when an external
constraint gradually departs the system from thermal equilibrium. This reveals
the presence of a self-organization scenario whose final product depends on the
magnitude of the applied constraint. At first it appears a complexity whose
stability is ensured by the presence of an electrical double layer. By
increasing the external constraint the complexity transits into an autonomous
state whose existence is related to a rhythmic exchange of matter and energy
with the surrounding environment, sustained and controlled by a proper dynamics
of the double layer. The results are potentially important for developing a
general strategy of nonequilibrium physics, suggesting answers to challenging
problems concerning the mechanism that could explain the appearance of
self-organized complexities in laboratory and nature.
