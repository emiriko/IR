The aim of this paper is to establish time decay properties and dispersive
estimates for strictly hyperbolic equations with homogeneous symbols and with
time-dependent coefficients whose derivatives are integrable. For this purpose,
the method of asymptotic integration is developed for such equations and
representation formulae for solutions are obtained. These formulae are analysed
further to obtain time decay of Lp-Lq norms of propagators for the
corresponding Cauchy problems. It turns out that the decay rates can be
expressed in terms of certain geometric indices of the limiting equation and we
carry out the thorough analysis of this relation. This provides a comprehensive
view on asymptotic properties of solutions to time-perturbations of hyperbolic
equations with constant coefficients. Moreover, we also obtain the time decay
rate of the Lp-Lq estimates for equations of these kinds, so the time
well-posedness of the corresponding nonlinear equations with additional
semilinearity can be treated by standard Strichartz estimates.
