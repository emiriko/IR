The generalized Chaplygin gas provides an interesting candidate for the
present accelerated expansion of the universe. We explore a geometrical
explanation for the generalized Chaplygin gas within the context of brane world
theories where matter fields are confined to the brane by means of the action
of a confining potential. We obtain the modified Friedmann equations,
deceleration parameter and age of the universe in this scenario and show that
they are consistent with the present observational data.
