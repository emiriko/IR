``Three-mass triangles'' are a class of integral functions appearing in
one-loop gauge theory amplitudes. We discuss how the complex analytic
properties and singularity structures of these amplitudes can be combined with
generalised unitarity techniques to produce compact expressions for three-mass
triangle coefficients. We present formulae for the N=1 contributions to the
n-point NMHV amplitude.
