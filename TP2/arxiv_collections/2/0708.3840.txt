Considering the Gross-Pitaevskii integral equation we are able to formally
obtain an analytical solution for the order parameter $\Phi (x)$ and for the
chemical potential $\mu $ as a function of a unique dimensionless non-linear
parameter $\Lambda $. We report solutions for different range of values for the
repulsive and the attractive non-linear interactions in the condensate. Also,
we study a bright soliton-like variational solution for the order parameter for
positive and negative values of $\Lambda $. Introducing an accumulated error
function we have performed a quantitative analysis with other well-established
methods as: the perturbation theory, the Thomas-Fermi approximation, and the
numerical solution. This study gives a very useful result establishing the
universal range of the $\Lambda $-values where each solution can be easily
implemented. In particular we showed that for $\Lambda <-9$, the bright soliton
function reproduces the exact solution of GPE wave function.
