We show that the magnetization in color-flavor locked superconductors can be
so strong that homogeneous quark matter becomes metastable for a wide range of
magnetic field values. This indicates that magnetic domains or other type of
magnetic inhomogeneities can be present in the quark cores of magnetars.
