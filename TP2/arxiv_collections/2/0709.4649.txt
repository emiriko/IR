A class of one dimensional classical systems is characterized from an
algebraic point of view. The Hamiltonians of these systems are factorized in
terms of two functions that together with the Hamiltonian itself close a
Poisson algebra. These two functions lead directly to two time-dependent
integrals of motion from which the phase motions are derived algebraically. The
systems so obtained constitute the classical analogues of the well known
factorizable one dimensional quantum mechanical systems.
