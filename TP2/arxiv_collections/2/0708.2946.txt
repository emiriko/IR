We compute generating functions for number of U(N) (SU(N)) singlets in Fock
space in several space dimensions. The motivation to find the explicit form of
the functions is from the numerical approach to supersymmetric Yang-Mills
quantum mechanics, based on Fock space. Incidently the functions give many
important insights into the quantum mechanical models based U(N) (SU(N)) gauge
group.
