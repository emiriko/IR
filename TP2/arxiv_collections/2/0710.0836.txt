We study the giant magnetoresistance of nanogranular magnets in the presence
of an external magnetic field and finite temperature. We show that the
magnetization of arrays of nanogranular magnets has hysteretic behaviour at low
temperatures leading to a double peak in the magnetoresistance which coalesces
at high temperatures into a single peak. We numerically calculate the
magnetization of magnetic domains and the motion of domain walls in this system
using a combined mean-field approach and a model for an elastic membrane moving
in a random medium, respectively. From the obtained results, we calculate the
electric resistivity as a function of magnetic field and temperature. Our
findings show excellent agreement with various experimental data.
