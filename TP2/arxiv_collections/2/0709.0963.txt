We propose new experiments with high sensitivity to a possible spatial or
temporal variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio $\mu \equiv m_e/m_p$.
We consider a nearly-degenerate pair of molecular vibrational levels, where
each state is associated with a different electronic potential. The change in
the splitting between such levels, with respect to a change in $\mu$, can be
large both on an absolute scale and relative to the splitting. We demonstrate
the existence of such pairs of levels in Cs$_2$. The narrow spectral lines
achievable with ultracold Cs$_2$ in these long-lived levels make this system
promising for future searches for small variations in $\mu$.
