We consider a composite piezoelectric material whose reference configuration
is a thin shell with fixed thickness. In this work, we give a new approach
based on the periodic unfolding method to justify the modelling of a thin
piezoelectric perforated shells and we establish the limit constitutive law by
letting the size of holes is supposed to go to zero. This allows to use the
homogenization technique to derive the limitting equations and the homogenizaed
coefficients are explicity described.
