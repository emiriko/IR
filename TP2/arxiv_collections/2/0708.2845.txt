We report on the transport of mixed quantum degenerate gases of bosonic 87Rb
and fermionic 40K in a harmonic potential provided by a modified QUIC trap. The
samples are transported over a distance of 6 mm to the geometric center of the
anti-Helmholtz coils of the QUIC trap. This transport mechanism was implemented
by a small modification of the QUIC trap and is free of losses and heating. It
allows all experiments using QUIC traps to use the highly homogeneous magnetic
fields that can be created in the center of a QUIC trap and improves the
optical access to the atoms, e.g., for experiments with optical lattices. This
mechanism may be cascaded to cover even larger distances for applications with
quantum degenerate samples.
