We propose a new method for dynamic nuclear polarisation in a quasi
one-dimensional quantum wire utilising the spin-orbit interaction, the
hyperfine interaction, and a finite source-drain potential difference. In
contrast with current methods, our scheme does not rely on external magnetic or
optical sources which makes independent control of closely placed devices much
more feasible. Using this method, a significant polarisation of a few per cent
is possible in currently available InAs wires which may be detected by
conductance measurements. This may prove useful for nuclear-magnetic-resonance
studies in nanoscale systems as well as in spin-based devices where external
magnetic and optical sources will not be suitable.
