Recombination of H3+ with electrons was studied in a low temperature plasma
in helium. The plasma recombination rate is driven by two body, H3+ + e, and
three-body, H3+ + e + He, processes with the rate coefficients 7.5x10^{-8}cm3/s
and 2.8x10^{-25}cm6/s correspondingly at 260K. The two-body rate coefficient is
in excellent agreement with results from storage ring experiments and
theoretical calculations. We suggest that the three-body recombination involves
formation of highly excited Rydberg neutral H3 followed by an l- or m- changing
collision with He. Plasma electron spectroscopy indicates the presence of H3.
