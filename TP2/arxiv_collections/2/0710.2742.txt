The super-inflationary phase is predicted by the Loop Quantum Cosmology. In
this paper we study the creation of gravitational waves during this phase. We
consider the inverse volume corrections to the equation for the tensor modes
and calculate the spectrum of the produced gravitons. The amplitude of the
obtained spectrum as well as maximal energy of gravitons strongly depend on the
evolution of the Universe after the super-inflation. We show that a further
standard inflationary phase is necessary to lower the amount of gravitons below
the present bound. In case of the lack of the standard inflationary phase, the
present intensity of gravitons would be extremely large. These considerations
give us another motivation to introduce the standard phase of inflation.
