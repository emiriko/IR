We study the realization of lattice models, where cold atoms and molecules
move as extra particles in a dipolar crystal of trapped polar molecules. The
crystal is a self-assembled floating mesoscopic lattice structure with quantum
dynamics given by phonons. We show that within an experimentally accessible
parameter regime extended Hubbard models with tunable long-range
phonon-mediated interactions describe the effective dynamics of dressed
particles.
