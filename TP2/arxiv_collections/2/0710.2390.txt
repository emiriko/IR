We report on our calculation of the pion electromagnetic form factor with
two-flavors of dynamical overlap quarks. Gauge configurations are generated
using the Iwasaki gauge action on a 16^3 \times 32 lattice at the lattice
spacing of 0.12fm with sea quark masses down to m_s/6, where m_s is the
physical strange quark mass. We describe our setup to measure the form factor
through all-to-all quark propagators and present preliminary results.
