This paper analyses the requirements of performing parallel
transaction-oriented simulations with a special focus on the space-parallel
approach and discrete event simulation synchronisation algorithms that are
suitable for transaction-oriented simulation and the target environment of Ad
Hoc Grids. To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel
transaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is
implemented on the basis of the most promising Shock Resistant Time Warp
synchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The
validation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves
but it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion
of this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm to avoid such problems.
