Quantum expanders are a natural generalization of classical expanders. These
objects were introduced and studied by Ben-Aroya and Ta-Shma and by Hastings.
In this note we show how to construct explicit, constant-degree quantum
expanders. The construction is essentially the classical Zig-Zag expander
construction, applied to quantum expanders.
