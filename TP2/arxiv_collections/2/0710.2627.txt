Let $G$ be a real semisimple Lie group, $K$ its maximal complex subgroup, and
$G_C$ its complexification.
  It is known that all the $K$-finite matrix elements on $G$ admit holomorphic
continuation to branching functions on $G_C$ having singularities at the a
prescribed divisor. We propose a geometric explanation of this phenomenon. The
note also contsins a general survey of holomorphic continuations of
infinite-dimensional representations.
