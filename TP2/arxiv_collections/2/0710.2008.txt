We analyze the dynamics of occupation probabilities for a certain type of
design models by the use of two different methods. On the one hand we present
some numerical calculations for two concrete interactions which point out that
the occurrence of statistical dynamics depends on the interaction structure.
Furthermore we show an analytical derivation for an infinite system that yields
statistical behaviour for the average over the whole ensemble of interactions
in the Van Hove-limit.
