We evaluate the Casimir-Polder potential between two atoms in the presence of
an infinite perfectly conducting plate and at nonzero temperature. In order to
calculate the potential, we use a method based on equal-time spatial
correlations of the electric field, already used to evaluate the effect of
boundary conditions on interatomic potentials. This method gives also a
transparent physical picture of the role of a finite temperature and boundary
conditions on the Casimir-Polder potential. We obtain an analytical expression
of the potential both in the near and far zones, and consider several limiting
cases of interest, according to the values of the parameters involved, such as
atom-atom distance, atoms-wall distance and temperature.
