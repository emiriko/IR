Shashlyk electromagnetic calorimeter modules with an energy resolution of
about 3%/sqrt{E (GeV)} for 50-1000 MeV photons has been developed, and a
prototype tested. Details of these improved modules, including mechanical
construction, selection of wave shifting fibers and photo-detectors, and
development of a new scintillator with improved optical and mechanical
properties are described. How the modules will perform in a large calorimeter
was determined from prototype measurements. The experimentally determined
characteristics of the calorimeter prototype show energy resolution of
sigma_E/E=(1.96+-0.1)% \oplus (2.74+-0.05)%/sqrt{E}, time resolution of sigma_T
= (72+-4)/sqrt{E} \oplus (14+-2)/E (ps), where photon energy E is given in GeV
units and \oplus means a quadratic summation. A punch-through inefficiency of
photon detection was measured to be \epsilon = 5*10^{-5} (\Theta >5 mrad).
