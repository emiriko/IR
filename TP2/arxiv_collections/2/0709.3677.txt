In this paper we describe in full details a new family of recently found
exact solutions of relativistic, perfect fluid dynamics. With an ansatz, which
generalizes the well-known Hwa-Bjorken solution, we obtain a wide class of new
exact, explicit and simple solutions, which have a remarkable advantage as
compared to presently known exact and explicit solutions: they do not lack
acceleration. They can be utilized for the description of the evolution of the
matter created in high energy heavy ion collisions. Because these solutions are
accelerating, they provide a more realistic picture than the well-known
Hwa-Bjorken solution, and give more insight into the dynamics of the matter. We
exploit this by giving an advanced simple estimation of the initial energy
density of the produced matter in high energy collisions, which takes
acceleration effects (i.e. the work done by the pressure and the modified
change of the volume elements) into account. We also give an advanced
estimation of the life-time of the reaction. Our new solutions can also be used
to test numerical hydrodynamical codes reliably. In the end, we also give an
exact, 1+1 dimensional, relativistic hydrodynamical solution, where the initial
pressure and velocity profile is arbitrary, and we show that this general
solution is stable for perturbations.
