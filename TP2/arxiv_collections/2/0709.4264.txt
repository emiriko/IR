We present a theoretical study of a superconducting charge qubit dispersively
coupled to a transmission line resonator. Starting from a master equation
description of this coupled system and using a polaron transformation, we
obtain an exact effective master equation for the qubit. We then use quantum
trajectory theory to investigate the measurement of the qubit by continuous
homodyne measurement of the resonator out-field. Using the same porlaron
transformation, a stochastic master equation for the conditional state of the
qubit is obtained. From this result, various definitions of the measurement
time are studied. Furthermore, we find that in the limit of strong homodyne
measurement, typical quantum trajectories for the qubit exhibit a crossover
from diffusive to jump-like behavior. Finally, in the presence of Rabi drive on
the qubit, the qubit dynamics is shown to exhibit quantum Zeno behavior.
