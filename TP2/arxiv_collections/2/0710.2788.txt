I start by giving a brief overview over new developments in the area of
confinement and topology. As an example for the interrelations between
topological objects, instantons at finite temperature are discussed. Then I
focus on new insights into the structure of the QCD vacuum obtained through
filtering methods, in particular those based on decompositions w.r.t. fermionic
eigenmodes.
