The nondegenerate two-orbital Hubbard model is studied within the dynamic
mean-field theory to reveal the influence of two important factors, i.e.
crystal field splitting and interorbital hopping, on orbital selective Mott
transition (OSMT) and realistic compound Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$RuO$_{4}$. A
distinctive feature of the optical conductivity of the two nondegenerate bands
is found in OSMT phase, where the metallic character of the wide band is
indicated by a nonzero Drude peak, while the insulating narrow band has its
Drude peak drop to zero in the mean time. We also find that the OSMT regime
expands profoundly with the increase of interorbital hopping integrals. On the
contrary, it is shown that large and negative level splitting of the two
orbitals diminishes the OSMT regime completely. Applying the present findings
to compound Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$RuO$_{4}$, we demonstrate that in the doping
region from $x=0.2$ to 2.0, the negative level splitting is unfavorable to the
OSMT phase.
