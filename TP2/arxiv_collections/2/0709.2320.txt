We discuss an alternative accurate Monte Carlo method to calculate the
ground-state energy and related quantities for Laughlin states of the
fractional quantum Hall effect in a disk geometry. This alternative approach
allows us to obtain accurate bulk regime (thermodynamic limit) values for
various quantities from Monte Carlo simulations with a small number of
particles (much smaller than that needed with standard Monte Carlo approaches).
