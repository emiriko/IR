We calculate the statistical entropy of a scalar field on the background of
(2+1)-dimensional de Sitter space without an artificial cutoff considering
corrections to all orders in the Planck length from a generalized uncertainty
principle (GUP) on the quantum state density. The desired entropy proportional
to the horizon perimeter is obtained.
