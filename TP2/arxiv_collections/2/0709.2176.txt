The reaction center of Chloroflexus aurantiacus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides
mutation of RC`s was investigated. To describe the kinetic of the Chloroflexus
aurantiacus RC's we use incoherent model of electron transfer. It was shown
that the asymmetry in electronic coupling must be included to explain the
experiments. For the description of Rhodobacter sphaeroides H(M182)L mutation
we used partially coherent as incoherent models of electron transfer. These two
models are discussed with regard to the observed electron transfer kinetics. It
can be concluded that partially coherent model is more adequate. We predict
some new electron pathways for describing the kinetic of RC's and some
mutation.
