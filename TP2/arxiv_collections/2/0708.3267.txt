In his renormalization paper of the Kondo effect Wilson replaced the full
band of s-electrons by a small number of ''Wilson states''. He started from a
rather artificial symmetric band with constant density of states and constant
interaction with the impurity. It is shown in the present paper that with a
minor modification the Wilson states are optimally suited to treat the
interaction of an impurity with an arbitrary s-band. Each Wilson state
represents electrons of a whole energy range. It carries the interaction of all
these electrons with the impurity. All the other electron states in this energy
range have zero interaction with the impurity and are neglected in the
calculation. The resulting error is minor. As an example the singlet-triplet
excitation energy of a Kondo impurity is numerically calculated for a
tight-binding band with a strongly energy dependent density of states.
