We introduce our concept on the modular wireless robot consisting of three
main modules : main unit, data acquisition and data processing modules. We have
developed a generic prototype with an integrated control and monitoring system
to enhance its flexibility, and to enable simple operation through a web-based
interface accessible wirelessly. In present paper, we focus on the
microcontroller based hardware to enable data acquisition and remote mechanical
control.
