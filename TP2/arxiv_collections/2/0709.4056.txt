We report the detection of single ion impacts through monitoring of changes
in the source-drain currents of field effect transistors (FET) at room
temperature. Implant apertures are formed in the interlayer dielectrics and
gate electrodes of planar, micro-scale FETs by electron beam assisted etching.
FET currents increase due to the generation of positively charged defects in
gate oxides when ions (121Sb12+, 14+, Xe6+; 50 to 70 keV) impinge into channel
regions. Implant damage is repaired by rapid thermal annealing, enabling
iterative cycles of device doping and electrical characterization for
development of single atom devices and studies of dopant fluctuation effects.
