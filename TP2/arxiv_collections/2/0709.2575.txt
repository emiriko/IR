The realization of a cavity soliton laser using a vertical-cavity
surface-emitting semiconductor gain structure coupled to an external cavity
with a frequency-selective element is reported. All-optical control of bistable
solitonic emission states representing small microlasers is demonstrated by
injection of an external beam. The control scheme is phase-insensitive and
hence expected to be robust for all-optical processing applications. The
motility of these structures is also demonstrated.
