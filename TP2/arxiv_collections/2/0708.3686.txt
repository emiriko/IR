We propose a simplified scheme to teleport a superposition of coherent states
from one mode to another of the same bimodal lossy cavity. Based on current
experimental capabilities, we present a calculation of the fidelity that can be
achieved, demonstrating accurate teleportation if the mean photon number of
each mode is at most 1.5. Our scheme applies as well for teleportation of
coherent states from one mode of a cavity to another mode of a second cavity,
both cavities embedded in a common reservoir.
