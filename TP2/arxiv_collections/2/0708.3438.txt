The optical properties of cesium chloride (CsCl) are changed with presence of
vacancies in the crystal structure giving rise to what is called as "color
centers". We have unconventionally adopted Tauc's method to determine the
characteristic color centers and have modeled the correlation among the film
optical properties and lattice size, highlighting the interrelation between the
structural and optical properties of alkali halide films.
