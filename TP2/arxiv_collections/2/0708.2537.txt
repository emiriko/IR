In a companion paper (Jonsson and Westman, Class. Quantum Grav. 23 (2006)
61), a generalization of optical geometry, assuming a non-shearing reference
congruence, is discussed. Here we illustrate that this formalism can be applied
to a finite four-volume of any spherically symmetric spacetime. In particular
we apply the formalism, using a non-static reference congruence, to do optical
geometry across the horizon of a static black hole. While the resulting
geometry in principle is time dependent, we can choose the reference congruence
in such a manner that an embedding of the geometry always looks the same.
Relative to the embedded geometry the reference points are then moving. We
discuss the motion of photons, inertial forces and gyroscope precession in this
framework.
