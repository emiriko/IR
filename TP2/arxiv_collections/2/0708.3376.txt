We report on a new measurement of $^{14}$N(p,$\gamma$)$^{15}$O for the ground
state capture transition at $E_p$ = 360, 380 and 400 keV, using the 400 kV LUNA
accelerator. The true coincidence summing effect --the major source of error in
the ground state capture determination-- has been significantly reduced by
using a Clover--type gamma detector.
