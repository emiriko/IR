The discovery of community structure is a common challenge in the analysis of
network data. Many methods have been proposed for finding community structure,
but few have been proposed for determining whether the structure found is
statistically significant or whether, conversely, it could have arisen purely
as a result of chance. In this paper we show that the significance of community
structure can be effectively quantified by measuring its robustness to small
perturbations in network structure. We propose a suitable method for perturbing
networks and a measure of the resulting change in community structure and use
them to assess the significance of community structure in a variety of
networks, both real and computer generated.
