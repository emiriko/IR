A surface model of Nambu and Goto is studied statistical mechanically by
using the canonical Monte Carlo simulation technique on a spherical meshwork.
The model is defined by the area energy term and a one-dimensional bending
energy term in the Hamiltonian. We find that the model has a large variety of
phases; the spherical phase, the planar phase, the long linear phase, the short
linear phase, the wormlike phase, and the collapsed phase. Almost all two
neighboring phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. It is also
remarkable that no surface fluctuation can be seen in the surfaces both in the
spherical phase and in the planar phase.
