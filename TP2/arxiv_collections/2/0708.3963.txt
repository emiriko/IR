The contra-directional coupling between a left-handed monomode waveguide and
a right-handed monomode waveguide is rigorously studied using a complex plane
analysis. Light is shown to rotate in this lamellar structure forming a very
exotic mode which we have called a light wheel. The light wheel can be excited
using evanescent coupling or by placing sources in one of the waveguides. This
structure can thus be seen as a new type of cavity. It is a way to suppress the
guided mode of a dielectric slab.
