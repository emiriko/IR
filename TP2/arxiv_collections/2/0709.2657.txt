We consider the Green's functions associated to a scalar field propagating on
a curved, ultra-static background, in the presence of modified dispersion
relations. The usual proper-time deWitt-Schwinger procedure to obtain a series
representation of the Green's functions is doomed to failure, because of higher
order spatial derivatives in the Klein-Gordon operator. We show how to overcome
this difficulty by considering a preferred frame, associated to a unit
time-like vector. With respect to this frame, we can express the Green's
functions as an integral over all frequencies of a space-dependent function.
The latter can be expanded in momentum space, as a series with geometric
coefficients similar to the deWitt-Schwinger's ones. By integrating over all
frequencies, we finally find the expansion of the Green's function up to four
derivatives of the metric tensor. The relation with the proper-time formalism
is also discussed.
