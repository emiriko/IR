We show how the symmetry breaking pattern of the simplest little Higgs model,
and that of the smallest moose model that incorporates an approximate custodial
SU(2), can be realized through the condensation of strongly coupled fermions.
In each case a custodial SU(2) symmetry of the new strong dynamics limits the
sizes of corrections to precision electroweak observables. In the case of the
simplest little Higgs, there are no new light states beyond those present in
the original model. However, our realization of the symmetry breaking pattern
of the moose model predicts an additional scalar field with mass of order a TeV
or higher that has exactly the same quantum numbers as the Standard Model Higgs
and which decays primarily to third generation quarks.
