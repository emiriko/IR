The focusing properties of three aspheric lenses with numerical aperture (NA)
between 0.53 and 0.68 were directly measured using an interferometrically
referenced scanning knife-edge beam profiler with sub-micron resolution. The
results obtained for two of the three lenses tested were in agreement with
paraxial gaussian beam theory. It was also found that the highest NA aspheric
lens which was designed for 830nm was not diffraction limited at 633nm. This
process was automated using motorized translation stages and provides a direct
method for testing the design specifications of high numerical aperture optics.
