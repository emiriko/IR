Density functional calculations of electronic structure, total energy,
structural distortions, and magnetism for hydrogenated single-layer, bilayer,
and multi-layer graphene are performed. It is found that hydrogen-induced
magnetism can survives only at very low concentrations of hydrogen (single-atom
regime) whereas hydrogen pairs with optimized structure are usually
nonmagnetic. Chemisorption energy as a function of hydrogen concentration is
calculated, as well as energy barriers for hydrogen binding and release. The
results confirm that graphene can be perspective material for hydrogen storage.
Difference between hydrogenation of graphene, nanotubes, and bulk graphite is
discussed.
