La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$Mn$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_{3}$ ($0 \le x \le 0.20$)
polycrystalline materials are prepared by employing lower annealing temperature
compared to the temperatures reported for the materials of the same
composition. The transport and magnetic properties of these materials are
significantly different from those compounds prepared at higher annealing
temperature. Samples with $x < 0.10$, show metal-insulator transition and those
with $x \ge 0.10$ exhibit insulating behavior over the entire temperature range
investigated. A gradual transition occurs from ferromagnetic-metallic state to
ferromagnetic-insulator state with increasing Ti substitution. Lattice
parameters and bond lengths of Mn and its near neighbours however do not change
appreciably with the dopant content $x$ in these materials. It is shown that
Ti$^{4+}$ doping in the low temperature annealed samples is inhomogeneous
resulting in isolated Mn rich regions that are connected by a variable range
hopping polaron.
