Einstein- Schroedinger (ES) non-symmetric theory has been extended to
accommodate the Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories of dyons in terms of the
quaternion-octonion metric realization. Corresponding covariant derivatives for
complex, quaternion and octonion spaces in internal gauge groups are shown to
describe the consistent field equations and generalized Dirac equation of
dyons. It is also shown that quaternion and octonion representations extend the
so-called unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism to the Yang-Mill's
fields leading to two SU(2) gauge theories of internal spaces due to the
presence of electric and magnetic charges on dyons.
