In order to describe unbalanced ultracold fermionic quantum gases on optical
lattices in a harmonic trap, we investigate an attractive ($U<0$) asymmetric
($t_\uparrow\neq t_\downarrow$) Hubbard model with a Zeeman-like magnetic
field. In view of the model's spatial inhomogeneity, we focus in this paper on
the solution at Hartree-Fock level. The Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is
diagonalized with particular emphasis on superfluid phases. For the special
case of spin-independent hopping we analytically determine the number of
solutions of the resulting self-consistency equations and the nature of the
possible ground states at weak coupling. Numerical results for unbalanced
Fermi-mixtures are presented within the local density approximation. In
particular, we find a fascinating shell structure, involving normal and
superfluid phases. For the general case of spin-dependent hopping we calculate
the density of states and the possible superfluid phases in the ground state.
In particular, we find a new magnetized superfluid phase.
