We show a tensorial-computational way to find out conditions that must fulfil
an m-rank tensor in arbitrary dimension in order to be algebraically the
energy-momentum tensor of some field. We apply in this paper our method to
three 2-rank tensors: electromagnetic, mass less scalar field and perfect fluid
tensors. Finally we apply the Rainich theory to some examples.
