A way to increase the Scanning Thermal Microscope (SThM) sensitivity in the
harmonic 3w mode is to heat the probe with an AC current sufficiently high to
generate a coupling between the AC and the DC signals. We detail in this paper
how to properly take into account this coupling with a Wollaston-probe SThM. We
also show how to link correctly the thermal conductivity to the thermal
conductance measured by the SThM.
