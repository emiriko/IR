Orbifold groupoids have been recently widely used to represent both effective
and ineffective orbifolds. We show that every orbifold groupoid can be
faithfully represented on a continuous family of finite dimensional Hilbert
spaces. As a consequence we obtain the result that every orbifold groupoid is
Morita equivalent to the translation groupoid of an action of a bundle of
compact topological groups.
