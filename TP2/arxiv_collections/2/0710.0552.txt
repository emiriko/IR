We present an update on Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory projects for
Lattice QCD, which are by now run on apeNEXT. As a first issue, we discuss a
strategy to tackle finite size effects which can be quite sizeable in the
computation of logarithmically divergent renormalization constants. Our first
high loop determination of quark bilinears for Wilson fermions was limited to
finite constants and finite ratios. A precise determination of Z_P and Z_S (and
hence of Z_m) now becomes possible. We also give an account of computations for
actions different from the standard regularization we have taken into account
so far (Wilson gauge action and Wilson fermions). In particular, we present the
status of computations for the Lattice QCD regularization defined by tree level
Symanzik improved gauge action and Wilson fermions, which became quite popular
in recent times. We also take the chance to discuss the related topic of the
computation of the gluon and ghost propagators (which we undertook in
collaboration with another group). This is relevant in order to better
understand non-perturbative computations of propagators aiming at
qualitative/quantitative understanding of confinement.
