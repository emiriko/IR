We extracted and processed abstract data from the SFN annual meeting
abstracts during the period 2001-2006, using techniques and software from
natural language processing, database management, and data visualization and
analysis. An important first step in the process was the application of data
cleaning and disambiguation methods to construct a unified database, since the
data were too noisy to be of full utility in the raw form initially available.
The resulting co-author graph in 2006, for example, had 39,645 nodes (with an
estimated 6% error rate in our disambiguation of similar author names) and
13,979 abstracts, with an average of 1.5 abstracts per author, 4.3 authors per
abstract, and 5.96 collaborators per author (including all authors on shared
abstracts). Recent work in related areas has focused on reputational indices
such as highly cited papers or scientists and journal impact factors, and to a
lesser extent on creating visual maps of the knowledge space. In contrast,
there has been relatively less work on the demographics and community
structure, the dynamics of the field over time to examine major research trends
and the structure of the sources of research funding. In this paper we examined
each of these areas in order to gain an objective overview of contemporary
neuroscience. Some interesting findings include a high geographical
concentration of neuroscience research in north eastern United States, a
surprisingly large transient population (60% of the authors appear in only one
out of the six studied years), the central role played by the study of
neurodegenerative disorders in the neuroscience community structure, and an
apparent growth of behavioral/systems neuroscience with a corresponding
shrinkage of cellular/molecular neuroscience over the six year period.
