In this paper a quantum mechanical description of the assembly/disassembly
process for microtubules is proposed. We introduce creation and annihilation
operators that raise or lower the microtubule length by a tubulin layer.
Following that, the Hamiltonian and corresponding equations of motion for the
quantum fields are derived that describe the dynamics of microtubules. These
Heisenberg-type equations are then transformed to semi-classical equations
using the method of coherent structures. We find that the dynamics of a
microtubule can be mathematically expressed via a cubic-quintic nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation. We show that a vortex filament, a generic
solution of the NLS equation, exhibits linear growth/shrinkage in time as well
as temporal fluctuations about some mean value which is qualitatively similar
to the dynamic instability of microtubules.
