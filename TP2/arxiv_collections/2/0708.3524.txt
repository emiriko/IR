A macroscopic phase separation, in which ferromagnetic clusters are observed
in an insulating matrix, is sometimes observed, and believed to be essential to
the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) properties of manganese oxides. The
application of a magnetic field may indeed trigger large magnetoresistance
effects due to the percolation between clusters allowing the movement of the
charge carriers. However, this macroscopic phase separation is mainly related
to extrinsic defects or impurities, which hinder the long-ranged charge-orbital
order of the system. We show in the present article that rather than the
macroscopic phase separation, an homogeneous short-ranged charge-orbital order
accompanied by a spin glass state occurs, as an intrinsic result of the
uniformity of the random potential perturbation induced by the solid solution
of the cations on the $A$-sites of the structure of these materials. Hence the
phase separation does occur, but in a more subtle and interesting nanoscopic
form, here referred as ``homogeneous''. Remarkably, this ``nanoscale phase
separation'' alone is able to bring forth the colossal magnetoresistance in the
perovskite manganites, and is potentially relevant to a wide variety of other
magnetic and/or electrical properties of manganites, as well as many other
transition metal oxides, in bulk or thin film form as we exemplify throughout
the article.
