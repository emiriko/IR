Schizophrenia is a severe, currently incurable, relatively common mental
condition. Its symptoms are complex and widespread. It structurally and
functionally affects cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive,
emotional and motivational aspects of behavior. Its cause is unknown, its
diagnosis is based on statistical behavior and its treatment is elusive.
  Our paradigm addresses the complexity of schizophrenic symptoms. Building
upon recent neural vulnerability and limbic dysregulation hypotheses, it offers
a mathematical model for the evolution of the limbic system under perturbation.
Dependence on parameters and the concept of "bifurcation" could be the key to
understanding the threshold between "normality" and "disease".
