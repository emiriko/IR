We investigate the effect of quantum interferences and Coulomb interaction on
the counting statistics of electrons crossing a double quantum dot in a
parallel geometry using a generating function technique based on a quantum
master equation approach. The skewness and the average residence time of
electrons in the dots are shown to be the quantities most sensitive to
interferences and Coulomb coupling. The joint probabilities of consecutive
electron transfer processes show characteristic temporal oscillations due to
interference. The steady-state fluctuation theorem which predicts a universal
connection between the number of forward and backward transfer events is shown
to hold even in the presence of Coulomb coupling and interference.
