Diffuse X-ray data for mixed stack organic charge-transfer crystals
approaching the neutral-ionic phase transition can be quantitatively explained
as due to the softening of the optical phonon branch. The interpretation is
fully consistent with vibrational spectra, and underlines the importance of
electron-phonon coupling in low-dimensional systems with delocalized electrons.
