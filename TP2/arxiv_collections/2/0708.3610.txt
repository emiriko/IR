We perform the first study for the heavy-heavy-light quark (QQq) potential in
SU(3) lattice QCD. The calculations are done with the standard gauge and
$O(a)$-improved Wilson fermion action on the $16^4$ lattice at $\beta =6.0$ at
the quenched level. We calculate the energy of QQq systems as the function of
the distance between the two heavy quarks, and find that the QQq potential is
well described with a Coulomb plus linear potential form. Compared to the
static three-quark case, the Coulomb term does not change but the effective
string tension between the heavy quarks is significantly reduced by the
light-quark effect. We also investigate the light-quark mass dependence of the
QQq potential using the four hopping parameters, $\kappa
=0.1200,0.1300,0.1340$, and 0.1380. The reduction of the effective string
tension is considered to be a general property for baryons and multi-quark
hadrons.
