We performed optical-pump terahertz-probe measurements of a Mott insulator
YTiO$_{3}$ and a band semiconductor Si using a laser diode (1.47 eV) and a
femtosecond pulse laser (1.55 eV). Both samples possess long energy-relaxation
times (1.5 ms for YTiO$_{3}$ and 15 $\mu$s for Si); therefore, it is possible
to extract terahertz complex conductivities of photoinduced carriers under
equilibrium. We observed highly contrasting behavior - Drude conductivity in Si
and localized conductivity possibly obeying the Jonscher law in YTiO$_{3}$. The
carrier number at the highest carrier-concentration layer in YTiO$_{3}$ is
estimated to be 0.015 per Ti site. Anisotropic conductivity of YTiO$_{3}$ is
determined. Our study indicates that localized carriers might play an important
role in the incipient formation of photoinduced metallic phases in Mott
insulators. In addition, this study shows that the transfer-matrix method is
effective for extracting an optical constant of a sample with a spatially
inhomogeneous carrier distribution.
