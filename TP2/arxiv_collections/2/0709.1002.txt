We discuss signatures of bound-state formation in finite volume via the
Luscher finite size method. Assuming that the phase-shift formula in this
method inherits all aspects of the quantum scattering theory, we may expect
that the bound-state formation induces the sign of the scattering length to be
changed. If it were true, this fact provides us a distinctive identification of
a shallow bound state even in finite volume through determination of whether
the second lowest energy state appears just above the threshold. We also
consider the bound-state pole condition in finite volume, based on Luscher's
phase-shift formula and then find that the condition is fulfilled only in the
infinite volume limit, but its modification by finite size corrections is
exponentially suppressed by the spatial lattice size L. These theoretical
considerations are also numerically checked through lattice simulations to
calculate the positronium spectrum in compact scalar QED, where the short-range
interaction between an electron and a positron is realized in the Higgs phase.
