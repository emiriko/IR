A thin layer of overdense plasma is created when an electromagnetic pulse
interacts with a rapidly ionizing thin foil. This layer will reflect the
incoming pulse, forming a so-called plasma mirror. A simple realistic model
based on paired kinetic and wave equations is used to describe analytically the
process of mirror formation and the reflection and transmission of the incident
pulse. The model incorporates the exact description of the ionization process
in the foil and the polarization and conduction currents that follow. The
analytical description of the reflected and transmitted pulses as well as their
dependence on foil parameters, and initial pulse amplitude and form are
presented. Possible application and effectiveness of this process to improve
laser pulse contrast are discussed. In the case of the linearly polarized
incident pulse, there harmonic generation occurs, that is absent in the case of
the circular polarization. The spectra of the reflected pulses for different
initial forms and amplitudes are studied.
