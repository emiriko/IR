The purposes of the present article are: a) To show that non-locality leads
to the transfer of certain amounts of energy and angular momentum at very long
distances, in an absolutely strange and unnatural manner, in any model
reproducing the quantum mechanical results. b) To prove that non-locality is
the result only of the zero spin state assumption for distant particles, which
explains its presence in any quantum mechanical model. c) To reintroduce
locality, simply by denying the existence of the zero spin state in nature (the
so-called highly correlated, or EPR singlet state) for particles
non-interacting with any known field. d) To propose a realizable experiment to
clarify if two remote (and thus non-interacting with a known field) particles,
supposed to be correlated as in Bell-type experiments, are actually in zero
spin state.
