The amount of oxygen incorporated into MgB2 thin films upon exposure to
atmospheric gasses is found to depend strongly on the material's stoichiometry.
Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in oxygen
incorporation resulting from exposure to: (a) ambient atmosphere, (b) humid
atmospheres, (c) anneals in air and (d) anneals in oxygen. The study
investigated thin-film samples with compositions that were systematically
varied from Mg0.9B2 to Mg1.1B2. A significant surface oxygen contamination was
observed in all of these films. The oxygen content in the bulk of the film, on
the other hand, increased significantly only in Mg rich films and in films
exposed to humid atmospheres.
