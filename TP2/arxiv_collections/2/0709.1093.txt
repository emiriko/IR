We investigate the mass spectra of scalar and vector glueballs in the
so-called bottom-up approach of the AdS/QCD correspondence. The holographic
model of QCD includes a static dilaton background field. We study the
constraints on the masses coming from perturbing the dilaton field and the
geometry of the bulk.
