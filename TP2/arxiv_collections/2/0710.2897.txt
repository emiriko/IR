Searches for supersymmetry in the framework of R-parity conserving models
have been performed in data collected by the D0 detector at the Tevatron
$p\bar{p}$ collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. Topologies analyzed
consist of acoplanar-jets, multijets, and leptons with large missing transverse
energy in the final state. The 1 fb$^{-1}$ data shows good agreement with the
standard model expectations. The improved mass limits at 95% CL have been
derived. In the first search, generic squarks and gluinos productions are
investigated and lower limits of 375 GeV and 289 GeV are derived on the squarks
and gluino masses, respectively, with $\tan$($\beta$) = 3, $A_0$ = 0 and $\mu
<$ 0. In second analysis, squarks are searched for in a final state that has
$\tau$ leptons accompanied by jets and missing transverse energy. This channel
is explored for the first time at the Tevatron and excludes squark masses $<$
366 GeV. Supergravity inspired models suggest the existence of light
supersymmetric partners of the third generation quarks: a light stop for
moderate values of $\tan(\beta)$, a light sbottom for large $\tan(\beta)$. If
stop is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, the expected decay
channel is $\tilde{t} \to c \tilde{\chi}^0_1$ with $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ assumed
to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. Using this channel, stop masses $<$
149 GeV and neutralino masses $<$ 63 GeV are excluded. If there is a mass
hierarchy between stop, chargino and sneutrino masses, stop is expected to
decay via $\tilde{t} \to b l \tilde{\nu}$ where $l$ could be an electron or
muon. The search performed with both electrons, muons and dimuon final states
excludes stop mass $<$ 186 GeV for sneutrino mass of 71 GeV.
