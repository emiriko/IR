These are my notes for a talk at the The Tate Conjecture workshop at the
American Institute of Mathematics in Palo Alto, CA, July 23--July 27, 2007,
somewhat revised and expanded. The intent of the talk was to review what is
known and to suggest directions for research. v2: Revised expanded (24 pages).
