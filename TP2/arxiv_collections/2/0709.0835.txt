The three electromagnetic form factors of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance,
$G^*_M(q^2)$, $G^*_E(q^2)$, and $G^*_C(q^2)$ are obtained in the space-like
region using a Dual Resonance Model realization of QCD in the large $N_c$ limit
(Dual-${QCD}_{\infty}$). Each form factor involves a single free parameter
which is fixed by fitting data on $G^*_M(q^2)$, and on the ratios $R_{EM}(q^2)$
and $R_{SM}(q^2)$. Good agreement with experiment is obtained for all three
quantities. Results are then used to predict the $q^2$-dependence of the chiral
effective-field theory form factors $g_M(q^2)$, $g_E(q^2)$, and $g_C(q^2)$.
