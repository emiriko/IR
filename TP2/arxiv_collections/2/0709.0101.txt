We show that any finitely generated non-elementary Kleinian group has a
co-final family of finite index normal subgroups with respect to which it has
Property $\tau$. As a consequence, any closed hyperbolic 3-manifold has a
co-final family of finite index normal subgroups for which the infimal Heegaard
gradient is positive.
