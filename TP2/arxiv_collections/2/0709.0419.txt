The operator approach to analytical evaluation of multi-loop Feynman diagrams
is proposed. We show that the known analytical methods of evaluation of
massless Feynman integrals, such as the integration by parts method and the
method of "uniqueness" (which is based on the star-triangle relation), can be
drastically simplified by using this operator approach. To demonstrate the
advantages of the operator method of analytical evaluation of multi-loop
Feynman diagrams, we calculate ladder diagrams for the massless $\phi^3$ theory
(analytical results for these diagrams are expressed in terms of multiple
polylogarithms). It is shown how operator formalism can be applied to
calculation of certain massive Feynman diagrams and investigation of Lipatov
integrable chain model.
