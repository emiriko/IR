Engineering semiconductors to enhance carrier multiplication (CM) could lead
to increased photovoltaic cell performance and a significant widening of the
materials range suitable for future solar technologies. Semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) have been proposed as a favourable structure for CM
enhancement, and recent measurements by transient absorption have shown
evidence for highly efficient CM in lead chalcogenide and CdSe NCs. We report
here an assessment of CM yields in CdSe and CdTe NCs by a quantitative analysis
of biexciton and exciton signatures in transient photoluminescence decays.
Although the technique is particularly sensitive due to enhanced biexciton
radiative rates relative to the exciton, kradBX > 2 kradX, we find no evidence
for CM in CdSe and CdTe NCs up to photon energies E > 3 Eg, well above
previously reported relative energy thresholds.
