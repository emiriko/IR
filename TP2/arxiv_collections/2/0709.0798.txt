We study in this Letter the dynamical effects of the limited bandwidth of the
control electronics in a solid-state (Nd-YAG) ring laser gyroscope. We derive a
stability condition for the rotation-sensing regime in the case of a
first-order control loop, showing that the smallest measurable rotation speed
depends directly on the cutoff frequency value. Our experimental measurements
are in good agreement with this prediction.
