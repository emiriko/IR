We report X-ray irradiation-induced carrier doping effects on the electrical
conductivity in the organic dimer-Mott insulators $\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$$X$ with
$X =$ Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Cl and Cu$_{2}$(CN)$_{3}$. For
$\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Cl, we have observed a large decrease of the
resistivity by 40 % with the irradiation at 300 K and the metal-like
temperature dependence down to about 50 K. The irradiation-induced defects
expected at the donor molecule sites might cause a local imbalance of the
charge transfer in the crystal. Such molecular defects result in the effective
doping of carriers into the half-filled dimer-Mott insulators.
