Using numerical simulations, we show that a novel spontaneous transverse
response can appear when a longitudinal drive is applied to type-II
superconductors with honeycomb pinning arrays in a magnetic field near certain
filling fractions. This response is generated by dynamical symmetry breaking
that occurs at fields away from commensurability. We find a coherent strongly
amplified transverse switching effect when an additional transverse ac current
is applied. The transverse ac drive can also be used to control switching in
the longitudinal velocity response. We discuss how these effects could be used
to create new types of devices such as current effect transistors.
