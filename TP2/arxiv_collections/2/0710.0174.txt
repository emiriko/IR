We complete our analysis of Nf=2 QCD based on the lattice staggered fermion
formulation. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations at fixed (amq*Ls^yh) one
is able to test the universality class with given critical exponent yh. This
strategy has been used to test the O(4) universality class and it has been
presented at the previous Lattice conferences. No agreement was found with
simulations in the mass range amq=[0.01335,0.15] using lattices with Ls=16 up
to 32 and Lt=4. With the same strategy, we now investigate the possibility of a
first order transition using a new set of Monte Carlo data corresponding to
yh=3 in the same mass and volume range as the one used for O(4). A substantial
agreement is observed both in the specific heat scaling and in the scaling of
the chiral condensate, while the chiral susceptibilities still presents visible
deviation from scaling in the mass range explored.
