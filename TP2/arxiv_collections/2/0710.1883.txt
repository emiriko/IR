We revisit the implications of the R-invariant New Inflation model to the
supersymmetric standard model in light of recent discussion of gravitino
production processes by the decay of the inflaton or the supersymmetry breaking
field. We show that the models with supergravity mediation do not go well with
the R-invariant New Inflation model, where the gravitino abundance produced by
the decay of the inflaton or the supersymmetry breaking field significantly
exceeds the bounds from cosmological observations without fine-tuning. We also
show that the models with gauge mediation can go together with R-invariant New
Inflation model, where the dark matter and the baryon asymmetry are
consistently explained without severe fine-tuning.
