We study models in which supersymmetry breaking appears at an intermediate
scale, M_in, below the GUT scale. That is, that the soft supersymmetry-breaking
parameters of the MSSM are universal at M_in. We demand that the lightest
neutralino be the LSP, and that the relic neutralino density not conflict with
measurements by WMAP and others, and study the morphology of this constraint as
the universality scale is reduced from the GUT scale. At moderate values of
M_in, we find that the allowed regions of the (m_1/2,m_0) plane are squeezed by
the requirements of electroweak symmetry breaking and that the lightest
neutralino be the LSP, whereas the constraint on the relic density is less
severe. At very low M_in, the electroweak vacuum conditions become the dominant
constraint, and a secondary source of astrophysical cold dark matter would be
necessary to explain the measured relic density for nearly all values of the
soft SUSY-breaking parameters and tan(beta).
