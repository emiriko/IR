We have observed temperature-dependent reversal of the rectifying polarity in
Au/Nb:SrTiO3 Schottky junctions. By simulating current-voltage characteristics
we have found that the permittivity of SrTiO3 near the interface exhibits
temperature dependence opposite to that observed in the bulk, significantly
reducing the barrier width. At low temperature, tunneling current dominates the
junction transport due both to such barrier narrowing and to suppressed thermal
excitations. The present results demonstrate that novel junction properties can
be induced by the interface permittivity.
