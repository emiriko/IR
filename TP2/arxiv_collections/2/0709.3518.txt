We investigate the magnetic properties of the isostructural spinel-spinel
interface of NiMn2O4(NMO)-Fe3O4. Although the magnetic transition temperature
of the NMO film is preserved, both bulk and interface sensitive measurements
demonstrate that the interface exhibits strong interfacial magnetic coupling up
to room temperature. While NMO thin films have a ferrimagnetic transition
temperature of 60K, both NiFe2O4 and MnFe2O4 are ferrimagnetic at room
temperature. Our experimental results suggest that these magnetic properties
arise from a thin interdiffused region of (Fe,Mn,Ni)3O4 at the interface
leading to Mn and Ni magnetic properties similar to MnFe2O4 and NiFe2O4.
