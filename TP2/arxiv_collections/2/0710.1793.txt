The processes of exclusive photo- and electroproduction of vector mesons
$\rho^0$(770), $\phi$(1020) and $J/\psi$(3096) at collision energies $30
GeV<W<300 GeV$ and transferred momenta squared $0<-t<2 GeV^2$ are considered in
the framework of a phenomenological Regge-eikonal scheme with nonlinear Regge
trajectories in which their QCD asymptotic behavior is taken into account
explicitly. By comparison of available experimental data from ZEUS and H1
Collaborations with the model predictions it is demonstrated that corresponding
angular distributions and integrated cross-sections in the above-mentioned
kinematical range can be quantitatively described with use of two $C$-even
vacuum Regge trajectories. These are the "soft" pomeron dominating the high
energy reactions without a hard scale and the "hard" pomeron giving an
essential contribution to photo- and electroproduction of heavy vector mesons
and deeply virtual electroproduction of light vector mesons.
