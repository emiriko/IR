The critical behavior of the disordered ferromagnetic Ising model is studied
numerically by the Monte Carlo method in a wide range of variation of
concentration of nonmagnetic impurity atoms. The temperature dependences of
correlation length and magnetic susceptibility are determined for samples with
various spin concentrations and various linear sizes. The finite-size scaling
technique is used for obtaining scaling functions for these quantities, which
exhibit a universal behavior in the critical region; the critical temperatures
and static critical exponents are also determined using scaling corrections. On
the basis of variation of the scaling functions and values of critical
exponents upon a change in the concentration, the conclusion is drawn
concerning the existence of two universal classes of the critical behavior of
the diluted Ising model with different characteristics for weakly and strongly
disordered systems.
