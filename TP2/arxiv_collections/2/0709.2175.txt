We argue that quite unusual properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma in the RHIC
temperature domain $T=(1-2)T_c$ are consequences of the approximate equilibrium
between electric and magnetic sectors reached above the deconfinement
temperature. Already classical study of few body motion in a electric-magnetic
plasma shows abnormally large scattering rate due to the so called ``magnetic
bottle'' effect. Molecular dynamics simulation have found that equal mixture of
electric and magnetic quasiparticles do produce plasmas of small viscosity and
even smaller diffusion rate, comparable to what is needed to explain RHIC data
and also to what follows from AdS/CFT.
  As a separate issue, we point out that right above $T_c$ there should be
surviving s-wave baryons made of quarks ($N,\Delta$), as well as adjoint
objects, 3-gluon and 3-monopole chains (the latter being nothing else but
``calorons'' or finite-T instantons).
