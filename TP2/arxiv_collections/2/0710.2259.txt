We report the first optical study of CaAlSi, a superconductor which displays
both the crystal structure of MgB2 and the electronic band structure of
intercalated graphites. The reflectivity of a CaAlSi single crystal was
measured down to sub-THz frequencies and to 3.3 K, with the use of Coherent
Synchrotron Radiation. A superconducting gap in the hexagonal planes, two gaps
along the c axis were found and measured, as expected from the structure of the
CaAlSi Fermi surface. The anisotropic optical parameters of the normal state
were also determined.
