We have investigated the half-filling two-orbital Hubbard model on a
triangular lattice by means of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The
densities of states and optical conductivity clearly show the occurence of
metal-insulating transition (MIT) at U$_{c}$, U$_{c}$=18.2, 16.8, 6.12 and 5.85
for J=0, 0.01U, U/4 and U/3, respectively. The distinct continuities of double
occupation of electrons, local square moments and local susceptibility of the
charge, the spin and the orbital at J > 0 suggest that the MIT is the
first-order; however at J=0, the MIT is the second-order in the half-filling
two-orbital Hubbard model on triangular lattices. We attribute the first-order
nature of the MIT to the low symmetry of the systems with finite Hund's
coupling J.
