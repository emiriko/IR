Guided-wave atom interferometers measure interference effects using atoms
held in a confining potential. In one common implementation, the confinement is
primarily two-dimensional, and the atoms move along the nearly free dimension
under the influence of an off-resonant standing wave laser beam. In this
configuration, residual confinement along the nominally free axis can introduce
a phase gradient to the atoms that limits the arm separation of the
interferometer. We experimentally investigate this effect in detail, and show
that it can be alleviated by having the atoms undergo a more symmetric motion
in the guide. This can be achieved by either using additional laser pulses or
by allowing the atoms to freely oscillate in the potential. Using these
techniques, we demonstrate interferometer measurement times up to 72 ms and arm
separations up to 0.42 mm with a well controlled phase, or times of 0.91 s and
separations of 1.7 mm with an uncontrolled phase.
