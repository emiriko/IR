We study minimal surfaces in generic sub-Riemannian manifolds with
sub-Riemannian structures of co-rank one. These surfaces can be defined as the
critical points of the so-called {\it horizontal} area functional associated to
the canonical {\it horizontal} area form. We derive the intrinsic equation in
the general case and then consider in greater detail 2-dimensional surfaces in
contact manifolds of dimension 3. We show that in this case minimal surfaces
are projections of a special class of 2-dimensional surfaces in the horizontal
spherical bundle over the base manifold. Generic singularities of minimal
surfaces turn out the singularities of this projection, and we give a complete
local classification of them. We illustrate our results by examples in the
Heisenberg group and the group of roto-translations
