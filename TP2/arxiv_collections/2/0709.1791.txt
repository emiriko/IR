We report on the growth and properties of high quality bicolor oxide
superlattices, composed of two perovskites out of BaTiO3, CaTiO3, and SrTiO3.
The artificially grown superlattices are structurally unique and have a
macroscopically homogeneous phase, which is not feasible to recreate in bulk
form. By artificial structuring, it is found that the polarization of such
superlattices can be highly increased as compared to pseudo-binary ceramics
with the same overall composition. Such strong enhancement in superlattice is
attributed to newly-developed ionic motions of A-site cations at the
hetero-interfaces due to the interfacial coupling of electrostatic and elastic
interactions, which cannot be found in single phase materials.
