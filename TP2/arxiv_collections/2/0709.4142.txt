We present micro-rheological measurments of the drag force on colloids pulled
through a solution of lambda-DNA (used here as a monodisperse model polymer)
with an optical tweezer. The experiments show a violation of the
Stokes-Einstein relation based on the independently measured viscosity of the
DNA solution: the drag force is larger than expected. We attribute this to the
accumulation of DNA infront of the colloid and the reduced DNA density behind
the colloid. This hypothesis is corroborated by a simple drift-diffusion model
for the DNA molecules, which reproduces the experimental data surprisingly
well, as well as by corresponding Brownian dynamics simulations.
