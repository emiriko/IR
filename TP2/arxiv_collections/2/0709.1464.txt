Conventional lattice Boltzmann models only satisfy moment isotropy up to
fourth order. In order to accurately describe improtant physical effects beyond
the isothermal Navier-Stokes fluid regime, higher order isotropy is required.
In this paper, we present some basic results on moment isotropy and its
relationship to the rotational symmetry of a generating discrete vector set.
The anslysis provides a geometric understanding for popular lattice Boltzmann
models, while offering a systematic procedure to construct higher order models.
