Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be holomorphic self-maps of the unit polydisc $U^n$ in
the $n$-dimensional complex space, and denote by $C_{\phi}$ and $C_{\psi}$ the
induced composition operators. This paper gives some simple estimates of the
essential norm for the difference of composition operators $C_{\phi}-C_{\psi}$
from Bloch space to bounded holomorphic function space in the unit polydisc.
Moreover the compactness of the difference is also characterized.
