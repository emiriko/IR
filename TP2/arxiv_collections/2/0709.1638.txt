In the Brans-Dicke theory the Planck mass is replaced by a dynamical scalar
field. We consider here the supersymmetric analogous of this mechanism
replacing in the supergravity Lagrangian the Planck mass with a chiral
superfield. This analysis is motivated by the research of possible connections
between supersymmetric Dark Matter scenarios and Dark Energy models based on
Brans-Dicke-like theories. We find that, contrary to the original Brans-Dicke
theory, in its supersymmetric analogous the gravitational sector does not
couple to the matter sector in a universal metric way. As a result, violations
of the weak equivalence principle could be present in such a scenario.
