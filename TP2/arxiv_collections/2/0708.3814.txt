We extend BCCNR's flavored KW and KS geometries into the negative coupling
constant region and try giving physical explanations from the dual gauge theory
side. We show that, in the extended region, except the coupling constant being
negative, all other fields of the super-gravity theory having good properties
which can be described by the dual gauge theory.
