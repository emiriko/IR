We experimentally study the effect of enhancement of localization in weak
one-dimensional random potentials. Our experimental setup is a single mode
waveguide with 100 tuneable scatterers periodically inserted into the
waveguide. By measuring the amplitudes of transmitted and reflected waves in
the spacing between each pair of scatterers, we observe a strong decrease of
the localization length when white-noise scatterers are replaced by a
correlated arrangement of scatterers.
