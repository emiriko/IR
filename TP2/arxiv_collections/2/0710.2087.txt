We perform a systematic study of sneutrino production and decays in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with slepton generation mixing. We
study bosonic decays like sneutrino \to slepton^- + W^+/H^+ as well as
fermionic ones. We show that the effect of slepton generation mixing on the
sneutrino production and decays can be quite large in a significant part of the
MSSM parameter space despite the very strong experimental limits on lepton
flavour violating processes. This could have an important impact on the search
for sneutrinos and the determination of the MSSM parameters at future
colliders, such as LHC, ILC, CLIC and muon collider.
