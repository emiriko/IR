The photon polarization in radiative decays B -> Y gamma is known to be a
subtle probe of the effective Lagrangian structure and possible New Physics
effects. We discuss exclusive decay mode B -> phi K gamma where the
experimentally distinct final state makes analysis especially promising. The
possibility to extract information on the photon polarization out of the data
entirely depends on the partial waves interference pattern in the phi K system.
