The renormalization of the chiral np interaction in the 1S0 channel to N3LO
in Weinberg counting for the long distance potential with one single momentum
and energy independent counterterm is carried out. This renormalization scheme
yields finite and unique results and is free of short distance off-shell
ambiguities. We observe good convergence in the entire elastic range below pion
production threshold and find that there are some small physical effects
missing in the purely pionic chiral NN potential with or without inclusion of
explicit Delta degrees of freedom. We also study the renormalizability of the
standard Weinberg counting at NLO and N2LO when a momentum dependent polynomial
counterterm is included. Our numerical results suggest that the inclusion of
this counterterm does not yield a convergent amplitude (at NLO and N2LO).
