It is known that silicon is an indirect band gap material, reducing its
efficiency in photovoltaic applications. Using surface plasmons in metallic
nanoparticles embedded in a solar cell has recently been proposed as a way to
increase the efficiency of thin film silicon solar cells. The dipole mode that
dominates the plasmons in small particles produces an electric field having
Fourier components with all wave numbers. In this work, we show that such a
field creates electron-hole-pairs without phonon assistance, and discuss the
importance of this effect compared to radiation from the particle and losses
due to heating.
