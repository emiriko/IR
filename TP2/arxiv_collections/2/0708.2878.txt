We have used two types of thermometry to study thermal fluctuations in a
microcantilever-based system below 1 K. We measured the temperature of a
cantilever's macroscopic degree-of-freedom (via the Brownian motion of its
lowest flexural mode) and its microscopic degrees-of-freedom (via the electron
temperature of a metal sample mounted on the cantilever). We also measured both
temperatures' response to a localized heat source. We find it possible to
maintain thermal equilibrium between these two temperatures and a refrigerator
down to at least 300 mK. These results are promising for ongoing experiments to
probe quantum effects using micromechanical devices.
