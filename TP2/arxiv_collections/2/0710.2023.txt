The time evolution of Earth with her cities, languages and countries is
considered in terms of the multiplicative noise and the fragmentation-
processes, where the related families, size distributions, lifetimes,
bilinguals, etc. are studied. Earlier we treated the cities and the languages
differently (and as connected; languages split since cities split, etc.).
Hence, two dis- tributions are obtained in the same computation at the same
time. The same approach is followed here and Pareto-Zipf law for the
distribution of the cities, log-normal for the languages, decreasing
exponential for the city families (countries) in the rank order over
population, and power law -2 for the language families over the number of
languages in rank order are obtained theoretically in this combination for the
first time (up to our knowledge) in the literature; all of which are in good
agreement with the present empirical data.
