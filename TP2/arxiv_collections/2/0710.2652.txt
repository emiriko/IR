In this paper we prove that the Grosse-Wulkenhaar type non-commutative
orientable complex scalar $\phi^6_3$ theory, with two non-commutative
coordinates and the third one commuting with the other two, is renormalizable
to all orders in perturbation theory. Our proof relies on a multiscale analysis
in x space.
