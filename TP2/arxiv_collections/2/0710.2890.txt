A model of spin torque induced magnetization dynamics based upon
semi-classical spin diffusion theory for a single layer nanocontact is
presented. The model incorporates effects due to the current induced Oersted
field and predicts the generation of a variety of spatially dependent,
coherent, precessional magnetic wave structures. Directionally controllable
collimated spin wave beams, vortex spiral waves, and localized standing waves
are found to be excited by the interplay of the Oersted field and the
orientation of an applied field. These fields act as a spin wave ``corral''
around the nanocontact that controls the propagation of spin waves in certain
directions.
