We have performed Monte Carlo studies of the 3D random field XY model on $L
\times L \times L$ simple cubic lattices, with random field strengths of $h_r$
= 1 and 2. We present results for the angle-averaged magnetic structure factor,
$S (k)$ at $L = 64$. Our results appear to indicate a phase transition into a
ferromagnetic state. This is made possible by the existence of a Griffiths
singularity. It appears that at the phase transition $M^2$ jumps to zero
discontinuously, with a latent heat which is probably subextensive.
