We examine an evolutionary naming-game model where communicating agents are
equipped with an evolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of
biological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a
small change of a model control parameter a poorly communicating group of
linguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating
group with large learning abilities. When learning ability is kept fixed, the
transition appears to be continuous. Genetic imprinting of the learning
abilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents
learn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary
pressure for the increase of learning ability.Our model suggests that when
linguistic (or cultural) processes became intensive enough, a transition took
place where both linguistic performance and biological endowment of our species
experienced an abrupt change that perhaps triggered the rapid expansion of
human civilization.
