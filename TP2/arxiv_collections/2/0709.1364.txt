We present the first estimate of the gluon-gluon fusion process, gg->4f, in
the high energy domain as a probe of the electroweak symmetry breaking
mechanism (EWSB). We consider the exact matrix element at
$O(\alpha_s\alpha_{em}^2)$, and we include all irreducible background coming
from qq->4f. Purely leptonic final states, pp->llvv, are numerically
investigated. We find that this channel is extremely sensitive to the regime of
the interaction between gauge bosons. It can thus be associated to the
traditionally used vector boson scattering (VBS) to improve the analysis of the
EWSB physics.
