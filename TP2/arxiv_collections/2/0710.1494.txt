We study clustering in a stochastic system of particles sliding down a
fluctuating surface in one and two dimensions. In steady state, the
density-density correlation function is a scaling function of separation and
system size.This scaling function is singular for small argument -- it exhibits
a cusp singularity for particles with mutual exclusion, and a divergence for
noninteracting particles. The steady state is characterized by giant
fluctuations which do not damp down in the thermodynamic limit. The
autocorrelation function is a singular scaling function of time and system
size. The scaling properties are surprisingly similar to those for particles
moving in a quenched disordered environment that results if the surface is
frozen.
