Coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom are important in
geometrically frustrated magnets where they can lead to degeneracy lifting and
novel orders. We show that moderate spin-lattice couplings in triangular and
Kagome antiferromagnets can induce complex colinear magnetic orders. When
classical Heisenberg spins on the triangular lattice are coupled to Einstein
phonons, a rich variety of phases emerge, including the experimentally observed
four sublattice state and the five sublattice 1/5th plateau state seen in the
magneto-electric material CuFeO$_2$. In addition we predict magnetization
plateaus at 1/3, 3/7, 1/2, 3/5 and 5/7 at these couplings. Strong spin-lattice
couplings induce a striped colinear state, seen in $\alpha$-NaFeO$_2$ and
MnBr$_2$. On the Kagome lattice, moderate spin-lattice couplings induce
colinear order, but an extensive degeneracy remains.
