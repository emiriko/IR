In this paper, a methodology for designing efficient energy scavengers is
proposed. The scavenger consists of a cantilever beam on which piezoelectric
films and a mass are mounted. The mass at the tip of the beam is known as the
proof mass and the device is called either an energy scavenger or a beam-mass
system. The proof mass is a permanent magnet, where in its vicinity attracting
permanent magnets are placed. It is shown that when the magnets have
appropriate strengths and are placed appropriately, the vibration of the
beam-mass system can be amplified, thereby the scavenged energy is increased.
Examples are given throughout the paper.
