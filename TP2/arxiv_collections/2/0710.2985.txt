Standard active--sterile neutrino oscillations do not provide a satisfactory
description of the LSND evidence for neutrino oscillations together with the
constraints from MiniBooNE and other null-result short-baseline oscillation
experiments. However, if the mass or the mixing of the sterile neutrino depends
in an exotic way on its energy all data become consistent. I explore the
phenomenological consequences of the assumption that either the mass or the
mixing scales with the neutrino energy as $1/E_\nu^r (r > 0)$. Since the
neutrino energy in LSND is about 40 MeV, whereas MiniBooNE operates at around 1
GeV, oscillations get suppressed in MiniBooNE and the two results become fully
compatible for $r\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, also the global fit of all relevant
data improves significantly by exploring the different energy regimes of the
various experiments. The best fit $\chi^2$ decreases by 12.7 (14.1) units with
respect to standard sterile neutrino oscillations if the mass (mixing) scales
with energy.
