We calculate the collisional energy loss of a muon of high energy $E$ in a
hot QED plasma beyond logarithmic accuracy, i.e., we determine the constant
terms of order O(1) in $-dE/dx \propto \ln{E}+ O(1)$. Considering first the
$t$-channel contribution to $-dE/dx$, we show that the terms $\sim O(1)$ are
sensitive to the full kinematic region for the momentum exchange $q$ in elastic
scattering, including large values $q \sim O(E)$. We thus redress a previous
calculation by Braaten and Thoma, which assumed $q << E$ and could not find the
correct constant (in the large $E$ limit). The relevance of 'very hard'
momentum transfers then requires, for consistency, that $s$ and $u$-channel
contributions from Compton scattering must be included, bringing a second
modification to the Braaten-Thoma result. Most importantly, Compton scattering
yields an additional large logarithm in $-dE/dx$. Our results might have
implications in the QCD case of parton collisional energy loss in a quark gluon
plasma.
