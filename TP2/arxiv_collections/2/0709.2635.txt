Data transfer and staging services are common components in Grid-based, or
more generally, in service-oriented applications. Security mechanisms play a
central role in such services, especially when they are deployed in sensitive
application fields like e-health. The adoption of WS-Security and related
standards to SOAP-based transfer services is, however, problematic as a
straightforward adoption of SOAP with MTOM introduces considerable
inefficiencies in the signature generation process when large data sets are
involved. This paper proposes a non-blocking, signature generation approach
enabling a stream-like processing with considerable performance enhancements.
