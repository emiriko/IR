Finite automata with weights in the max-plus semiring are considered. The
main result is: it is decidable in an effective way whether a series that is
recognized by a finitely ambiguous max-plus automaton is unambiguous, or is
sequential. A collection of examples is given to illustrate the hierarchy of
max-plus series with respect to ambiguity.
