We demonstrate a formally exact quantum-classical correspondence between the
stationary coherent states associated with the commensurate anisotropic
two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the classical Lissajous orbits. Our
derivation draws upon earlier work of Louck et al [1973 \textit {J. Math.
Phys.} \textbf {14} 692] wherein they have provided a non-bijective canonical
transformation that maps, within a degenerate eigenspace, the commensurate
anisotropic oscillator on to the isotropic oscillator. This mapping leads, in a
natural manner, to a Schwinger realization of SU(2) in terms of the canonically
transformed creation and annihilation operators. Through the corresponding
coherent states built over a degenerate eigenspace, we directly effect the
classical limit via the expectation values of the underlying generators. Our
work completely accounts for the fact that the SU(2) coherent state in general
corresponds to an ensemble of Lissajous orbits.
