A new method for efficiently generating an isolated single-cycle attosecond
pulse is proposed. It is shown that the ultraviolet (UV) attosecond pulse can
be utilized as a robust tool to control the dynamics of electron wave packets
(EWPs). By adding a UV attosecond pulse to an infrared (IR) few-cycle pulse at
a proper time, only one return of the EWP to the parent ion is selected to
effectively contribute to the harmonics, then an isolated two-cycle 130-as
pulse with a bandwidth of 45 eV is obtained. After complementing the chirp, an
isolated single-cycle attosecond pulse with a duration less than 100 as seems
achievable. In addition, the contribution of the quantum trajectories can be
selected by adjusting the delay between the IR and UV fields. Using this
method, the harmonic and attosecond pulse yields are efficiently enhanced in
contrast to the scheme [G. Sansone {\it et al.}, Science {\bf314}, 443 (2006)]
using a few-cycle IR pulse in combination with the polarization gating
technique.
