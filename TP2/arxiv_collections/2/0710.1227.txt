Electromagnetic metamaterials are a class of materials which have been
artificially structured on a subwavelength scale. They are currently the focus
of a great deal of interest because they allow access to previously
unrealisable properties like a negative refractive index. Most metamaterial
designs have so far been based on resonant elements, like split rings, and
research has concentrated on microwave frequencies and above. In this work, we
present the first experimental realisation of a non-resonant metamaterial
designed to operate at zero frequency. Our samples are based on a
recently-proposed template for an anisotropic magnetic metamaterial consisting
of an array of superconducting plates. Magnetometry experiments show a strong,
adjustable diamagnetic response when a field is applied perpendicular to the
plates. We have calculated the corresponding effective permeability, which
agrees well with theoretical predictions. Applications for this metamaterial
may include non-intrusive screening of weak DC magnetic fields.
