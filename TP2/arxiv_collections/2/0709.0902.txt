Electrical and magnetic properties of underdoped cuprates in the spin gap
phase, a precursor to high Tc superconducting state, is riddled with puzzles.
We propose a novel reference state to study this phase, where each hole dopant
adds one real holon and one real spinon, with Haldane exclusion statistics
$g_{\rm h} =1$ and $g_{\rm s} = {1/2}$, to a fairly inert (pseudo gaped) spin
liquid vacuum, resulting in a low density spin-charge liquid. Spins and charges
interact and form a novel collective state, a \textit{3/2-Fermi liquid}. A
holon pairs with a spinon; this hole like fermion composite carries charge +e
and a spin-\hlf moment and novel exclusion statistics $g_{\rm hole} = {3/2}$.
We explain an anomalous expansion of Fermi sea area by 3/2, seen in recent
quantum oscillation experiments at two different dopings.
