We analyse the influence of current induced torques on the magnetization
configuration of a ferromagnet in a circuit containing a compensated
antiferromagnet. We argue that these torques are generically non-zero and
support this conclusion with a microscopic NEGF calculation for a circuit
containing antiferromagnetic NiMn and ferromagnetic Co layers. Because of
symmetry dictated differences in the form of the current-induced torque, the
phase diagram which expresses the dependence of ferromagnet configuration on
current and external magnetic field differs qualitatively from its
ferromagnet-only counterpart.
