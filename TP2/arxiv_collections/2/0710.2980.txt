The present paper establishes characteristics of the relative magnetic
permeability spectrum $\mu$(f) of magnetic materials at microwave frequencies.
The integral of the imaginary part of $\mu$(f) multiplied with the frequency f
gives remarkable properties. A generalisation of Snoek's law consists in this
quantity being bounded by the square of the saturation magnetization multiplied
with a constant. While previous results have been obtained in the case of
non-conductive materials, this work is a generalization to ferromagnetic
materials and ferromagnetic-based composites with significant skin effect. The
influence of truncating the summation to finite upper frequencies is
investigated, and estimates associated to the finite summation are provided. It
is established that, in practice, the integral does not depend on the damping
model under consideration. Numerical experiments are performed in the exactly
solvable case of ferromagnetic thin films with uniform magnetization, and these
numerical experiments are found to confirm our theoretical results. Microwave
permeability measurements on soft amorphous films are reported. The relation
between the integral and the saturation magnetization is verified
experimentally, and some practical applications of the theoretical results are
introduced. The integral can be used to determine the average magnetization
orientation in materials with complex configurations of the magnetization, and
furthermore to demonstrate the accuracy of microwave measurement systems. For
certain applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility or radar absorbing
materials, the relations established herein provide useful indications for the
design of efficient materials, and simple figures of merit to compare the
properties measured on various materials.
