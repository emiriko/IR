Quantum coherence conservation is shown to be achieved by a very high rate of
dissipation of an environmental system coupled with a principal system. This
effect is not in the list of previously-known strategies of noise suppression,
such as Zeno effect, dynamical decoupling, quantum error correction code, and
decoherence free subspace. An analytical solution is found for a simplified
model of a single qubit coupled with an environmental single qubit dissipating
rapidly. We also show examples of coherence conservation in a spin-boson linear
coupling model with a numerical evaluation.
