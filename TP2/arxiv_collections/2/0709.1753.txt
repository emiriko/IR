The spectrum and the circular polarization of radiation from longitudinally
polarized high-energy electrons in oriented single crystal are considered using
the method which permits inseparable consideration of both the coherent and the
incoherent mechanisms of photon emission. The spectral and polarization
properties of radiation are obtained and analyzed. It is found that in some
part of spectral distribution the influence of multiple scattering (the
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect) attains the order of 7 percent. The
same is true for the influence of multiple scattering on the polarization part
of the radiation intensity. The degree of circular polarization of total
intensity of radiation is found. It is shown that the influence of multiple
scattering on the photon polarization is similar to the influence of the LPM
effect on the total intensity of radiation: it appears only for relatively low
energies of radiating electron and has the order of 1 percent, while at higher
energies the crystal field action excludes the LPM effect.
