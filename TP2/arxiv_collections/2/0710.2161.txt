We explore the effect of spatiotemporally varying substrate temperature
profiles on the dynamics and resulting reaction rate enhancement for the
catalytic oxidation of CO on Pt(110). The catalytic surface is "addressed" by a
focused laser beam whose motion is computer-controlled. The averaged reaction
rate is observed to undergo a characteristic maximum as a function of the speed
of this moving laser spot. Experiments as well as modelling are used to explore
and rationalize the existence of such an optimal laser speed.
