International Linear Collider (ILC) is an electron-positron collider with the
initial center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV which is upgradable to about 1 TeV
later on. Its goal is to study the physics at TeV scale with unprecedented high
sensitivities. The main topics include precision measurements of the Higgs
particle properties, studies of supersymmtric particles and the underlying
theoretical structure if supersymmetry turns out to be realized in nature,
probing alternative possibilities for the origin of mass, and the cosmological
connections thereof. In many channels, Higgs and leptonic sector in particular,
ILC is substantially more sensitive than LHC, and is complementary to LHC
overall. In this short article, we will have a quick look at the capabilities
of ILC.
