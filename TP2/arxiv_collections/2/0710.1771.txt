Motivated by the existence of remarkably ordered cluster arrays of bacteria
colonies growing in Petri dishes and related problems, we study the spontaneous
emergence of clustering and patterns in a simple nonequilibrium system: the
individual-based interacting Brownian bug model. We map this discrete model
into a continuous Langevin equation which is the starting point for our
extensive numerical analyses. For the two-dimensional case we report on the
spontaneous generation of localized clusters of activity as well as a
melting/freezing transition from a disordered or isotropic phase to an ordered
one characterized by hexagonal patterns. We study in detail the analogies and
differences with the well-established Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young
theory of equilibrium melting, as well as with another competing theory. For
that, we study translational and orientational correlations and perform a
careful defect analysis. We find a non standard one-stage, defect-mediated,
transition whose nature is only partially elucidated.
