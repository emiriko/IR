We study the energy distribution of ultrarelativistic electrons produced when
a beam of 33 TeV Pb$^{81+}$(1s) ions penetrates a thin Al foil. We show that,
because of a prominent role of the excitations of the ions inside the foil
which becomes possible due to the relativistic time dilatation, the width of
this distribution can be much narrower compared to the case when the ions
interact with rarefied gaseous targets. We also show that a very similar shape
of the energy distribution may arise when 33 TeV Pb$^{82+}$ ions penetrate a
thin Au foil. These results shed some light on the origin of the very narrow
electron energy distributions observed experimentally about a decade ago.
