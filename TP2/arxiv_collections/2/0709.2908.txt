Over the past two years we have improved several of the (Mordell-Weil) rank
records for elliptic curves over Q and nonconstant elliptic curves over Q(t).
For example, we found the first example of a curve E/Q with 28 independent
points P_i in E(Q) (the previous record was 24, by R.Martin and W.McMillen
2000), and the first example of a curve over Q with Mordell-Weil group
isomorphic with (Z/2Z) x Z^18 (the previous rank record for a curve with a
2-torsion point was 15, by Dujella 2002). In these lectures we give some of the
background, theory, and computational tools that led to these new records and
related applications.
  I Context and overview: the theorems of Mordell(-Weil) and Mazur; the rank
problem; the approaches of Neron--Shioda and Mestre; elliptic surfaces and
Neron specialization; fields other than Q.
  II Elliptic surfaces and K3 surfaces: the Mordell-Weil and Neron-Severi
groups; K3 surfaces of high Neron-Severi rank and their moduli; an elliptic K3
surface over Q of Mordell-Weil rank 17. Some other applications of K3 surfaces
of high rank and their moduli.
  III Computational issues, techniques, and results: slices of Niemeier
lattices; finding and transforming models of K3 surfaces of high rank;
searching for good specializations. Summary of new rank records for elliptic
curves.
