We propose a feasible scheme for generation of strongly non-Gaussian states
using the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. The resultant states are highly
non-classical states of electromagnetic field and exhibit negativity of their
Wigner function, sub-Poissonian photon statistics, and amplitude squeezing.
Furthermore, the Wigner function has a distinctly pronounced ``banana'' or
``crescent'' shape specific for the Kerr-type interactions, which so far was
not demonstrated experimentally. We show that creating and detecting such
states should be possible with the present technology using electromagnetically
induced transparency in a four-level atomic system in N-configuration.
