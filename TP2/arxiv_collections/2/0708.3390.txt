We consider the Hilbert scheme Hilb^{d+1}(C^d) of (d+1) points in affine
d-space C^d (d > 2), which includes the square of any maximal ideal. We
describe equations for the most symmetric affine open subscheme of
Hilb^{d+1}(C^d), in terms of Schur modules. In addition we prove that
Hilb^{d+1}(C^d) is reducible for n>d>11.
