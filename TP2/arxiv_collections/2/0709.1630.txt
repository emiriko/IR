In a recently archived paper by Zhang\cite{Zhang}, it is claimed that before
turnaround in a cyclic model two unexpected events happen: (1) black holes
cease to contract and begin to expand; (2) separated causal patches start to
reconnect. We show that both conclusions are erroneous and result from the
author's choice of variables.
