We study the exclusive production of pi-pi and rho-pi in hard gamma* gamma
scattering in the forward kinematical region where the virtuality of one photon
provides us with a hard scale in the process. The newly introduced concept of
Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDA) is used to perform a QCD calculation
of these reactions thanks to two simple models for TDAs. The sizable cross
sections for rho-pi and pi-pi production may be tested at intense
electron-positron colliders such as CLEO and B factories (Belle and BaBar).
