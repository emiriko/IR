We study competition between the Kondo effect and superconductivity in a
single self-assembled InAs quantum dot contacted with Al lateral electrodes.
Due to Kondo enhancement of Andreev reflections the zero-bias anomaly develops
sidepeaks, separated by the superconducting gap energy Delta. For ten valleys
of different Kondo temperature T_K we tune the gap Delta with an external
magnetic field. We find that the zero-bias conductance in each case collapses
onto a single curve with Delta/kT_K as the only relevant energy scale,
providing experimental evidence for universal scaling in this system.
