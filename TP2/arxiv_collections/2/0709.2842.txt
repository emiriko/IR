We present a set of inner boundary conditions for the numerical construction
of dynamical black hole space-times, when employing a 3+1 constrained evolution
scheme and an excision technique. These inner boundary conditions are
heuristically motivated by the dynamical trapping horizon framework and are
enforced in an elliptic subsystem of the full Einstein equation. In the
stationary limit they reduce to existing isolated horizon boundary conditions.
A characteristic analysis completes the discussion of inner boundary conditions
for the radiative modes.
