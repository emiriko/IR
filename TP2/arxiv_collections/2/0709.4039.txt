The \tau -> (\omega, \phi)P^-\nu decays, where P^-=\pi^-, K^-, are considered
within a phenomenological model with dominance of meson intermediate states. We
assume SU(3) flavor symmetry to fix some of the unknown strong interaction
couplings. Our predictions for the \tau -> \phi (\pi^-, K^-)\nu branching
fractions are in good agreement with recent measurements of the BABAR and BELLE
Collaborations.
