Motivated by the prospect of an optical frequency standard based on 43Ca+, we
calculate the blackbody radiation (BBR) shift of the 4s_1/2-3d_5/2 clock
transition, which is a major component of the uncertainty budget. The
calculations are based on the relativistic all-order single-double method where
all single and double excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave function are included
to all orders of perturbation theory. Additional calculations are conducted for
the dominant contributions in order to evaluate some omitted high-order
corrections and estimate the uncertainties of the final results. The BBR shift
obtained for this transition is 0.38(1) Hz. The tensor polarizability of the
3d_5/2 level is also calculated and its uncertainty is evaluated as well. Our
results are compared with other calculations.
