A property associated with a vortex structure becomes evident from an
analysis of confinement phenomena of magnetic oscillations in a quasi-2D
ferrite disk with a dominating role of magnetic-dipolar
(non-exchange-interaction) spectra. The vortices are guaranteed by the chiral
edge states of magnetic-dipolar modes which result in appearance of eigen
electric moments oriented normally to the disk plane. Due to the
eigen-electric-moment properties, a ferrite disk placed in a microwave cavity
is strongly affected by the cavity RF electric field with a clear evidence for
multi-resonance oscillations. For different cavity parameters, one may observe
the "resonance absorption" and "resonance repulsion" behaviors.
