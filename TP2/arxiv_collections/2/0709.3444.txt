In their book Rapoport and Zink constructed rigid analytic period spaces for
Fontaine's filtered isocrystals, and period morphisms from moduli spaces of
p-divisible groups to some of these period spaces. We determine the image of
these period morphisms, thereby contributing to a question of Grothendieck. We
give examples showing that only in rare cases the image is all of the
Rapoport-Zink period space.
