A cranking harmonic oscillator model, widely used for the physics of fast
rotating nuclei and Bose-Einstein condensates, is re-investigated in the
context of PT-symmetry. The instability points of the model are identified as
exceptional points. It is argued that - even though the Hamiltonian appears
hermitian at first glance - it actually is not hermitian within the region of
instability.
