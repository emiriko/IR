We study the heavy-heavy-light quark ($QQq$) system in a non-relativistic
potential model, and investigate the quark motional effect on the
inter-two-quark potential in baryons. We adopt the Hamiltonian with the static
three-quark potential which is obtained by the first-principle calculation of
lattice QCD, rather than the two-body force in ordinary quark models. Using the
renormalization-group inspired variational method in discretized space, we
calculate the ground-state energy of $QQq$ systems and the light-quark spatial
distribution. We find that the effective string tension between the two heavy
quarks is reduced compared to the static three-quark case. This reduction of
the effective string tension originates from the geometrical difference between
the inter-quark distance and the flux-tube length, and is conjectured to be a
general property for baryons.
