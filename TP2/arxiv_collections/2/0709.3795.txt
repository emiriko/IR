Analysis of the effects of decoherence on the radiative and squeezing
properties of a coherently driven two-level atom trapped in a resonant cavity
applying the corresponding master equation is presented. The atomic dynamics as
well as the squeezing and statistical properties of the emitted radiation are
investigated. It is found that the atom stays in the lower energy level more
often at steady state irrespective of the strength of the coherent radiation
and thermal fluctuations entering the cavity. Moreover, a strong external
coherent radiation results the splitting of the line of the emission spectrum,
whereas the decoherence broadens the width and significantly decreases the
height. It is also found that the emitted radiation exhibits photon
anti-bunching, super-Poissonian photon statistics and squeezing, despite the
presence of the decoherence which is expected to destroy the quantum features.
