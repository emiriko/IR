We show that the magnetic anisotropy energy of antiferromagnetic ferrihydrite
depends on the square root of the nanoparticles volume, using a method based on
the analysis of statistical distributions. The size distribution was obtained
by transmission electron microscopy, and the anisotropy energy distributions
were obtained from ac magnetic susceptibility and magnetic relaxation. The
square root dependence corresponds to random local anisotropy, whose average is
given by its variance, and can be understood in terms of the recently proposed
single phase homogeneous structure of ferrihydrite.
