We analyze the spin-resolved full counting statistics of electron transfer
through an ultrasmall quantum dot coupled to metallic electrodes. Modelling the
setup by the Anderson Hamiltonian, we explicitly take into account the onsite
Coulomb repulsion $U$. We calculate the cumulant generating function for the
probability to transfer a certain number of electrons with a preselected spin
orientation during a fixed time interval. With the cumulant generating function
at hand we are then able to calculate the spin current correlations which are
of outmost importance in the emerging field of spintronics. We confirm the
existing results for the charge statistics and report the discovery of the new
type of correlation between the spin-up and -down polarized electrons flows,
which has a potential to become a powerful new instrument for the investigation
of the Kondo effect in nanostructures.
