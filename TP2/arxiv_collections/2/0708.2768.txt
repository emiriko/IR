Detection of a surprisingly high flux of positron annihilation radiation from
the inner galaxy has motivated the proposal that dark matter is made of weakly
interacting light particles (possibly as light as the electron). This scenario
is extremely hard to test in current high energy physics experiments. Here,
however, we demonstrate that the current value of the electron anomalous
magnetic moment already has the required precision to unambiguously test the
light dark matter hypothesis. If confirmed, the implications for astrophysics
are far-reaching.
