We consider the deformation of the Whitham systems in the case when the
initial system is close to linear one. It appears that the deformation
procedure should be modified in this special case to make all the constructions
stable in the linear limit. We suggest here the special deformation scheme
which gives the stable deformation of the Whitham system for the almost linear
initial systems.
