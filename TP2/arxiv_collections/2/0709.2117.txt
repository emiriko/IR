The Hardy space H^2(R) for the upper half plane together with a unimodular
function group representation u(\lambda) = \exp(i(\lambda_1\psi_1 + ... +
\lambda_n\psi_n)) for \lambda in R^n, gives rise to a manifold M of orthogonal
projections for the subspaces u(\lambda)H^2(R) of L^2(R). For classes of
admissible functions \psi_i the strong operator topology closures of M and M
\cup M^\perp are determined explicitly as various n-balls and n-spheres. The
arguments used are direct and rely on the analysis of oscillatory integrals and
Hilbert space geometry. Some classes of these closed projection manifolds are
classified up to unitary equivalence. In particular the Fourier-Plancherel
2-sphere and the hyperbolic 3-sphere of Katavolos and Power appear as
distinguished special cases admitting nontrivial unitary automorphisms groups
which are explicitly described.
