We study the charged lepton electric dipole moment which is induced by the
scalar unparticle mediation and we predict the appropriate range for the free
parameters appearing in the effective lagrangian which drives the
unparticle-standard model lepton interactions. We observe that the charged
lepton electric dipole moment is strongly sensitive to the scaling dimension
d_u of the unparticle and the new couplings in the effective interaction.
Furthermore, we see that the current experimental limits of charged lepton
electric dipole moments can ensure an appropriate range for these free
parameters.
