We report experimental results of the field-induced variations of the
microwave surface resistance in samples of MgB2, produced by different methods.
By sweeping the DC magnetic field at increasing and decreasing values, we have
detected a magnetic hysteresis that can be ascribed to the different magnetic
induction, due to the critical state of the fluxon lattice. The hysteresis
observed in the bulk samples has an unusual shape, which cannot be justified in
the framework of the critical-state models.
