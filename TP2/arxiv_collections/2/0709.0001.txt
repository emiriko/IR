We introduce an overcomplete highest weight state basis as a calculational
tool for the description of the isotropic spin-1 chain with bilinear exchange
coupling J1 and biquadratic coupling J2. The ground state can be expressed
exactly at the three special points in the phase diagram where the Hamiltonian
corresponds to a sum of nearest neighbor total spin projection operators
(J1=0>J2, J1=-J2<0, and J1=-J2/3<0). In particular, at the phase transition
point J1=-J2<0 it is possible to exactly compute the ground states, excited
states, expectation values, and correlation functions by using the new total
spin basis.
