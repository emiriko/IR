Application of fractional calculus to the description of anomalous diffusion
and relaxation processes in complex media provided one of the most impressive
impulses to the development of statistical physics during the last decade. In
particular the so-called fractional diffusion equation enabled one to capture
the main features of anomalous diffusion. However the price for this
achievement is rather high - the fractional diffusion coefficient becomes an
involved function of a characteristic of the media (e.g., that of the radius of
pores in the case of the porous one). Revealing this dependence from the first
principles is one of the main problems in this field of science. Another one
still remains that of extracting this dependence from the experiment. The
latter problem is tackled in the present paper. Our aim is to provide detailed
and pedagogical deriving the relationship of the fractional diffusion
coefficient with experimentally observable value from nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation data. The result obtained promotes the
NMR relaxation method to become a powerful tool in solving the problem of
experimental measuring the fractional diffusion coefficient. Also the merits
and limitations of NMR relaxation method and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR
for the research of anomalous diffusion are compared and discussed.
