We investigate the effects of the aberration of light for a uniformly
accelerating observer. The observer we consider is initially at rest with
respect to a luminous spherical object--a star, say--and then starts to move
away with constant acceleration. The main results we derive are the following:
(i) The observer always sees an initial increase of the apparent size of the
object; (ii) The apparent size of the object approaches a non-zero value as the
proper time of the observer goes to infinity. (iii) There exists a critical
value of the acceleration such that the apparent size of the object is always
increasing when the acceleration is super-critical. We show that, while (i) is
a purely non-relativistic effect, (ii) and (iii) are effects of the
relativistic aberration of light and are intimately connected with the
Lorentzian geometry of Minkowksi spacetime. Finally, the examples we present
illustrate that, while more or less negligible in everyday life, the three
effects can be significant in the context of space-flight.
