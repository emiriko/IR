Investigating the causes of the nonlinear behavior of a gaseous conductor we
identified the presence of two states of the complex space charge configuration
self-assembled in front of the anode. These states correspond to two levels of
self-organization from which the first one is related to spatial pattern
whereas the second one to spatiotemporal pattern. Their emergence through two
kinds of instabilities produced for two critical distances from thermodynamic
equilibrium is emphasized in the current voltage characteristic as an S-shaped,
respectively Z-shaped bistability. Their presence attributes to the gaseous
conductor the ability to work as an S-shaped, respectively an N-shaped negative
differential resistance.
