The emission of Auger electrons from the K-, L- and M-sheels of two
configurations of copper atoms is investigated in detail within the frame work
of the momentum average technique. Ab initio calculations for the bound state
wavefunctions of the ionized atoms are performed using a Gaussian computer
code. The continuum wavefunctions of the emitted electrons are determined by
employing an effective potential variational approach. Slight differences have
been noticed between the results of both configurations. The transition rates,
energies and widths of all possible Auger electrons are listed in Tables.
Slight differences have been noticed between the results of the two types of
copper atoms.
