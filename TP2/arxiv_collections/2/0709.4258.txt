We show that fractional charges bound to topological defects in the recently
proposed time-reversal-invariant models on honeycomb and square lattices obey
fractional statistics. The effective low-energy description is given in terms
of a `doubled' level-2 Chern-Simons field theory, which is parity and
time-reversal invariant and implies two species of semions (particles with
statistical angle pi/2) labeled by a new emergent quantum number that we
identify as the fermion axial charge.
