Let k be a positive integer divisible by 4, l>k a prime, and f an elliptic
cuspidal eigenform of weight k-1, level 4, and non-trivial character. Let
\rho_f be the l-adic Galois representation attached to f. In this paper we
provide evidence for the Bloch-Kato conjecture for a twist of the adjoint motif
of \rho_f in the following way. Let L(f,s) denote the symmetric square
L-function of f. We prove that (under certain conditions) the l-adic valuation
of the algebraic part of L(f, k) is no greater than the l-adic valuation of the
order of S, where S is (the Pontryagin dual of) the Selmer group attached to
the Galois module \ad^0\rho_f|_{G_K} (-1), and K= Q(i). Our method uses an idea
of Ribet in that we introduce an intermediate step and produce congruences
between CAP and non-CAP modular forms on the unitary group U(2,2).
