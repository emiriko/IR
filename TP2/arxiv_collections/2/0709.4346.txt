Flux penetration into type-II superconducing films is simulated for
transverse applied magnetic field and flux creep dynamics. The films contain
macroscopic, non-conducting holes and we suggest a new method to introduce the
holes in the simulation formalism. The method implies reconstruction of the
magnetic field change inside the hole. We find that in the region between the
hole and the edge the current density is compressed so that the flux density is
slightly reduced, but the traffic of flux is significantly increased. The
results are in good agreement with magneto-optical studies of flux
distributions in YBCO films.
