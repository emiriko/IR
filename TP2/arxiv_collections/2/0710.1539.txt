Theoretical decay half-lives of the heaviest odd-Z nuclei are calculated
using the experimental Q value. The barriers in the quasimolecular shape path
are determined within a Generalized Liquid Drop Model (GLDM) and the WKB
approximation is used. The results are compared with calculations using the
Density-Dependent M3Y (DDM3Y) effective interaction and the
Viola-Seaborg-Sobiczewski (VSS) formulas. The calculations provide consistent
estimates for the half-lives of the decay chains of these superheavy elements.
The experimental data stand between the GLDM calculations and VSS ones in the
most time. Predictions are provided for the decay half-lives of other
superheavy nuclei within the GLDM and VSS approaches using the recent
extrapolated Q of Audi, Wapstra, and Thibault [Nucl. Phys. A729, 337 (2003)],
which may be used for future experimental assignment and identification.
