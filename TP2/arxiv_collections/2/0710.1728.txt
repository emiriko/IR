The LHC will soon provide proton-proton collisions at the unprecedented
center of mass energy, $\sqrt{s}=$14 TeV. This not only allows us to probe new
regions of high-$p_T$ physics, but also low-$x$ and forward physics. A
selection of potential measurements are described to outline the prospects for
low-$x$ and forward physics in the ATLAS, CMS, TOTEM, and LHCf experiments.
