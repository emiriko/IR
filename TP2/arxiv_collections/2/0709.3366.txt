We review J. Zimanyi's key contributions to the theoretical understanding of
dynamical freeze-out in nuclear collisions and their subsequent applications to
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, leading to the discovery of a
freeze-out hierarchy where chemical freeze-out of hadron yields precedes the
thermal decoupling of their momentum spectra. Following Zimanyi's lines of
reasoning we show that kinetic freeze-out necessarily leads to a dependence of
the corresponding freeze-out temperature on collision centrality. This
centrality dependence can be predicted within hydrodynamic models, and for
Au+Au collisions at RHIC this prediction is shown to reproduce the
experimentally observed centrality dependence of the thermal decoupling
temperature, extracted from hadron momentum spectra. The fact that no such
centrality dependence is observed for the chemical decoupling temperature,
extracted from the hadron yields measured in these collisions, excludes a
similar kinetic interpretation of the chemical decoupling process. We argue
that the chemical decoupling data from Au+Au collisions at RHIC can only be
consistently understood if the chemical freeze-out process is driven by a phase
transition, and that the measured chemical decoupling temperature therefore
measures the critical temperature of the quark-hadron phase transition. We
propose additional experiments to further test this interpretation.
