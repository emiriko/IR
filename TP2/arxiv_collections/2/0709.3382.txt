The results of IR-studies in quasi-1D carbynoid films produced by
dehydrohalogenation of poly(vinilidene fluoride) are in good agreement with the
assumption that carbynoid films studied are generalized spin -Peierls
conductors, the metal to insulator transition in which can be described in the
frame of t-J model. Residual atoms of fluorine, hydrogen and atoms of main
technological impurity oxygen in the form of various complexes in interchain
space are suggested to be spin - (or joint spin - and electrical) conductivity
dopants. Antiferroelectric spin wave resonance (AFESWR) being to be optical
analogue of antiferromagnetic spin wave resonance has been identified for the
first time. Electric spin-Peierls polaron lattice in C-C -bonds is proposed to
be responsible for the observed AFESWR both in starting PWDF films and in
carbynoid B-films (the samples with the least impurity content). Electric spin
moment with pure imaginary value predicted by Dirac as early as 1928 was
identified for the first time. Electric spin-Peierls polarons are proposed to
be electric spin moment carriers. It has been established that topological
solitons, earlier called spin-Peierls solitons (SPS), are simultaneously
active, unlike to topological solitons with nonzero spin in
\textit{trans}-polyacetylene, in both optical and magnetic resonance spectra.It
is explained in suggestion that SPS possess by both electric and magnetic spin
moments which can be considered as two components of complex electromagnetic
spin vector as a single whole. SPS proposed to be consisting of two coupled
domain walls in both magnetic and electric generalized spin density wave
(GSDW), produced by electromagnetic spin-Peierls transition in its generalized
form in $\pi$ - and $\sigma$ -subsystems of carbynoids.
