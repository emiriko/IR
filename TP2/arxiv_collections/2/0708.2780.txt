The propagation of a superintense laser pulse in an underdense, inhomogeneous
plasma has been studied numerically by two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations on a time scale extending up to several picoseconds. The effects of
the ion dynamics following the charge-displacement self-channeling of the laser
pulse have been addressed. Radial ion acceleration leads to the ``breaking'' of
the plasma channel walls, causing an inversion of the radial space-charge field
and the filamentation of the laser pulse. At later times a number of
long-lived, quasi-periodic field structures are observed and their dynamics is
characterized with high resolution. Inside the plasma channel, a pattern of
electric and magnetic fields resembling both soliton- and vortex-like
structures is observed.
