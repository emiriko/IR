In a system where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, the low energy
eigenmodes of the continuum Dirac operator are extended. On the lattice, due to
discretization effects, the Dirac operator can have localized eigenmodes that
affect physical quantities sensitive to chiral symmetry. While the infrared
eigenmodes of the Wilson Dirac operator are usually extended even on coarse
lattices, the chiral overlap operator has many localized eigenmodes in the
physical region, especially in mixed action simulations. Depending on their
density, these modes can introduce strong lattice artifacts. The effect can be
controlled by changing the parameters of the overlap operator, in particular
the clover improvement term and the center of the overlap projection.
