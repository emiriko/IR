We report formation of self organized InP nano dots using 3 keV Ar+ ion
sputtering, at $15^\circ$ incidence from surface normal, on InP(111) surface.
Morphology and optical properties of the sputtered surface, as a function of
sputtering time, have been investigated by Scanning Probe Microscopy and Raman
Scattering techniques. Uniform patterns of nano dots are observed for different
durations of sputtering. The sizes and the heights of these nano dots vary
between 10 to 100 nm and 20 to 40 nm, respectively. With increasing of
sputtering time, t, the size and height of these nano dots increases up to a
certain sputtering time $t_c$. However beyond $t_c$, the dots break down into
smaller nanostructures, and as a result, the size and height of these
nanostructures decrease. The uniformity and regularity of these structures are
also lost for sputtering beyond $t_c$. The crossover behavior is also observed
in the rms surface roughness. Raman investigations of InP nano dots reveal
optical phonon softening due to phonon confinement in the surface nano dots.
