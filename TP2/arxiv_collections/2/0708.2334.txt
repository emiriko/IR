We investigate collective Cooper-pair transport of one- and two-dimensional
Josephson junction arrays in the insulating state. We derive an analytical
expression for the current-voltage characteristic revealing thermally activated
conductivity at small voltages and threshold voltage depinning. The activation
energy and the related depinning voltage represent a dynamic Coulomb barrier
for collective charge transfer over the whole system and scale with the system
size. We show that both quantities are non-monotonic functions of magnetic
field. We propose that formation of the dynamic Coulomb barrier as well as the
size scaling of the activation energy and the depinning threshold voltage, are
consequences of the mutual phase synchronization. We apply the results for
interpretation of experimental data in disordered films near the
superconductor-insulator transition.
