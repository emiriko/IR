We present a measurement of the branching fraction $B(D_s^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu)$
using a 548 fb$^{-1}$ data sample collected by the Belle experiment at the KEKB
$e^+e^-$ collider. The $D_s$ momentum is determined by reconstruction of the
system recoiling against $DK\gamma X$ in events of the type $e^+e^-\to D_s^\ast
DKX, D_s^\ast \to D_s\gamma$, where $X$ represents additional pions or photons
from fragmentation. The full reconstruction method provides high resolution in
the neutrino momentum and thus good background separation, equivalent to that
reached by experiments at the tau-charm factories. We obtain the branching
fraction $B(D_s^+\to\mu^+\nu_\mu) = (6.44 \pm 0.76({\rm stat}) \pm 0.57({\rm
syst})) \cdot 10^{-3}$, implying a $D_s$ decay constant of $f_{D_s} = (275 \pm
16({\rm stat}) \pm 12({\rm syst}))$ MeV.
