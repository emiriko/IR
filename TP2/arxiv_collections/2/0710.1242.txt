Some highly speculative and serendipitous ideas that might relate
thermodynamics, spacetime, shape and symmetry are brought together. A
hypothetical spacetime comprising a pointwise lattice with a fixed metric is
considered. If there were absolute symmetry between displacement and time it is
suggested that the velocity of light would be an integer conversion factor
between the units of these quantities. In the context of such outlandish
hypotheses the answer to the question posed would be 'everything'.
