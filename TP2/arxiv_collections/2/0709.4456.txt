We present results for masses of light mesons obtained with the variational
method using an enhanced basis of interpolating field operators with different
quark smearings. The interpolators are constructed from Jacobi-smeared quarks
of a Gaussian type as well as from derivative quark sources obtained by a
covariant derivative acting on the Gaussian sources. For our analysis we use
quenched gauge configurations with Chirally Improved quarks and the
Luescher-Weisz gauge action on a 16^3 x 32 lattice with a = 0.148 fm. We
discuss the influence of derivative sources on the overlap with excited states.
