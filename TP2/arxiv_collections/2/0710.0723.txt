We derive an uncertainty relation for two unitary operators which obey a
commutation relation of the form UV=exp[i phi] VU. Its most important
application is to constrain how much a quantum state can be localised
simultaneously in two mutually unbiased bases related by a Discrete Fourier
Transform. It provides an uncertainty relation which smoothly interpolates
between the well known cases of the Pauli operators in 2 dimensions and the
continuous variables position and momentum. This work also provides an
uncertainty relation for modular variables, and could find applications in
signal processing. In the finite dimensional case the minimum uncertainty
states, discrete analogues of coherent and squeezed states, are minimum energy
solutions of Harper's equation, a discrete version of the Harmonic oscillator
equation.
