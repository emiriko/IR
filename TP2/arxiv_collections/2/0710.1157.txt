We construct a large class of multipartite qudit states which are positive
under the family of partial transpositions. The construction is based on
certain direct sum decomposition of the total Hilbert space displaying
characteristic circular structure and hence generalizes a class of bipartite
circulant states proposed recently by the authors. This class contains many
well known examples of multipartite quantum states from the literature and
gives rise to a huge family of completely new states.
