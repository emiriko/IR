When are quantum filters asymptotically independent of the initial state? We
show that this is the case for absolutely continuous initial states when the
quantum stochastic model satisfies an observability condition. When the initial
system is finite dimensional, this condition can be verified explicitly in
terms of a rank condition on the coefficients of the associated quantum
stochastic differential equation.
