The capillary force was measured by atomic force microscopy between a gold
coated sphere mounted on a cantilever and gold surfaces with different
roughness. For smooth surfaces the capillary adhesive force surpasses in
magnitude any dispersion, e.g. van der Waals/Casimir, and/or electrostatic
forces. A substantial decrease in the capillary force was observed by
increasing the roughness ampltitude a few nanometers between 1-10 nm. From
these measurements two limits can be defined: a smooth limit where a closely
macroscopic size contact surface interacts through the capillary force, and the
rough limit where only a few asperities give a capillary contribution.
