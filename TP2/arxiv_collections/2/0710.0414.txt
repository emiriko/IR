We describe a class of theories of dielectric polarization and a species of
solitons in these theories. The solitons, made entirely out of the polarization
field, have quantized values of the electric charge and can be interpreted as
electrons and holes. A soliton-antisoliton pair is an exciton. We present
numerical evidence that the elementary soliton is stable.
