The pseudoparticle approach is a numerical method to compute path integrals
without discretizing spacetime. The basic idea is to consider only those field
configurations, which can be represented as a linear superposition of a small
number of localized building blocks (pseudoparticles), and to replace the
functional integration by an integration over the pseudoparticle degrees of
freedom. In previous papers we have successfully applied the pseudoparticle
approach to SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. In this work we discuss the inclusion of
fermionic fields in the pseudoparticle approach. To test our method, we compute
the phase diagram of the 1+1-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large-N limit
as well as the chiral condensate in the crystal phase.
