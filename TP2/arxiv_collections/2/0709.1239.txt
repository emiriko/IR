I study an aspect of chiral perturbation theory (\chi PT) which enables one
to ``bridge'' different reactions. That is, an operator fixed in one of the
reactions can then be used to predict the other. For this purpose, I calculate
the partial wave amplitude for the p-wave pion production (pp\to pn\pi^+) using
the pion production operator from the lowest and the next nonvanishing orders.
The operator includes a contact operator whose coupling has been fixed using a
matrix element of a low-energy weak process (pp\to de^+\nu_e). I find that this
operator does not reproduce the partial wave amplitude extracted from
experimental data, showing that the bridging over the reactions with
significantly different kinematics is not necessarily successful. I study the
dependence of the amplitude on the various inputs such as the NN potential, the
\pi N\Delta coupling, and the cutoff. I argue the importance of a higher order
calculation. In order to gain an insight into a higher order calculation, I add
a higher order counter term to the operator used above, and fit the couplings
to both the low-energy weak process and the pion production. The energy
dependence of the partial wave amplitude for the pion production is described
by the operator consistently with the data. However, I find a result which
tells us to be careful about the convergence of the chiral expansion for the
pp\to pn\pi^+ reaction.
