We study the behavior of the order parameter, the phase diagram, and the
thermodynamics of exotic phases of finite temperature gauge theory. Lattice
simulations were performed in SU(3) and SU(4) with an adjoint Polyakov loop
term added to the standard Wilson action. In SU(3), the pattern of Z(3)
symmetry breaking in the new phase is distinct from the pattern observed in the
deconfined phase. In SU(4), the Z(4) symmetry is spontaneously broken down to
Z(2), representing a partially-confined phase. The existence of the new phases
is confirmed in analytical calculations of the free energy based on
high-temperature perturbation theory.
