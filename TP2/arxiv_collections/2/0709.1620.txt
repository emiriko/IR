We study perfect fluid Stephani quantum cosmological model. In the present
work the Schutz's variational formalism which recovers the notion of time is
applied. This gives rise to Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale factor. We
use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets for each case. We
study the time-dependent behavior of the expectation value of the scale factor,
using many-worlds and deBroglie-Bohm interpretations of quantum mechanics.
