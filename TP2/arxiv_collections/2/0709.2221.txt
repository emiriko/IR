It has been argued by Pisarski and Wilczek that finite temperature
restoration of the chiral symmetry SU(Nf) x SU(Nf) is first-order for Nf >=3.
This type of chiral symmetry with a large Nf may appear in the Higgs sector if
one considers models such as walking technicolor theories. We examine the
first-order restoration of the chiral symmetry from the point of view of the
electroweak phase transition. The strength of the transition is estimated in
SU(2) x U(1) gauged linear sigma model by means of the finite temperature
effective potential at one-loop with the ring improvement. Even if the mass of
the neutral scalar boson corresponding to the Higgs boson is larger than 114
GeV, the first-order transition can be strong enough for the electroweak
baryogenesis, as long as the extra massive scalar bosons (required for the
linear realization) are kept heavier than the neutral scalar boson. Explicit
symmetry breaking terms reduce the strength of the first-order transition, but
the transition can remain strongly first-order even when the masses of pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons become as large as the current lower bound of direct
search experiments.
