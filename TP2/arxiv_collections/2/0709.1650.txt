We argue that the Fermi arc observed in angle resolved photoemission
measurements in underdoped cuprates can be understood as a consequence of
inelastic scattering in a d-wave superconductor. We analyze this phenomenon in
the context of strong coupling Eliashberg theory, deriving a `single lifetime'
model for describing the temperature evolution of the spectral gap as measured
by single particle probes such as photoemission and tunneling.
