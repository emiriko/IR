The transfer of heat between the air and surrounding soil in underground
tunnels ins investigated, as part of the analysis of environmental conditions
in underground rail systems. Using standard turbulent modelling assumptions,
flow profiles are obtained in both open tunnels and in the annulus between a
tunnel wall and a moving train, from which the heat transfer coefficient
between the air and tunnel wall is computed. The radial conduction of heat
through the surrounding soil resulting from changes in the temperature of air
in the tunnel are determined. An impulse change and an oscillating tunnel air
temperature are considered separately. The correlations between fluctuations in
heat transfer coefficient and air temperature are found to increase the mean
soil temperature. Finally, a model for the coupled evolution of the air and
surrounding soil temperature along a tunnel of finite length is given.
