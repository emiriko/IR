We study a one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with longer-range Coulomb
interactions at quarter-filling in the strong coupling limit. We find two
different charge-ordered (CO) ground states as the strength of the longer range
interactions is varied. At lower energies, these CO states drive two different
spin-ordered ground states. A variety of response functions computed here bear
a remarkable resemblance to recent experimental observations for organic TMTSF
systems, and so we propose that these systems are proximate to a QCP associated
with T=0 charge order. For a ladder system relevant to $Sr_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41}$,
we find in-chain CO, rung-dimer, and orbital antiferromagnetic ordered phases
with varying interchain couplings and superconductivity with hole-doping. RPA
studies of many chains (ladders) coupled reveal a phase diagram with the
ordered phase extended to finite temperatures and a phase boundary ending at a
quantum critical point (QCP). Critical quantum fluctuations at the QCP are
found to enhance the transverse dispersion, leading to a dimensional crossover
and a T=0 decofinement transition.
