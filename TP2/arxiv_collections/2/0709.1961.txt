We present a unitary equivalent spin-boson Hamiltonian in which terms can be
identified which contribute to the Bloch-Siegert shift, and to the level
splittings at the anticrossings associated with the Bloch-Siegert resonances.
First-order degenerate perturbation theory is used to develop approximate
results in the case of moderate coupling for the level splitting.
