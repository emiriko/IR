The results here presented are a continuation of the algebraic research line
which attempts to find properties of multiple-valued systems based on a poset
of two agents.
  The aim of this paper is to exhibit two relationships between some
three-valued structures and binary relations. The established connections are
so narrow that two representation theorems are obtained.
