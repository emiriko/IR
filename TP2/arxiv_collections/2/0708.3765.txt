We study the charged lepton electric dipole moments in the Randall Sundrum
model where the leptons and the gauge fields are accessible to the extra
dimension. We observe that the electron (muon; tau) electric dipole moment
reaches to the value of the order of 10^{-26} e-cm (10^{-20} e-cm; 10^{-20}
e-cm) with the inclusion of the lepton KK modes.
