There exist quantum algorithms that are more efficient than their classical
counterparts; such algorithms were invented by Shor in 1994 and then Grover in
1996. A lack of invention since Grover's algorithm has been commonly attributed
to the non-intuitive nature of quantum algorithms to the classically trained
person. Thus, the idea of using computers to automatically generate quantum
algorithms based on an evolutionary model emerged. A limitation of this
approach is that quantum computers do not yet exist and quantum simulation on a
classical machine has an exponential order overhead. Nevertheless, early
research into evolving quantum algorithms has shown promise.
  This paper provides an introduction into quantum and evolutionary algorithms
for the computer scientist not familiar with these fields. The exciting field
of using evolutionary algorithms to evolve quantum algorithms is then reviewed.
