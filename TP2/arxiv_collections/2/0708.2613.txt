In this talk we present the results of two-pion HBT correlation at freeze-out
in heavy ion collisions (HICs) from AGS to RHIC energies. The UrQMD
hadron-string transport model as well as the CRAB analyzing program are
adopted. Based on the cascade mode, in general, the calculations are satisfying
and well in line with the experimental data although discrepancies are not
negligible. Such as: I), the HBT time-related puzzle exists at all energies.
II), at low AGS energies, the calculated volume as well as the mean free path
of pion source at freeze-out are lower than data. It implies that a better
description of interactions of particles at early stage of HICs is required.
