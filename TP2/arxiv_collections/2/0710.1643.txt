The reflection of a three-dimensional vectorial Maxwell-Gaussian beam by a
planar surface is studied. The surface is characterized by its complex
reflection coefficients $r_s(\bk)$ and $r_p(\bk)$ for TE and TM electromagnetic
plane waves of wavevector $\bk$, respectively. The field impinging upon the
reflecting surface is modeled as a quasi-monochromatic fundamental Gaussian
beam suitably modified in order to satisfy Maxwell equations (Maxwell-Gaussian
beam). Analytical expressions, correct up to the second order in a perturbation
expansion, are given for the reflected electric and magnetic field,
respectively. We found that first order terms in the perturbation expansion
account for a longitudinal shift (Goos-H\"{a}nchen effect) of the whole
reflected beam, while second order terms modifies the transverse shape of the
beam which is, at this order, no longer cylindrically symmetric.
