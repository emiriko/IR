Recent quantum oscillation measurements on underdoped cuprates are shown to
be consistent with the predictions of a mean field theory of the 1/8 magnetic
antiphase stripe order proposed to occur in high-$T_c$ cuprates. In particular,
for intermediate values of the stripe order parameter, the magneto-transport is
found to be dominated by an electron pocket.
