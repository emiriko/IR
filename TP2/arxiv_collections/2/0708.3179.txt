MOND is a phenomenological theory with no apparent physical justification
which seems to undermine some of the basic principles that underpin established
theoretical physics. It is nevertheless remarkably successful over its sphere
of application and this suggests MOND may have some physical basis. It is shown
here that two simple axioms pertaining to fundamental principles will reproduce
the characteristic behaviour of MOND, though the axioms are in conflict with
general relativistic cosmology.
