We test a pentaquark model of the negative parity hyperon Lambda(1405). We
use a model where valence four quarks and one antiquark move in a potential
relativistically and interact with each other and themselves through gluon and
NG boson. Fall-apart decay rate of the system is studied and strong model
dependence is pointed out.
