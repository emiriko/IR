Interpretations of key concepts, such as uncertainty relations, kinetic
energy, value of an observable, probability distributions, the projection or
collapse of a wave function postulate, and discrete versus continuous values,
that appear in several excellent textbooks on quantum mechanics are reviewed
and found not to be consistent with our current understanding of quantum
theory. Possible alternatives are suggested.
