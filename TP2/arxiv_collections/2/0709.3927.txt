We consider two prototypical quantum models, the spin-1/2 XY chain and the
quantum Ising chain and study their entanglement entropy, S(l,L), of blocks of
l spins in homogeneous or inhomogeneous systems of length L. By using two
different approaches, free-fermion techniques and perturbational expansion, an
exact relationship between the entropies is revealed. Using this relation we
translate known results between the two models and obtain, among others, the
additive constant of the entropy of the critical homogeneous quantum Ising
chain and the effective central charge of the random XY chain.
