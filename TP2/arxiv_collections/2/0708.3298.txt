We argue that the main mechanism for condensate collapse in an attractive
Bose-Einstein condensate is the loss of coherence between atoms a finite
distance apart, rather than the growth of the occupation number in
noncondensate modes. Since the former mechanism is faster than the latter by a
factor of approximately 3/2, this helps to dispel the apparent failure of field
theoretical models in predicting the collapse time of the condensate.
