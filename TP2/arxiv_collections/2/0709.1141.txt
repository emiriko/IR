We investigate the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov linear differential system. The
coefficients of this system are rational functions. We have proved that the
solution of the KZ system is rational when k is equal to two and n is equal to
three (see [5]) . In this paper, we construct the corresponding solution in the
explicit form.
