Close examination of wealth distributions reveal the existence of two
distinct power law regimes. The Pareto exponents of the super-rich, identified
for example in rich lists such as provided by Forbes are smaller than the
Pareto exponents obtained for top earners in income data sets. Our extension of
the Slanina model of wealth is able to reproduce these double power law
features.
