This contribution investigates a prototype of a TPC readout with a highly
pixelated CMOS ASIC, which is an option for charged particles tracking of the
ILC. A triple GEM stack was joined with a TimePix and MediPix2 chip (pixel size
of 55$\times$55 $\mu m^2$) and its readout properties were investigated with 5
GeV electrons. The spatial resolution of the cluster center reconstruction was
determined as a function of drift distance using different cluster alhoritms
and compared with Monte Carlo predictions.
