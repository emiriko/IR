For a quiver with potential, Derksen, Weyman and Zelevinsky defined a
combinatorial transformation - mutations. Mukhopadhyay and Ray, on the other
hand, tell us how to compute Seiberg dual quivers for some quivers with
potentials through a tilting procedure, thus obtaining derived equivalent
algebras. In this text, we compare mutations with the concept of Seiberg
duality, concluding that for a certain class of potentials (the good ones)
mutations coincide with Seiberg duality, therefore giving derived equivalences.
