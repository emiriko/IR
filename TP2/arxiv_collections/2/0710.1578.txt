A dynamical formulation of the dimer method for the determination of
transition states is presented. The method is suited for ab-initio molecular
dynamics using the fictitious Lagrangian formulation. The method has been
applied to the con-rotatory ring opening of chloro-cyclo-butadiene, an example,
where the application of the drag method is problematic.
