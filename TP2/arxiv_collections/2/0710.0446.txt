The Detector Concept Report (DCR) consists of two parts, one for the physics
and the other for ILC detectors. It has been prepared as the accompany document
of the ILC Accelerator Reference Design Report. The detector DCR describes ILC
detector designs, R&Ds on detector technologies and expected performances. The
overview of the Detector DCR and the plan for the final release are presented.
