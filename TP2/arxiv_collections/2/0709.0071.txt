The Weil representation discovered by Andre Weil plays an important role in
the study of the tranformation properties of theta series. In this paper, we
define the Weil-Schroedinger representation of the Jacobi group and prove that
the theta series associated with the Weil-Schroedinger representation is a
Jacobi form with respect to a suitable arithmetic subgroup of the Jacobi
modular group.
