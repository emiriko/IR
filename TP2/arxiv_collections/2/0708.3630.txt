In this paper based on the notion of entanglement witness, a new measure of
entanglement called floating entanglement witness measure is introduced which
satisfies some of the usual properties of a good entanglement measure. By
exploiting genetic algorithm, we introduce a classical algorithm that computes
floating entanglement witness measure. This algorithm also provides a method
for finding entanglement witness for a given entangled state.
