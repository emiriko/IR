We present and discuss the results of calculations of surface relaxations and
rumplings for the (001) and (011) surfaces of BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, using a hybrid
B3PW description of exchange and correlation. On the (001) surfaces, we
consider both AO (A = Ba or Pb) and TiO2 terminations. In the former case, the
surface AO layer is found to relax inward for both materials, while outward
relaxations of all atoms in the second layer are found at both kinds of (001)
terminations and for both materials. The surface relaxation energies of BaO and
TiO2 terminations on BaTiO3 (001) are found to be comparable, as are those of
PbO and TiO2 on PbTiO3 (001), although in both cases the relaxation energy is
slightly larger for the TiO2 termination. As for the (011) surfaces, we
consider three types of surfaces, terminating on a TiO layer, a Ba or Pb layer,
or an O layer. Here, the relaxation energies are much larger for the
TiO-terminated than for the Ba or Pb-terminated surfaces. The relaxed surface
energy for the O-terminated surface is about the same as the corresponding
average of the TiO and Pb-terminated surfaces on PbTiO3, but much less than the
average of the TiO and Ba-terminated surfaces on BaTiO3. We predict a
considerable increase of the Ti-O chemical bond covalency near the BaTiO3 and
PbTiO3 (011) surface as compared to both the bulk and the (001) surface.
