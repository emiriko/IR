We report a high statistics measurement of Upsilon production with an 800
GeV/c proton beam on hydrogen and deuterium targets. The dominance of the
gluon-gluon fusion process for Upsilon production at this energy implies that
the cross section ratio, $\sigma (p + d \to \Upsilon) / 2\sigma (p + p\to
\Upsilon)$, is sensitive to the gluon content in the neutron relative to that
in the proton. Over the kinematic region 0 < x_F < 0.6, this ratio is found to
be consistent with unity, in striking contrast to the behavior of the Drell-Yan
cross section ratio $\sigma(p+d)_{DY}/2\sigma(p+p)_{DY}$. This result shows
that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron are very similar. The
Upsilon production cross sections are also compared with the p+d and p+Cu cross
sections from earlier measurements.
