The diversity of a community that cannot be fully counted must be inferred.
The two preeminent inference methods are the MaxEnt method, which uses
information in the form of constraints and Bayes' rule which uses information
in the form of data. It has been shown that these two methods are special cases
of the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy (ME). We demonstrate how this
method can be used as a measure of diversity that not only reproduces the
features of Shannon's index but exceeds them by allowing more types of
information to be included in the inference. A specific example is solved in
detail. Additionally, the entropy that is found is the same form as the
thermodynamic entropy.
