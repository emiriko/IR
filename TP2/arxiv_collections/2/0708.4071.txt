Magnetoelectric (ME) voltage coefficient was always considered independent on
in-plane shape of plate layered magnetostrictive-piezoelectric composites due
to the oversimplification in ME theoretical models. In this article, we present
that in fact the ME voltage coefficient is largely dependent on the in-plane
shape owing to shape demagnetization effect on magnetostrictivity. Theoretical
analysis and experimental results both indicate that ME voltage coefficient
changes notably with the variation of in-plane sizes (length and width) of
layered ME properties. ME coefficient increases with the rise of in-plane
sizes, and different aspect ratio will also result in different ME coefficient.
Proper design of in-plane shape will greatly promote the development of ME
devices.
