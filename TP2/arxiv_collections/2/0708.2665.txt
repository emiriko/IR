The LHCb detector has been designed to study CP violation and other rare
phenomena in B-meson decays up to a luminosity of $\sim 5.10^{32}\rm
cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. This paper will describe what is limiting LHCb to exploit the
much higher luminosities available at the LHC, and what are the baseline
modifications which will remedy these limitations. The aim of SuperLHCb is to
increase the yields in hadronic B-decay channels by about a factor twenty
compared to LHCb, while for channels with leptons in the final state a factor
ten increase in statistics is envisaged.
