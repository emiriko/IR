Recent experiments demonstrated unexpected, even intriguing properties of
certain glassy materials in magnetic field at low temperatures. We have studied
the magnetic field dependence of the static dielectric susceptibility and the
heat capacity of glasses at low temperatures. We present a theory in which we
consider the coupling of the tunnelling motion to nuclear quadrupoles in order
to evaluate the static dielectric susceptibility. In the limit of weak magnetic
field we find the resonant part of the susceptibility increasing like $B^2$
while for the large magnetic field it behaves as 1/B. In the same manner we
consider the coupling of the tunnelling motion to nuclear quadrupoles and
angular momentum of tunnelling particles in order to find the heat capacity.
Our results show the Schotky peak for the angular momentum part, and $B^2$
dependence for nuclear quadrupoles part of heat capacity, respectively. We
discuss whether or not this approach can provide a suitable explanation for
such magnetic properties.
