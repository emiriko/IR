The origin of the cosmic rays has been a great mystery since they were
discovered by Victor Hess in 1912. AGASA's observation of ultra-high-energy
cosmic-rays (UHECR) possibly beyond the GZK (Greisen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin)
cutoff stimulated the field in great deal. In addition, Kamiokande's detection
of neutrinos from SN1987A and the H.E.S.S.'s detection of TeV gamma-rays from
supernova remnants demonstrated the viability of neutrino and TeV gamma-ray
astronomy for cosmic-ray research. A new generation of currently-operating or
soon-to-be-operating detectors for charged particles, gamma-rays and neutrinos
from cosmos will get us even closer to understanding the nature and origin of
cosmic rays. Detectors for UHECRs, gamma rays and neutrinos are of particular
importance in order to study the origins of cosmic rays since these particles
are free from the deflection due to magnetic fields. Detectors for
antiparticles and gamma rays would be useful to detect cosmic rays originated
from the decay of the dark matter in the Universe. I will review these
cosmic-ray detectors with particular attention on the differences of
ground-based, balloon-borne and satellite-borne detectors.
