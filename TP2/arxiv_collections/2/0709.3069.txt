We obtain explicit time dependent brane solutions in M-theory as well as in
string theory by solving the reduced equations of motion (which follow from
11-d supergravity) for a class of brane solutions in curved backgrounds. The
behaviour of our solutions in both asymptotic and near-horizon limits are
studied. It is shown that our time dependent solutions serve as explicit
examples of branes in singular, cosmological backgrounds. In some special cases
the asymptotic and the boundary AdS solutions can be identified as Milne X R^n
spacetime.
