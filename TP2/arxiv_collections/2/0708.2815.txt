We analyze a degenerate three-level cascade laser coupled to an external
coherent light via one of the coupler mirrors and vacuum reservoir in the
other, employing the stochastic differential equation associated with the
normal ordering. We study the squeezing properties and also calculate the mean
photon number of the cavity radiation. It turns out that the generated light
exhibits up to 98.3% squeezing under certain conditions pertaining to the
initial preparation of the superposition and the amplitude of the driving
radiation. Moreover, the mean photon number is found to be large where there is
a better squeezing. Hence it is believed that the system under consideration
can generate an intense squeezed light.
