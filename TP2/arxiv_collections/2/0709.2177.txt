An exponential dependence of the fragmentation cross-section on the average
binding energy is observed and reproduced with a statistical model. The
observed functional dependence is robust and allows the extraction of binding
energies from measured cross-sections. From the systematics of 75,77,78,79Cu
isotope cross-sections have been extracted. They are 636.94 +/- 0.40 MeV, 647.1
+/- 0.4 MeV, 651.6 +/- 0.4 MeV and 657.8 +/- 0.5 MeV, respectively.
Specifically, the uncertainty of the binding energy of 75Cu is reduced from 980
keV (listed value in the 2003 mass table of Audi and Wapstra) to 400 keV. The
predicted cross-sections of two near drip-line nuclei, 39Na and 40Mg, from the
fragmentation of 48Ca are discussed.
