Magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes in and above the
room-temperature region has been measured for La0.7Sr0.3Mn1-xM'xO3 (M' = Al,
Ti) by means of magnetization and heat capacity measurements in magnetic fields
up to 6 T. The magnetocaloric effect becomes largest at the ferromagnetic
ordering temperature Tc that is tuned to ~300 K by the substitution of Al or Ti
for Mn. While the substitution of Al for Mn drastically reduces the entropy
change, it extends considerably the working temperature span and improves the
relative cooling power. The magnetocaloric effect seems to be only lightly
affected by Ti substitution. Although manganites have been considered potential
for magnetic refrigerants, the magnetocaloric effect in these materials is
limited due to the existence of short-range ferromagnetic correlations above
Tc.
