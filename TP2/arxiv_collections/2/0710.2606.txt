We study the representation dimension of the class of algebras known as
quantum complete intersections. For such an algebra, we show that the
representation dimension is at most twice its codimension. Moreover, we show
that the representation dimension of a "homogeneous" quantum complete
intersection is strictly larger than its codimension.
