The spin texture in a gate-controlled superlattice with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling is studied in the presence of external terahertz radiation causing the
superlattice miniband transitions. It is shown that the local distribution of
spin density can be flipped by tuning the radiation intensity, allowing the
controlled coupling of spins and photons with different polarizations.
