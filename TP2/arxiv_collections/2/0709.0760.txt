A recursive Green's function method is employed to calculate the
density-of-states, transmission function, and current through a 150 layer (3,3)
armchair nanotorus (1800 atoms) with laterally attached metallic leads as
functions of relative lead angle and magnetic flux. Plateaus in the
transmissivity through the torus occur over wide ranges of lead placement,
accompanied by enhancements in the transmissivity through the torus as magnetic
flux normal to the toroidal plane is varied.
