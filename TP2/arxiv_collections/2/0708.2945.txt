We explore a novel and straightforward solution to the sign problem that has
plagued the Auxiliary-field Monte Carlo (AFMC) method applied to many-body
systems for more than a decade. We present a solution to the sign problem that
has plagued the Auxiliary-field Monte Carlo (AFMC) method for more than a
decade and report a breakthrough where excellent agreement between AFMC and
exact CI calculations for fully realistic nuclear applications is achieved.
This result offers the capability, unmatched by other methods, to achieve exact
solutions for large-scale quantum many-body systems.
