We calculate the inclusive cross section of double Z-boson production within
large extra dimensions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using perturbatively
quantized gravity in the ADD model we perform a first order calculation of the
graviton mediated contribution to the pp to ZZ cross section. At low energies
(e.g. Tevatron) this additional contribution is very small, making it virtually
unobservable, for a fundamental mass scale above 2500 GeV. At LHC energies
however, the calculation indicates that the ZZ-production rate within the ADD
model should differ significantly from the Standard Model if the new
fundamental mass scale would be below 15000 GeV. A comparison with the observed
production rate at the LHC might therefore provide direct hints on the number
and structure of the extra dimensions.
