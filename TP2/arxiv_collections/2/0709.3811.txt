Simulations are reported on the Ising two-dimensional ferromagnet in the
presence of a special kind of noise. The noise spectrum P(n) follows a power
law, where P(n) is the probability of flipping randomly selected n spins at
each timestep. This is introduced to mimic the self-organized criticality as a
model influence of a complex environment. We reproduced the phase transition
similar to the case of P(n) = constant. Above some value of the noise amplitude
the magnetisation tends to zero; otherwise it remains constant after some
relaxation. Information of the initial spin orientation remains preserved to
some extent by short-range spin-spin correlations. The distribution of the
times between flips is exponential. The results are discussed as a step towards
modeling of social systems.
