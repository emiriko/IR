The aim of this paper is to show how we can handle the Recognising Textual
Entailment (RTE) task by using Description Logics (DLs). To do this, we propose
a representation of natural language semantics in DLs inspired by existing
representations in first-order logic. But our most significant contribution is
the definition of two novel inference tasks: A-Box saturation and subgraph
detection which are crucial for our approach to RTE.
