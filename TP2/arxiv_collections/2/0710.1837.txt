We provide a rigorous calculation of the free energy of a non-metallic
crystal containing a small concentration of defects. The low-temperature
leading contribution is found to be $\propto T^2$. This further gives a
linear-in-$T$ low-temperature specific heat as that exhibited by glasses. These
results also show that, similarly to what happens in glasses, the
long-wavelength spectrum of a nearly perfect crystal does not suffice to
determine its low-temperature behavior.
