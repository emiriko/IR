In this note we carry out the counting of states for a black hole in loop
quantum gravity, however assuming an equidistant area spectrum. We find that
this toy-model is exactly solvable, and we show that its behavior is very
similar to that of the correct model. Thus this toy-model can be used as a nice
and simplifying `laboratory' for questions about the full theory.
