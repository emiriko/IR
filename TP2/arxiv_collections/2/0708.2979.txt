We report a study of the phase behavior of multiple-occupancy crystals
through simulation. We argue that in order to reproduce the equilibrium
behavior of such crystals it is essential to treat the number of lattice sites
as a constraining thermodynamic variable. The resulting free-energy
calculations thus differ considerably from schemes used for single-occupancy
lattices. Using our approach, we obtain the phase diagram and the bulk modulus
for a generalized exponential model that forms cluster crystals at high
densities. We compare the simulation results with existing theoretical
predictions. We also identify two types of density fluctuations that can lead
to two sound modes and evaluate the corresponding elastic constants.
