We study the influence of Coulomb interaction on the thermoelectric transport
coefficients for a metallic single-electron transistor. By performing a
perturbation expansion up to second order in the tunnel-barrier conductance, we
include sequential and cotunneling processes as well as quantum fluctuations
that renormalize the charging energy and the tunnel conductance. We find that
Coulomb interaction leads to a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law: the
Lorenz ratio becomes gate-voltage dependent for sequential tunneling, and is
increased by a factor 9/5 in the cotunneling regime. Finally, we suggest a
measurement scheme for an experimental realization.
