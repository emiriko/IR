During 1993-94 Venezuela experienced a severe banking crisis which ended up
with 18 commercial banks intervened by the government. Here we develop an early
warning system for detecting credit related bankruptcy through discriminant
functions developed on financial and macroeconomic data predating the crisis. A
robustness test performed on these functions shows high precision in error
estimation. The model calibrated on pre-crisis data could detect abnormal
financial tension in the late Banco Capital many months before it was
intervened and liquidated.
