An elaborate least-squares variational technique is proposed for obtaining
improved continuum wavefunctions of Auger electrons emitted from arbitrary
systems the electronic structures of which are determined via one of the
computer codes available. A computer program is developed on the basis of this
technique for calculating the Auger transition rates using the angular momentum
average scheme. The program is employed for investigating the emission of Auger
electrons as a consequence of K- shell ionizations of two configurations of
copper atoms. A comparison is presented between the improved Auger transitions
and the ones determined using conventional Hartree-Fock codes. The results
emphasize the argument that (3p to 3d3d) is the dominant transition in both
configurations of the copper atoms. There is a minimal change in the values of
the Auger transition rates obtained from these configurations. It is
anticipated that the improved continuum wavefunctions provide closer results to
the experimental ones.
