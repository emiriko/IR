We develop a simple technique for calculation of next to nearest neighbor
spin-spin and chiral-spin correlation functions in inhomogeneous XXX model.
Exact expression of the chiral-spin order parameter as a function of the model
parameter, $\omega$, is analytically found. Using the same method we also
calculate the next to nearest neighbor spin-spin correlation function. In the
limit $\omega -> 0$ it reproduces the known result for the vacuum expectation
value of the next to nearest neighbor spins in the standard Heisenberg spin
chain. The technique is simple and can be extended for calculation of next to
next to nearest neighbor correlation functions as well as for calculation of
correlation functions in XXZ model.
