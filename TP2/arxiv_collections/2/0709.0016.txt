We propose a physically motivated parametrization for the unpolarized
generalized parton distributions, H and E, valid at both zero and non-zero
values of the skewness variable, \zeta. At \zeta=0, H and E are determined
using constraints from simultaneous fits of experimental data on both the
nucleon elastic form factors and the deep inelastic structure functions.
Lattice calculations of the higher moments constrain the parametrization at
\zeta > 0. Our method provides a step towards a model independent extraction of
generalized distributions from the data that is alternative to the mathematical
ansatz of double distributions.
