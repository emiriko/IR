High-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is ubiquitous in the
cuprates containing CuO2 planes but each cuprate has its own character. The
study of the material dependence of the d-wave superconducting gap (SG) should
provide important insights into the mechanism of high-Tc. However, because of
the 'pseudogap' phenomenon, it is often unclear whether the energy gaps
observed by spectroscopic techniques really represent the SG. Here, we report
spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) studies of
nearly-optimally-doped Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 (Na-CCOC) with Tc = 25 ~ 28 K. They
enable us to observe the quasi-particle interference (QPI) effect in this
material, through which unambiguous new information on the SG is obtained. The
analysis of QPI in Na-CCOC reveals that the SG dispersion near the gap node is
almost identical to that of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy (Bi2212) at the same doping level,
while Tc of Bi2212 is 3 times higher than that of Na-CCOC. We also find that SG
in Na-CCOC is confined in narrower energy and momentum ranges than Bi2212. This
explains at least in part the remarkable material dependence of Tc
