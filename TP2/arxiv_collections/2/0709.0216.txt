The strong octupole correlations in the mass region $A\approx 226$ are
interpreted as rotation-induced condensation of octupole phonons having their
angular momentum aligned with the rotational axis. Discrete phonon energy and
parity conservation generate oscillations of the energy difference between the
lowest rotational bands with positive and negative parity. Anharmonicities tend
to synchronize the the rotation of the condensate and the quadrupole shape of
the nucleus forming a rotating heart shape.
