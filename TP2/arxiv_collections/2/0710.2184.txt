We give a simple algebraic proof that the two different Lax pairs for the
Kac-van Moerbeke hierarchy, constructed from Jacobi respectively
super-symmetric Dirac-type difference operators, give rise to the same
hierarchy of evolution equations. As a byproduct we obtain some new recursions
for computing these equations.
