We study the influence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bond defects on
the ground-state energy of antiferromagnetic spin chains. In the absence of
translational invariance, the energy spectrum of the full Hamiltonian is
obtained numerically, by an iterative modification of the power algorithm. In
parallel, approximate analytical energies are obtained from a local-bond
approximation, proposed here. This approximation results in significant
improvement upon the mean-field approximation, at negligible extra
computational effort.
