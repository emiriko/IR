In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 092501 (2007)], Roth and Navratil
present an importance-truncation scheme for the no-core shell model. The
authors claim that their truncation scheme leads to converged results for the
ground state of 40-Ca. We believe that this conclusion cannot be drawn from the
results presented in the Letter. Furthermore, the claimed convergence is at
variance with expectations of many-body theory. In particular, coupled-cluster
calculations indicate that a significant fraction of the correlation energy is
missing.
