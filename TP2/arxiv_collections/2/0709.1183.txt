We present a panoramic view of the main scientific manuscripts left
unpublished by the brightest Italian theoretical physicist of the XX century,
Ettore Majorana. We deal in particular: (i) with his very original "study"
notes (the so-called "Volumetti"), already published by us in English, in 2003,
c/o Kluwer Acad.Press, Dordrecht & Boston, and in the original Italian
language, in 2006, c/o Zanichelli pub., Bologna, Italy; and (ii) with a
selection of his research notes (the so-called "Quaderni"), that we shall
publish c/o Springer, Berlin. We seize the present opportunity for setting
forth also some suitable -scarcely known- information about Majorana's life and
work, on the basis of documents (letters, testimonies, different documents...)
discovered or collected by ourselves during the last decades. [A finished,
enlarged version of this paper will appear as the editors' Preface, at the
beginning of the coming book "Ettore Majorana - Unpublished Research Notes on
Theoretical Physics", edited by S.Esposito, E.Recami, A.van der Merwe and
R.Battiston, to be printed by Springer verlag, Berlin].
