In a previous work a model was proposed for the phase transitions of crystals
with localized magnetic moments which at low temperature have a "conical"
arrangement that at higher T transforms into a more symmetrical structure
(depending on the compound) before becoming totally disordered. The model
assumes bilinear and biquadratic interactions between magnetic moments up to
the fifth neighbours, and for any given T the structure with the least free
energy is obtained by a mean-field approximation (MFA). The interaction
constants are derived from ab initio energy calculations. In this work we
improve upon that model modifying the MFA in such a way that a continuous
(instead of discontinuous) spectrum of excited states is available to the
system. In the previous work, which dealt with LaMn_2Ge_2 and LaMn_2Si_2, we
found that transitions to different structures can be obtained for increasing
T, in good qualitative agreement with experiment. The critical temperatures,
however, were exaggerately high. With the new MFA we obtain essentially the
same behaviour concerning the phase transitions, and critical temperatures much
closer to the experimental ones.
