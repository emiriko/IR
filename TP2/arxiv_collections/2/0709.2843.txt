Statistical DNA models available in the literature are often effective models
where the base-pair state only (unbroken or broken) is considered. Because of a
decrease by a factor of 30 of the effective bending rigidity of a sequence of
broken bonds, or bubble, compared to the double stranded state, the inclusion
of the molecular conformational degrees of freedom in a more general mesoscopic
model is needed. In this paper we do so by presenting a 1D Ising model, which
describes the internal base pair states, coupled to a discrete worm like chain
model describing the chain configurations [J. Palmeri, M. Manghi, and N.
Destainville, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 088103 (2007)]. This coupled model is
exactly solved using a transfer matrix technique that presents an analogy with
the path integral treatment of a quantum two-state diatomic molecule. When the
chain fluctuations are integrated out, the denaturation transition temperature
and width emerge naturally as an explicit function of the model parameters of a
well defined Hamiltonian, revealing that the transition is driven by the
difference in bending (entropy dominated) free energy between bubble and
double-stranded segments. The calculated melting curve (fraction of open base
pairs) is in good agreement with the experimental melting profile of
polydA-polydT. The predicted variation of the mean-square-radius as a function
of temperature leads to a coherent novel explanation for the experimentally
observed thermal viscosity transition. Finally, the influence of the DNA strand
length is studied in detail, underlining the importance of finite size effects,
even for DNA made of several thousand base pairs.
