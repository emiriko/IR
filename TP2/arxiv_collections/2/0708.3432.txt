The influence of Gaussian laser pulses on the transport through molecular
wires is investigated within a tight-binding model for spinless electrons
including correlation. Motivated by the phenomenon of coherent destruction of
tunneling for monochromatic laser fields, situations are studied in which the
maximum amplitude of the electric field fulfills the conditions for the
destructive quantum effect. It is shown that, as for monochromatic laser
pulses, the average current through the wire can be suppressed. For parameters
of the model, which do not show a net current without any optical field, a
Gaussian laser pulse can establish a temporary current. In addition, the effect
of electron correlation on the current is investigated.
