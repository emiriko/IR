We investigate the following question: if a polynomial can be evaluated at
rational points by a polynomial-time boolean algorithm, does it have a
polynomial-size arithmetic circuit? We argue that this question is certainly
difficult. Answering it negatively would indeed imply that the constant-free
versions of the algebraic complexity classes VP and VNP defined by Valiant are
different. Answering this question positively would imply a transfer theorem
from boolean to algebraic complexity. Our proof method relies on Lagrange
interpolation and on recent results connecting the (boolean) counting hierarchy
to algebraic complexity classes. As a byproduct we obtain two additional
results: (i) The constant-free, degree-unbounded version of Valiant's
hypothesis that VP and VNP differ implies the degree-bounded version. This
result was previously known to hold for fields of positive characteristic only.
(ii) If exponential sums of easy to compute polynomials can be computed
efficiently, then the same is true of exponential products. We point out an
application of this result to the P=NP problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of
computation over the field of complex numbers.
