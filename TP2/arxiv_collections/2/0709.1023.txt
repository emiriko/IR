We describe an effective landscape introduced in [1] for the analysis of
Constraint Satisfaction problems, such as Sphere Packing, K-SAT and Graph
Coloring. This geometric construction reexpresses these problems in the more
familiar terms of optimization in rugged energy landscapes. In particular, it
allows one to understand the puzzling fact that unsophisticated programs are
successful well beyond what was considered to be the `hard' transition, and
suggests an algorithm defining a new, higher, easy-hard frontier.
