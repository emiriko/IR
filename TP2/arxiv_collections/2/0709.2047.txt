For a quantum channel with additive Gaussian quantum noise, at the large
input energy side, we prove that the one shot capacity is achieved by the
thermal noise state for all Gaussian state inputs, it is also true for
non-Gaussian input in the sense of first order perturbation. For a general case
of $n$ copies input, we show that up to first order perturbation, any
non-Gaussian perturbation to the product thermal state input has a less quantum
information transmission rate when the input energy tend to infinitive.
