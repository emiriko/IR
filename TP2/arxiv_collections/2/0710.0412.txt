Several analytic approaches predict for SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theories in Landau
gauge an enhanced ghost propagator G(p^2) and a suppressed gluon propagator
D(p^2) at small momenta. This prediction applies to two, three and four
space-time dimensions. Moreover, the gluon propagator is predicted to be null
at p = 0. Numerical studies by several groups indeed support an enhanced ghost
propagator when compared to the tree-level behavior $1/p^2$ and a finite
infrared gluon propagator. However, the agreement between analytic and
numerical studies is only at the qualitative level in three and in four
dimensions. In particular, the infrared exponent of the ghost propagator seems
to be smaller than the one predicted analytically and the gluon propagator
seems to display a (finite) nonzero value at zero momentum. It has been argued
that this discrepancy might go away once simulations are done on much larger
lattice sizes than the ones used up to now. Here we present data in three and
four space-time dimensions using huge lattices in the scaling region, i.e. up
to 320^3 at beta = 3.0 and up to 128^4 at beta = 2.2, corresponding to V
\approx (85 fm)^3 and V \approx (27 fm)^4. Simulations have been done on the
IBM supercomputer at the University of Sao Paulo
