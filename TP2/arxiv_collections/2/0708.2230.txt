We consider approximating data structures with collections of the items that
they contain. For examples, lists, binary trees, tuples, etc, can be
approximated by sets or multisets of the items within them. Such approximations
can be used to provide partial correctness properties of logic programs. For
example, one might wish to specify than whenever the atom $sort(t,s)$ is proved
then the two lists $t$ and $s$ contain the same multiset of items (that is, $s$
is a permutation of $t$). If sorting removes duplicates, then one would like to
infer that the sets of items underlying $t$ and $s$ are the same. Such results
could be useful to have if they can be determined statically and automatically.
We present a scheme by which such collection analysis can be structured and
automated. Central to this scheme is the use of linear logic as a omputational
logic underlying the logic of Horn clauses.
