Fluorescence microscopy is an important and extensively utilised tool for
imaging biological systems. However, the image resolution that can be obtained
has a limit as defined through the laws of diffraction. Demand for improved
resolution has stimulated research into developing methods to image beyond the
diffraction limit based on far-field fluorescence microscopy techniques. Rapid
progress is being made in this area of science with methods emerging that
enable fluorescence imaging in the far-field to possess a resolution well
beyond the diffraction limit. This review outlines developments in far-field
fluorescence methods which enable ultrahigh resolution imaging and application
of these techniques to biology. Future possible trends and directions in
far-field fluorescence imaging with ultrahigh resolution are also outlined.
