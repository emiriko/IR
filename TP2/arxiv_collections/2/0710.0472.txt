We discuss solution generating techniques treating stationary and axially
symmetric metrics in the presence of a cosmological constant. Using the
recently found extended form of Ernst's complex equation, which takes into
account the cosmological constant term, we propose an extension of spheroidal
coordinates adapted to asymptotically de-Sitter and anti de-Sitter static
spacetimes. In the absence of a cosmological constant we show in addition that
any higher dimensional metric parametrised by a single angular momentum can be
given by a 4 dimensional solution and Weyl potentials parametrising the extra
Killing directions. We explicitly show how a stationary, and a static axially
symmetric spacetime solution in 4 dimensions, can be {\it added} together to
give a 5 dimensional stationary and axisymmetric solution.
