We address the constraints on the SUSY seesaw parameters arising from Lepton
Flavour Violation observables. Working in the Constrained Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model extended by three right-handed (s)neutrinos, we
study the predictions for the branching ratios of $l_j \to l_i \gamma$ and $l_j
\to 3 l_i$ channels. We impose compatibility with neutrino data, electric
dipole moment bounds, and further require a successful baryon asymmetry of the
Universe (via thermal leptogenesis). We emphasise the interesting interplay
between $\theta_{13}$ and the LFV muon decays, pointing out the hints on the
SUSY seesaw parameters that can arise from measurements of $\theta_{13}$ and
LFV branching ratios. This is a brief summary of the work of Ref.
\cite{Antusch:2006vw}.
