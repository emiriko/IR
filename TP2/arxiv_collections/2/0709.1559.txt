We construct Koppelman formulas on Grassmannians for forms with values in any
holomorphic line bundle as well as in the tautological vector bundle and its
dual. As a consequence we obtain some vanishing theorems of the Bott-Borel-Weil
type. We also relate the projection part of our formulas to the Bergman kernels
associated to the line bundles.
