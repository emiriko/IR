We show that Fokker-Planck equation for chordal SLE process under a simple
rescaling of the probability density can be traced to the minisuperspace
Wheeler-de Witt equation for boundary operator in 2d Liouville gravity.
Insertion of an operator, calculating SLE critical exponent, corresponds to
adding matter contribution to WdW equation. This observation may be useful for
understanding of why SLE critical exponents are given by KPZ gravitational
scaling dimensions. Possible applications of the obtained relation are
discussed.
