General thermodynamic theory of metastable states is used in this short note
to try to understand better atmospheric instabilities. It is shown that not
only cooling of a cloud can lead to rain, but heating also, especially when
there are charged water drops in a cloud (in this case we have rain with
lightning). The influence of the global warming on weather is discussed.
