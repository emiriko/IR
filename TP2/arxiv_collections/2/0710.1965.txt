We have investigated space syntax of Venice by means of random walks. Random
walks being defined on an undirected graph establish the Euclidean space in
which distances and angles between nodes acquire the clear statistical
interpretation. The properties of nodes with respect to random walks allow
partitioning the city canal network into disjoint divisions which may be
identified with the traditional divisions of the city (sestieri).
