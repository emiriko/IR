Cody & Waite argument reduction technique works perfectly for reasonably
large arguments but as the input grows there are no bit left to approximate the
constant with enough accuracy. Under mild assumptions, we show that the result
computed with a fused-multiply-add provides a fully accurate result for many
possible values of the input with a constant almost accurate to the full
working precision. We also present an algorithm for a fully accurate second
reduction step to reach double full accuracy (all the significand bits of two
numbers are significant) even in the worst cases of argument reduction. Our
work recalls the common algorithms and presents proofs of correctness. All the
proofs are formally verified using the Coq automatic proof checker.
