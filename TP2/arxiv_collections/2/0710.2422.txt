We study the transverse-momentum (q_T) and rapidity (y) distributions of the
Higgs boson in perturbative QCD, including the most advanced theoretical
information presently available: fixed-order perturbation theory at
Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in the large-q_T region (q_T ~ M_H, being M_H the
Higgs mass), and soft-gluon resummation at the Next-to-Next-to-Leading
Logarithmic accuracy (NNLL) in the small-q_T region (q_T << M_H). We present
numerical results for the doubly-differential (q_T and y) cross section for the
production of a Standard Model Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
