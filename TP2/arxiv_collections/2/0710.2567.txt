We study quantum states of electrons in magnetically doped quantum dots as a
function of exchange coupling between electron and impurity spins, the strength
of Coulomb interaction, confining potential, and the number of electrons. The
magnetic phase diagram of quantum dots, doped with a large number of magnetic
Mn impurities, can be described by the energy gap in the spectrum of electrons
and the mean field electron-Mn exchange coupling. A competition between these
two parameters leads to a transition between spin-unpolarized and
spin-polarized states, in the absence of applied magnetic field. Tuning the
energy gap by electrostatic control of nonparabolicity of the confining
potential can enable control of magnetization even at the fixed number of
electrons. We illustrate our findings by directly comparing Mn-doped quantum
dots with parabolic and Gaussian confining potential.
