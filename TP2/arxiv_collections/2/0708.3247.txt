A new integrable sixth-order nonlinear wave equation is discovered by means
of the Painleve analysis, which is equivalent to the Korteweg - de Vries
equation with a source. A Lax representation and a Backlund self-transformation
are found of the new equation, and its travelling wave solutions and
generalized symmetries are studied.
