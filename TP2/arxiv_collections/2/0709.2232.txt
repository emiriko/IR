We present a complete calculation of the QCD and SUSY-QCD corrections to
neutralino pair annihilation into bottom quark-antiquark pairs through exchange
of a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, which is the dominant process in the
cosmological A-funnel region of the mSUGRA model. We present numerical
predictions for the annihilation cross section and discuss the influence of the
correction terms on the cold dark matter relic density with respect to recent
cosmological data.
