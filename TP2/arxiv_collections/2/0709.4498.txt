Neutrino oscillation is the only known phenomenon for physics beyond the
standard model. To investigate this phenomenon, the understanding of low energy
neutrino scattering (200<E<2000 MeV) is the crucial task for high energy
physicists. In this energy region, the charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE)
neutrino interaction is the dominant process, and experiments require a precise
model to predict signal samples. Using a high-statistics sample of muon
neutrino CCQE events, MiniBooNE finds that a simple Fermi gas model, with
appropriate adjustments, accurately characterizes the CCQE events on carbon.
The extracted parameters include an effective axial mass, MA=1.23 +- 0.20 GeV,
and a Pauli-blocking parameter, kappa = 1.019 +- 0.011.
