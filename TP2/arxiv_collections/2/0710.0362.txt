We investigate possibilities for dynamical P-parity violation in dense baryon
matter in the framework of effective quark models. Dynamical P-parity violation
can appear in models with at least two scalar and two pseudoscalar fields,
where both scalar fields are condensed at normal conditions. At special
configurations of coupling constants, one of pseudoscalar fields can then also
condense at some value of baryon density, the phenomenon results in mixing of
the scalar and pseudoscalar physical degrees of freedom, hence, giving rise to
P-parity violation. We discuss the implications and possible experimental
signatures for P-parity violation in strong interactions in future experiments
with heavy-ion collisions.
