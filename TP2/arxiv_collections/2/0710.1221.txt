Spatially extended localized spins can interact via indirect exchange
interaction through Friedel oscillations in the Fermi sea. In arrays of
localized spins such interaction can lead to a magnetically ordered phase.
Without external magnetic field such a phase is well understood via a
"two-impurity" Kondo model. Here we employ non-equilibrium transport
spectroscopy to investigate the role of the orbital phase of conduction
electrons on the magnetic state of a spin lattice. We show experimentally, that
even tiniest perpendicular magnetic field can influence the magnitude of the
inter-spin magnetic exchange.
