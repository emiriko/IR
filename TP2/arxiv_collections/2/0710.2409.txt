The main production mechanism for supersymmetric Higgs particles at hadron
colliders crucially depends on the size of their Yukawa couplings to bottom
quarks. For sufficiently large tan(beta) the total cross section for some of
the neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM is dominated by bottom-quark fusion. After
an introduction to bottom-associated Higgs production, we discuss the complete
O(alpha) electroweak and O(alpha_s) strong corrections for the bb-fusion
channel in the MSSM. Choosing proper renormalization and input-parameter
schemes, an improved Born approximation, constructed from previously known
results, can absorb the bulk of the corrections so that the remaining
non-universal corrections are typically of the order of a few per cent.
Numerical results are discussed for the SPS benchmark scenarios.
