We formulate and approximately solve a specific many-body generalization of
the Landau-Zener problem. Unlike with the single particle Landau-Zener problem,
our system does not abide in the adiabatic ground state, even at very slow
driving rates. The structure of the theory suggests that this finding reflects
a more general phenomenon in the physics of adiabatically driven many particle
systems. Our solution can be used to understand, for example, the behavior of
two-level systems coupled to an electromagnetic field, as realized in cavity
QED experiments.
