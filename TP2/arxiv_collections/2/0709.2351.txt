The superconductor UCoGe is analyzed with electronic structure calculations
using Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method based on Density Functional
Theory. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic calculations with and without
correlations (via LDA+U) were done. In this compound the Fermi level is
situated in a region where the main contribution to DOS comes from the U-5f
orbital. The magnetic moment is mainly due to the Co-3d orbital with a small
contribution from the U-5f orbital. The possibility of fully non-collinear
magnetism in this compound seems to be ruled out. These results are compared
with the isostructural compound URhGe, in this case the magnetism comes mostly
from the U-5f orbital.
