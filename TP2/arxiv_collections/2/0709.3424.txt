Exciton-polaron formation in one-dimensional lattice models with short or
long-range carrier-phonon interaction is studied by quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Depending on the relative sign of electron and hole-phonon
coupling, the exciton-polaron size increases or decreases with increasing
interaction strength. Quantum phonon fluctuations determine the
(exciton-)polaron size and yield translation-invariant states at all finite
couplings.
