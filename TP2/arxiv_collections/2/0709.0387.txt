We present the analytical approach to scalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere
which has been developed in arXiv:0706.2493 [hep-th]. This approach is based on
considering a perturbative expansion of the kinetic term in the partition
function. After truncating this expansion at second order, one arrives at a
multitrace matrix model, which allows for an application of the saddle-point
method. The results are in agreement with the numerical findings in the
literature.
