The construction of the ATLAS electromagnetic liquid argon calorimeter
modules is completed and all the modules are assembled and inserted in the
cryostats. During the production period four barrel and three endcap modules
were exposed to test beams in order to assess their performance, ascertain the
production quality and reproducibility, and to scrutinize the complete energy
reconstruction chain from the readout and calibration electronics to the signal
and energy reconstruction. It was also possible to check the full Monte Carlo
simulation of the calorimeter. The analysis of the uniformity, resolution and
extraction of constant term is presented. Typical non-uniformities of 0.5% and
typical global constant terms of 0.6% are measured for the barrel and end-cap
modules.
