II-oxide and III-nitride semiconductors doped by nonmagnetic 2p light
elements are investigated as potential dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS).
Based on our first-principle calculations, nitrogen doped ZnO, carbon doped
ZnO, and carbon doped AlN are predicted to be ferromagnetic. The ferromagnetism
of such DMS materials can be attributed to a p-d exchange-like p-p coupling
interaction which is derived from the similar symmetry and wave function
between the impurity (p-like t_2) and valence (p) states. We also propose a
co-doping mechanism, using beryllium and nitrogen as dopants in ZnO, to enhance
the ferromagnetic coupling and to increase the solubility and activity.
