We present the results of an extensive analysis of lepton flavour violating
decays in the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT). As lepton flavour
violation is highly suppressed in the Standard Model by small neutrino masses,
the LHT effects turn out to be naturally huge and could be seen in the near
future experiments.
