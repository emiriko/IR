Dynamics of molecular motor dimers, consisting of rigidly bound particles
that move along two parallel lattices and interact with underlying molecular
tracks, is investigated theoretically by analyzing discrete-state stochastic
continuous-time burnt-bridge models. In these models the motion of molecular
motors is viewed as a random walk along the lattices with periodically
distributed weak links (bridges). When the particle crosses the weak link it
can be destroyed with a probability $p$, driving the molecular motor motion in
one direction. Dynamic properties and effective generated forces of dimer
molecular motors are calculated exactly as a function of a concentration of
bridges $c$ and burning probability $p$ and compared with properties of the
monomer motors. It is found that the ratio of the velocities of the dimer and
the monomer can never exceed 2, while the dispersions of the dimer and the
monomer are not very different. The relative effective generated force of the
dimer (as compared to the monomer) also cannot be larger than 2 for most sets
of parameters. However, a very large force can be produced by the dimer in the
special case of $c=1/2$ for non-zero shift between the lattices. Our
calculations do not show the significant increase in the force generated by
collagenase motor proteins in real biological systems as predicted by previous
computational studies. The observed behavior of dimer molecular motors is
discussed by considering in detail the particle dynamics near burnt bridges.
