Phase transitions between the quantum spin Hall and the insulator phases in
three dimensions are studied. We find that in inversion-asymmetric systems
there appears a gapless phase between the quantum spin Hall and insulator
phases in three dimensions, which is in contrast with the two-dimensional case.
Existence of this gapless phase stems from a topological nature of gapless
points (diabolical points) in three dimensions, but not in two dimensions.
