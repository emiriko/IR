In the context of a debate on the correct expression of the Hawking
temperature of an expanding cosmological black hole, we show that the correct
expression in terms of the Hawking-Hayward quasi-local energy m of the hole is
T=1/(8\pi m(t)). This expression holds for comoving black holes and agrees with
a recent proposal by Saida, Harada, and Maeda.
