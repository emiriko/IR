By using the measure of concurrence, mode entanglement of an electron moving
in four kinds of one-dimensional determined and random potentials is studied
numerically. The extended and local- ized states can be distinguished by mode
entanglement. There are sharp transitions in concurrence at mobility edges. It
provides that the mode entanglement may be a new index for a metal-insulator
transition.
