Even within the framework of the leading logarithmic approximation the
eigenvalues of the BKP kernel for states of more than three reggeized gluons
are unknown in general, contrary to the planar limit case where the problem
becomes integrable. We consider a 4-gluon kernel for a finite number of colors
and define some simple toy models for the configuration space dynamics, which
are directly solvable with group theoretical methods. Then we study the
dependence of the spectrum of these models with respect to the number of colors
and make comparisons with the large limit case.
