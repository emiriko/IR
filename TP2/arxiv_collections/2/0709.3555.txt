We present a short and intuitive argument explaining why gravity is
non-renormalizable. The argument is based on black-hole domination of the high
energy spectrum of gravity and not on the standard perturbative irrelevance of
the gravitational coupling. This is a pedagogical note, containing textbook
material that is widely appreciated by experts and is by no means original.
