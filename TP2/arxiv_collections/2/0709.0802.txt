Schemes to generate Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) and W states of three
distant atoms are proposed in this paper. The schemes use the effects of
quantum statistics of indistinguishable photons emitted by the atoms inside
optical cavities. The advantages of the schemes are their robustness against
detection inefficiency and asynchronous emission of the photons. Moreover, in
Lamb-Dicke limit, the schemes do not require simultaneous click of the
detectors, this makes the schemes more realizable in experiments.
