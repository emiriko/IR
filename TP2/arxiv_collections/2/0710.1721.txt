We analyze classically defined games for which a quantum team has an
advantage over any classical team. The quantum team has a clear advantage in
games in which the players of each team are separated in space and the quantum
team can use unusually strong correlations of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
type. We present an example of a classically defined game played at one
location for which quantum players have a real advantage.
