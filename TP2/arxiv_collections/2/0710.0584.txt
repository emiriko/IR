Ultrahigh energy cosmic rays provide a unique ground for probing new physics.
In this talk we review the possibility of testing TeV gravity in interactions
of cosmogenic neutrinos and the potential to discover long-lived exotic
particles in nucleon-produced air showers, such as gluinos of split-SUSY models
or staus of supersymmetric models with a gravitino LSP.
