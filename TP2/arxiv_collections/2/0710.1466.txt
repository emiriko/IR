In this note, we present two arguments showing that the classical
\textit{linear adjoint cone restriction conjecture} holds for the class of
functions supported on the cone and invariant under the spatial rotation in all
dimensions. The first is based on a dyadic restriction estimate, while the
second follows from a strengthening version of the Hausdorff-Young inequality
and the H\"older inequality in the Lorentz spaces.
