We study the performance of reactor and superbeam neutrino experiments in the
presence of non-standard interactions (NSI). We find that for some non-standard
terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield conflicting result in the
theta-13 determination, while in other cases, they may agree well with each
other, but the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value.
Throughout our discussion, we pay special attention to the impact of the
complex phases of the NSI parameters and to the observations at the near
detector.
