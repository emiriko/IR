A widely used assumption within the gravitational-wave community has so far
been that a test mass acts like a rigid body for frequencies in the detection
band, i.e. for frequencies far below the first internal resonance. In this
article we demonstrate that localized forces, applied for example by a photon
pressure actuator, can result in a non-negligible elastic deformation of the
test masses. For a photon pressure actuator setup used in the gravitational
wave detector GEO600 we measured that this effect modifies the standard
response function by 10% at 1 kHz and about 100% at 2.5 kHz.
