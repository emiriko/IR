The renormalization scheme for the Wick expansion of a modified version of
the perturbative QCD introduced in previous works is discussed. Massless QCD is
considered, by implementing the usual multiplicative scaling of the gluon and
quark wave functions and vertices. However, also massive quark and gluon
counter-terms are allowed in this mass less theory since the condensates are
expected to generate masses. A natural set of expansion parameters of the
physical quantities is introduced: the coupling itself and to masses $m_q$ and
$m_g$ associated to quarks and gluons respectively. This procedure allows to
implement a dimensional transmutation effect through these new mass scales. A
general expression for the new generating functional in terms of the mass
parameters $m_q$ and $m_g$ is obtained in terms of integrals over arbitrary but
constant gluon or quark fields in each case. Further, the one loop potential,
is evaluated in more detail in the case when only the quark condensate is
retained. This lowest order result again indicates the dynamical generation of
quark condensates in the vacuum.
