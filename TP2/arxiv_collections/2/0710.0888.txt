GaAs:Mn nanowires were obtained on GaAs(001) and GaAs(111)B substrates by
molecular beam epitaxial growth of (Ga,Mn)As at conditions leading to MnAs
phase separation. Their density is proportional to the density of catalyzing
MnAs nanoislands, which can be controlled by the Mn flux and/or the substrate
temperature. Being rooted in the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As, the
nanowires combine one-dimensional properties with the magnetic properties of
(Ga,Mn)As and provide natural, self assembled structures for nanospintronics.
