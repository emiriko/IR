We present first results for a study with two mass-degenerate dynamical
Chirally Improved (CI) fermions on lattices of spatial extent 2.4 fm. The CI
Dirac operator obeys the Ginsparg-Wilson condition in good approximation. The
pion mass we use is still large O(470 MeV) for the 16**3*32 lattices with
lattice spacing of 0.15 fm. The hadron masses are obtained with the variational
technique and the results compared with earlier quenched calculations with
similar lattice parameters. We find indications for the isovector, scalar meson
a0(980) near the experimental value, in contradistinction to quenched results
which always produced a mass value compatible with the first excitation
a0(1450).
