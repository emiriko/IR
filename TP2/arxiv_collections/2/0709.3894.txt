We have realised a semiconductor quantum structure that produces
electroluminescence while operating in the light-matter strong coupling regime.
The mid-infrared light emitting device is composed of a quantum cascade
structure embedded in a planar microcavity, based on the GaAs/AlGaAs material
system. At zero bias, the structure is characterised using reflectivity
measurements which show, up to room temperature, a wide polariton anticrossing
between an intersubband transition and the resonant cavity photon mode. Under
electrical injection the spectral features of the emitted light change
drastically, as electrons are resonantly injected in a reduced part of the
polariton branches. Our experiment demonstrates that electrons can be
selectively injected into polariton states up to room temperature.
