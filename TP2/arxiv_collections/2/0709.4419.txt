The focus of our work is to identify conditions for the presence of an
isotropic-nematic phase transition in the context of a generic system with
isotropic competing interactions. The comment 0709.4205 criticizes our results
by showing that the low temperature fluctuations of a stripe phase in 2d
diverge linearly in the thermodynamic limit. The analysis is restricted to the
stripe phase and does not apply to the central result of our letter. We show,
contrary to what is suggested in the comment, that the model introduced by D.
G. Barci and D. A. Stariolo in PRL98, 200604 (2007) undergoes an
isotropic-nematic phase transition in the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality
class.
