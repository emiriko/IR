Rotating dilaton black hole solution for asymptotically anti-de Sitter
spacetime are obtained in the small angular momentum limit with an appropriate
combination of three Liouville-type dilaton potentials. The angular momentum,
magnetic dipole moment and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole are
determined for arbitrary values of the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling
parameter.
