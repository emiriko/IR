We prove effective equidistribution, with polynomial rate, for large closed
orbits of semisimple groups on homogeneous spaces, under certain technical
restrictions (notably, the acting group should have finite centralizer in the
ambient group). The proofs make extensive use of spectral gaps, and also of a
closing lemma for such actions.
