Nonlocal cosmological models derived from String Field Theory are considered.
A new method for constructing rolling tachyon solutions in the FRW metric in
two field configuration is proposed and solutions of the Friedman equations
with nonlocal operator are presented. The cosmological properties of these
solutions are discussed.
