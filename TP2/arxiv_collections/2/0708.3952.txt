Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p and let G be a
subgroup of Aut(k[[t]]) be a faithful action on a local power series ring over
k. Let R be a discrete valuation ring of characteristic 0 with residue field k.
One asks, whether it is possible to find a faithful action G inside Aut(R[[t]])
which reduces to the given action, i.e. a lift to characteristic 0. We show
that liftable actions exists in the case that G = D_4 and p = 2. In fact we
introduce a family, the supersimple D_4 -actions, which can always be lifted to
characteristic 0.
