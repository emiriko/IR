We analyse the role of the Gribov ambiguity in the construction of physical
charges in gauge theories. It is shown explicitly how the Gribov copies prevent
the construction of physical coloured charges beyond perturbation theory. We
also present a new and manifestly non-perturbative class of Coulomb gauge
Gribov copies.
