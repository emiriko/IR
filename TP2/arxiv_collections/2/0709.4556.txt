Without resorting to spin-spin coupling, we propose a scalable spin quantum
computing scheme assisted with a semiconductor multiple-quantum-dot structure.
The techniques of single electron transitions and the nanostructure of
quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) are used to generate charge entangled
states of two electrons, which are then converted into spin entanglement states
using single-spin rotations only. Deterministic two-qubit quantum gates are
also manipulated using only single-spin rotations with the help of QCA. A
single-shot readout of spin states can be carried out by coupling the multiple
dot structure to a quantum point contact. As a result, deterministic
spin-interaction-free quantum computing can be implemented in semiconductor
nanostructure.
