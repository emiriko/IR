A theorem of Kushnirenko and Bernstein shows that the number of isolated
roots of a system of polynomials in a torus is bounded above by the mixed
volume of the Newton polytopes of the given polynomials, and this upper bound
is generically exact. We improve on this result by introducing refined
combinatorial invariants of polynomials and a generalization of the mixed
volume of convex bodies: the mixed integral of concave functions. The proof is
based on new techniques and results from relative toric geometry.
