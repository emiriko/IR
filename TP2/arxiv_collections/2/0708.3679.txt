A scheme of adiabatic cross-polarization is described. It is based on
demagnetization - remagnetization, when the Zeeman order of abundant nuclei in
the laboratory frame is first adiabatically converted into the dipolar order,
and then, into the Zeeman order of rare nuclei. The scheme, implemented with
two low-power frequency-sweeping pulses, is very efficient for static samples
and can significantly increase polarization of rare nuclei, compared to the
conventional Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization. The experimental examples are
presented for solids, liquid crystal, and molecules in a liquid-crystalline
solvent.
