Unitary evolution from pure initial states to pure final states in pi(-)p->
pi(-)pi(+)n imposes constraints on pion production amplitudes that are violated
by CERN data on polarized target at 17.2 GeV/c. The pion creation is a
non-unitary process arising from a unitary co-evolution of the pion creation
process with a quantum environment. The purpose of this work is to identify the
interacting degrees of freedom of the environment in a high resolution
amplitude analysis of CERN data on polarized target for dipion masses 580-1080
MeV. The S-wave spectra |S|^2 show presence of rho0(770) while P-wave spectra
|L|^2 show a dip at f0(980) mass. The observed rho0(770)-f0(980) mixing is
encoded in all measured density matrix elements which also encode a level
splitting of the spectra arising from the interaction of the pion creation
process with the environment. The analytical form of the level splitting
reveals the existence of a new quantum number characterizing the environment.
We propose a model for the CPT violating interaction of the pion creation
process with the environment in which non-diagonal transitions between resonant
qqbar modes and pi(-)pi(+) states lead to vector-scalar mixing and a dynamic
entanglement of the pi(-)pi(+) isospin states. The final states pi(-)p(+)n do
not posses CPT cojugate states and the concept of CPT symmetry looses its
meanining.
