Drops deposited on rough and hydrophobic surfaces can stay suspended with gas
pockets underneath the liquid, then showing very low hydrodynamic resistance.
When this superhydrophobic state breaks down, the subsequent wetting process
can show different dynamical properties. A suitable choice of the geometry can
make the wetting front propagate in a stepwise manner leading to {\it
square-shaped} wetted area: the front propagation is slow and the patterned
surface fills by rows through a {\it zipping} mechanism. The multiple time
scale scenario of this wetting process is experimentally characterized and
compared to numerical simulations.
