Properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are evaluated within a
relativistic mean field approximation using density dependent coupling
constants. A parameterization for these coupling constants is presented, which
reproduces the properties of the nucleon self-energy obtained in Dirac
Brueckner Hartree Fock calculations of asymmetric nuclear matter but also
provides a good description for bulk properties of finite nuclei. The
inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz
cells, which allows for a microscopic description of the structures in the
so-called ``pasta-phase'' of nuclear configurations and provides a smooth
transition to the limit of homogeneous matter. The effects of pairing
properties and finite temperature are considered. A comparison is made to
corresponding results employing the phenomenological Skyrme Hartree-Fock
approach and the consequences for the Thomas-Fermi approximation are discussed.
