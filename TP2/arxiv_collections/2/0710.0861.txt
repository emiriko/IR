We report an experimental study of the elastic properties of a
two-dimensional (2D) colloidal crystal subjected to light-induced substrate
potentials. In agreement with recent theoretical predictions [H.H. von
Gruenberg and J. Baumgartl, Phys. Rev. E 75, 051406 (2007)] the phonon band
structure of such systems can be tuned depending on the symmetry and depth of
the substrate potential. Calculations with binary crystals suggest that
phononic band engineering can be also performed by variations of the pair
potential and thus opens novel perspectives for the fabrication of phononic
crystals with band gaps tunable by external fields.
