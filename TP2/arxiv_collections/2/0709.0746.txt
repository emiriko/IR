These are lectures notes for the introductory graduate courses on geometric
complexity theory (GCT) in the computer science department, the university of
Chicago. Part I consists of the lecture notes for the course given by the first
author in the spring quarter, 2007. It gives introduction to the basic
structure of GCT. Part II consists of the lecture notes for the course given by
the second author in the spring quarter, 2003. It gives introduction to
invariant theory with a view towards GCT. No background in algebraic geometry
or representation theory is assumed. These lecture notes in conjunction with
the article \cite{GCTflip1}, which describes in detail the basic plan of GCT
based on the principle called the flip, should provide a high level picture of
GCT assuming familiarity with only basic notions of algebra, such as groups,
rings, fields etc.
