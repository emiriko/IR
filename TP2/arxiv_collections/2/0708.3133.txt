The surprise discovery of superconductivity below 5K in sodium cobalt oxides
when hydrated with water has caught the attention of experimentalists and
theorists alike. Most explanations for its occurence have focused heavily on
the properties of some small elliptically shaped pockets predicted to be the
electronically dominant Fermi surface sheet, but direct attempts to look for
them have instead cast serious doubts over their existence. Here we present
evidence that these pockets do indeed exist, based on bulk measurements of the
electron momentum distribution in unhydrated and hydrated sodium cobalt oxides
using the technique of x-ray Compton scattering.
