Impact of the cone algorithm parameters Ecut, Eseed, R on the efficiency and
characteristics of the reconstructed jets in p-p collisions at the energy sqrt
s = 200 GeV is studied. The PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator is used for event
generation. The dependence of dijet production fraction on the parton
transverse momentum at different algorithm parameters is analyzed. The
dependence of reconstruction efficiency of parton energy in dijet events and
two leading jets in N-jet events on Ecut, Eseed, R is studied. Monte Carlo
results are compared with predictions made in the framework of z-scaling and
experimental data obtained at RHIC. The independence of the slope parameter
beta of the scaling function, on the algorithm parameters over the energy range
ETJet=25-60 GeV is found. The strong dependence of the invariant cross section
and the slope parameter on the algorithm parameters with decreasing of ETJet
for ETJet<25 GeV is observed.
