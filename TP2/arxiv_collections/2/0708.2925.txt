Nuclear spin-dependent parity violation arises from weak interactions between
electrons and nucleons, and from nuclear anapole moments. We outline a method
to measure such effects, using a Stark-interference technique to determine the
mixing between opposite-parity rotational/hyperfine levels of ground-state
molecules. The technique is applicable to nuclei over a wide range of atomic
number, in diatomic species that are theoretically tractable for
interpretation. This should provide data on anapole moments of many nuclei, and
on previously unmeasured neutral weak couplings.
