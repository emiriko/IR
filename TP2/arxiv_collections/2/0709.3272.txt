We study the azimuthal asymmetric distribution of hadrons inside a high
energy jet in the single transverse polarized proton proton scattering, coming
from the Collins effect multiplied by the quark transversity distribution. We
argue that the Collins function in this process is the same as that in the
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The experimental study of this
process will provide us important information on the quark transversity
distribution and test the universality of the fragmentation functions.
