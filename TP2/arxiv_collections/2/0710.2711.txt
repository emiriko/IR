We present an approach for the highly sensitive photon detection based on the
quantum dots (QDs) operating at temperature of 77K. The detection structure is
based on an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double barrier resonant tunneling diode combined
with a layer of self-assembled InAs QDs (QD-RTD). A photon rate of 115 photons
per second had induced 10nA photocurrent in this structure, corresponding to
the photo-excited carrier multiplication factor of 10^7. This high
multiplication factor is achieved by the quantum dot induced memory effect and
the resonant tunneling tuning effect of QD-RTD structure.
