A detailed analysis of $Z^{'0}Z^{'0}$, $K^{+}K^{-}$ and $K^{0}\bar{K}^{0}$
pair production in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions is presented by using helicity
amplitudes. The trilinear bosons couplings in the $SU(3)_{C}\otimes
SU(3)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{X}$ models without exotic electric charges are also
calculated. We carry out the mentioned analysis for two models, one of them is
a one family model which is an $E_6$ subgroup \cite{b1} and the other one is a
three family model with right handed neutrinos\cite{b2,b3}. These models do not
contain exotic electric charges. For them, we give explicit formulae and the
corresponding numerical estimates of the cross-sections and angular
distributions occurred in the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\to Z^{'0}Z^{'0}$,
$e^{+}e^{-} \to K^{+}K^{-}$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\to K^{0}\bar{K}^{0}$ present in our
models. We suppose these processes are invariant under $C$, $P$ and $T$
transformation.
