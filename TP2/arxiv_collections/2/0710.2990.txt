It is shown that the action for Hamiltonian equations of motion can be
brought into invariant symplectic form. In other words, it can be formulated
directly in terms of the symplectic structure $\omega$ without any need to
choose some 1-form $\gamma$, such that $\omega= d \gamma$, which is not unique
and does not even generally exist in a global sense.
