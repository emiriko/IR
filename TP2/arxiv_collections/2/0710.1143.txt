This paper reports a novel single mode source of narrow-band entangled photon
pairs at telecom wavelengths under continuous wave excitation, based on
parametric down conversion. For only 7 mW of pump power it has a created
spectral radiance of 0.08 pairs per coherence length and a bandwidth of 10 pm
(1.2 GHz). The effectively emitted spectral brightness reaches 3.9*10^5 pairs
/(s pm). Furthermore, when combined with low jitter single photon detectors,
such sources allow for the implementation of quantum communication protocols
without any active synchronization or path length stabilization. A HOM-Dip with
photons from two autonomous CW sources has been realized demonstrating the
setup's stability and performance.
