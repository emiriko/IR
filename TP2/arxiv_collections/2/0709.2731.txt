We investigate crystalline order on a two-dimensional paraboloid of
revolution by assembling a single layer of millimeter-sized soap bubbles on the
surface of a rotating liquid, thus extending the classic work of Bragg and Nye
on planar soap bubble rafts. Topological constraints require crystalline
configurations to contain a certain minimum number of topological defects such
as disclinations or grain boundary scars whose structure is analyzed as a
function of the aspect ratio of the paraboloid. We find the defect structure to
agree with theoretical predictions and propose a mechanism for scar nucleation
in the presence of large Gaussian curvature.
