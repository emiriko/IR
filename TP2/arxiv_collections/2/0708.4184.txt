We present an optimal scheme to realize the transformations between single
copies of two bipartite entangled states without classical communication
between the sharing parties. The scheme achieves the upper bound for the
success probabilities [PRA 63, 022301 (2001), PRL 83, 1455 (1999)] of
generating maximally entangled states if applied to entanglement concentration.
Such strategy also dispenses with the interaction with an ancilla system in the
implementation. We also show that classical communications are indispensable in
realizing the deterministic transformations of a single bipartite entangled
state. With a finite number of identical pairs of two entangled bosons, on the
other hand, we can realize the deterministic transformation to any target
entangled state of equal or less Schmidt rank through an extension of the
scheme.
