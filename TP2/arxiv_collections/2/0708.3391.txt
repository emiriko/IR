Using the geometric entanglement measure, we study the scaling of
multipartite entanglement in several 1D models at criticality, specifically the
linear harmonic chain and the XY spin chain encompassing both the Ising and XX
critical models. Our results provide convincing evidence that 1D models at
criticality exhibit a universal logarithmic scaling behavior ~(c/12)log l in
the multipartite entanglement per region for a partition of the system into
regions of size l, where c is the central charge of the corresponding
universality class in conformal field theory.
