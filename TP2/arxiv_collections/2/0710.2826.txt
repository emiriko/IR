Ferromagnetic resonance has been used to study the magnetic properties and
magnetization dynamics of polycrystalline Fe$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$ alloy films with
$0\leq x < 0.7$. Films were produced by co-sputtering from separate Fe and V
targets, leading to a composition gradient across a Si substrate. FMR studies
were conducted at room temperature with a broadband coplanar waveguide at
frequencies up to 50 GHz using the flip-chip method. The effective
demagnetization field $4 \pi M_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and the Gilbert damping
parameter $\alpha$ have been determined as a function of V concentration. The
results are compared to those of epitaxial FeV films.
