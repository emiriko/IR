It is generally assumed that the physical vacuum of particle physics should
be characterized by an energy momentum tensor in such a way to preserve exact
Lorentz invariance. On the other hand, if the ground state were characterized
by its energy-momentum vector, with zero spatial momentum and a non-zero
energy, the vacuum would represent a preferred frame. Since both theoretical
approaches have their own good motivations, we propose an experimental test to
decide between the two scenarios.
