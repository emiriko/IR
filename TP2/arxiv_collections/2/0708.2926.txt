This talk was about the frustration-induced criticality in the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-leg ladder with exchange
interactions along the chains, rungs, and diagonals, and also about the effect
of thermal fluctuations on this criticlity. The method used is the bond
mean-field theory, which is based on the Jordan-Wigner transformation in
dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we will summarize the main results
presented in this talk, and report on new results about the couplings and
temperature dependences of the spin susceptibility.
