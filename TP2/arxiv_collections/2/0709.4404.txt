We address the relaxation dynamics in hydrogen-bonded super-cooled liquids
near the glass transition, measured via Broad-Band Dielectric Spectroscopy
(BDS). We propose a theory based on decomposing the relaxation of the
macroscopic dipole moment into contributions from hydrogen bonded clusters of
$s$ molecules, with $s_{min}\le s \le s_{max}$. The existence of $s_{max}$ is
due to dynamical arrest and its value may depend on the cooling protocol and on
the aging time. The existence of $s_{max}$ is translated into a sum-rule on the
concentrations of clusters of size $s$. We construct the statistical mechanics
of the super-cooled liquid subject to this sum-rule as a constraint, to
estimate the temperature-dependent density of clusters of size $s$. With a
theoretical estimate of the relaxation time of each cluster we provide
predictions for the real and imaginary part of the frequency dependent
dielectric response. The predicted spectra and their temperature dependence are
in accord with measurements, explaining a host of phenomenological fits like
the Vogel-Fulcher fit and the stretched exponential fit. Using glycerol as a
particular example we demonstrate quantitative correspondence between theory
and experiments. The theory also demonstrates that the $\alpha$ peak and the
"excess wing" stem from the same physics in this material. The theory also
shows that in other hydrogen -bonded glass formers the "excess wing" can
develop into a $\beta$ peak, depending on the molecular material parameters
(predominantly the surface energy of the clusters). We thus argue that $\alpha$
and $\beta$ peaks can stem from the same physics. Finally we address the BDS in
constrained geometries (pores) and explain why recent experiments on glycerol
did not show a deviation from bul k spectra.
