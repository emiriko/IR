Using a holographic dual model of QCD, we compute the pion electromagnetic
form factor F_pi(Q^2) in the spacelike momentum transfer region, as well as
pion couplings to vector mesons g_rho^(n) pi pi. Spontaneous and explicit
chiral symmetry breaking are intrinsic features of this particular holographic
model. We consider variants with both ``hard-wall'' and ``soft-wall'' infrared
cutoffs, and find that the F_pi(Q^2) data tend to lie closer to the hard-wall
model predictions, although both are too shallow for large Q^2. By allowing the
parameters of the soft-wall model (originally fixed by observables such as
m_rho) to vary, one finds fits that tend to agree better with F_pi(Q^2). We
also compute the pion charge radius <r_pi^2> for a variety of parameter
choices, and use the values of f^(n)_rho, g_{rho^(n) pi pi} and m^(n)_rho to
observe the saturation of F_pi(0) by rho poles.
