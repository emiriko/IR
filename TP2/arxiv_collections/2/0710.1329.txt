Rational conformal field theories produce a tower of finite-dimensional
representations of surface mapping class groups, acting on the conformal blocks
of the theory. We review this formalism. We show that many recent mathematical
developments can be fit into the first 2 floors of this tower. We also review
what is known in higher genus.
