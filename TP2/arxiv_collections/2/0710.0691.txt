We calculate the electromagnetic contribution to the pion mass difference,
$\Delta m^2_\pi=m^2_{\pi^+}-m^2_{\pi^0}$, in the chiral limit through the
$VV-AA$ type vacuum polarization using Das-Guralnik-Mathur-Low-Young (DGMLY)
sum rule. The calculation is made with two-flavors of dynamical overlap
fermions on a $16^3\times 32$ lattice at $a\sim$0.12 fm. The exact chiral
symmetry of the overlap fermion is essential to control the systematic error in
the difference $VV-AA$. We obtain $\Delta m_\pi^2 = 1024(100) {\rm MeV^2}$
combining the lattice data with the perturbative contribution in the high
momentum region evaluated by the operator product expansion. By analyzing the
momentum dependence of the vacuum polarization, we also obtain pion decay
constant $f_\pi$ and the low-energy constants $L_{10}^r$ in the chiral limit.
