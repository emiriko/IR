The role of Pauli potentials in the semiclassical simulation of Fermi gases
at low temperatures is investigated. An alternative Pauli potential to the
usual bivariate Gaussian form by Dorso et al. is proposed. This new Pauli
potential allows for a simultaneous good reproduction of not only the kinetic
energy per particle but also the momentum distribution and the two-body
correlation function. The reproduction of the binding energies in finite nuclei
in the low and medium mass range is also analyzed. What is found is that given
a reasonable short-range atractive nuclear interaction one can include
correlation effects in a suitable chosen density dependent Pauli potential.
