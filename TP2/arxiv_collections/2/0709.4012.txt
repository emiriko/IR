Assessing the vulnerability of a large set of buildings using sophisticated
methods can be very time consuming and at a prohibitive cost, particularly for
a moderate seismic hazard country like France. We propose here a low-cost
analysis using an experimental approach to extract the elastic behaviour of
existing buildings. An elastic modal model is proposed for the different types
of building tested in Grenoble (France) thanks to their experimental modal
parameters (resonance frequencies, modal shapes and damping), which are
estimated using ambient vibrations surveys. Sixty buildings of various types
were recorded. The building integrity is then calculated considering an
accelerogram scenario provided by seismologists as input and considering an
integrity threshold based on the FEMA inter-storey drift limits. Even if the
level of damage remains unknown, we conclude that masonry buildings undergo
more damage (70% of buildings damaged) than RC buildings. Finally, extracting
modal parameters from ambient vibration recordings allows us to define, for
each class of building, its ability to support seismic deformation in case of
earthquake.
