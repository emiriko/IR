Tau decays into hadrons have a twofold interest: On the one hand, they are a
clean environment for studying the hadronization of the left-handed current of
QCD, while, on the other side, provide relevant dynamical information of the
resonances that mediate these processes. Within an effective field theory-like
framework, namely Resonance Chiral Theory, we analyse the decays ot the tau
into K K pion modes and compare the results with CLEO and BaBar data. In this
way, we provide bounds on the couplings entering our Lagrangian and predict the
corresponding spectral functions. As a main result -and contrary to the bulk of
theoretical studies and experimental analyses- we find vector current dominance
on these decays.
