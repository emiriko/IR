In this paper, authors successfully construct a new algorithm for the new
higher order scheme of weak approximation of SDEs. The algorithm presented here
is based on [1][2]. Although this algorithm shares some features with the
algorithm presented by [3], algorithms themselves are completely different and
the diversity is not trivial. They apply this new algorithm to the problem of
pricing Asian options under the Heston stochastic volatility model and obtain
encouraging results.
