We propose an exactly solvable model for the dynamics of voters in a
two-party system. The opinion formation process is modeled on a random network
of agents. The dynamical nature of interpersonal relations is also reflected in
the model, as the connections in the network evolve with the dynamics of the
voters. In the infinite time limit, an exact solution predicts the emergence of
consensus, for arbitrary initial conditions. However, before consensus is
reached, two different metastable states can persist for exponentially long
times. One state reflects a perfect balancing of opinions, the other reflects a
completely static situation. An estimate of the associated lifetimes suggests
that lack of consensus is typical for large systems.
