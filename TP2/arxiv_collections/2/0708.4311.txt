When Kurt Goedel layed the foundations of theoretical computer science in
1931, he also introduced essential concepts of the theory of Artificial
Intelligence (AI). Although much of subsequent AI research has focused on
heuristics, which still play a major role in many practical AI applications, in
the new millennium AI theory has finally become a full-fledged formal science,
with important optimality results for embodied agents living in unknown
environments, obtained through a combination of theory a la Goedel and
probability theory. Here we look back at important milestones of AI history,
mention essential recent results, and speculate about what we may expect from
the next 25 years, emphasizing the significance of the ongoing dramatic
hardware speedups, and discussing Goedel-inspired, self-referential,
self-improving universal problem solvers.
