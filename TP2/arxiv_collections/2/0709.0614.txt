Utilizing recent DIS measurements (F_{2,L}) and data on dilepton and
high-E_{T} jet production we determine the dynamical parton distributions of
the nucleon generated radiatively from valence-like positive input
distributions at optimally chosen low resolution scales. These are compared
with `standard' distributions generated from positive input distributions at
some fixed and higher resolution scale. It is shown that up to the next to
leading order NLO(\bar{MS}, DIS) of perturbative QCD considered in this paper,
the uncertainties of the dynamical distributions are, as expected, smaller than
those of their standard counterparts. This holds true in particular in the
presently unexplored extremely small-x region relevant for evaluating ultrahigh
energy cross sections in astrophysical applications. It is noted that our new
dynamical distributions are compatible, within the presently determined
uncertainties, with previously determined dynamical parton distributions.
