In this paper the Lorentz transformation for temperature is derived and
discussed. Considering the hyperbolic heat transport equation it is shown that
T(prim) = gamma T, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, T denotes the temperature
in the rest system and T(prim) is the temperature in the moving system (rod).
