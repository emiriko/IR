Many of the open questions beyond the Standard Model will be addressed by the
LHC, including the origin of mass, supersymmetry, dark matter and the
possibility of large extra dimensions. A linear e+ e- collider (LC) with
sufficient centre-of-mass energy would add considerable value to the
capabilities of the LHC.
