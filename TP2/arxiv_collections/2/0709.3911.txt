A classical exchange algebra of the superstring on S^5 with the AdS-time is
shown on the light-like plane. To this end we use the geometrical method of
which consistency is guaranteed by the classical Yang-Baxter equation. The
Dirac method does not work, there being constraints which contain first-class
and second-class and one can disentangle with each other keeping the isometry
hardly.
