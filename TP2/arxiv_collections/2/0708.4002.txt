In 1982 Hawking suggested that quantum fluctuations of space-time metric will
induce a non-unitary evolution from pure initial states to mixed final states
in particle interactions at any energy. This hypothesis can be tested using
existing CERN data on pi(-) p -> pi(-)pi(+) n on polarized target at 17.2
GeV/c. The purity of the final state is controlled by the purity of recoil
nucleon polarization. We develop a spin formalism to calculate expressions for
recoil nucleon polarization for two specific pure initial states. Imposing
conditions of purity on the recoil nuclon polarization we obtain conditions on
the amplitudes which are violated by model independent amplitude analysis of
CERN data at large t. We conclude that pure states can evolve into mixed states
in pi(-) p -> pi(-)pi(+) n. In quantum theory such non-unitary evolution occurs
in open quantum systems interacting with an environment. We present evidence to
validate the view of the pion creation process as an open quantum system
interacting with a quantum environment. The observed process is
time-irreversible and violates CPT symmetry.
