A careful functional treatment of quantum scattering is given using
Schwinger's dynamical principle which involves a functional differentiation
operation applied to a generating functional written in closed form. For long
range interactions, such as for the Coulomb one, it is shown that this
expression may be used to obtain explicitly the asymptotic "free" modified
Green function near the energy shell.
