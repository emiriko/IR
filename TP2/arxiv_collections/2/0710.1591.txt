In this paper we examine a phase transition in $SU(N_{c})$ gauge theories
governed by the existence of an infrared fixed point of the renormalization
group $\beta$ function. The nonlinear integral Schwinger-Dyson equation for a
mass function of massless fermions is solved numerically using the exact
expression of the running coupling in two-loop approximation for an SU(3) gauge
theory. Based on the obtained solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation, the
value of the chiral condensate, $<\bar{q}q>$, and the decay constant,
$f_{\pi}$, of bound states (mesons) are calculated for several values of
fermion flavors $N_{f}$. We show that this kind of phase transition is a
transition of finite order.
