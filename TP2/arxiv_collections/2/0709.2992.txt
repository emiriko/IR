The 2-matrix model has been introduced to study Ising model on random
surfaces. Since then, the link between matrix models and combinatorics of
discrete surfaces has strongly tightened. This manuscript aims to investigate
these deep links and extend them beyond the matrix models, following my work's
evolution. First, I take care to define properly the hermitian 2 matrix model
which gives rise to generating functions of discrete surfaces equipped with a
spin structure. Then, I show how to compute all the terms in the topological
expansion of any observable by using algebraic geometry tools. They are
obtained as differential forms on an algebraic curve associated to the model:
the spectral curve. In a second part, I show how to define such differentials
on any algebraic curve even if it does not come from a matrix model. I then
study their numerous symmetry properties under deformations of the algebraic
curve. In particular, I show that these objects coincide with the topological
expansion of the observable of a matrix model if the algebraic curve is the
spectral curve of this model. Finally, I show that fine tuning the parameters
ensure that these objects can be promoted to modular invariants and satisfy the
holomorphic anomaly equation of the Kodaira-Spencer theory. This gives a new
hint that the Dijkgraaf-Vafa conjecture is correct.
