Granular particles vibrated in a fluid have been found to exhibit
self-organization with attractive and repulsive interactions between the
particles. These interactions have been attributed to the steady streaming flow
around oscillating particles. Here we examine the steady streaming flow
surrounding a vertically oscillating sphere using three dimensional particle
tracking velocimetry. We present measurements of the flow with the sphere far
from boundaries, close to the bottom wall of the tank, and near another
oscillating sphere. The steady velocity field is found to disagree with
available analytic calculations. When the sphere is oscillated near the bottom
wall the entire topology of the flow changes, resulting in a larger repulsive
region than expected. Previous experiments saw attraction between particles in
the region where the flow around a single particle is repulsive. We conclude
that advection in the streaming flow due to a single particle cannot explain
the observed attractive and repulsive interactions, rather non-linear
interactions between the flows around two or more spheres must be responsible.
