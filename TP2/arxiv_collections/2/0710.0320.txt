We investigate manipulation with Andreev bound states in Josephson quantum
point contacts with magnetic scattering. Rabi oscillations in the two-level
Andreev subsystems are excited by resonant driving the direction of magnetic
moment of the scatterer, and by modulating the superconducting phase difference
across the contact. The Andreev level dynamics is manifested by temporal
oscillation of the Josephson current, accompanied, in the case of magnetic
manipulation, also by oscillation of the Andreev states spin polarization. The
interlevel transitions obey a selection rule that forbids manipulations in a
certain region of external parameters, and results from specific properties of
Andreev bound states in magnetic contacts: 4$\pi$-periodicity with respect to
the superconducting phase, and strong spontaneous spin polarization.
