We quantize the set of all quarter BPS brane probe solutions in global AdS_3
\times S^3 \times T^4/K3 found in arxiv:0709.1168 [hep-th]. We show that,
generically, these solutions give rise to states in discrete representations of
the SL(2,R) WZW model on AdS_3. Our procedure provides us with a detailed
description of the low energy 1/4 and 1/2 BPS sectors of string theory on this
background. The 1/4 BPS partition function jumps as we move off the point in
moduli space where the bulk theta angle and NS-NS fields vanish. We show that
generic 1/2 BPS states are protected because they correspond to geodesics
rather than puffed up branes. By exactly quantizing the simplest of the probes
above, we verify our description of 1/4 BPS states and find agreement with the
known spectrum of 1/2 BPS states of the boundary theory. We also consider the
contribution of these probes to the elliptic genus and discuss puzzles, and
their possible resolutions, in reproducing the elliptic genus of the symmetric
product.
