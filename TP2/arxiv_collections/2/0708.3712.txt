In this work, we consider the canonical charmonium assignments for Y(4360)
and Y(4660). Y(4660) is good candidate of $\rm 5 ^3S_1$ $c\bar{c}$ state, the
possibility of Y(4360) as a $\rm 3 ^3D_1$ $c\bar{c}$ state is studied, and the
charmonium hybrid interpretation of Y(4360) can not be excluded completely. We
evaluate the $e^{+}e^{-}$ leptonic widths, E1 transitions, M1 transitions and
the open flavor strong decays of Y(4360) and Y(4660). Experimental tests for
the charmonium assignments are suggested.
