Spin-dipole mediated interactions between tightly confined metastable helium
atoms couple the spin-polarized quintet ${}^{5}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ state to the
singlet ${}^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}$ state from which autoionization is highly
probable, resulting in finite lifetimes for the trap eigenstates. We extend our
earlier study on spherically symmetric harmonic traps to the interesting cases
of axially symmetric anisotropic harmonic traps and report results for the
lowest 10 states in "cigar-like" and "pancake-like" traps with average
frequencies of 100 kHz and 1 MHz. We find that there is a significant
suppression of ionization, and subsequent increase in lifetimes, at trap aspect
ratios $A=p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers, for those states that are
degenerate in the absence of collisions or spin-dipole interactions.
