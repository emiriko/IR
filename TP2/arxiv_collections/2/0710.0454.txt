We look for asymmetries in the angular distributions of events from recent
data on $e^+ +e^-\to p +\bar p +\gamma$ from BABAR collaboration. From first
principles, as the C-invariance of the electromagnetic interaction and the
crossing symmetry, the presence of two-photon exchange would create a forward
backward asymmetry in the data. The analysis of the available data shows no
asymmetry, within an error of 2%. This result is consistent with a
structureless model for the proton, based on a calculation of $e^+ +e^-\to
\mu^+ + \mu^- +\gamma$ with a proper replacement of the muon mass. As no
systematic deviations are seen, we can conclude that these data do not give any
hint of the presence of the two photon contribution, in all the considered
kinematical range.
