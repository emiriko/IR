We present theoretical study of shot noise in single wall metallic carbon
nanotubes weakly coupled to either nonmagnetic or ferromagnetic leads. Using
the real-time diagrammatic technique, we calculate the current, Fano factor and
tunnel magnetoresistance in the sequential tunneling regime. It is shown that
the differential conductance displays characteristic four-fold periodicity,
indicating single-electron charging. Such a periodicity is also visible in
tunnel magnetoresistance of the system as well as in the Fano factor. The
present studies elucidate the impact of ferromagnetic (vs. nonmagnetic)
contacts on the transport characteristics under consideration.
