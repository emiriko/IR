We investigate the effect that Rashba spin-orbit coupling has on the low
energy behaviour of a two dimensional magnetic impurity system. It is shown
that the Kondo effect, the screening of the magnetic impurity at temperatures T
< T_K, is robust against such spin-orbit coupling, despite the fact that the
spin of the conduction electrons is no longer a conserved quantity. A proposal
is made for how the spin-orbit coupling may change the value of the Kondo
temperature T_K in such systems and the prospects of measuring this change are
discussed. We conclude that many of the assumptions made in our analysis
invalidate our results as applied to recent experiments in semi-conductor
quantum dots but may apply to measurements made with magnetic atoms placed on
metallic surfaces.
