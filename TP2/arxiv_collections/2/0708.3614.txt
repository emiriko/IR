Correlated $\Lambda d$ pairs emitted after the absorption of negative kaons
at rest $K^{-}_{stop}A\to \Lambda d A'$ in light nuclei $^6Li$ and $^{12}C$ are
studied. $\Lambda$-hyperons and deuterons are found to be preferentially
emitted in opposite directions. The $\Lambda d$ invariant mass spectrum of
$^6Li$ shows a bump whose mass is 3251$\pm$6 MeV/c$^2$. The bump mass (binding
energy), width and yield are reported. The appearance of a bump is discussed in
the realm of the [$\bar{K}3N$] clustering process in nuclei. The experiment was
performed with the FINUDA spectrometer at DA$\Phi$NE (LNF).
