The electron doped manganite system, Bi0.125Ca0.875MnO3, exhibits large bulk
magnetization of unknown origin. To select amongst possible magnetic ordering
models, we have conducted temperature and magnetic field dependent small-angle
neutron scattering measurements. Nontrivial spin structure has been revealed.
Ferromagnetic spin clusters form in the antiferromagnetic background when
temperature is decreased to Tc~108K. With a further reduction in temperature or
the application of external magnetic field, the clusters begin to form in
larger numbers, which gives an overall enhancement of magnetization below Tc.
