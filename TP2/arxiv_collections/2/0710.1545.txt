The masses and decays of the scalar D_{s0}^*(2317) and axial-vector
D_{s1}^*(2460) charmed strange mesons are calculated consistently in the
hadrogenesis conjecture. These mesons decay either strongly into the
isospin-violating pi^0 D_s and pi^0 D_s^* channels or electromagnetically. They
are generated by coupled-channel dynamics based on the leading order chiral
Lagrangian. The effect of chiral corrections to chiral order Q_\chi^2 is
investigated. We show that taking into account large-N_c relations to determine
the strength of these correction terms implies a measurable signal for an
exotic axial-vector state in the eta D* invariant mass distribution. The
one-loop contribution to the electromagnetic decay amplitudes of scalar and
axial-vector states is calculated. The Lagrangian describing electromagnetic
interactions is obtained by gauging the chiral Lagrangian for hadronic
interactions and adding gauge-invariant correction terms to chiral order
Q_chi^2. In addition the role of light vector meson degrees of freedom is
explored. We confront our results with measured branching ratios. Once the
light vector mesons are included, a natural explanation of all radiative decay
parameters is achieved.
