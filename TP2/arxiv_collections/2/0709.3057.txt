We present a precision calculation of the transverse-momentum and
invariant-mass distributions for supersymmetric particle pair production at
hadron colliders, focusing on Drell-Yan like slepton pair and slepton-sneutrino
associated production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We implement the joint
resummation formalism at the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy with a
process-independent Sudakov form factor, thus ensuring a universal description
of soft-gluon emission, and consistently match the obtained result with the
pure perturbative result at the first order in the strong coupling constant,
i.e. at O(alpha_s). We also implement three different recent parameterizations
of non-perturbative effects. Numerically, we give predictions for ~e_R ~e_R^*
production and compare the resummed cross section with the perturbative result.
The dependence on unphysical scales is found to be reduced, and
non-perturbative contributions remain small.
