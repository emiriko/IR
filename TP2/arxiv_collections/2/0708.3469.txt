We investigate the electronic structure of the InAs/InP quantum dots using an
atomistic pseudopotential method and compare them to those of the InAs/GaAs
QDs. We show that even though the InAs/InP and InAs/GaAs dots have the same dot
material, their electronic structure differ significantly in certain aspects,
especially for holes: (i) The hole levels have a much larger energy spacing in
the InAs/InP dots than in the InAs/GaAs dots of corresponding size. (ii)
Furthermore, in contrast with the InAs/GaAs dots, where the sizeable hole $p$,
$d$ intra-shell level splitting smashes the energy level shell structure, the
InAs/InP QDs have a well defined energy level shell structure with small $p$,
$d$ level splitting, for holes. (iii) The fundamental exciton energies of the
InAs/InP dots are calculated to be around 0.8 eV ($\sim$ 1.55 $\mu$m), about
200 meV lower than those of typical InAs/GaAs QDs, mainly due to the smaller
lattice mismatch in the InAs/InP dots. (iii) The widths of the exciton $P$
shell and $D$ shell are much narrower in the InAs/InP dots than in the
InAs/GaAs dots. (iv) The InAs/GaAs and InAs/InP dots have a reversed light
polarization anisotropy along the [100] and [1$\bar{1}$0] directions.
