In this paper, we present an adaptive investment strategy for environments
with periodic returns on investment. In our approach, we consider an investment
model where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to
invest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset.
Every investment is evaluated in the market via a stylized return on investment
function (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown
periodicities and levels of noise. For comparison reasons, we present two
reference strategies which represent the case of agents with zero-knowledge and
complete-knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. We consider also an
investment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return by
fitting a trend line to previous received returns. To account for the
performance of the different strategies, we perform some computer experiments
to calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain
number of time steps. To assure for fair comparisons, we first tune the
parameters of each strategy. Afterwards, we compare the performance of these
strategies for RoIs with different periodicities and levels of noise.
