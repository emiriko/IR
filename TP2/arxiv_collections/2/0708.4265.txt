Recent results on direct photons and dileptons from the PHENIX experiment
opened up a possibility of landscaping electro-magnetic radiation over various
kinetic energies in heavy ion collisions. Results on direct photon measurement
in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV are discussed from the point of
view of structure function and isospin effect. It is supported by the first
measurement of direct photons at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=62.4GeV in the same
collisional system.
