We investigate the use of beam polarisation as well as final state $\tau$
polarisation effects in probing the interaction of the Higgs boson with a pair
of heavy vector bosons in the process $e^+ e^- \to f \bar f H$, where $f$ is
any light fermion. The sensitivity of the International Linear Collider (ILC)
operating at $\sqrt s=500$ GeV, to such $VVH$($V = W/Z$) couplings is examined
in a model independent way. The effects of ISR and beamstrahlung are discussed.
