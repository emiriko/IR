We consider the statics and dynamics of dark matter-wave solitons in the
dimensionality crossover regime from 3D to 1D. There, using the nonpolynomial
Schr\"{o}dinger mean-field model, we find that the anomalous mode of the
Bogoliubov spectrum has an eigenfrequency which coincides with the soliton
oscillation frequency obtained by the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model. We show that
substantial deviations (of order of 10% or more) from the characteristic
frequency $\omega_{z}/\sqrt{2}$ ($\omega_{z}$ being the longitudinal trap
frequency) are possible even in the purely 1D regime.
