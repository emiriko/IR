Following our previous works on extended higher spin symmetries on the torus
we focus in the present contribution to make a setup of the integrable KdV
hierarchies on $T^{2} = S^{1} \times S^{1}$. Actually two particular systems
are considered, namely the KdV and the Burgers non linear integrable model
associated to currents of conformal weights (2, 2) and (1, 1) respectively. One
key steps towards proving the integrability of these systems is to find their
Lax pair operators. This is explicitly done and a mapping between the two
systems is discussed.
