The notion of a surface-order specific entropy h_c(P) of a two-dimensional
discrete random field P along a curve c is introduced as the limit of rescaled
entropies along lattice approximations of the blowups of c. Existence is shown
by proving a corresponding Shannon-McMillan theorem. We obtain a representation
of h_c(P) as a mixture of specific entropies along the tangent lines of c. As
an application, the specific entropy along curves is used to refine Foellmer
and Ort's lower bound for the large deviations of the empirical field of an
attractive Gibbs measure from its ergodic behavior in the phase-transition
regime.
