The presence of low viscosity layers in the mantle is supported by line of
geological and geophysical observations. Recent high pressure and temperature
investigations indicated that partial carbonate melt should exist at the bottom
of the lithosphere and at 660 km. The presence of few percent carbonate melt
reduces the viscosity by several order of magnitude. The globally existing 660
km very low viscosity layer allows the development of differential rotation
between the upper and lower mantle. This differential rotation between the 660
km outer shell and the rest of the earth offers a plausible explanation for
plate tectonics and for the generation of the earth's magnetic field. Simple
dynamo model is proposed, which able to reproduce all of the features of the
contemporary and, within reasonable uncertainty, the paleomagnetic field. The
model is also consistent with geological and geophysical observations.
