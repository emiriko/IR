We calculate the magnetic-field dependence of the critical current due to
both geometrical edge barriers and bulk pinning in a periodic coplanar array of
narrow superconducting strips. We find that in zero or low applied magnetic
fields the critical current can be considerably enhanced by the edge barriers,
but in modest applied magnetic fields the critical current reduces to that due
to bulk pinning alone.
