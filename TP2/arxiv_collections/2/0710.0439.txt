We report on systematic study of superconducting characteristics and Pr
crystalline-electric-field (CEF) levels of filled-skutterudite \pra ($T_{\rm
c}$ = 2.33 K). The temperature dependences of the upper critical field $H_{\rm
c2}$ and the Ginzburg-Landau (Maki) parameter $\kappa_2$ suggest an s-wave
clean-limit superconductivity. The electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma
\sim 95$ mJ/K$^2$mol, being $\sim 1.5$ times larger than that for \lra,
indicates $4f$-originating quasiparticle mass enhancement. Magnetic
susceptibility $\chi(T)$ indicates that the CEF ground state is a $\Gamma_1$
singlet and a $\Gamma_4^{(1)}$ triplet first excited state lies at $\Delta_{\rm
CEF}\sim 30$ K above. Systematic comparison among \pos, \prs, \pra and La-based
reference compounds suggests that inelastic exchange- and
aspherical-charge-scatterings of conduction electrons from CEF-split $4f$
levels play an essential role for the quasiparticle mass enhancement and the
value of $T_{\rm c}$ in the Pr-based filled skutterudites.
