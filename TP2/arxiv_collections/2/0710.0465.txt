The use of the loudest observed event to generate statistical statements
about rate and strength has become standard in searches for gravitational waves
from compact binaries and pulsars. The Bayesian formulation of the method is
generalized in this paper to allow for uncertainties both in the background
estimate and in the properties of the population being constrained. The method
is also extended to allow rate interval construction. Finally, it is shown how
to combine the results from multiple experiments and a comparison is drawn
between the upper limit obtained in a single search and the upper limit
obtained by combining the results of two experiments each of half the original
duration. To illustrate this, we look at an example case, motivated by the
search for gravitational waves from binary inspiral.
