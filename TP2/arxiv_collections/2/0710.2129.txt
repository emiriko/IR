The three-dimensional pure quantum gravity with a negative cosmological
constant has been conjectured to be dual to an extremal conformal field theory
(ECFT), of central charge c=24k for some positive integer k. We compute the
partition function of the dual ECFT by summing over gravitational instanton
contributions. In particular, we conjecture an exact expression for the
contribution from handlebodies to the partition function for all genera and all
values of k, and provide nontrivial evidences for the conjecture at genus two.
