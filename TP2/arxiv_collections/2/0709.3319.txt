Using very-high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2D electron Hall bar samples, we have
experimentally studied the photoresistance/photovoltaic oscillations induced by
microwave irradiation in the regime where both 1/B and B-periodic oscillations
can be observed. In the frequency range between 27 and 130 GHz we found that
these two types of oscillations are decoupled from each other, consistent with
the respective models that 1/B oscillations occur in bulk while the
B-oscillations occur along the edges of the Hall bars. In contrast to the
original report of this phenomenon (Ref. 1) the periodicity of the
B-oscillations in our samples are found to be independent of L, the length of
the Hall bar section between voltage measuring leads.
