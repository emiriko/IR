We describe the design and realization of a scheme for uv laser spectroscopy
of singly-ionized iron (Fe II) with very high resolution. A buffer-gas cooled
laser ablation source is used to provide a plasma close to room temperature
with a high density of Fe II. We combine this with a scheme for pulsed-laser
saturation spectroscopy to yield sub-Doppler resolution. In a demonstration
experiment, we have examined an Fe II transition near 260 nm, attaining a
linewidth of about 250 MHz. The method is well-suited to measuring transition
frequencies and hyperfine structure. It could also be used to measure small
isotope shifts in isotope-enriched samples.
