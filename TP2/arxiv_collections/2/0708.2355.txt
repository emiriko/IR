Three-dimensional solitary and vortex structures in Bose-Einstein condensates
are studied in the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii model including the
simultaneous action of local cubic-quintic nonlinearity and nonlocal
dipole-dipole interactions. Nonlocal interactions are shown to change
significantly the formation threshold and the numbers of atoms confined into
the coherent structures. An appearance of robust high-order ($m=2$)
three-dimensional vortices is revealed.
