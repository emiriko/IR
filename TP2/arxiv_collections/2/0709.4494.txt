Numerical studies support the conjecture that in continuum planar QCD the
eigenvalue density of a Wilson loop operator undergoes a transition as the loop
is dilated while keeping the loop shape fixed. A second part of the conjecture
is that the transition obeys large N universality and that this universality
class is the same in 2, 3 and 4 Euclidean space-time dimensions. The focus of
the talk will be on clarifying precisely what the conjecture is claiming.
