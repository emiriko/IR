I discuss two selected examples of diffractive production of quarkonia: $p p
\to p \eta' p$ and $p p \to p J/\psi p$. In the first case I consider
diffractive pQCD approach and $\gamma \gamma$ fusion, in the second case the
amplitude is linked to the amplitude of the process for $J/\psi$
photoproduction at HERA. Absorption effects are discussed briefly for the
second reaction.
