We investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium
drift dynamics of an ideal flexible polymer pulled by a constant force applied
at one end of the polymer using the perturbation theory and the renormalization
group method. For moderate force, if the polymer elongation is small, the
hydrodynamic interactions are not screened and the velocity and the
longitudinal elongation of the polymer are computed using the renormalization
group method. Both the velocity and elongation are nonlinear functions of the
driving force in this regime. For large elongation we found two regimes. For
large force but finite chain length $L$ the hydrodynamic interactions are
screened. For large chain lengths and a finite force the hydrodynamic
interactions are only partially screened, which in three dimensions results in
unusual logarithmic corrections to the velocity and the longitudinal
elongation.
