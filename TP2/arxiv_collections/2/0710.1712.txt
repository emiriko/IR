We show that for a d-dimensional model in which a quench with a rate
\tau^{-1} takes the system across a d-m dimensional critical surface, the
defect density scales as n \sim 1/\tau^{m\nu/(z\nu +1)}, where \nu and z are
the correlation length and dynamical critical exponents characterizing the
critical surface. We explicitly demonstrate that the Kitaev model provides an
example of such a scaling with d=2 and m=\nu=z=1. We also provide the first
example of an exact calculation of some multispin correlation functions for a
two-dimensional model which can be used to determine the correlation between
the defects. We suggest possible experiments to test our theory.
