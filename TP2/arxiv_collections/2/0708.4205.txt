We investigate the possibility to construct a generalization of the Standard
Model, which we call the Maximal Mass Model because it contains a limiting mass
$M$ for its fundamental constituents. The parameter $M$ is considered as a new
universal physical constant of Nature and therefore is called the fundamental
mass. It is introduced in a purely geometrical way, like the velocity of light
as a maximal velocity in the special relativity. If one chooses the Euclidean
formulation of quantum field theory, the adequate realization of the limiting
mass hypothesis is reduced to the choice of the de Sitter geometry as the
geometry of the 4-momentum space. All fields, defined in de Sitter p-space in
configurational space obey five dimensional Klein-Gordon type equation with
fundamental mass $M$ as a mass parameter. The role of dynamical field variables
is played by the Cauchy initial conditions given at $x_5 = 0$, guarantying the
locality and gauge invariance principles. The corresponding to the geometrical
requirements formulation of the theory of scalar, vector and spinor fields is
considered in some detail. On a simple example it is demonstrated that the
spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism leads to renormalization of the
fundamental mass $M$. A new geometrical concept of the chirality of the fermion
fields is introduced. It would be responsible for new measurable effects at
high energies $E \geq M$. Interaction terms of a new type, due to the existence
of the Higgs boson are revealed. The most intriguing prediction of the new
approach is the possible existence of exotic fermions with no analogues in the
SM, which may be candidate for dark matter constituents.
