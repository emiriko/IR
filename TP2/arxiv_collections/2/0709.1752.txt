We calculate the transverse-momentum $Q_T$ spectrum of the dilepton in the
transversely polarized Drell-Yan process on the basis of the factorization
theorem in QCD. We take into account universal logarithmically enhanced
corrections in edge region of phase space by resumming multiple soft-gluon
emissions to all orders in the small $Q_T$ region.
