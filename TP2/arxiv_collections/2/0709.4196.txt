We compute the inclusive cross-section of $f_{2}$ tensor mesons production in
proton-proton collisions at high-energy. We use an effective theory inspired
from the tensor meson dominance hypothesis that couples gluons to $f_{2}$
mesons. We compute the differential cross-section in the
$k_{\perp}$-factorization and in the Color Glass Condensate formalism in the
low density regime. We show that the two formalisms are equivalent for this
specific observable. Finally, we study the phenomenology of $f_{2}$ mesons by
comparing theoretical predictions of different parameterizations of the
unintegrated gluon distribution function. We find that $f_{2}$-meson production
is another observable that can be used to put constraints on these
distributions.
