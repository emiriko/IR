We extend the construction of the Symanzik effective action to include rooted
staggered fermions, starting from a generalization of the renormalization-group
approach to rooted staggered fermions. The Symanzik action, together with the
usual construction of a partially quenched chiral effective theory from a
local, partially quenched, fundamental theory, can then be used to derive the
chiral effective theory. The latter reproduces rooted staggered chiral
perturbation theory.
