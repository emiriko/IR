We consider entanglement distillation under the assumption that the input
states are allowed to be correlated among each other. We hence replace the
usually considered independent and identically-distributed hypothesis by the
weaker assumption of merely having identical reductions. We find that whether a
state is then distillable or not is only a property of these reductions, and
not of the correlations that are present in the input state. This is shown by
establishing an appealing relation between the set of copy-correlated
undistillable states and the standard set of undistillable states: The former
turns out to be the convex hull of the latter. As an example of the usefulness
of our approach to the study of entanglement distillation, we prove a new
activation result, which generalizes earlier findings: it is shown that for
every entangled state and every positive integer k, there exists a
copy-correlated k-undistillable state such that their tensor product is
single-copy distillable. Finally, the relation of our results to the conjecture
about the existence of bound entangled states with a non-positive partial
transpose is discussed.
