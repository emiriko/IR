We propose an afterglow phenomenon as a unique trace of chameleon fields in
optical experiments. The vacuum interaction of a laser pulse with a magnetic
field can lead to a production and subsequent trapping of chameleons in the
vacuum chamber, owing to their mass dependence on the ambient matter density.
Magnetically induced re-conversion of the trapped chameleons into photons
creates an afterglow over macroscopic timescales that can conveniently be
searched for by current optical experiments. We show that the chameleon
parameter range accessible to available laboratory technology is comparable to
scales familiar from astrophysical stellar energy loss arguments. We analyze
quantitatively the afterglow properties for various experimental scenarios and
discuss the role of potential background and systematic effects. We conclude
that afterglow searches represent an ideal tool to aim at the production and
detection of cosmologically relevant scalar fields in the laboratory.
