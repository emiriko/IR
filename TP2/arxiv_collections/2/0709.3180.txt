It was found that NMR properties of both superfluid phases of $^3$He in
anisotropic aerogel can be described in terms of the bulk superfluid order
parameters with the orbital order parameter vector fixed by anisotropy of the
aerogel sample. It was also shown that by a proper squeezing it is possible to
get the aerogel sample with isotropic NMR properties.
