The Voronoi diagram of a finite set of objects is a fundamental geometric
structure that subdivides the embedding space into regions, each region
consisting of the points that are closer to a given object than to the others.
We may define many variants of Voronoi diagrams depending on the class of
objects, the distance functions and the embedding space. In this paper, we
investigate a framework for defining and building Voronoi diagrams for a broad
class of distance functions called Bregman divergences. Bregman divergences
include not only the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance but also various
divergence measures based on entropic functions. Accordingly, Bregman Voronoi
diagrams allow to define information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical
parametric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions. We define
several types of Bregman diagrams, establish correspondences between those
diagrams (using the Legendre transformation), and show how to compute them
efficiently. We also introduce extensions of these diagrams, e.g. k-order and
k-bag Bregman Voronoi diagrams, and introduce Bregman triangulations of a set
of points and their connexion with Bregman Voronoi diagrams. We show that these
triangulations capture many of the properties of the celebrated Delaunay
triangulation. Finally, we give some applications of Bregman Voronoi diagrams
which are of interest in the context of computational geometry and machine
learning.
