The Rouse-Zimm equation for the position vectors of beads mapping the polymer
is generalized by taking into account the viscous aftereffect and the
hydrodynamic noise. For the noise, the random fluctuations of the hydrodynamic
tensor of stresses are responsible. The preaveraging of the Oseen tensor for
the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equation allowed us to relate the time
correlation functions of the Fourier components of the bead position to the
correlation functions of the hydrodynamic field created by the noise. The
velocity autocorrelation function of the center of inertia of the polymer coil
is considered in detail for both the short and long times when it behaves
according to the t^(-3/2) law and does not depend on any polymer parameters.
The diffusion coefficient of the polymer is close to that from the Zimm theory,
with corrections depending on the ratio between the size of the bead and the
size of the whole coil.
