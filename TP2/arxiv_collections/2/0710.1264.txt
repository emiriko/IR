Optoelectronic measurements of carbon nanotube transistors have shown a wide
variety of sensitivites to the incident light. Direct photocurrent processes
compete with a number of extrinsic mechanisms. Here we show that visible light
absorption in the silicon substrate generates a photovoltage that can
electrically gate the nanotube device. The photocurrent induced by the changing
gate voltage can be significantly larger than that due to direct electron-hole
pair generation in the nanotube. The dominance of photogating in these devices
is confirmed by the power and position dependence of the resulting
photocurrent. The power dependence is strongly non-linear and photocurrents are
measured through the device even when the laser illuminates up to 1~mm from the
nanotube.
