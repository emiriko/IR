We report the observation of a Bose Einstein condensate in a bosonic isotope
of ytterbium (170Yb). More than 10^6 atoms are trapped in a crossed optical
dipole trap and cooled by evaporation. Condensates of approximately 10^4 atoms
have been obtained. From an expansion of the condensate, we have extracted the
scattering length a=3.6(9) nm.
