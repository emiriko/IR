In the context of AdS/CFT, we consider a cascading theory with an arbitrarily
large number of chiral flavors. In the UV the theory can be considered as a
chiral flavoring of the Klebanov-Tseytlin solution, and exhibits a duality
wall. Instead in the IR, due to the rich dynamics, it safely flows to a
non-cascading theory. We engineer the field theory through intersecting
D7-branes with world-volume gauge flux on a conifold with 3-form fluxes, and we
find new fully backreacted solutions of Type IIB Supergravity plus branes. We
match the field theory cascade with supergravity by computing Page charges and
interpreting Seiberg dualities as large gauge transformations of the
background. Eventually we give an interpretation of the chiral zero modes
arising at the intersection of the D7-branes with flux.
