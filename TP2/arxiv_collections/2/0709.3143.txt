The tangent dynamics of the Lyapunov modes and their dynamics as generated
numerically - {\it the numerical dynamics} - is considered. We present a new
phenomenological description of the numerical dynamical structure that
accurately reproduces the experimental data for the quasi-one-dimensional
hard-disk system, and shows that the Lyapunov mode numerical dynamics is linear
and separate from the rest of the tangent space. Moreover, we propose a new,
detailed structure for the Lyapunov mode tangent dynamics, which implies that
the Lyapunov modes have well-defined (in)stability in either direction of time.
We test this tangent dynamics and its derivative properties numerically with
partial success. The phenomenological description involves a time-modal linear
combination of all other Lyapunov modes on the same polarization branch and our
proposed Lyapunov mode tangent dynamics is based upon the form of the tangent
dynamics for the zero modes.
