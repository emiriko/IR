The expected universal dynamics associated with the initial stage of droplet
coalescence are difficult to study visually due to the rapid motion of the
liquid and the awkward viewing geometry. Here we employ an electrical method to
study the coalescence of two inviscid droplets at early times. We measure the
growth dynamics of the bridge connecting the two droplets and observe a new
asymptotic regime inconsistent with previous theoretical predictions. The
measurements are consistent with a model in which the two liquids coalesce with
a slightly deformed interface.
