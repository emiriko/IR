A phenomenological quasiparticle model is surveyed for 2+1 quark flavors and
compared with recent lattice QCD results. Emphasis is devoted to the effects of
plasmons, plasminos and Landau damping. It is shown that thermodynamic bulk
quantities, known at zero chemical potential, can uniquely be mapped towards
nonzero chemical potential by means of a thermodynamic consistency condition
and a stationarity condition.
