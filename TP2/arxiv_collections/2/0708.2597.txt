The impact dynamics between wet surfaces, which dominates the mechanical
properties of wet granular matter, is studied both experimentally and
theoretically. It is shown that the hysteretic formation and rupture of liquid
capillary bridges between adjacent grains accounts reasonably well for most
relevant cases of wet granular matter. The various dissipation mechanisms are
discussed with particular emphasis on their relevance. Variations of the
rupture energy loss with the impact energy are quantified and discussed.
