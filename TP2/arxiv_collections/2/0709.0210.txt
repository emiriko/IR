I discuss exclusive production of the $\eta'$ meson in the $pp \to p\eta'p$
reaction far from the threshold. The contribution of diffractive component as
well as that for $\gamma^* \gamma^* \to \eta'$ fusion are calculated. In the
first case the formalism of unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGDF) is
used. The distributions in the Feynman $x_F$ (or rapidity), transferred
four-momenta squared between initial and final protons ($t_1$, $t_2$) and
azimuthal angle difference between outgoing protons ($\Phi$) are calculated.
The deviations from the $\sin^2(\Phi)$ dependence predicted by one-step
vector-vector-pseudoscalar coupling are quantified and discussed. The results
are compared with the results of the WA102 collaboration at CERN. Most of the
models of UGDF from the literature give too small cross section as compared to
the WA102 data and predict angular distribution in relative azimuthal angle
strongly asymmetric with respect to $\pi/2$ in disagreement with the WA102
data. This points to a different mechanism at the WA102 energy. Predictions for
RHIC, Tevatron and LHC are given.
