In many cases inhomogeneities are known to exist near the metal (or
superconductor)-insulator transition, as follows from well-known domain-wall
arguments. If the conducting regions are large enough (i.e. when the T=0
superconducting gap is much larger than the single-electron level spacing), and
if they have superconducting correlations, it becomes energetically favorable
for the system to go into a Josephson-coupled zero-resistance state before
(i.e. at higher resistance than) becoming a "real" metal. We show that this is
plausible by a simple comparison of the relevant coupling constants. For small
grains in the above sense, the electronic grain structure is washed out by
delocalization and thus becomes irrelevant. When the proposed "Josephson state"
is quenched by a magnetic field, an insulating, rather then a metallic, state
should appear. This has been shown to be consistent with the existing data on
oxide materials as well as ultra-thin films. We discuss the Uemura correlations
versus the Homes law, and derive the former for the large-grain Josephson array
(inhomogenous superconductor) model. The small-grain case behaves like a dirty
homogenous metal. It should obey the Homes law provided that the system is in
the dirty supeconductivity limit. A speculation why that is typically the case
for d-wave superconductors is presented.
