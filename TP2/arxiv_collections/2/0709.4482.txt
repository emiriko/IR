We consider compactification of type IIA supergravity on nearly Kaehler
manifolds. These represent a simple class of SU(3) structure manifolds which
includes S^6 and CP^3. We exhibit for the first time an explicit reduction
ansatz in this context, obtaining an N=2 gauged supergravity in 4d with a
single vector and hypermultiplet. We verify that supersymmetric solutions of
the 4d theory lift to 10d solutions. Along the way, we discuss questions
related to encountering both electric and magnetic charges in the 4d theory.
