The p-parity conjecture for twists of elliptic curves relates multiplicities
of Artin representations in p-infinity Selmer groups to root numbers. In this
paper we prove this conjecture for a class of such twists. For example, if E/Q
is semistable at 2 and 3, K/Q is abelian and K^\infty is its maximal pro-p
extension, then the p-parity conjecture holds for twists of E by all orthogonal
Artin representations of Gal(K^\infty/Q). We also give analogous results when
K/Q is non-abelian, the base field is not Q and E is replaced by an abelian
variety. The heart of the paper is a study of relations between permutation
representations of finite groups, their "regulator constants", and
compatibility between local root numbers and local Tamagawa numbers of abelian
varieties in such relations.
