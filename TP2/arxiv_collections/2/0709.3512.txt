We present an efficient, principled, and interpretable technique for
inferring module assignments and for identifying the optimal number of modules
in a given network. We show how several existing methods for finding modules
can be described as variant, special, or limiting cases of our work, and how
the method overcomes the resolution limit problem, accurately recovering the
true number of modules. Our approach is based on Bayesian methods for model
selection which have been used with success for almost a century, implemented
using a variational technique developed only in the past decade. We apply the
technique to synthetic and real networks and outline how the method naturally
allows selection among competing models.
