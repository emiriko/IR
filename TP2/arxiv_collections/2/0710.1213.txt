We show that the decay of a soliton into vortices provides a mechanism for
measuring the initial phase difference between two merging Bose-Einstein
condensates. At very low temperatures, the mechanism is resonant, operating
only when the clouds start in anti-phase. But at higher temperatures, phase
fluctuations trigger vortex production over a wide range of initial relative
phase, as observed in recent experiments at MIT. Choosing the merge time to
maximize the number of vortices created makes the interferometer highly
sensitive to spatially varying phase patterns and hence atomic movement.
