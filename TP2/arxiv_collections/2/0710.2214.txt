We discuss phenomenological consequences of some class of supersymmetric
seesaw models in which the right-handed (s)neutrino mass is given to be TeV
scale. In this scenario, scalar trilinear interaction of
Higgs-slepton-(right-handed) sneutrino is enhanced. We show that the 1-loop
correction by sneutrino exchange to the lightest Higgs boson mass destructively
interferes with top-stop contributions in the minimal SUSY Standard Model. We
find that a decay of charged Higgs boson into sneutrino and charged slepton is
sizably enhanced and hence it gives rise to a distinctive signal at future
collider experiments in some parameter space.
