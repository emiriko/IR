We introduce the notion of maximally multipartite entangled states of n
qubits as a generalization of the bipartite case. These pure states have a
bipartite entanglement that does not depend on the bipartition and is maximal
for all possible bipartitions. They are solutions of a minimization problem.
Examples for small n are investigated, both analytically and numerically.
