Far-infrared cyclotron resonance photoconductivity (CRP) is investigated in
HgTe quantum wells (QWs) of various widths grown on (013) oriented GaAs
substrates. It is shown that CRP is caused by the heating of two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG). From the resonance magnetic field strength effective
masses and their dependence on the carrier concentration is obtained. We found
that the effective mass in each sample slightly increases from the value
(0.0260 \pm 0.0005)m_0 at N_s = 2.2x10^11 cm^(-2) to (0.0335 \pm 0.0005)m_0 at
N_s = 9.6x10^11 cm^(-2). Compared to determination of effective masses by the
temperature dependence of magnitudes of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
oscillations used so far in this material our measurements demonstrate that the
CRP provides a more accurate (about few percents) tool. Combining optical
methods with transport measurements we found that the transport time
substantially exceeds the cyclotron resonance lifetime as well as the quantum
lifetime which is the shortest.
