Lattice simulations of five-dimensional gauge theories on an orbifold
revealed that there is spontaneous symmetry breaking. Some of the
extra-dimensional components of the gauge field play the role of a Higgs field
and some of the four-dimensional components become massive gauge bosons. The
effect is confirmed by computing the Coleman-Weinberg potential with a cutoff.
We compare the results of this computation with the lattice data.
