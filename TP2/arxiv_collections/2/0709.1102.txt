Within the scenario of chiral freedom we compute the quark and lepton masses
of the first two generations in terms of their chiral couplings. This allows us
to make a rough estimate of the size of the chiral couplings, narrowing down
the uncertainty in the chiron contribution to low energy observables, like the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We also extract information about the
chiron mass which determines the size of possible chiron effects at the LHC.
