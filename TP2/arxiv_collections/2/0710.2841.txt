Interference dynamics is analyzed in the light of the complex quantum
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, using as a working model the collision of two
Gaussian wave packets. Though simple, this model nicely shows that interference
in quantum scattering processes gives rise to rich dynamics and trajectory
topologies in the complex plane, both ruled by two types of singularities:
caustics and vortices, where the former are associated with the regime of free
wave-packet propagation, and the latter with the collision (interference)
process. Furthermore, an unambiguous picture connecting the complex and real
frameworks is also provided and discussed.
