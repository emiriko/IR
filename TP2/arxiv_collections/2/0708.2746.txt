Single crystals of the lightly-doped spin-Peierls system Cu(1-x)Cd(x)GeO3
have been studied using bulk susceptibility, x-ray diffraction, and inelastic
neutron scattering techniques. We investigate the triplet gap in the magnetic
excitation spectrum of this quasi-one dimensional quantum antiferromagnet, and
its relation to the spin-Peierls dimerisation order parameter. We employ two
different theoretical forms to model the inelastic neutron scattering cross
section and chi''(Q,omega), and show the sensitivity of the gap energy to the
choice of chi''(Q,omega). We find that a finite gap exists at the spin-Peierls
phase transition.
