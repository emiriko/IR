We present measurements of the semileptonic decays B- --> D0 tau- nubar, B-
--> D*0 tau- nubar, B0bar --> D+ tau- nubar, and B0bar --> D*+ tau- nubar,
which are potentially sensitive to non--Standard Model amplitudes. The data
sample comprises 232x10^6 Upsilon(4S) --> BBbar decays collected with the BaBar
detector. From a combined fit to B- and B0bar channels, we obtain the branching
fractions B(B --> D tau- nubar) = (0.86 +/- 0.24 +/- 0.11 +/- 0.06)% and B(B
--> D* tau- nubar) = (1.62 +/- 0.31 +/- 0.10 +/- 0.05)% (normalized for the
B0bar), where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and
normalization-mode-related.
