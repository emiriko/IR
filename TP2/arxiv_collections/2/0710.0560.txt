We calculate loop contributions up to four loops to the Landau gauge gluon
propagator in numerical stochastic perturbation theory. For different lattice
volumes we carefully extrapolate the Euler time step to zero for the Langevin
dynamics derived from the Wilson action. The one-loop result for the gluon
propagator is compared to the infinite volume limit of standard lattice
perturbation theory.
