We propose a scenario to physically implement a kind of topologically
decoherence-protected qubit using superconducting devices coupled to a
micro-wave cavity mode with unconventional geometric operations. It is shown
that the two needed interactions for selective devices, which are required for
implementing such protected qubits, as well as single-qubit gates, can be
achieved by using the external magnetic flux. The easy combination of
individual addressing with the many-device setup proposed in the system
presents a distinct merit in comparison with the implementation of
topologically protected qubits in a trapped-ion system.
