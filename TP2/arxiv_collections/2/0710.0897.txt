Solutions analogous to the Weber-Wheeler cylindrical pulse waves are found
for the case of cylindrical gravitational waves in an expanding universe. These
pulse solutions mimic the asymptotic properties of waves from an isolated
source in three dimensions and can be used to test the far-field behavior of
numerical simulation techniques.
