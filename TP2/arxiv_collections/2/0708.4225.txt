We review searches for mixing and CP violation in the D0-D0bar system and
discuss the first evidence for mixing recently obtained by the Belle and BABAR
collaborations. We also present world average values for the mixing parameters
x=Delta m/Gamma and y=Delta Gamma/(2 Gamma) as calculated by the Heavy Flavors
Averaging Group.
