Two of the most popular quantum mechanical models of interacting fermions are
compared to each other and to potentially exact solutions for a pair of
contact-interacting fermions trapped in a 1D double-well potential, a model of
atoms in a quasi-1D optical lattice or electrons of a Hydrogen molecule in a
strong magnetic field. An exact few-body Hamiltonian is solved numerically in
momentum space yielding a highly-correlated eigenspectrum. Additionally,
approximate ground-state energies are obtained using both density functional
theory (DFT) functional and 2-site Hubbard models. A 1D adiabatic LDA kernel is
constructed for use in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), and
the resulting excited-state spectrum is compared to the exact and Hubbard
results. DFT is shown to give accurate results for wells with small separations
but fails to describe localization of opposite spin fermions to different
sites. A locally cognizant (LC) density functional based on an effective local
fermion number would provide a solution to this problem, and an approximate
treatment presented here compares favorably with the exact and Hubbard results.
The TDDFT excited-state spectrum is accurate in the small parameter regime with
non-adiabatic effects accounting for any deviations. As expected, the
ground-state Hubbard model outperforms DFT at large separations but breaks down
at intermediate separations due to improper scaling to the united-atom limit.
At strong coupling, both Hubbard and TDDFT methods fail to capture the
appropriate energetics.
