Conformal totally symmetric arbitrary spin bosonic fields in flat space-time
of even dimension greater than or equal to four are studied. Second-derivative
(ordinary-derivative) formulation for such fields is developed. We obtain gauge
invariant Lagrangian and the corresponding gauge transformations. Gauge
symmetries are realized by involving the Stueckelberg and auxiliary fields.
Realization of global conformal boost symmetries on conformal gauge fields is
obtained. Modified de Donder gauge condition and de Donder-Stueckelberg gauge
condition are introduced. Using the de Donder-Stueckelberg gauge frame,
equivalence of the ordinary-derivative and higher-derivative approaches is
demonstrated. On-shell degrees of freedom of the arbitrary spin conformal field
are analyzed. Ordinary-derivative light-cone gauge Lagrangian of conformal
fields is also presented. Interrelations between the ordinary-derivative gauge
invariant formulation of conformal fields and the gauge invariant formulation
of massive fields are discussed.
