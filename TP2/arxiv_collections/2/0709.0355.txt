This paper describes a novel numerical model aiming at solving
moving-boundary problems such as free-surface flows or fluid-structure
interaction. This model uses a moving-grid technique to solve the
Navier--Stokes equations expressed in the arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian
kinematics. The discretization in space is based on the spectral element
method. The coupling of the fluid equations and the moving-grid equations is
essentially done through the conditions on the moving boundaries. Two- and
three-dimensional simulations are presented: translation and rotation of a
cylinder in a fluid, and large-amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank. The
accuracy and robustness of the present numerical model is studied and
discussed.
