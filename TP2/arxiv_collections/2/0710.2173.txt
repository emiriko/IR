We present results on the nucleon axial vector form factors $G_A(q^2)$ and
$G_p(q^2)$ in the quenched theory and using two degenerate flavors of dynamical
Wilson fermions for momentum transfer squared from about 0.1 to about 2 GeV^2
and for pion masses in the range of 380 to 600 MeV. We also present results on
the corresponding N to Delta axial vector transition form factors $C_5^A(q^2)$
and $C_6^A(q^2)$ using, in addition to Wilson fermions, domain wall valence
quarks and dynamical staggered sea quarks provided by the MILC collaboration.
