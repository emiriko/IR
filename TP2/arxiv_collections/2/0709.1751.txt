We consider the Wiener sausage among Poissonian obstacles. The obstacle is
called hard if Brownian motion entering the obstacle is immediately killed, and
is called soft if it is killed at certain rate. It is known that Brownian
motion conditioned to survive among obstacles is confined in a ball near its
starting point. We show the weak law of large numbers, large deviation
principle in special cases and the moment asymptotics for the volume of the
corresponding Wiener sausage. One of the consequence of our results is that the
trajectory of Brownian motion almost fills the confinement ball.
