We present an analysis of a variational coherent-squeezed state that has been
discussed in the literature as a potential ground state for the spin-boson
model. We show that when the system-size scaling of the spin-bath coupling is
included properly, all squeezing effects and non-universal physics vanish in
the thermodynamic limit. We also present finite-size corrections to the
renormalisation of the spin's coherence, showing that squeezing effects are
also absent to leading order in the inverse bath-size.
