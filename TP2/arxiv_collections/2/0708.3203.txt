The no-scalar-hair conjecture rules out the existence of asymptotically flat
black holes with a scalar dressing for a large class of theories.
No-scalar-hair theorems have been proved for the cases of neutral black holes
and for charged black holes in the Maxwell electrodynamics. These theorems,
however, do not apply in the case of non-linear electrodynamics. In the present
work numerical solutions describing charged black holes coupled to
Euler-Heisenberg type non-linear electrodynamics in scalar-tensor theories of
gravity with massless scalar field are found. In comparison to the
corresponding solution in General Relativity the presented solution has a
simpler causal structure the reason for which is the presence of the scalar
field. The present class of black holes has a single, non-degenerate horizon,
i.e., its causal structure resembles that of the Schwarzschild black hole.
