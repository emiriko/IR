The Debye-Waller factor has been calculated for stabilized delta-phase
plutonium with 5% aluminum. A quasi-harmonic Born-von Karman force model with
temperature dependent phonon frequencies was used to calculate the mean-square
thermal atomic displacement from absolute zero to 800 K. Implementation of the
observed anomalous softening of the long wavelength phonons with increasing
temperature cannot account for the softening of the measured thermal parameter
at high temperatures nor for its rather high value at low temperatures. The
implications for diffraction measurements on delta-phase stabilized plutonium
alloys are discussed.
