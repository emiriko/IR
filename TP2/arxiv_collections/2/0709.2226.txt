The authors report on observation of Bragg confined mode in a hollow
cylindrical dielectric cavity. A resonance was observed at 13.4 $GHz$ with an
unloaded Q-factor of order $2\times10^5$, which is more than a factor of 6
above the dielectric loss limit. Previously such modes have only been realized
from pure Transverse Electric modes with no azimuthal variations and only the
$E_{\phi}$ component. From rigorous numeric simulations it is shown that the
mode is a hybrid mode with non-zero azimuthal variations and with dominant
$E_r$ and $E_{\phi}$ electric field components and $H_z$ magnetic field
component.
