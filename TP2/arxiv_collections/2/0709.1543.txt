Increasingly, a huge amount of statistics have been gathered which clearly
indicates that income and wealth distributions in various countries or
societies follow a robust pattern, close to the Gibbs distribution of energy in
an ideal gas in equilibrium. However, it also deviates in the low income and
more significantly for the high income ranges. Application of physics models
provides illuminating ideas and understanding, complementing the observations.
