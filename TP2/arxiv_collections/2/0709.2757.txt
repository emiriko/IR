We calculate the frequencies of the Tkachenko oscillations of a vortex
lattice in a harmonically trapped superfluid Fermi gas. We use the
elasto-hydrodynamic theory by properly accounting for the elastic constants,
the Thomas-Fermi density profile of the atomic cloud, and the boundary
conditions. Thanks to the Fermi pressure, which is responsible for larger cloud
radii with respect to the case of dilute Bose-Einstein condensed gases, large
vortex lattices are achievable in the unitary limit of infinite scattering
length, even at relatively small angular velocities. This opens the possibility
of experimentally observing vortex oscillations in the regime where the
dispersion relation approaches the Tkachenko law for incompressible fluids and
the mode frequency is almost comparable to the trapping frequencies.
