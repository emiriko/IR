We show that the implicit equation of a surface in 3-dimensional projective
space parametrized by bi-homogeneous polynomials of bi-degree (d,d), for a
given positive integer d, can be represented and computed from the linear
syzygies of its parametrization if the base points are isolated and form
locally a complete intersection.
