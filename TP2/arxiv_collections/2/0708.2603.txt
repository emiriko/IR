The rates of multiparton collisions in high energy hadronic interactions
provide information on the typical transverse distances between partons in the
hadron structure. The different configurations of the hadron in transverse
space are, on the other hand, at the origin of hadron diffraction. The relation
between the two phenomena is exploted in an eikonal model of hadronic
interactions.
