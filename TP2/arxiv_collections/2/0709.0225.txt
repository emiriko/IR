The Battle of the Sexes describes asymmetric conflicts in mating behavior of
males and females. Males can be philanderer or faithful, while females are
either fast or coy, leading to a cyclic dynamics. The adjusted replicator
equation predicts stable coexistence of all four strategies. In this situation,
we consider the effects of fluctuations stemming from a finite population size.
We show that they unavoidably lead to extinction of two strategies in the
population. However, the typical time until extinction occurs strongly prolongs
with increasing system size. In the meantime, a quasi-stationary probability
distribution forms that is anomalously flat in the vicinity of the coexistence
state. This behavior originates in a vanishing linear deterministic drift near
the fixed point. We provide numerical data as well as an analytical approach to
the mean extinction time and the quasi-stationary probability distribution.
