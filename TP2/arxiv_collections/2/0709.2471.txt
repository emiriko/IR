We give an introductory account of functional determinants of elliptic
operators on manifolds and Polyakov-type formulas for their infinitesimal and
finite conformal variations. We relate this to extremal problems and to the
Q-curvature on even-dimensional conformal manifolds. The exposition is
self-contained, in the sense of giving references sufficient to allow the
reader to work through all details.
