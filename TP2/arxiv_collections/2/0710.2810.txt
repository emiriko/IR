Belle Collaboration reported a new observed value of K*-(892) mass by
studying tau --> K_S pi nu_tau decay, which is significantly different from the
current world average value given by Particle Data Group 2006. Motivated by
this new data, we revisit the issue on the K*0(892)-K*+(892) mass splitting.
Our theoretical estimation favors the new measurement by Belle Collaboration.
Therefore further experimental efforts are urgently needed to improve our
understanding of these issues.
