Dalitz analysis is a powerful tool for physics studies within and beyond the
Standard Model. In the last decade it has helped to investigate the Heavy
Flavor hadronic decay dynamics and is now being applied to extract angles of
the CKM Unitarity triangle. To perform such sophisticate analyses we need to
model the strong interaction effects. The FOCUS experiment has performed pilot
studies in the charm sector through the K-matrix formalism. What has been
learnt from charm will be beneficial for future accurate beauty measurements.
Experience and results from FOCUS are presented and discussed.
