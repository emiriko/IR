We prove a result that can be applied to determine the finite-dimensional
simple Poisson modules over a Poisson algebra and apply it to numerous
examples. In the discussion of the examples, the emphasis is on the
correspondence with the finite-dimensional simple modules over deformations and
on the behaviour of finite-dimensional simple Poisson modules on the passage
from a Poisson algebra to the Poisson subalgebra of invariants for the action
of a finite group of Poisson automorphisms.
