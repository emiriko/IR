We develop a formalism to calculate form factor and charge density
distribution of pion in the chiral limit using the holographic dual model of
QCD with hard-wall cutoff. We introduce two conjugate pion wave functions and
present analytic expressions for these functions and for the pion form factor.
They allow to relate such observables as the pion decay constant and the pion
charge electric radius to the values of chiral condensate and hard-wall cutoff
scale. The evolution of the pion form factor to large values of the momentum
transfer is discussed, and results are compared to existing experimental data.
