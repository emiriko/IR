The aim of this paper is the kinematic study of a 3-RPR planar parallel
manipulator where the three fixed revolute joints are actuated. The direct and
inverse kinematic problem as well as the singular configuration is
characterized. On parallel singular configurations, the motion produce by the
mobile platform can be compared to the Reuleaux straight-line mechanism.
