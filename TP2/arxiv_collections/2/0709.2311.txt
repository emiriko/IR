Recently the two-loop next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) virtual corrections
to arbitrary processes with massless external fermions have been calculated.
Within the spontaneously broken electroweak theory the one- and two-loop mass
singularities have been derived to NLL accuracy and expressed as universal
correction factors depending only on the quantum numbers of the external
particles. This talk summarizes the results for massless fermionic processes
and presents new aspects arising in the extension of the corresponding loop
calculations to massive external fermions. As a preliminary result, the Abelian
form factor for massive fermions is given.
