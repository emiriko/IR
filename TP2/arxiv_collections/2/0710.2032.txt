A Penrose diagram is constructed for an example black hole that evaporates at
a steady rate as measured by a distant observer, until the mass vanishes,
yielding a final state Minkowski space-time. Coordinate dependencies of
significant features, such as the horizon and coordinate anomalies, are clearly
demonstrated on the diagram. The large-scale causal structure of the space-time
is briefly discussed.
