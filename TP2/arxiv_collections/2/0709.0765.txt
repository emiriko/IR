We study orbifold compactifications of the type IIB superstring on AdS_5 x
S^5/Gamma, where Gamma is the abelian group Z_8, which can lead to non-SUSY
three and four family models based on quartification. In particular, we focus
on two models, one fully quartified model and one a model with two
trinification families and one quartification family, which reduces to the
standard model with a minimal leptonic color sector.
