We study the viability of the lightest neutralino as a dark matter candidate
in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Taking into account
accelerator constraints as well as bounds on low-energy observables, and
imposing consistency with present bounds on the neutralino relic density, we
address the prospects for the direct detection of neutralino dark matter. We
find regions of the allowed parameter space where the neutralino detection
cross section is within the reach of dark matter detectors, essentially owing
to the presence of very light singlet-like Higgses, and to either singlino
dominated or very light neutralinos.
