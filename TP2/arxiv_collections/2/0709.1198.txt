We characterize the subclass of quasianti-Hermitian quaternionic Hamiltonian
dynamics such that their complex projections are one-parameter semigroup
dynamics in the space of complex quasi-Hermitian density matrices. As an
example, the complex projection of a spin-1/2 system in a constant
quasianti-Hermitian quaternionic potential is considered.
