We investigate a linearized tensor-tensor theory of gravity with torsion and
a perturbed torsion wave solution is discovered in background Minkowski
spacetime with zero torsion. Furthermore, gauge transformations of any
perturbed tensor field are derived in general background non-Riemannian
geometries. By calculating autoparallel deviations, both longitudinal and
transverse polarizations of the torsion wave are discovered.
