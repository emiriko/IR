The isothermal compression of a dilute nucleonic gas invoking cluster degrees
of freedom is studied in an equilibrium statistical model; this clusterized
system is found to be more stable than the pure nucleonic system. The equation
of state (EoS) of this matter shows features qualitatively very similar to the
one obtained from pure nucleonic gas. In the isothermal compression process,
there is a sudden enhancement of clusterization at a transition density
rendering features analogous to the gas-liquid phase transition in normal
dilute nucleonic matter. Different observables like the caloric curves, heat
capacity, isospin distillation, etc. are studied in both the models. Possible
changes in the observables due to recently indicated medium modifications in
the symmetry energy are also investigated.
