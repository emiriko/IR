At zero magnetic field, a series of five phase transitions occur in Co3V2O8.
The Neel temperature, TN=11.4 K, is followed by four additional phase changes
at T1=8.9 K, T2=7.0 K, T3=6.9 K, and T4=6.2 K. The different phases are
distinguished by the commensurability of the b-component of its spin density
wave vector. We investigate the stability of these various phases under
magnetic fields through dielectric constant and magnetic susceptibility
anomalies. The field-temperature phase diagram of Co3V2O8 is completely
resolved. The complexity of the phase diagram results from the competition of
different magnetic states with almost equal ground state energies due to
competing exchange interactions and frustration.
