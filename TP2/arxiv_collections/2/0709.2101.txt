We have fabricated pillar microcavity samples with Bragg mirrors consisting
of alternate layers of GaAs and Aluminium Oxide. Compared to the more widely
studied GaAs/AlAs micropillars these mirrors can achieve higher reflectivities
with fewer layer repeats and reduce the mode volume. We have studied a number
of samples containing a low density of InGaAs/GaAs self assembled quantum dots
in a cavity and here report observation of a three fold enhancement in the
radiative lifetime of a quantum dot exciton state due to the Purcell effect.
