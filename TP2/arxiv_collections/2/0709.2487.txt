We briefly summarize the properties of conserved charge fluctuations as a
sensitive probe for the QCD phase transitions. We discuss the density
fluctuations which play a significant role to search for the critical end
point. The importance of spinodal instabilities to distinguish the first-order
phase transition is also indicated.
