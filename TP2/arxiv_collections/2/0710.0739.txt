The current status of transport coefficients in relativistic field theories
at high temperature is reviewed. I contrast weak coupling results obtained
using kinetic theory/diagrammatic techniques with strong coupling results
obtained using gauge/gravity duality, and describe the recent developments in
extracting transport coefficients and spectral functions from lattice QCD
simulations. The fate of quarkonium at high temperature as seen from the
lattice is briefly mentioned as well.
