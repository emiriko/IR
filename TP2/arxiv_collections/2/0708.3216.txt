We propose a novel technique for the creation of maximally entangled
symmetric Dicke states in an ion trap using adiabatic passage, which requires
only a pair of chirped pulses from a single laser and is applicable to any
number of ions and excitations. By utilising a particular factorisation of the
Hilbert space for multi-level ladders we show that the problem can be reduced
to `bow-tie' configuration energy-level crossings. This technique is naturally
robust against fluctuations in the laser intensity and the chirp rate. Even
when realistic heating rates are considered, we estimate that the overall
fidelity should remain high (e.g. 98% for a ten-ion Dicke state), which
represents a significant improvement over traditional approaches.
