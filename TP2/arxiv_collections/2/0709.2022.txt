The nonlinear propagation of 3D wave-packets in a 1D Bragg-induced band-gap
system, shows that tranverse effects (free space diffraction) affect the
interplay of periodicity and nonlinearity, leading to the spontaneous formation
of fast and slow conical localized waves. Such excitation corresponds to
enhanced nonlinear transmission (tunneling) in the gap, with peculiar features
which differ on the two edges of the band-gap, as dictated by the full
dispersion relationship of the localized waves.
