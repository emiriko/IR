In the hard core limit, interacting vortices in planar type II
superconductors can be modeled as non-interacting one dimensional fermions
propagating in imaginary time. We use this analogy to derive analytical
expressions for the probability density and imaginary current of vortex lines
interacting with an isolated bent line defect and to understand the pinning
properties of such systems. When there is an abrupt change of the direction of
the pinning defect, we find a sinusoidal modulation of the vortex density in
directions both parallel and perpendicular to the defect.
