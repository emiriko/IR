In this manuscript we analyse the long-term probability density function of
non-stationary dynamical processes which are enclosed inward the Feller class
of processes with time varying exponents for multiplicative noise. The update
in the value of the exponent occurs in the same conditions presented by Beck
and Cohen for superstatistics. Moreover, we are able to provide a dynamical
scenario for the emergence of a generalisation of the Weibull distribution
previously introduced.
