Recently many authors have calculated the energy of the Friedman universes by
using double index energy-momentum complexes in Cartesian comoving coordinates
$(t,x,y,z)$ and concluded that the flat and closed Friedman universes are
energy-free. We show in this paper by using Einstein canonical energy-momentum
complex and by doing calculations in conformally flat coordinates that such
conclusion is incorrect. The results obtained in this paper are compatible with
the results of the our previous paper \cite{Gar07} where we have used
coordinate-independent averaged relative energy-momentum tensors to analyze
Friedman universes.
