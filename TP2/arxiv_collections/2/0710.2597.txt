Wheeler has strikingly illustrated the wave-particle duality by the
delayed-choice thought experiment, in which the configuration of a 2-path
interferometer is chosen after a single-photon light-pulsed has entered it. We
present a quantitative theoretical analysis of an experimental realization of
Wheeler's proposal.
