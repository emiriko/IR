In certain neighborhood $U$ of an arbitrary point of a symplectic manifold
$M$ we construct a Fedosov-type star-product $\ast_L$ such that for an
arbitrary leaf $\wp$ of a given polarization $\mathcal{D}\subset TM$ the
algebra $C^\infty (\wp \cap U)[[h]]$ has a natural structure of left module
over the deformed algebra $(C^\infty (U)[[h]], \ast_L)$. With certain
additional assumptions on $M$, $\ast_L$ becomes a so-called star-product with
separation of variables.
