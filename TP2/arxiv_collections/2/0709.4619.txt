In this paper we investigate the properties of gauge-invariant coherent
states for Loop Quantum Gravity, for the gauge group U(1). This is done by
projecting the corresponding complexifier coherent states, which have been
applied in numerous occasions to investigate the semiclassical limit of the
kinematical sector, to the gauge-invariant Hilbert space. This being the first
step to construct physical coherent states, we arrive at a set of
gauge-invariant states that approximate well the gauge-invariant degrees of
freedom of abelian LQG. Furthermore, these states turn out to encode explicit
information about the graph topology, and show the same pleasant peakedness
properties known from the gauge-variant complexifier coherent states.
