We summarise applications of Dyson-Schwinger equations to the theory and
phenomenology of hadrons. Some exact results for pseudoscalar mesons are
highlighted with details relating to the U_A(1) problem. We describe inferences
from the gap equation relating to the radius of convergence for expansions of
observables in the current-quark mass. We recapitulate upon studies of nucleon
electromagnetic form factors, providing a comparison of the ln-weighted ratios
of Pauli and Dirac form factors for the neutron and proton.
