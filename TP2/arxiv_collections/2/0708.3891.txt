Recently, the quantum brachistochrone problem is discussed in the literature
by using non-Hermitian Hamilton operators of different type. Here, it is
demonstrated that the passage time is tunable in realistic open quantum systems
due to the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions of the non-Hermitian Hamilton
operator. As an example, the numerical results obtained by Bulgakov et al. for
the transmission through microwave cavities of different shape are analyzed
from the point of view of the brachistochrone problem. The passage time is
shortened in the crossover from the weak-coupling to the strong-coupling regime
where the resonance states overlap and many branch points (exceptional points)
in the complex plane exist. The effect can {\it not} be described in the
framework of standard quantum mechanics with Hermitian Hamilton operator and
consideration of $S$ matrix poles.
