A semiconductor laser subject to delayed optical feedback is investigated in
the limit of extremely intense feedback power. In a range of feedback
polarization rotation angles the emission spectra of the laser reveal a giant
gap with width of more than a terahertz. The position of the gap and its width
are shown to be regulated by means of feedback polarization rotation angle. We
demonstrate that a theoretical approach, based on carrier density grating
induced potential, explains our experimental results.
