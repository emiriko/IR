We present a single-freeze-out model with thermal and geometric parameters
dependent on the position within the fireball and use it to describe the
rapidity and transverse-momentum spectra of pions, kaons, protons, and
antiprotons measured at RHIC at 200 GeV} by BRAHMS. THERMINATOR is used to
perform the necessary simulation, which includes all resonance decays. The
result of the fit to the data is the expected growth of the baryon and strange
chemical potentials with the spatial rapidity\alpha_\parallel. The value of the
baryon chemical potential at \alpha_\parallel ~ 3 is about 200 MeV, i.e. lies
in the range of the highest SPS energies. The chosen geometry of the fireball
has a decreasing transverse size as the magnitude of \alpha_\parallel is
increased, which also corresponds to decreasing transverse flow. The strange
chemical potential obtained from the fit to the K+/K- ratio is such that the
local strangeness density in the fireball is compatible with zero. The
resulting rapidity spectra of net protons are described qualitatively within
the statistical approach. As a result of our study, the knowledge of the
``topography'' of the fireball is acquired, allowing for other analyses and
predictions.
