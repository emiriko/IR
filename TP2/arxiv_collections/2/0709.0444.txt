We show that the fluctuations of the partial current in two dimensional
diffusive systems are dominated by vortices leading to a different scaling from
the one predicted by the hydrodynamic large deviation theory. This is supported
by exact computations of the variance of partial current fluctuations for the
symmetric simple exclusion process on general graphs. On a two-dimensional
torus, our exact expressions are compared to the results of numerical
simulations. They confirm the logarithmic dependence on the system size of the
fluctuations of the partialflux. The impact of the vortices on the validity of
the fluctuation relation for partial currents is also discussed.
