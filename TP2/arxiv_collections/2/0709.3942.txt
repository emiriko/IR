In this write-up we summarize main points of our recent analysis on the
thermal dilepton production rate from the dropping rho based on the vector
manifestation (VM). In the analysis, we studied the effect of the strong
violation of the vector dominance (VD), which is predicted by the VM, and
showed that the effect of the violation of the VD substantially suppresses the
dilepton production rate compared with the one predicted by assuming the VD
together with the dropping rho.
