I review lattice QCD calculations that compute the masses of the flavour
singlet pseudoscalar mesons. I describe the progress in computing the mass
spectrum of light 0++ mesons using lattice QCD. I also compare the results for
basic quantities such as fpi and mrho, from various different formalisms of
lattice QCD. I discuss the physical value of r0.
