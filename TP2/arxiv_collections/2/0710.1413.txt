New germanium-platinum compounds with the filled-skutterudite crystal
structure were synthesized. The structure and composition were investigated by
X-ray diffraction and microprobe analysis. Magnetic susceptibility, specific
heat, and electrical resistivity measurements evidence superconductivity in
LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 below 8.3K. The parameters of the normal and
superconducting states were established. Strong coupling and a crystal electric
field singlet groundstate is found for the Pr compound. Electronic structure
calculations show a large density of states at the Fermi level. Similar
behavior with lower T_c was observed for SrPt4Ge12 and BaPt4Ge12.
