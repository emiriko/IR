The charge form factor of ${}^6$Li nucleus is considered on the basis of its
cluster structure. The charge density of ${}^6$Li is presented as a
superposition of two terms. One of them is a folded density and the second one
is a sum of ${}^4$He and the deuteron densities. Using the available
experimental data for ${}^4$He and deuteron charge form factors, a good
agreement of the calculations within the suggested scheme is obtained with the
experimental data for the charge form factor of ${}^6$Li, including those in
the region of large transferred momenta.
