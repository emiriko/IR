In this article we prove the following result: that for any two natural
numbers k and j, and for all sufficiently large symmetric groups Sym(n), there
are k disjoint sets of j irreducible characters of Sym(n), such that each set
consists of characters with the same degree, and distinct sets have different
degrees. In particular, this resolves a conjecture most recently made by
Moret\'o. The methods employed here are based upon the duality between
irreducible characters of the symmetric groups and the partitions to which they
correspond. Consequently, the paper is combinatorial in nature.
