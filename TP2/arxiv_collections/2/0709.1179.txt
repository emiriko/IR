We investigate the dispersion and temperature dependence of a number of
phonons in the recently discovered superconductor CaC6 utilizing inelastic
x-ray scattering. Four [00L] and two ab-plane phonon modes are observed, and
measured at temperatures both above and below T_c. In general, our measurements
of phonon dispersions are in good agreement with existing theoretical
calculations of the phonon dispersion. This is significant in light of several
discrepancies between experimental measurements of phonon-derived quantities
and theoretical calculations. The present work suggests that the origin of
these discrepancies lies in the understanding of the electron-phonon coupling
in this material, rather than in the phonons themselves.
