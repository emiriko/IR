We investigate the set a) of positive, trace preserving maps acting on
density matrices of size N, and a sequence of its nested subsets: the sets of
maps which are b) decomposable, c) completely positive, d) extended by identity
impose positive partial transpose and e) are superpositive. Working with the
Hilbert-Schmidt (Euclidean) measure we derive tight explicit two-sided bounds
for the volumes of all five sets. A sample consequence is the fact that, as N
increases, a generic positive map becomes not decomposable and, a fortiori, not
completely positive.
  Due to the Jamiolkowski isomorphism, the results obtained for quantum maps
are closely connected to similar relations between the volume of the set of
quantum states and the volumes of its subsets (such as states with positive
partial transpose or separable states) or supersets. Our approach depends on
systematic use of duality to derive quantitative estimates, and on various
tools of classical convexity, high-dimensional probability and geometry of
Banach spaces, some of which are not standard.
