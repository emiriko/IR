Concerning the gravitational corrections to the running of gauge couplings
two different results were reported. Some authors claim that gravitational
correction at the one-loop level indicates an interesting effect of universal
gravitational decreasing of gauge couplings, that is, gravitational correction
works universally in the direction of asymptotic freedom no matter how the
gauge coupling behaves without gravity, while others reject the presence of
gravitational correction at the one-loop level at all. Being these calculations
done in the framework of an effective field theory approach to general
relativity, we wanted to draw attention to a recently discovered profound
quantum-gravitational effect of space-time dimension running that inevitably
affects the running of gauge couplings. The running of space-time dimension
indicating gradual reduction of dimension as one gets into smaller scales acts
on the coupling constants in the direction of asymptotic freedom and therefore
in any case manifests the plausibility of this quantum-gravitational effect.
Curiously enough, the results are also in perfect quantitative agreement with
those of Robinson and Wilczek.
