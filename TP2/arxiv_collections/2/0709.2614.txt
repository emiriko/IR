We theoretically investigate electron transport through corrugated graphene
ribbons and show how the ribbon curvature leads to an electronic superlattice
with a period set by the corrugation wave length. Transport through the ribbon
depends sensitively on the superlattice band structure which, in turn, strongly
depends on the geometry of the deformed sheet. In particular, we find that for
ribbon widths where the transverse level separation is comparable to the the
band edge energy, a strong current switching occurs as function of an applied
backgate voltage. Thus, artificially corrugated graphene sheets or ribbons can
be used for the study of Dirac fermions in periodic potentials. Furthermore,
this provides an additional design paradigm for graphene-based electronics.
