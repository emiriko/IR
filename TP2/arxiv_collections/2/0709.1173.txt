Both cellular automata (CA) and lattice-gas automata (LG) provide finite
algorithmic presentations for certain classes of infinite dynamical systems
studied by symbolic dynamics; it is customary to use the term `cellular
automaton' or `lattice gas' for the dynamic system itself as well as for its
presentation. The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display
profound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling
convenience and physical implementability.
  Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari
(and by Durand--Lose for more than two dimensions) that any invertible CA can
be rewritten as an LG (with a possibly much more complex ``unit cell''). But
until now it was not known whether this is possible in general for
noninvertible CA--which comprise ``almost all'' CA and represent the bulk of
examples in theory and applications. Even circumstantial evidence--whether in
favor or against--was lacking.
  Here, for noninvertible CA, (a) we prove that an LG presentation is out of
the question for the vanishingly small class of surjective ones. We then turn
our attention to all the rest--noninvertible and nonsurjective--which comprise
all the typical ones, including Conway's `Game of Life'. For these (b) we prove
by explicit construction that all the one-dimensional ones are representable as
LG, and (c) we present and motivate the conjecture that this result extends to
any number of dimensions.
  The tradeoff between dissipation rate and structural complexity implied by
the above results have compelling implications for the thermodynamics of
computation at a microscopic scale.
