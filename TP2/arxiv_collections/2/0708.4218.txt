The main point of this paper is a suggestion about the proper treatment of
the photon gas in a theory of stellar structure and other plasmas. This problem
arises in the study of polytropic gas spheres, where we have already introduced
some innovations. The main idea, already advanced in the contextof neutral,
homogeneous, polytropic stellar models, is to base the theory firmly on a
variational principle. Another essential novelty is to let mass distribution
extend to infinity, the boundary between bulk and atmosphere being defined by
an abrupt change in the polytropic index, triggered by the density. The logical
next step in this program is to include the effect of radiation, which is a
very significant complication since a full treatment would have to include an
account of ionization, thus fieldsrepresenting electrons, ions, photons,
gravitons and neutral atoms as well. In way of preparation, we consider models
that are charged but homogeneous, involving only gravity, electromagnetism and
a single scalar field that represents both the mass and the electric charge; in
short, anon-neutral plasma. While this work only represents a stage in the
development of a theory of stars, without direct application to physical
systems, it does shed some light on the meaning of the Reissner-Nordstrom
solution of the modified Einstein-Maxwell equations., with an application to a
simple system.
