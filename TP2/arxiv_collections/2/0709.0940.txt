Searches for gravitational wave bursts that are triggered by the observation
of astronomical events require a different mode of analysis than all-sky, blind
searches. For one, much more prior information is usually available in a
triggered search which can and should be used in the analysis. Second, since
the data volume is usually small in a triggered search, it is also possible to
use computationally more expensive algorithms for tasks such as data
pre-processing that can consume significant computing resources in a high
data-volume un-triggered search. From the statistical point of view, the
reduction in the parameter space search volume leads to higher sensitivity than
an un-triggered search. We describe here a data analysis pipeline for triggered
searches, called {\tt RIDGE}, and present preliminary results for simulated
noise and signals.
