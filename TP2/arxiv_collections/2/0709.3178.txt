We provide the exact generating function for semi-flexible and super-flexible
interacting partially directed walks and also analyse the solution in detail.
We demonstrate that while fully flexible walks have a collapse transition that
is second order and obeys tricritical scaling, once positive stiffness is
introduced the collapse transition becomes first order. This confirms a recent
conjecture based on numerical results. We note that the addition of an
horizontal force in either case does not affect the order of the transition. In
the opposite case where stiffness is discouraged by the energy potential
introduced, which we denote the super-flexible case, the transition also
changes, though more subtly, with the crossover exponent remaining unmoved from
the neutral case but the entropic exponents changing.
