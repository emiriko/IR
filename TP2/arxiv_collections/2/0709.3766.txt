Separability problem, to decide whether a given state is entangled or not, is
a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. We propose a powerful and
computationally simple separability criterion, which allows us to detect the
entanglement of many bound entangled states. The criterion is strictly stronger
than the dV criterion, the computable cross-norm or realignment criterion and
its optimal nonlinear entanglement witnesses. Furthermore, this criterion can
be generalized to an analogue of permutation separability criteria in the
even-partite systems.
