A recent essay [1] reminds us of how richly Boltzmann deserves to be
admiringly commemorated for the originality of his ideas on the occasion of his
150th birthday. Without any doubt, the scientific community owes Boltzmann a
great debt of gratitude for his ingenious and pathfinding contributions.
However, the essay chooses to illustrate this important memorial by statements
and inferences that perhaps are questionable today even to Boltzmann himself. I
will comment only on three issues.
