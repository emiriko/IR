The study of energy harvesting in chain-like structures is important due to
its relevance to a variety of interesting physical systems. Harvesting is
understood as the combination of exciton transport through intra-band exciton
relaxation (via scattering on phonon modes) and subsequent quenching by a trap.
Previously, we have shown that in the low temperature limit different
harvesting scenarios as a function of the applied bias strength (slope of the
energy gradient towards the trap) are possible \cite{Vlaming07}. This paper
generalizes the results for both homogeneous and disordered chains to nonzero
temperatures. We show that thermal effects are appreciable only for low bias
strengths, particularly so in disordered systems, and lead to faster
harvesting.
