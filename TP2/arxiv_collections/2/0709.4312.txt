Operating in the framework of `supmech' (a scheme of mechanics which aims at
providing a concrete setting for the axiomatization of physics and probability
theory as required in Hilbert's sixth problem; integrating noncommutative
symplectic geometry and noncommutative probability in an algebraic setting, it
associates, with every `experimentally accessible' system, a symplectic algebra
and operates essentially as noncommutative Hamiltonian mechanics with some
extra sophistication in the treatment of states) it is shown that interaction
between systems can be consistently described only if either (i) all system
algebras are commutative or (ii) all system algebras are noncommutative and
have a quantum symplectic structure characterized by a UNIVERSAL Planck type
real-valued constant of the dimension of action.
