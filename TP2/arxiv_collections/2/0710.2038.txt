We provide a short account of the effects one expects on meson-antimeson
oscillations in the context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). This issue is largely dependent on the assumptions made on the MSSM
parameter space. In this respect, we consider in closer detail the cases of the
general MSSM, with completely free soft terms, and the Minimal Flavor Violating
limit of the MSSM, providing a natural mechanism of near-flavor-conservation.
For the case of meson oscillations in the Delta B = 2 sector, we show that this
approach leads to a striking increase of the predictivity of the model. In
particular, we find (i) SUSY corrections to be naturally small and always
positive; (ii) if mu is not small, an increase in importance (even for low tan
beta) of scalar operators due to gluino contributions. The last point signals
that (V-A)x(V-A) dominated MFV is in general inconsistent with the MSSM. In
this context, we also briefly discuss the MFV-Unitarity Triangle.
