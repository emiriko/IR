In this study, a model of a Schottky-barrier carbon nanotube field- effect
transistor (CNT-FET), with ferromagnetic contacts, has been developed. The
emphasis is put on analysis of current-voltage characteristics as well as shot
(and thermal) noise. The method is based on the tight-binding model and the
non- equilibrium Green's function technique. The calculations show that, at
room temperature, the shot noise of the CNT FET is Poissonian in the
sub-threshold region, whereas in elevated gate and drain/source voltage regions
the Fano factor gets strongly reduced. Moreover, transport properties strongly
depend on relative magnetization orientations in the source and drain contacts.
In particular, one observes quite a large tunnel magnetoresistance, whose
absolute value may exceed 50%.
