In this work, we apply black box methods (methods not requiring input) to
find excited-state energies. A variety of such methods for lattice QCD were
introduced at the 3rd iteration of the numerical workshop series. We first
review a selection of approaches that have been used in lattice calculations to
determine multiple energy states: multiple correlator fits, the variational
method and Bayesian fitting. In the second half, we will focus on a black box
method, the multi-effective mass. We demonstrate the approach on anisotropic
lattice data, extracting multiple states from single correlators. Without
complicated operator construction or specialized fitting programs, the black
box method shows good consistency with the traditional approaches.
