In this letter we show that supersymmetry like geometry can be approximated
using finite dimensional matrix models and fuzzy manifolds. In particular we
propose a non-perturbative regularization of {\cal N}=2 supersymmetric U(n)
gauge action in 4D. In some planar large N limits we recover exact SUSY
together with the smooth geometry of R^4_{theta}.
