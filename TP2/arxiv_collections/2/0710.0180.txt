Starting from an N=1 supersymmetric electric gauge theory with the gauge
group SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') x SU(N_c'') with fundamentals for each gauge group,
the bifundamentals, a symmetric flavor and a conjugate symmetric flavor for
SU(N_c), we apply Seiberg dual to each gauge group, obtain the N=1
supersymmetric dual magnetic gauge theories with dual matters including the
gauge singlets, and describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA
string theory corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this
gauge theory. We also discuss the case where a symmetric flavor is replaced by
an antisymmetric flavor. Next we apply to the case for N=1 supersymmetric
electric gauge theory with the gauge group SO(N_c) x SU(N_c') x SU(N_c'') with
flavors for each gauge group and the bifundamentals. Finally, we describe the
case where the orientifold 6-plane charge is reversed.
