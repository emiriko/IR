In the previous papers (notably, Y. Kodama, J. Phys. A 37, 11169-11190
(2004), and G. Biondini and S. Chakravarty, J. Math. Phys. 47 033514 (2006)),
we found a large variety of line-soliton solutions of the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KPII) equation. The line-soliton solutions are
solitary waves which decay exponentially in $(x,y)$-plane except along certain
rays. In this paper, we show that those solutions are classified by asymptotic
information of the solution as $|y| \to \infty$. Our study then unravels some
interesting relations between the line-soliton classification scheme and
classical results in the theory of permutations.
