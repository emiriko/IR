We discuss the use of model building for temporal representations. We chose
Polish to illustrate our discussion because it has an interesting aspectual
system, but the points we wish to make are not language specific. Rather, our
goal is to develop theoretical and computational tools for temporal model
building tasks in computational semantics. To this end, we present a
first-order theory of time and events which is rich enough to capture
interesting semantic distinctions, and an algorithm which takes minimal models
for first-order theories and systematically attempts to ``perturb'' their
temporal component to provide non-minimal, but semantically significant,
models.
