The Doniach's diagram has been originally proposed to describe the
competition between the local Kondo effect and the intersite RKKY interactions
in cerium compounds. Here we discuss the extension of this diagram to different
variations of Kondo lattice model. We consider a) ordered cerium compounds
where the competition between magnetic order and Kondo effect plays an
important role, as $CeRh_2Si_2$, b) disordered cerium systems with competing
spin glass phase, magnetic ordered phases and a Kondo phase, as the heavy
fermion cerium alloy $CeCu_xNi_{1-x}$ and, c) uranium compounds where a
coexistence between Kondo effect and ferromagnetic order has been observed, as
UTe. We show that all these cases can be described by a generalized Doniach
phase diagram.
