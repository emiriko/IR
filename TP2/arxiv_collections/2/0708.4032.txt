We propose two dimensional x-ray coherent correlation spectroscopy (2DXCS)
for the study of interactions between core-electron and valence transitions.
This technique might find experimental applications in the future when very
high intensity x-ray sources become available. Spectra obtained by varying two
delay periods between pulses show off-diagonal cross-peaks induced by coupling
of core transitions of two different types. Calculations of the N1s and O1s
signals of aminophenol isomers illustrate how novel information about many-body
effects in electronic structure and excitations of molecules can be extracted
from these spectra.
