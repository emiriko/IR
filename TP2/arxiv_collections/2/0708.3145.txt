We investigate thermodynamics for a magnetically charged regular black hole
(MCRBH), which comes from the action of general relativity and nonlinear
electromagnetics, comparing with the Reissner-Norstr\"om (RN) black hole in
both four and two dimensions after dimensional reduction. We find that there is
no thermodynamic difference between the regular and RN black holes for a fixed
charge $Q$ in both dimensions. This means that the condition for either
singularity or regularity at the origin of coordinate does not affect the
thermodynamics of black hole. Furthermore, we describe the near-horizon AdS$_2$
thermodynamics of the MCRBH with the connection of the Jackiw-Teitelboim
theory. We also identify the near-horizon entropy as the statistical entropy by
using the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence.
