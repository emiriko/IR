The CMS and ATLAS search strategy for SUSY in inclusive multijet plus high
missing transverse energy final states is reviewed. This canonical SUSY
signature may be a viable discovery channel for low mass SUSY in the early
phase of the LHC. Methods for Standard Model background estimates, MET studies
and filters for instrumental background are presented.
