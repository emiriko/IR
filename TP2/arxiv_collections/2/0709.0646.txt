We present an exact algebraic solution of a single graphene plane in
transverse electric and perpendicular magnetic fields. The method presented
gives both the eigen-values and the eigen-functions of the graphene plane. It
is shown that the eigen-states of the problem can be casted in terms of
coherent states, which appears in a natural way from the formalism.
