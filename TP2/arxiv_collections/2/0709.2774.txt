We investigate the influence on the density of states and the density of spin
polarization for a two-dimensional hole gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
under intense terahertz laser fields. Via Floquet theorem, we solve the
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and calculate these densities. It is
shown that a terahertz magnetic moment can be induced for low hole
concentration. Different from the electron case, the induced magnetic moment is
quite anisotropic due to the anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. Both the
amplitude and the direction of the magnetic moment depend on the direction of
the terahertz field. We further point out that for high hole concentration, the
magnetic moment becomes very small due to the interference caused by the
momentum dependence of the spin-orbit coupling. This effect also appears in
two-dimensional electron systems.
