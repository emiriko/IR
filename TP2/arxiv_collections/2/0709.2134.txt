We study the single production of excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 leptons in
future high energy $e^+e^-$ collisions. We calculate the production cross
section and decay widths of excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 leptons according to
their effective currents. We show that these possible new excited states can be
probed up to the mass $m^*$ ~ $\sqrt{s}$ depending on their couplings to
leptons and gauge bosons. We present the angular distributions of final state
particles as a measure to discriminate between an excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2
lepton signal. The signals and the corresponding backgrounds are studied in
detail to obtain attainable limits on masses and couplings of excited leptons
at future linear colliders
