The Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) will search for double beta decays of
136Xe. We report the results of a systematic study of trace concentrations of
radioactive impurities in a wide range of raw materials and finished parts
considered for use in the construction of EXO-200, the first stage of the EXO
experimental program. Analysis techniques employed, and described here, include
direct gamma counting, alpha counting, neutron activation analysis, and
high-sensitivity mass spectrometry.
