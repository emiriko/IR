This paper details an algorithm for unfolding a class of convex polyhedra,
where each polyhedron in the class consists of a convex cap over a rectangular
base, with several restrictions: the cap's faces are quadrilaterals, with
vertices over an underlying integer lattice, and such that the cap convexity is
``radially monotone,'' a type of smoothness constraint. Extensions of Cauchy's
arm lemma are used in the proof of non-overlap.
