We report a molecular dynamics study of the contact between a rigid solid
with a randomly rough surface and an elastic block with a flat surface. We
study the contact area and the interfacial separation from small contact (low
load) to full contact (high load). For small load the contact area varies
linearly with the load and the interfacial separation depends logarithmically
on the load. For high load the contact area approaches to the nominal contact
area (i.e., complete contact), and the interfacial separation approaches to
zero. The present results may be very important for soft solids, e.g., rubber,
or for very smooth surfaces, where complete contact can be reached at moderate
high loads without plastic deformation of the solids.
