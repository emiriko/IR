The crucial role of ambient correlations in determining thermodynamic
behavior is established. A class of entangled states of two macroscopic systems
is constructed such that each component is in a state of thermal equilibrium at
a given temperature, and when the two are allowed to interact heat can flow
from the colder to the hotter system. A dilute gas model exhibiting this
behavior is presented. This reversal of the thermodynamic arrow is a
consequence of the entanglement between the two systems, a condition that is
opposite to molecular chaos and shown to be unlikely in a low-entropy
environment. By contrast, the second law is established by proving Clausius'
inequality in a low-entropy environment. These general results strongly support
the expectation, first expressed by Boltzmann and subsequently elaborated by
others, that the second law is an emergent phenomenon that requires a
low-entropy cosmological environment, one that can effectively function as an
ideal information sink.
