In the 1920's, Ritt studied the operation of functional composition g o h(x)
= g(h(x)) on complex rational functions. In the case of polynomials, he
described all the ways in which a polynomial can have multiple `prime
factorizations' with respect to this operation. Despite significant effort by
Ritt and others, little progress has been made towards solving the analogous
problem for rational functions. In this paper we use results of Avanzi--Zannier
and Bilu--Tichy to prove analogues of Ritt's results for decompositions of
Laurent polynomials, i.e., rational functions with denominator a power of x.
