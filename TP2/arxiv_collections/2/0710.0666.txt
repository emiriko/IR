A new classical potential for methyl-thiol on a Au(111) surface has been
developed using density functional theory electronic structure calculations.
Energy surfaces between methyl-thiol and a gold surface were investigated in
terms of symmetry sites and thiol density. Geometrical optimization was
employed over all the configurations while minimum energy and thiol height were
determined. Finally, a new interatomic potential has been generated as a
function of thiol density, and applications to coarse-grained simulations are
presented.
