A general framework for the solutions of the constraints of pure gravity is
constructed. It provides with well defined mathematical criteria to classify
their solutions in four classes. Complete families of solutions are obtained in
some cases. A starting point for the systematic study of the solutions of
Einstein gravity is suggested.
