Random percolation can be fully interpreted as a confining pure gauge theory.
With numerical high-precision measurements of Polyakov-Polyakov correlators at
finite temperature, we could well observe the presence of shape effects due to
rough fluctuations of the confining string, in complete agreement with the
universality predictions up to the next-to-leading order.
