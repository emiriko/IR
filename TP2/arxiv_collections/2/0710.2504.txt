We present the results of band structure calculations for ACr2X4 (A=Zn, Cd,
Hg and X=O, S, Se) spinels. Effective exchange coupling constants between Cr
spins are determined by fitting the energy of spin spirals to a classical
Heisenberg model. The calculations reproduce the change of the sign of the
dominant nearest-neighbor exchange interaction J1 from antiferromagnetic in
oxides to ferromagnetic in sulfides and selenides. It is verified that the
ferromagnetic contribution to J1 is due to indirect hopping between Cr t2g and
eg states via X p states. Antiferromagnetic coupling between 3-rd Cr neighbors
is found to be important in all the ACr2X4 spinels studied, whereas other
interactions are much weaker. The results are compared to predictions based on
the Goodenough-Kanamori rules of superexchange.
