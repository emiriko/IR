A subset of a group is product-free if it does not contain elements a, b, c
such that ab = c. We review progress on the problem of determining the size of
the largest product-free subset of an arbitrary finite group, including a lower
bound due to the author, and a recent upper bound due to Gowers. The bound of
Gowers is more general; it allows three different sets A, B, C such that one
cannot solve ab = c with a in A, b in B, c in C. We exhibit a refinement of the
lower bound construction which shows that for this broader question, the bound
of Gowers is essentially optimal.
