Introducing genetic algorithms as a reliable and efficient tool to find
ordered equilibrium structures, we predict minimum energy configurations of the
square shoulder system for different values of corona width $\lambda$. Varying
systematically the pressure for different values of $\lambda$ we obtain
complete sequences of minimum energy configurations which provide a deeper
understanding of the system's strategies to arrange particles in an
energetically optimized fashion, leading to the competing self-assembly
scenarios of cluster-formation vs. lane-formation.
