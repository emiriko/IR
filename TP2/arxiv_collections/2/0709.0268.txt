Exchange interactions among defects in semiconductors are commonly treated
within effective-mass theory using a scaled hydrogenic wave-function. However
such a wave-function is only applicable to shallow impurities; here we present
a simple but robust generalization to treat deep donors, in which we treat the
long-range part of the wavefunction using the well established quantum defect
theory, and include a model central-cell correction to fix the bound-state
eigenvalue at the experimentally observed value. This allows us to compute the
effect of binding energy on exchange interactions as a function of donor
distance; this is a significant quantity given recent proposals to carry out
quantum information processing using deep donors. As expected, exchange
interactions are suppressed (or increased), compared to the hydrogenic case, by
the greater localization (or delocalization) of the wavefunctions of deep
donors (or `super-shallow' donors with binding energy less then the hydrogenic
value). The calculated results are compared with a simple scaling of the
Heitler-London hydrogenic exchange; the scaled hydrogenic results give the
correct order of magnitude but fail to reproduce quantitatively our
calculations. We calculate the donor exchange in silicon including inter-valley
interference terms for donor pairs along the $\{100\}$ direction, and also show
the influence of the donor type on the distribution of nearest-neighbour
exchange constants at different concentrations. Our methods can be used to
compute the exchange interactions between two donor electrons with arbitrary
binding energy.
