The interesting but difficult phenomenology of supersymmetric models at the
LHC and ILC demands a corresponding complexity and maturity from simulation
tools. This includes multi-particle final states, reducible and irreducible
backgrounds, spin correlations, real emission of photons and gluons, virtual
corrections etc. Most of these topics are included in the multi-particle Monte
Carlo (MC) Event generators Madgraph, WHIZARD and Sherpa. A comparison of these
codes is shown, with a special focus on the new release of WHIZARD. I show
examples for the necessity of considering full matrix elements with all
off-shell effects and interferences for multi-particle final states in
supersymmetric models and give a status report on ongoing projects for
simulations of SUSY processes at the LHC with these codes, including all of the
abovementioned corrections.
