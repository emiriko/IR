In this paper we extend the new family of (quantitative) Belief Conditioning
Rules (BCR) recently developed in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) to their
qualitative counterpart for belief revision. Since the revision of quantitative
as well as qualitative belief assignment given the occurrence of a new event
(the conditioning constraint) can be done in many possible ways, we present
here only what we consider as the most appealing Qualitative Belief
Conditioning Rules (QBCR) which allow to revise the belief directly with words
and linguistic labels and thus avoids the introduction of ad-hoc translations
of quantitative beliefs into quantitative ones for solving the problem.
