We show that the conductivity tensor of a disordered two-dimensional electron
gas becomes anisotropic in the presence of both Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interactions (SOI). This anisotropy is a mesoscopic effect and
vanishes with vanishing charge dephasing time. Using a diagrammatic approach
including zero, one, and two-loop diagrams, we show that a consistent
calculation needs to go beyond a Boltzmann equation approach. In the absence of
charge dephasing and for zero frequency, a finite anisotropy \sigma_{xy}
e^2/lhpf arises even for infinitesimal SOI.
