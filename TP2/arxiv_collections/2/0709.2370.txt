A gauge-invariant wavefunctional is proposed as an approximation to the
ground state of Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions, quantized in temporal
gauge. The proposed vacuum state is the true ground state of the appropriate
Hamiltonian in both the free-field limit, and in a zero mode strong-field
limit. Confinement, in this approach, arises via dimensional reduction, and we
present numerical results for the mass gap. The issue of color screening is
briefly discussed.
