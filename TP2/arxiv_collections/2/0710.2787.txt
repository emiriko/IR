The operator valued distributions which arise in quantum field theory on the
noncommutative Minkowski space can be symbolized by a generalization of chord
diagrams, the dotted chord diagrams. In this framework, the combinatorial
aspects of quasiplanar Wick products are understood in terms of the shuffle
Hopf algebra of dotted chord diagrams, leading to an algebraic characterization
of quasiplanar Wick products as a convolution. Moreover, it is shown that the
distributions do not provide a weight system for universal knot invariants.
