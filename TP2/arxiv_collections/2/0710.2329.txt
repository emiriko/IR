We report some results for the magnetic moments of vector mesons extracted
from mass shifts in the presence of static external magnetic fields. The
calculations are done on $24^4$ quenched lattices using standard Wilson
actions, with $\beta$=6.0 and pion mass down to 500 MeV. The results are
compared to those from the form factor method.
