A conformal description of Poincare-Einstein manifolds is developed: these
structures are seen to be a special case of a natural weakening of the Einstein
condition termed an almost Einstein structure. This is used for two purposes:
to shed light on the relationship between the scattering construction of
Graham-Zworski and the higher order conformal Dirichlet-Neumann maps of Branson
and the author; to sketch a new construction of non-local (Dirichlet-to-Neumann
type) conformal operators between tensor bundles.
