I use an improved version of the two-step density matrix renormalization
group method to study ground-state properties of the 2D Heisenberg model on the
checkerboard lattice. In this version the Hamiltonian is projected on a tensor
product of two-leg ladders instead of chains. This allows investigations of 2D
isotropic models. I show that this method can describe both the magnetically
disordered and ordered phases. The ground-state phases of the checkerboard
model as $J_2$ increases are: (i) N\'eel with $Q=(\pi,\pi)$, (ii) a valence
bond crystal (VBC) of plaquettes, (iii) N\'eel with $Q=(\pi/2,\pi)$, and (iv) a
VBC of crossed dimers. In agreement with previous results, I find that at the
isotropic point $J_2=J_1$, the ground state is made of weakly interacting
plaquettes with a large gap $\Delta \approx 0.67 J_1$ to triplet excitations.
