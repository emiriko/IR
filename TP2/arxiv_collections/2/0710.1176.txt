The optical response of nonparabolic quantum wells is dominated by a strong
peak at the plasmon frequency. When the electrons reach the anharmonic regions,
resonant absorption becomes inefficient. This limitation is overcome by using a
chirped laser pulse in the autoresonant regime. By direct simulations using the
Wigner phase-space approach, the authors prove that, with a sequence of just a
few pulses, electrons can be efficiently detrapped from a nonparabolic well.
For an array of multiple quantum wells, they can create and control an
electronic current by suitably applying an autoresonant laser pulse and a
slowly varying dc electric field.
