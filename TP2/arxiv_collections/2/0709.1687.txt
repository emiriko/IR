We report experiments on a superconducting spin switch based on
technologically relevant materials as elemental ferromagnetic Co and elemental
superconducting Nb. The Co/Nb/Co structure exhibits inverse spin switch effect,
can be operated at liquid helium temperature and can switch from
superconductive to normal state in rather weak applied magnetic fields.
Relevant critical currents as a function of temperature and magnetic field as
well as preparation of superconductive or resistive state are addressed here.
