This Letter describes the search for a new heavy charged gauge boson W'
decaying into an electron and a neutrino. The data were collected with the D0
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton Collider at a
center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, and correspond to an integrated luminosity
of about 1 inverse femtobarn. Lacking any significant excess in the data in
comparison with known processes, an upper limit is set on the production cross
section times branching fraction, and a W' boson with mass below 1.00 TeV can
be excluded at the 95% C.L., assuming standard-model-like couplings to
fermions. This result significantly improves upon previous limits, and is the
most stringent to date.
