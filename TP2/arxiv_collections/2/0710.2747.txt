This paper presents simulations of the impact of tongue surgery on tongue
movements and on speech articulation. For this, a 3D biomechanical Finite
Element (FE) model of the tongue is used. Muscles are represented within the FE
structure by specific subsets of elements. The tongue model is inserted in the
upper airways including jaw, palate and pharyngeal walls. Two examples of
tongue surgery, which are quite common in the treatment of cancers of the oral
cavity are modelled: hemiglossectomy and large resection of the mouth floor.
Three kinds of reconstruction are also modelled, assuming flaps with a low,
medium or high stiffnesses. The impact of the surgery without any
reconstruction and with the three different reconstructions is quantitatively
measured and compared during simulated speech production sequences. More
precisely, differences in global 3D tongue shape and in velocity patterns
during tongue displacements are evaluated.
