The background field method for measuring the electric polarizability of the
neutron is adapted to the dynamical quark case, resulting in the calculation of
(certain space-time integrals over) three- and four-point functions. Particular
care is taken to disentangle polarizability effects from the effects of
subjecting the neutron to a constant background gauge field; such a field is
not a pure gauge on a finite lattice and engenders a mass shift of its own. At
a pion mass of m_pi = 759 MeV, a small, slightly negative electric
polarizability is found for the neutron.
