The optimization problems defining meta-stable or stationary equilibrium are
explored. The Gibbs scheme is modified aiming to describe the statistical
properties of a class of non-equilibrium and metastable states. The system is
assumed to maximize the usual definition of the Entropy, subject to the
standard constant energy and norm restrictions, plus additional constraints.
The central assumption is that the existence of the considered metastable state
is determined by the action of this additional dynamical constraint, that
blocks the evolution of the system up to its maximum Entropy state, thus
maintaining it in the metastable or stationary configuration. After requiring
from the statistical description to be valid for the combination of two nearly
independent subsystems, it follows that the eigenvalues of the constraint
operators C should have the restricted homogeneous form C(p{i})=p{i}^{q}, in
terms of the eigenvalues of the density matrix p{i}, where q is a fixed real
number. Therefore, the distribution of the eigenvalues of the constraint
function have the Tsallis structure. This conclusion suggests the
interpretation of the q parameter as reflecting the homogeneous dependence of
the constraint determining the metastable state on the density matrix. An
application to the plasma experiments of Huang and Driscoll is expected to be
considered elsewhere in order to compare the results with Tsallis scheme and
the minimal Enstrophy one.
