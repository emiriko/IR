A free field representation of the gl(1|1)_k current algebra at arbitrary
level k is given in terms of two scalar fields and a symplectic fermion. The
primary fields for all representations are explicitly constructed using the
twist and logarithmic fields in the symplectic fermion sector. A closed
operator algebra is described at integer level k. Using a new super spin charge
separation involving gl(1|1)_N and su(N)_0, we describe how the gl(1|1)_N
current algebra can describe a non-trivial critical point of disordered Dirac
fermions. Local gl(1|1) invariant lagrangians are defined which generalize the
Liouville and sine-Gordon theories. We apply these new tools to the spin
quantum Hall transition and show that it can be described as a logarithmic
perturbation of the osp(2|2)_k current algebra at k=-2.
