Using a combination of local density functional theory and cluster exact
diagonalization based dynamical mean field theory, we calculate many body
electronic structures of several Mott insulating oxides including undoped high
T_{c} materials. The dispersions of the lowest occupied electronic states are
associated with the Zhang-Rice singlets in cuprates and with doublets,
triplets, quadruplets and quintets in more general cases. Our results agree
with angle resolved photoemission experiments including the decrease of the
spectral weight of the Zhang--Rice band as it approaches k=0.
