We have considered the ballistic propagation of the 2D electron Wigner
distribution, which is excited by an ultrashort optical pulse from a
short-range impurity into the first quantized subband of a selectively-doped
heterostructure with high mobility. Transient ionization of a deep local state
into a continuum conduction c-band state is described. Since the quantum nature
of the photoexcitation, the Wigner distribution over 2D plane appears to be an
alternating-sign function. Due to a negative contribution to the Wigner
function, the mean values (concentration, energy, and flow) demonstrate an
oscillating transient evolution in contrast to the diffusive classical regime
of propagation.
