A new transport regime of photon in two-dimensional photonic crystal near the
Dirac point has been demonstrated by exact numerical simulation. In this
regime, the conductance of photon is inversely proportional to the thickness of
sample, which can be described by Dirac equation very well. Both of bulk and
surface disorders always reduce the transmission, which is in contrast to the
previous theoretical prediction that they increase the conductance of electron
at the Dirac point of grephene. However, regular tuning of interface structures
can cause the improvement of photon conductance. Furthermore, large conductance
fluctuations of photon have also been observed, which is similar to the case of
electron in graphene.
