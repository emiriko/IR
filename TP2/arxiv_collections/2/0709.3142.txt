Using a geometric approach for the propagation of light in anisotropic media,
we investigate what effect the director field of disclinations may have on the
polarization state of light. Parallel transport around the defect, of the
spinor describing the polarization, indicates the acquisition of a topological
phase, in analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
