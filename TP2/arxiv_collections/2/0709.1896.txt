We present measurements on direct radio-frequency pumping of ion channels and
pores bound in bilipid membranes. We make use of newly developed microcoaxes,
which allow delivering the high frequency signal in close proximity to the
membrane bound proteins and ion channels. We find rectification of the
radio-frequency signal, which is used to pump ions through the channels and
pores.
