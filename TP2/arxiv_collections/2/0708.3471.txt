We study electromagnetic properties of the nucleon and Roper resonance in a
chiral quark-diquark model including two kinds of diquarks needed to describe
the nucleon: scalar and axial-vector diquarks. The nucleon and Roper resonance
are described as superpositions of two quark-diquark bound states of a quark
and a scalar diquark and of a quark and an axial-vector diquark.
Electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and Roper resonance are obtained
from one-loop diagrams where the quark and diquarks are coupled by a photon. We
include the effects of intrinsic properties of the diquarks: the intrinsic form
factors both of the diquarks and the anomalous magnetic moment of the
axial-vector diquark. The electric form factors of the proton and neutron
reasonably agree with the experiments due to the inclusions of the diquark
sizes, while the magnetic moments become smaller than the experimental values
because of the scalar dominance in the nucleon. The charge radii of the Roper
resonance are almost comparable with those of the nucleon.
