We report 32% efficient frequency doubling of single frequency 1029 nm light
to green light at 514.5 nm using a single pass configuration. A congruent
composition, periodically poled magnesium doped lithium niobate (PPMgLN)
crystal of 50 mm length was used to generate a second harmonic power of 2.3 W.
To our knowledge, this is the highest reported frequency doubling efficiency of
any wavelength light in a PPMgLN crystal and also the highest reported SHG
output power in the green for PPMgLN.
