Cells continuously probe their environment with membrane receptors, achieving
subsecond adaptation of their behaviour [1-3]. Recently, several receptors,
including cadherins, were found to bind ligands with a lifetime of order of one
second. Here we show at the single molecule level that homotypic C-cadherin
association involves transient intermediates lasting less than a few tens of
milliseconds. Further, these intermediates transitionned towards more stable
states with a kinetic rate displaying exponential decrease with piconewton
forces. These features enable cells to detect ligands or measure surrounding
mechanical behaviour within a fraction of a second, much more rapidly than was
previously thought.
