In this paper, we study the Chazy III,IX and X equations. For the Chazy III
equation, by making the birational transformations the Chazy III equation is
transformed into a third-order ordinary differential equation of rational type.
For this equation, we find its meromorphic solutions, whose free parameters are
essentially two. We also show that the system associated with this equation
admits new special solutions solved by $tanh(t)$. For the Chazy IX equation, we
transform the Chazy IX equation to a system of the first-order ordinary
differential equations by birational transformations. For this system, we give
two new birational B{\"a}cklund transformations. We also give the holomorphy
condition of this system. Thanks to this holomorphy condition, we obtain a new
partial differential system in two variables involving the Chazy IX equation,
This system satisfies the compatibility condition, and admits a travelling wave
solution. For the Chazy X equation, we transform the Chazy X equation to a
system of the first-order ordinary differential equations by birational
transformations. For this system, we give two birational B{\"a}cklund
transformations. One of them is new. We also give the holomorphy condition of
this system. Thanks to this holomorphy condition, we can recover this system.
