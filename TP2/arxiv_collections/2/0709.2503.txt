The Landauer scattering approach to 4-probe resistance is revisited for the
case of a d-dimensional disordered resistor in the presence of decoherence. Our
treatment is based on an invariant-embedding equation for the evolution of the
coherent reflection amplitude coefficient in the length of a 1-dimensional
disordered conductor, where decoherence is introduced at par with the disorder
through an outcoupling, or stochastic absorption, of the wave amplitude into
side (transverse) channels, and its subsequent incoherent re-injection into the
conductor. This is essentially in the spirit of B{\"u}ttiker's
reservoir-induced decoherence. The resulting evolution equation for the
probability density of the 4-probe resistance in the presence of decoherence is
then generalised from the 1-dimensional to the d-dimensional case following an
anisotropic Migdal-Kadanoff-type procedure and analysed. The anisotropy, namely
that the disorder evolves in one arbitrarily chosen direction only, is the main
approximation here that makes the analytical treatment possible. A
qualitatively new result is that arbitrarily small decoherence reduces the
localisation-delocalisation transition to a crossover making resistance moments
of all orders finite.
