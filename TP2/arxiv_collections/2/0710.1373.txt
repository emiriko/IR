Moments of the generalized parton distributions of the nucleon, calculated
with a mixed action of domain wall valence quarks and asqtad staggered sea
quarks, are presented for pion masses extending down to 359 MeV. Results for
the moments of the unpolarized, helicity, and transversity distributions are
given and compared to the available experimental measurements. Additionally, a
selection of the generalized form factors are shown and the implications for
the spin decomposition and transverse structure of the nucleon are discussed.
Particular emphasis is placed on understanding systematic errors in the lattice
calculation and exploring a variety of chiral extrapolations.
