We examine the conditions that give rise to metastable, persistent currents
in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. A necessary condition for the stability
of persistent currents is that the trapping potential is not a monotonically
increasing function of the distance from the trap center. Persistent currents
also require that the interatomic interactions are sufficiently strong and
repulsive. Finally, any off-center vortex state is shown to be unstable, while
a driven gas shows hysteresis.
