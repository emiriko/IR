B-hadron spectroscopy presents an interesting window for the study of QCD.
CDF has performed a number of studies involving the production and spectroscopy
of B mesons. Among these studies are the first direct observation of the Bc,
and the first observation of both narrow states of the Bs**. In addition,
measurements are made of the B** masses and widths and the best limit on the
production of Eta_b is set.
