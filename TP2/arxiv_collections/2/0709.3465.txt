In this brief note (written as a lengthy letter), we describe the
construction of a representation for the Weyl-algebra underlying Loop Quantum
Geometry constructed from a diffeomorphism variant state, which corresponds to
a ''condensate'' of Loop Quantum Geometry, resembling a static spatial
geometry. We present the kinematical GNS-representation and the gauge- and
diffeomorphism invariant Hilbert space representation and show that the
expectation values of the geometric operators take essentialy classical values
plus quantum corrections, which is similar to a ''local condensate'' of quantum
geometry. We describe the idea for the construction of a scale dependent
asymptotic map into a family of scale dependent lattice gauge theories, where
scale separates the essential geometry and a low energy effective theory, which
is described as degrees of freedom in the lattice gauge theory. If this idea
can be implemented then it is likely to turn out that this Hilbert space
contains in addition to gravity also gauge coupled ''extra degrees of
freedom'', which may not be dynamically irrelevant.
