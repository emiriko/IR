The progress in quantum operations of continuous-variable (CV) schemes can be
reduced to that in CV quantum teleportation. The fidelity of quantum
teleportation of an optical setup is limited by the finite degree of quantum
correlation which can be prepared with a pair of finitely squeezed states.
Reports of improvement of squeezing level have appeared recently, and we
adopted the improved methods in our experimental system of quantum
teleportation. As a result, we teleported a coherent state with a fidelity
$F=0.83\pm 0.01$, which is better than any other figures reported to date. In
this paper, we introduce a measure $n_{s}$, the number of teleportations
expected to be carried out sequentially. Our result corresponds to
$n_{s}$=5.0$\pm$0.4. It suggests that our improvement would enable us to
proceed toward more advanced quantum operations involving multi-step quantum
operations.
