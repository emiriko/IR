The purpose of this letter is to show that a rotation of Hartree-Fock
canonical orbitals which minimizes the lowest eigenvalues of a configuration
interaction calculation limited to the mono-excitated configurations from a
given orbital allows one to construct a better starting guess for the geminal
mean field configuration interaction method.
