The nonperturbative nature of nucleon-nucleon interactions evolved to low
momentum has recently been investigated in free space and at finite density
using Weinberg eigenvalues as a diagnostic. This analysis is extended here to
the in-medium eigenvalues near the Fermi surface to study pairing. For a fixed
value of density and cutoff Lambda, the eigenvalues increase arbitrarily in
magnitude close to the Fermi surface, signaling the pairing instability. When
using normal-phase propagators, the Weinberg analysis with complex energies
becomes a form of stability analysis and the pairing gap can be estimated from
the largest attractive eigenvalue. With Nambu-Gorkov Green's functions, the
largest attractive eigenvalue goes to unity close to the Fermi surface,
indicating the presence of bound states (Cooper pairs), and the corresponding
eigenvector leads to the self-consistent gap function.
