We give a classification of $1^{st}$ order invariant differential operators
acting between sections of certain bundles associated to Cartan geometries of
the so called metaplectic contact projective type. These bundles are associated
via representations, which are derived from the so called higher symplectic,
harmonic or generalized Kostant spinor modules. Higher symplectic spinor
modules are arising from the Segal-Shale-Weil representation of the metaplectic
group by tensoring it by finite dimensional modules. We show that for all pairs
of the considered bundles, there is at most one $1^{st}$ order invariant
differential operator up to a complex multiple and give an equivalence
condition for the existence of such an operator. Contact projective analogues
of the well known Dirac, twistor and Rarita-Schwinger operators appearing in
Riemannian geometry are special examples of these operators.
