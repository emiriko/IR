Cleaved and polished surfaces of CaCu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ ceramics have been
investigated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. While EDX technique shows the identical
CaCu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ stoichiometry for the two surfaces, XPS indicates that
the cleaved surface with grain-boundary layers is remarkably Ti-rich and
Cu-poor. The core-level spectrum of Cu 2$p$ unambiguously shows the existence
of monovalent copper only for the cleaved surface. Possible grain-boundary
structure and its formation are discussed.
