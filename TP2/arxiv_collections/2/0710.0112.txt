We investigate the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in two-color
photoassociation for a atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate. By applying two
time-varying Guassian laser pulses that fulfill generalized two-photon
resonance condition, we obtain highly efficient atom-molecule conversion. The
efficiency depends on the free-bound detuning and the delay time between the
two pulses. By adjusting the parameters optimally, we achieve 92% conversion
efficiency.
