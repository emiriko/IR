Charge density and magnetization density profiles of one-dimensional metals
are investigated by two complementary many-body methods: numerically exact
(Lanczos) diagonalization, and the Bethe-Ansatz local-density approximation
with and without a simple self-interaction correction. Depending on the
magnetization of the system, local approximations reproduce different Fourier
components of the exact Friedel oscillations.
