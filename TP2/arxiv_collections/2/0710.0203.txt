Higgs boson production in association with bottom quarks, is one of the most
important discovery channels for Higgs particles in the Standard Model (SM) and
its supersymmetric extension at the LHC pp collider . The theoretical
prediction of the corresponding cross section has been improved by including
the complete next-to-leading order QCD corrections. We review the status
results for the leading order to the partonic process and present calculations
for the integrated cross-section in both single and double parton scattering
collisions.
