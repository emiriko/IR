Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) transmission spectra show a clear polarization
effect in pi electronic transition in spin coated atactic polystyrene (aPS)
films of thickness below 4Rg, where Rg (~20.4nm) is the radius of gyration of
the polymer. This transition associated with pendant benzene rings in
polystyrene. The polarization effect clearly indicates pendant benzene ring
alignment on a macroscopic scale. Study of core electron (1s) transition
through near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy
confirms the ordering and shows that the rings are oriented towards
out-of-plane direction with a tilt angle ~63 degree with the sample plane,
which is consistent with the observed in-plane (sample surface) VUV
polarization. These results indicate the transition of a common polymer, like
polystyrene, inherently disordered in the bulk, to an orientationally ordered
phase under a certain degree of confinement.
