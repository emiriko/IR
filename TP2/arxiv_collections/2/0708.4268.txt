A systematic study of the pairing correlations as a function of temperature
and angular momentum has been performed in the sd-shell region using the
spherical shell model approach. The pairing correlations have been derived for
even-even, even-odd and odd-odd systems near N=Z and also for the asymmetric
case of N=Z+4. The results indicate that the pairing content and the behavior
of pair correlations is similar in even-even and odd-mass nuclei. For odd-odd
N=Z system, angular momentum I=0 state is an isospin, t=1 neutron-proton paired
configuration. Further, these t=1 correlations are shown to be dramatically
reduced for the asymmetric case of N=Z+4. The shell model results obtained are
qualitatively explained within a simplified degenerate model.
