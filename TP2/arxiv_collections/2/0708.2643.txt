The number of fixed points of a random permutation of 1,2,...,n has a
limiting Poisson distribution. We seek a generalization, looking at other
actions of the symmetric group. Restricting attention to primitive actions, a
complete classification of the limiting distributions is given. For most
examples, they are trivial -- almost every permutation has no fixed points. For
the usual action of the symmetric group on k-sets of 1,2,...,n, the limit is a
polynomial in independent Poisson variables. This exhausts all cases. We obtain
asymptotic estimates in some examples, and give a survey of related results.
