A program package for MATLAB is introduced that helps calculations in quantum
information science and quantum optics. It has commands for the following
operations: (i) Reordering the qudits of a quantum register, computing the
reduced state of a quantum register. (ii) Defining important quantum states
easily. (iii) Formatted input and output for quantum states and operators. (iv)
Constructing operators acting on given qudits of a quantum register and
constructing spin chain Hamiltonians. (v) Partial transposition, matrix
realignment and other operations related to the detection of quantum
entanglement. (vi) Generating random state vectors, random density matrices and
random unitaries.
