Functioning and interaction of distributed devices and concurrent algorithms
are analyzed in the context of the theory of algorithms. Our main concern here
is how and under what conditions algorithmic interactive devices can be more
powerful than the recursive models of computation, such as Turing machines.
Realization of such a higher computing power makes these systems
superrecursive. We find here five sources for superrecursiveness in
interaction. In addition, we prove that when all of these sources are excluded,
the algorithmic interactive system in question is able to perform only
recursive computations. These results provide computer scientists with
necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving superrecursiveness by
algorithmic interactive devices.
