Quantum theory shares with classical probability theory many important
properties. I show that this common core regards at least the following six
areas, and I provide details on each of these: the logic of propositions,
symmetry, probabilities, composition of systems, state preparation and
reductionism. The essential distinction between classical and quantum theory,
on the other hand, is shown to be joint decidability versus smoothness; for the
latter in particular I supply ample explanation and motivation. Finally, I
argue that beyond quantum theory there are no other generalisations of
classical probability theory that are relevant to physics.
