Based on fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach, we show the
non-Markovian effect in spin dephasing of heavy holes in $p$-type GaAs quantum
wells. The non-Markovian effect manifests itself in spin dephasing when the
mean spin precession time is shorter than the momentum relaxation time. The
spin dephasing becomes slower when the non-Markovian effect is important.
Moreover, quantum spin beats due to the memory effect of the non-Markovian
hole-longitudinal optical phonon scattering are predicted.
