Spin relaxation in the impurity band of a 2D semiconductor with spin-split
spectrum in the external magnetic field is considered. Several mechanisms of
spin relaxation are shown to be relevant. The first one is attributed to
phonon-assisted transitions between Zeeman sublevels of the ground state of an
isolated impurity, while other mechanisms can be described in terms of spin
precession in a random magnetic field during the electron motion over the
impurity band. In the later case there are two contributions to the spin
relaxation: the one given by optimal impurity configurations with the
hop-waiting time inversely proportional to the external magnetic field and
another one related to the electron motion on a large scale. The average spin
relaxation rate is calculated.
