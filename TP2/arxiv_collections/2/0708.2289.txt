We have used polarized neutron reflectometry to study the structural and
magnetic properties of the individual layers in a series of
(Al,Be,Ga)As/(Ga,Mn)As/GaAs/(Ga,Mn)As multilayer samples. Structurally, we
observe that the samples are virtually identical except for the GaAs spacer
thickness (which varies from 3-12 nm), and confirm that the spacers contain
little or no Mn. Magnetically, we observe that for the sample with the thickest
spacer layer, modulation doping by the(Al,Be,Ga)As results in (Ga,Mn)As layers
with very different temperature dependent magnetizations. However, as the
spacer layer thickness is reduced, the temperature dependent magnetizations of
the top an bottom (Ga,Mn)As layers become progressively more similar - a trend
we find to be independent of the crystallographic direction along which spins
are magnetized. These results definitively show that (Ga,Mn)As layers can
couple across a non-magnetic spacer, and that such coupling depends on spacer
thickness.
