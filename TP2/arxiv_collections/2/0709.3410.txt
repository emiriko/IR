We consider the level 1 solution of quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation
with reflecting boundary conditions which is relevant to the Temperley--Lieb
model of loops on a strip. By use of integral formulae we prove conjectures
relating it to the weighted enumeration of Cyclically Symmetric Transpose
Complement Plane Partitions and related combinatorial objects.
