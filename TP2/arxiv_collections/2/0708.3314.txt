We discuss a model for the autocatalytic reaction $A+B\to 2A$ on substrates
where the reactants perform a compact exploration of the space, i.e., on
lattices whose spectral dimension $\tilde{d}$ is $< 2$. For finite systems, the
total time $\tau$ for the reaction to end scales according to two different
regimes, for high and low concentrations of reactants. The functional
dependence of $\tau$ on the volume of the substrate and the concentration of
reactants is discussed within a mean-field approximation. Possible applications
are discussed.
