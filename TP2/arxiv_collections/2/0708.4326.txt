We systematically study the effect of the J^2 tensor terms in the Skyrme
energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. We build a set of 36
parameterizations covering a wide range of the corresponding parameter space.
We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on the evolution of
single-particle-level splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei in spherical
calculations. We find that positive values of the coupling constants of
proton-neutron and like-particle tensor terms allow for a qualitative
description of the evolution of neutron and proton single-particle level
splittings in chains of Ca, Ni and Sn isotopes.
