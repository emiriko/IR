The updated version of the Helac-Phegas event generator is presented. The
matrix elements are calculated through Dyson-Schwinger recursive equations.
Helac-Phegas generates parton-level events with all necessary information, in
the most recent Les Houches Accord format, for the study of any process within
the Standard Model in hadron and lepton colliders.
