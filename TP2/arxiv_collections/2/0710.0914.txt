We introduce the vacillating voter model in which each voter consults two
neighbors to decide its state, and changes opinion if it disagrees with either
neighbor. This irresolution leads to a global bias toward zero magnetization.
In spatial dimension d>1, anti-coarsening arises in which the linear dimension
L of minority domains grows as t^{1/(d+1)}. One consequence is that the time to
reach consensus scales exponentially with the number of voters.
