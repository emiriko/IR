We consider mutual effect of the electron-phonon and strong Coulomb
interactions on each other by summing up leading logarithmic corrections via
the renormalization group approach. We find that the Coulomb interaction
enhances electron coupling to the intervalley A1 optical phonons, but not to
the intravalley E2 phonons.
