Neurosurgery interventions involve complex tracking systems because a tissue
deformation takesplace. The neuronavigation system relies only on preoperative
images. In order to overcome the soft tissue deformations and guarantee the
accuracy of the navigation a biomechanical model can be used during surgery to
simulate the deformation of the brain. Therefore, a mesh generation for an
optimal real-time Finite Element Model (FEM) becomes crucial. In this work we
present different alternatives from a meshgeneration point of view that were
evaluated to optimize the process in terms of elements quantity and quality as
well as constraints of a intraoperative application and patient specific data.
