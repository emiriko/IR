The Hamiltonian H of one-body Maryland model is defined as the sum of a
linear unperturbed Hamiltonian H_0 and the interaction V, which is a Toeplitz
matrix. Maryland model with a doubly infinite Hilbert space are exactly solved.
Special cases of one-body Maryland model include the original Maryland model
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 833 (1982) and Physica 10D, 369 (1984)), which describes
a quantum kickied linear rotator and single band Bloch oscillations. Maryland
model and single band Bloch oscillations are the same Hamiltonian in two
different representations. A special case of many-body Maryland model is
Luttinger model.
