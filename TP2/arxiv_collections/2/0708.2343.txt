Hypothesis testing is a fundamental issue in statistical inference and has
been a crucial element in the development of information sciences. The Chernoff
bound gives the minimal Bayesian error probability when discriminating two
hypotheses given a large number of observations. Recently the combined work of
Audenaert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 160501] and Nussbaum and Szkola
  [quant-ph/0607216] has proved the quantum analog of this bound, which applies
when the hypotheses correspond to two quantum states. Based on the quantum
Chernoff bound, we define a physically meaningful distinguishability measure
and its corresponding metric in the space of states; the latter is shown to
coincide with the Wigner-Yanase metric. Along the same lines, we define a
second, more easily implementable, distinguishability measure based on the
error probability of discrimination when the same local measurement is
performed on every copy. We study some general properties of these measures,
including the probability distribution of density matrices, defined via the
volume element induced by the metric, and illustrate their use in the
paradigmatic cases of qubits and Gaussian infinite-dimensional states.
