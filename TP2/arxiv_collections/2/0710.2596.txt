Quiet (or sub-Poissonian) oscillators generate a number of dissipation events
whose variance is less than the mean. It was shown in 1984 by Golubev and
Sokolov that lasers driven by regular pumps are quiet in that sense. The
purpose of this paper is to show that, as long as the laser-detector system is
strictly stationary, quantization of the optical field is not required to
explain such phenomena. The theory presented here is semi-classical, yet exact.
Previous theories considering excited-state atoms regularly-injected in
resonators, on the other hand, do require in principle light quantization.
Specifically, we consider a laser involving a single electron permanently
interacting with the field and driven by a constant-potential battery, and
point out a similarity with reflex klystrons. The detected noise is found to be
only 7/8 of the shot-noise level. It is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our
calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with
different physical interpretations.
