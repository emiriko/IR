We discuss the implementation of arbitrary precision composite pulses
developed using the methods of Brown et al. [Phys. Rev. A 70 (2004) 052318]. We
give explicit results for pulse sequences designed to tackle both the simple
case of pulse length errors and for the more complex case of off-resonance
errors. The results are developed in the context of NMR quantum computation,
but could be applied more widely.
