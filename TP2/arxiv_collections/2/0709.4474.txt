We consider transitions from the resonance X(3872) to the chi_{cJ} states of
charmonium with emission of one or two pions as a means of studying the
structure of the X resonance. We find that the relative rates for these
transitions to the final states with different J significantly depend on
whether the initial state is a pure charmonium state or a four-quark/molecular
state.
