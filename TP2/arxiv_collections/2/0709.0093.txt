This document proposes data formats to exchange numerical relativity results,
in particular gravitational waveforms. The primary goal is to further the
interaction between gravitational-wave source modeling groups and the
gravitational-wave data-analysis community. We present a simple and extendable
format which is applicable to various kinds of gravitational wave sources
including binaries of compact objects and systems undergoing gravitational
collapse, but is nevertheless sufficiently general to be useful for other
purposes.
