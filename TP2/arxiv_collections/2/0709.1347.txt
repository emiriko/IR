We obtain an analytic expression for the specific heat of a system of N rigid
rotators exactly in the high temperature limit, and via a pertubative approach
in the low temperature limit. We then evaluate the specific heat of a diatomic
gas with both translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and conclude
that there is a mixing between the translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in nonextensive statistics.
