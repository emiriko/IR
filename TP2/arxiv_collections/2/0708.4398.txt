We compare several recent theoretical studies of the single transverse spin
asymmetry in dijet-correlations at hadron colliders. We show that the results
of these studies are all consistent. To establish this, we investigate in
particular the two-gluon exchange contributions to the relevant initial and
final state interactions in the context of a simplifying model. Overall, the
results confirm that the dijet imbalance obeys at best a non-standard or
"generalized" transverse-momentum-dependent factorization.
