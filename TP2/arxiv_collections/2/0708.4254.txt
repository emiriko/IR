We extend the Yang-Baxter cocycle invariants for virtual knots by augmenting
Yang-Baxter 2-cocycles with cocycles from a cohomology theory associated to a
virtual biquandle structure. These invariants coincide with the classical
Yang-Baxter cocycle invariants for classical knots but provide extra
information about virtual knots and links. In particular, they provide a method
for detecting non-classicality of virtual knots and links.
