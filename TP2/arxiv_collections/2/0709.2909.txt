We show that modelling the universe as a pre-geometric system with emergent
quantum modes, and then constructing the classical limit, we obtain a new
account of space and gravity that goes beyond Newtonian gravity even in the
non-relativistic limit. This account does not require dark matter to explain
the spiral galaxy rotation curves, and explains as well the observed
systematics of black hole masses in spherical star systems, the bore hole $g$
anomalies, gravitational lensing and so on. As well the dynamics has a Hubble
expanding universe solution that gives an excellent parameter-free account of
the supernovae and gamma-ray-burst red-shift data, without dark energy or dark
matter. The Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is derived
from this dynamics, but is shown not satisfy the General Relativity based
Friedmann equations. It is noted that General Relativity dynamics only permits
an expanding flat 3-space solution if the energy density in the pressure-less
dust approximation is non-zero. As a consequence dark energy and dark matter
are required in this cosmological model, and as well the prediction of a future
exponential accelerating Hubble expansion. The FLRW $\Lambda$CDM model
data-based parameter values, $\Omega_\Lambda=0.73$, $\Omega_{DM}=0.27$, are
derived within the quantum cosmology model, but are shown to be merely
artifacts of using the Friedmann equations in fitting the red-shift data.
