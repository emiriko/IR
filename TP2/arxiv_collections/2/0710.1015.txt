By regarding the Lifshitz expression for the Casimir free energy on the real
frequency axis rather than the imaginary Matsubara frequencies as is customary,
new light is shed on the ongoing debate regarding the thermodynamical
consistency of this theory in combination with common permittivity models. It
is argued that when permittivity is temperature independent over a temperature
interval including zero temperature, a cavity made of causal material with
continuous dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot violate Nernst's
theorem (the third law of thermodynamics). The purported violation of this
theorem pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and
temperature vanish simultaneously. While any model should abide by the laws of
thermodynamics within its range of applicability, we emphasise that the Nernst
heat theorem is a relevant criterion for choosing amongst candidate theories
only when these theories are fully applicable at zero temperature and
frequency.
