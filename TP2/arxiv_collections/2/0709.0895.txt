We numerically simulate vortex nucleation in a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)
subject to an effective magnetic field. The effective magnetic field is
generated from the interplay between light with a non-trivial phase structure
and the BEC, and can be shaped and controlled by appropriate modifications to
the phase and intensity of the light. We demonstrate that the nucleation of
vortices is seeded by instabilities in surface excitations which are coupled to
by an asymmetric trapping potential (similar to the case of condensates subject
to mechanical rotation) and show that this picture also holds when the applied
effective magnetic field is not homogeneous. The eventual configuration of
vortices in the cloud depends on the geometry of the applied field.
