The probabilistic character of the measurement process is one of the most
puzzling and fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. In many-body systems
quantum mechanical noise reveals non-local correlations of the underlying
many-body states. Here, we provide a complete experimental analysis of the
shot-to-shot variations of interference fringe contrast for pairs of
independently created one-dimensional Bose condensates. Analyzing different
system sizes we observe the crossover from thermal to quantum noise, reflected
in a characteristic change in the distribution functions from Poissonian to
Gumbel-type, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the
Luttinger liquid formalism. We present the first experimental observation of
quasi long-range order in one-dimensional atomic condensates, which is a
hallmark of quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. Furthermore, our
experiments constitute the first analysis of the full distribution of quantum
noise in an interacting many-body system.
