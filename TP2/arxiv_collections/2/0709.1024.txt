In this paper, a comprehensive performance review of a MPI-based high-order
spectral and mortar element method C++ toolbox is presented. The focus is put
on the performance evaluation of several aspects with a particular emphasis on
the parallel efficiency. The performance evaluation is analyzed and compared to
predictions given by a heuristic model, the so-called Gamma model. A
tailor-made CFD computation benchmark case is introduced and used to carry out
this review, stressing the particular interest for commodity clusters.
Conclusions are drawn from this extensive series of analyses and modeling
leading to specific recommendations concerning such toolbox development and
parallel implementation.
