Anyons are quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems that show statistical
properties very distinct from those of bosons or fermions. While their isolated
observation has not yet been achieved, here we perform a quantum simulation of
anyons on the toric code model. By encoding the model in the multi-partite
entangled state of polarized photons, we are able to demonstrate various
manipulations of anyonic states and, in particular, their characteristic
fractional statistics.
