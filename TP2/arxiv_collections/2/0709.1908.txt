Indirect information about the possible scale of supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking is provided by B physics observables (BPO) as well as electroweak
precision observables (EWPO). We review the combination of the constraints
imposed by recent measurements of the BPO BR(b -> s gamma), BR(B_s -> mu+ mu-),
BR(B_u -> tau nu_tau) and Delta M_{B_s} with those obtained from the
experimental measurements of the EWPO M_W, sin^2 theta_eff, Gamma_Z, (g-2)_mu
and M_h. We perform a chi^2 fit to the parameters of the constrained minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which the
SUSY-breaking parameters are universal at the GUT scale. Assuming that the
lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) provides the cold dark matter density
preferred by WMAP and other cosmological data, we confirm the preference found
previously for a relatively low SUSY-breaking scale, though there is some
slight tension between the EWPO and the BPO.
