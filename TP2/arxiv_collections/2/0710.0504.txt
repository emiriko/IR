We present an estimate for the imaginary part of the recently introduced
finite temperature real-time static potential. It can be extracted from the
time evolution of the Wilson loop in classical lattice gauge theory. The
real-time static potential determines, through a Schroedinger-type equation and
a subsequent Fourier-transform of its solution, the spectral function of heavy
quarkonium in finite-temperature QCD. We also compare the results of the
classical simulations with those of Hard Thermal Loop improved simulations, as
well as with analytic expectations based on resummed perturbation theory.
