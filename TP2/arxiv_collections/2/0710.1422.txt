We present results for the mass spectrum of charm and bottom heavy baryons,
using MILC coarse lattice configurations with 2+1 flavors. Clover heavy quark
propagators with the Fermilab interpretation and improved staggered light quark
propagators are used to construct two point functions with local operators for
different flavor and spin states.
