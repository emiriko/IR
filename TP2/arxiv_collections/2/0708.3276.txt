We have searched for neutrinoless $\tau$ lepton decays into $\ell$ and $V^0$,
where $\ell$ stands for an electron or muon, and $V^0$ for a vector meson
($\phi$, $\omega$, $K^{*0}$ or $\bar{K}^{*0}$), using 543 fb$^{-1}$ of data
collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$
collider. No excess of signal events over the expected background is observed,
and we set upper limits on the branching fractions in the range $(0.7 - 1.8)
\times 10^{-7}$ at the 90% confidence level. These upper limits include the
first results for $\ell \omega$ as well as new limits that are $3.6 - 9.6$
times more restrictive than our previous results for $\ell \phi$, $\ell K^{*0}$
and $\ell \bar{K}^{*0}$.
