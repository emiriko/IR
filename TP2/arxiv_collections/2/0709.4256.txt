In a recent Letter [N.A. Pertsev and H. Kohlstedt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
257603 (2007)] the authors claim that "even nanoscale capacitors and tunnel
junctions may have out of plane polarization sufficient for memory
applications." Here we show in an elementary way that this conclusion is not
substantiated by their calculations and that they should have come to the
opposite conclusion within their approximations.
