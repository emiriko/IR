Recently, neutron scattering data on powder samples of Zn-paratacamite,
Zn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_6$Cl$_{2}$, with small Zn concentration has been
interpreted as evidence for valence bond solid and N\'eel ordering [1]. We
study the classical and quantum Heisenberg models on the distorted kagome
lattice appropriate for Zn-paratacamite at low Zn doping. Our theory naturally
leads to the emergence of the valence bond solid and collinear magnetic order
at zero temperature. Implications of our results to the existing experiments
are discussed. We also suggest future inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering
experiments that can test our predictions.
