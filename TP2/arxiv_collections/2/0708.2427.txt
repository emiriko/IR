We discuss the signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for scenarios with
non-universal gaugino masses in supersymmetric (SUSY) theories. We perform a
multichannel analysis, and consider the ratios of event rates in different
channels such as $jets + {E}_T/ $, $same$ - and $opposite$-$sign dileptons$
$+jets+ {E}_T/ $, as well as $single-lepton$ and $trilepton$ final states
together with $jets + {E}_T/ $ . Low-energy SUSY spectra corresponding to
high-scale gaugino non-universality arising from different breaking schemes of
SU(5) as well as SO(10) Grand Unified (GUT) SUSY models are considered, with
both degenerate low-energy sfermion masses and those arising from a
supergravity scenario. We present the numerical predictions over a wide range
of the parameter space using the event generator {\tt Pythia}, specifying the
event selection criteria and pointing out regions where signals are likely to
be beset with backgrounds. Certain broad features emerge from the study, which
may be useful in identifying the signatures of different GUT breaking schemes
and distinguishing them from a situation with a universal gaugino mass at high
scale. The absolute values of the predicted event rates for different scenarios
are presented together with the various event ratios, so that these can also be
used whenever necessary.
