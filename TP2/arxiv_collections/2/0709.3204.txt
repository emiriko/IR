We studied magnetic field dependent microwave absorption in epitaxial
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ films using an X-band Bruker ESR spectrometer. By
analyzing angular and temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic and spin-wave
resonances we determine spin-wave stiffness and anisotropy field. The spin-wave
stiffness as found from the spectrum of the standing spin-wave resonances in
thin films is in fair agreement with the results of inelastic neutron
scattering studies on a single crystal of the same composition [Vasiliu-Doloc
et al., J. Appl. Phys. \textbf{83}, 7343 (1998)].
