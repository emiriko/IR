We show that the recent experimental observation of the rectification of
swimming bacteria in a system with an array of asymmetric barriers occurs due
to the ballistic component of the bacteria trajectories introduced by the
bacterial "motor." Each bacteria selects a random direction for motion and then
moves in this direction for a fixed period of time before randomly changing its
orientation and moving in a new direction. In the limit where the bacteria
undergo only Brownian motion, rectification by the barriers does not occur. We
also examine the effects of steric interactions between the bacteria and
observe a clogging effect upon increasing the bacteria density.
