Glass-like arrest of kinetics has been observed across many magnetic
first-order transitions. By traversing the two control variable H-T space,
tunable coexisting fractions of arrested and equilibrium phases have been
observed. We report here a fortuitous situation in a half-doped manganite
sample, where these features occur by varying only temperature (T) along the
H=0 line. The resistivity at 5 K rises by more than a factor of three provided
second cool-down is effected from a specified intermediate T. This significant
enhancement results from heterogeneous nucleation during second cool-down of
regions that were kinetically arrested during first cool-down.
