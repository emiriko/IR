A very precise determination of V_us can be obtained from the semi-inclusive
hadronic decay width of the tau lepton into final states with strangeness. The
ratio of the Cabibbo-suppressed and Cabibbo-allowed tau decay widths directly
measures (V_us/V_ud)^2, up to very small SU(3)-breaking corrections which can
be theoretically estimated with the needed accuracy. Together with previous LEP
and CLEO data, the recent measurements by Babar and Belle of some
Cabibbo-suppressed tau decays imply V_us= 0.2165 +- 0.0026_exp +- 0.0005_th,
which is already competitive with the standard extraction from K_l3 decays. The
uncertainty is largely dominated by experimental errors and should be easily
reduced with the high statistics of the B factories, providing the most
accurate determination of this parameter. A 1% experimental precision on the
Cabibbo-suppressed tau decay width would translate into a 0.6% uncertainty on
V_us.
