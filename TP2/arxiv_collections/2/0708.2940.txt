We use the work done on and the heat removed from a system to maintain it in
a nonequilibrium steady state for a thermodynamic-like description of such a
system as well as of its fluctuations. Based on a generalized Onsager-Machlup
theory for nonequilibrium steady states we indicate two ambiguities, not
present in an equilibrium state, in defining such work and heat: one due to a
non-uniqueness of time-reversal procedures and another due to multiple
possibilities to separate heat into work and an energy difference in
nonequilibrium steady states. As a consequence, for such systems, the work and
heat satisfy multiple versions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics
as well as of their fluctuation theorems. Unique laws and relations appear only
to be obtainable for concretely defined systems, using physical arguments to
choose the relevant physical quantities. This is illustrated on a number of
systems, including a Brownian particle in an electric field, a driven torsion
pendulum, electric circuits and an energy transfer driven by a temperature
difference.
