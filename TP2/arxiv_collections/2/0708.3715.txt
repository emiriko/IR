The exact spectrum of dyons in a class of N=4 supersymmetric string theories
gives us information about dyon spectrum in N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories.
This in turn can be translated into prediction about the BPS spectrum of three
string junctions on a configuration of three parallel D3-branes. We show that
this prediction agrees with the known spectrum of three string junction in
different domains in the moduli space separated by walls of marginal stability.
