In this work, the role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy capacity of
the wiretap channel is investigated. A model is considered in which the
feed-forward and feedback signals share the same noisy channel. More
specifically, a discrete memoryless modulo-additive channel with a full-duplex
destination node is considered first, and it is shown that a judicious use of
feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity to the capacity of the
source-destination channel in the absence of the wiretapper. In the
achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a private key, known
only to the destination. Then a half-duplex system is considered, for which a
novel feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate
(even when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the
source-destination channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the
modulo-additive property of the channel, which is exploited by the destination
to perform encryption over the channel without revealing its key to the source.
