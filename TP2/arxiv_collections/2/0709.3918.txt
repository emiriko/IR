In mirage-mediation models there exists a modulus field whose mass is O(1000)
TeV and its late-decay may significantly change the standard thermal relic
scenario of the dark matter. We study nonthermal production of the dark matter
directly from the modulus decay, and find that for some parameter regions
non-thermally produced neutralinos can become the dark matter.
