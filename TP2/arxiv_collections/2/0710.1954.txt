The prospects for the determination of the properties of a hypothetical boson
discovered at the Large Hadron Collider using measurements to be performed with
the ATLAS and CMS detectors are summarized. The properties that are discussed
are the mass of the boson, its width, the strength of its couplings to
fermions, the strength and structure of its couplings to gauge bosons and its
spin and CP quantum numbers.
