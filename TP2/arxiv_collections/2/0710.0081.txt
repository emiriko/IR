Partial summations of perturbation expansions of the directed polymer in
disordered media (DPRM) enables one to represent the latter as skeleton
expansions in powers of the effective coupling constant $\Delta (t)$, which
corresponds to the binding state between two replicas in the replica field
theory of DPRM, and is equivalent to the binding state of a quantum particle in
an external $\delta $% -potential. The strong coupling phase is characterized
by the exponential dependence of $\Delta (t)$ on $t$, $\Delta (t)\sim \exp
(p_{c}t)$ with $% p_{c} $ being the binding energy of the particle. For
dimensions $d>2$ the strong coupling phase exists for $\Delta_{0}>\Delta
_{c}(d)$. We compute explicitly the mean-square displacement and the 2nd
cumulant of the free energy to the lowest order in powers of effective coupling
in $d=1$. We argue that the elimination of the terms $\exp (p_{c}t)$ in
skeleton expansions demands an additional partial summation of skeleton series.
