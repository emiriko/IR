We report the observation of the b -> d penguin-dominated decay B0 -> K*0
K*0bar with a sample of 383.2 +/- 4.2 million BBbar pairs collected with the
BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center. The measured branching fraction is Br(B0 -> K*0
K*0bar) = [1.28^{+0.35}_{-0.30} +/- 0.11] x 10^{-6} and the fraction of
longitudinal polarization f_L (B0 -> K*0 K*0bar) = 0.80^{+0.10}_{-0.12} +/-
0.06. The first error quoted is statistical and the second systematic. We also
obtain an upper limit at the 90% confidence level on the branching fraction for
Br(B0 ->K*0 K*0) < 0.41 x 10^{-6}.
