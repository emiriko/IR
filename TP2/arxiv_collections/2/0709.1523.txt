I review recent progress on the connection between string theory and quantum
chromodynamics in the context of the gauge/gravity duality. Emphasis is placed
on conciseness and conceptual aspects rather than on technical details. Topics
covered include the large-Nc limit of gauge theories, the gravitational
description of gauge theory thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, and
confinement/deconfinement thermal phase transitions.
