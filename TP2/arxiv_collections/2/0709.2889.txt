We recently performed a pilot study determining the parameters of the leading
order chiral Lagrangian from distributions of the eigenvalues of a quenched
Dirac operator coupled to an imaginary isospin chemical potential. We
complement a quick survey of our recent preprint arXiv:0708.1731 [hep-lat] by
addressing some points raised during discussions at the conference.
