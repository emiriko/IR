We review the recent confirmation of quantum entanglement in e+ e- collisions
at the BELLE experiment at KEK-B in Japan with neutral B- mesons, and at the
KLOE experiment at the DAFNE in Italy with neutral K- mesons. Such effects in
the latter system seen already in proton-antiproton collisions by the CPLEAR
experiment are also reviewed for purposes of comparison. In addition, the KLOE
experiment provides new tests of the CPT theorem and are briefly discussed.
