We have conducted an agent-based simulation of chain bankruptcy. The
propagation of credit risk on a network, i.e., chain bankruptcy, is the key to
nderstanding largesized bankruptcies. In our model, decrease of revenue by the
loss of accounts payable is modeled by an interaction term, and bankruptcy is
defined as a capital deficit. Model parameters were estimated using financial
data for 1,077 listed Japanese firms. Simulations of chain bankruptcy on the
real transaction network consisting of those 1,077 firms were made with the
estimated model parameters. Given an initial bankrupt firm, a list of chain
bankrupt firms was obtained. This model can be used to detect high-risk links
in a transaction network, for the management of chain bankruptcy.
