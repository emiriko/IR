We implement non-minimal flavour violation (NMFV) in the MSSM at low scale.
In this framework, we propose benchmark points for the mSUGRA scenario
including non-minimal flavour violation by evaluating a number of experimental
low-energy, electroweak precision and cosmological constraints. We finally
discuss phenomenological aspects of our NMFV scenario and present a numerical
analysis of squark and gaugino production cross sections at the LHC.
