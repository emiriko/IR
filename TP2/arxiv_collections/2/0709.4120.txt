We review recent results, obtained with P. Fendley, on frustration of quantum
charges in lattice models for itinerant fermions with strong repulsive
interactions. A judicious tuning of kinetic and interaction terms leads to
models possessing supersymmetry. In such models frustration takes the form of
what we call superfrustration: an extensive degeneracy of supersymmetric ground
states. We present a gallery of examples of superfrustration on a variety of 2D
lattices.
