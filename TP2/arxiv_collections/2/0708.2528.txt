We report here the synthesis of single-phase bulk samples of CoO2, the x = 0
end member of the AxCoO2 systems (A = Li, Na), from a pristine LiCoO2 sample
using an electrochemical technique to completely de-intercalate lithium. Thus,
synthesized CoO2 samples were found to be oxygen-stoichiometric and possess a
crystal structure consisting of stacked triangular-lattice CoO2 layers only.
The magnetic susceptibility of the CoO2 sample was revealed to be relatively
large in its initial value and then level off as the temperature increases,
suggesting that CoO2 is a Pauli-paramagnetic metal with itinerant electrons.
