The investor is interested in the expected return and he is also concerned
about the risk and the uncertainty assumed by the investment. One of the most
popular concepts used to measure the risk and the uncertainty is the variance
and/or the standard-deviation. In this paper we explore the following issues:
Is the standard-deviation a good measure of risk and uncertainty? What are the
potentialities of the entropy in this context? Can entropy present some
advantages as a measure of uncertainty and simultaneously verify some basic
assumptions of the portfolio management theory, namely the effect of
diversification?
