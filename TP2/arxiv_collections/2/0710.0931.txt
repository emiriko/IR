The heptanuclear complex [Mo(IV)(CN)2(CN-CuL)6]8+ exhibits photomagnetism. An
earlier microscopic model showed that the transition dipole moments for
excitation in different spin manifolds are similar in magnitude. In this paper,
we attribute photomagnetism to the long lived S=3 charge transfer excited state
for which there appears to be sufficient experimental evidence. We model the
photomagnetism by employing a kinetic model which includes internal conversions
and intersystem crossings. The key feature of the model is assumption of the
existence of two kinds of S=3 states: one which has no direct pathway for
internal conversion and the other characterized by slow kinetics for internal
conversion to the low-energy states. The trapped S=3 state can decay via a
thermally activated barrier to the other S=3 state. The experimental
temperature dependence of magnetization plot is fitted using rate constants
with Arrhenius dependence. The two different experimental cMT vs. T curves
obtained with different irradiation times are fitted with our model. Our
studies show that the photomagnetism in these systems is governed by kinetics
and not due to differences in oscillator strengths for excitation of the
different spin states.
