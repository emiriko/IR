The ground-state energies of 2, 3, 4 and 5 \pi^+'s in a spatial volume V (2.5
fm)^3 are computed with lattice QCD. By eliminating the leading contribution
from three-\pi^+ interactions, particular combinations of these n-\pi^+
ground-state energies provide precise extractions of the \pi^+\pi^+ scattering
length in agreement with that obtained from calculations involving only two
\pi^+'s. The three-\pi^+ interaction can be isolated by forming other
combinations of the n-\pi^+ ground-state energies. We find a result that is
consistent with a repulsive three-\pi^+ interaction for m_\pi < 352 MeV.
