It is well known that simultaneity within an inertial frame is defined in
relativity theory by a convention or definition. This definition leads to
different simultaneities across inertial frames and the well known principle of
relativity of simultaneity. The lack of a universal present implies the
existence of past, present and future as a collection of events on a four
dimensional manifold or continuum wherein three dimensions are space like and
one dimension is time like. However, such a continuum precludes the possibility
of evolution of future from the present as all events exist forever so to speak
on the continuum with the tenses past, present and future merely being
perceptions of different inertial frames. Such a far-reaching ontological
concept, created by a mere convention, is yet to gain full acceptance. In this
paper, we present arguments in favour of an absolute present, which means
simultaneous events are simultaneous in all inertial frames, and subscribe to
evolution of future from the present.
