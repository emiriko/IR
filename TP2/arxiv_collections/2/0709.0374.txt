We find exact solutions in five dimensional inhomogeneous matter dominated
model with a varying cosmological constant. Adjusting arbitrary constants of
integration one can also achieve acceleration in our model. Aside from an
initial singularity our spacetime is regular everywhere including the centre of
the inhomogeneous distribution. We also study the analogous homogeneous
universe in (4+d) dimensions. Here an initially decelerating model is found to
give late acceleration in conformity with the current observational demands. We
also find that both anisotropy and number of dimensions have a role to play in
determining the time of flip, in fact the flip is delayed in multidimensional
models. Some astrophysical parameters like the age, luminosity distance etc are
also calculated and the influence of extra dimensions is briefly discussed.
Interestingly our model yields a larger age of the universe compared to many
other quintessential models.
