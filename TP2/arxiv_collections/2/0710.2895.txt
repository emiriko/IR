We present the ``algebrodynamical'' approach to field-particle theory based
on a nonlinear generalization of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions to
non-commutative algebras of quaternion-like type. For complex quaternions the
theory is Lorentz invariant and naturally carries some gauge and twistor
structures. Point- and string-like singularities are considered as
particle-like formations; their electric charge is ``self-quantized''. A novel
``causal Minkowski geometry with additional phase'' is presented that is
induced by the structure of primordial biquaternion algebra. On this
geometrical background a self-consistent algebraic dynamics of singularities
(``ensemble of dublicons'') is briefly discussed.
