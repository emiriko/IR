Recently, several papers discussed on the existence of a low mass new
structure at a mass close to M=214.3 MeV. It was suggested that the
$\Sigma^{+}$ disintegration: $\Sigma^{+}\to$pP$^{0}$, P$^{0}\to\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$
proceeds through an intermediate particle P$^{0}$ having such mass. The present
work intends to look at other new or available data, in order to observe the
eventual existence of small narrow peaks or shoulders in very low mesonic
masses. Indeed narrow structures were already extracted from various data in
dibaryons, baryons and mesons (at larger masses that those studied here).
