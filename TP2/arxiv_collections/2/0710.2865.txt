We analyze how individual eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac operator at nonzero
quark chemical potential are distributed in the complex plane. Exact and
approximate analytical results for both quenched and unquenched distributions
are derived from non-Hermitian random matrix theory. When comparing these to
quenched lattice QCD spectra close to the origin, excellent agreement is found
for zero and nonzero topology at several values of the quark chemical
potential. Our analytical results are also applicable to other physical systems
in the same symmetry class.
