Recent results show that when non-linear electrodynamics is considered the
no-scalar-hair theorems in the scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity, which
are valid for the cases of neutral black holes and charged black holes in the
Maxwell electrodynamics, can be circumvented. What is even more, in the present
work, we find new non-unique, numerical solutions describing charged black
holes coupled to non-linear electrodynamics in a special class of scalar-tensor
theories. One of the phases has a trivial scalar field and coincides with the
corresponding solution in General Relativity. The other four phases that we
find are characterized by the value of the scalar field charge. The causal
structure and some aspects of the stability of the solutions have also been
studied. For the scalar-tensor theories considered, the black holes have a
single, non-degenerate horizon, i.e., their causal structure resembles that of
the Schwarzschild black hole. The thermodynamic analysis of the stability of
the solutions indicates that a phase transition may occur.
