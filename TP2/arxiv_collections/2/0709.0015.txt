We study a noncommutative deformation of general relativity where the
gravitational field is described by a matrix-valued symmetric two-tensor field.
The equations of motion are derived in the framework of this new theory by
varying a diffeomorphisms and gauge invariant action constructed by using a
matrix-valued scalar curvature. Interestingly the genuine noncommutative part
of the dynamical equations is described only in terms of a particular tensor
density that vanishes identically in the commutative limit. A noncommutative
generalization of the energy-momentum tensor for the matter field is studied as
well.
