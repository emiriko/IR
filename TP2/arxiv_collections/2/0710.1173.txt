We present results on the mass of the nucleon and the $\Delta$ using two
dynamical degenerate twisted mass quarks. The evaluation is performed at four
quark masses corresponding to a pion mass in the range of 690-300 MeV on
lattices of size 2.1 fm and 2.7 fm. We check for cutoff effects by evaluating
these baryon masses on lattices of spatial size 2.1 fm with lattice spacings
$a(\beta=3.9)=0.0855(6)$ fm and $a(\beta=4.05)=0.0666(6)$ fm, determined from
the pion sector and find them to be within our statistical errors. Lattice
results are extrapolated to the physical limit using continuum chiral
perturbation theory.
  The nucleon mass at the physical point provides a determination of the
lattice spacing. Using heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory at ${\cal
O}(p^3)$ we find $a(\beta=3.9)=0.0879(12)$ fm, with a systematic error due to
the chiral extrapolation estimated to be about the same as the statistical
error. This value of the lattice spacing is in good agreement with the value
determined from the pion sector. We check for isospin breaking in the
$\Delta$-system. We find that $\Delta^{++,-}$ and $\Delta^{+,0}$ are almost
degenerate pointing to small flavor violating effects.
