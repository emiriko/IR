A possible explanation is offered for the longstanding mystery surrounding
the meaning of the fine structure constant. The reasoning is based on a
discrete self-similar cosmological paradigm that has shown promise in
explaining the general scaling properties of nature's global hierarchy. The
discrete scale invariance of the paradigm implies that "strong gravity" governs
gravitational interactions within atomic scale systems. Given the revised
gravitational coupling constant and Planck mass, one can demonstrate that the
fine structure constant is the ratio of the strengths of the unit
electromagnetic interaction and the unit gravitational interaction within
atomic scale systems. [Abridged]
