Although a vast amount of experimental information is available on the
elongation, compression, and folding of proteins in biochemical processes, very
little is known about the real structure and molecular dynamics of DNA at an
atomic level. Since this area of work is relatively new, this paper reports the
results of computer simulation of elongation and compression of B-DNA
structures providing new insights into high- energy forms of DNA implicated in
these processes.
