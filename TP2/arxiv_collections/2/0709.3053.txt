Avalanche photo detection is commonly used in applications which require
single photon sensitivity. We examine the limits of using avalanche photo
diodes (APD) for characterising photon statistics at high data rates. To
identify the regime of linear APD operation we employ a ps-pulsed diode laser
with variable repetition rates between 0.5MHz and 80MHz. We modify the mean
optical power of the coherent pulses by applying different levels of
well-calibrated attenuation. The linearity at high repetition rates is limited
by the APD dead time and a non-linear response arises at higher photon-numbers
due to multiphoton events. Assuming Poissonian input light statistics we
ascertain the effective mean photon-number of the incident light with high
accuracy. Time multiplexed detectors (TMD) allow to accomplish photon- number
resolution by photon chopping. This detection setup extends the linear response
function to higher photon-numbers and statistical methods may be used to
compensate for non-linearity. We investigated this effect, compare it to the
single APD case and show the validity of the convolution treatment in the TMD
data analysis.
