We produce Bose-Einstein condensates of 6Li2 molecules in a low power (22 W)
crossed optical dipole trap. Fermionic 6Li atoms are collected in a
magneto-optical trap from a Zeeman slowed atomic beam, then loaded into the
optical dipole trap where they are evaporatively cooled to quantum degeneracy.
Our simplified system offers a high degree of flexibility in trapping geometry
for studying ultracold Fermi and Bose gases.
