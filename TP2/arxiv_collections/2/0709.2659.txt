In a previous paper (Phase Transitions, 80(9), 987, 2007) we discussed the
smectic and nematic textures of some mesomorphic oxadiazole compounds with
terminal Cl-substituent. Optical microscope investigations showed a very
interesting behaviour of smectic and nematic phases; the smectic phase has
fan-shaped and toric textures and the nematic phase has spherulitic domains,
which disappear as the sample is further heated, the texture changing into a
smooth one. Here, we investigate four oxadiazole compounds with the same
structure but terminal Br-substituent. The behaviour of the smectic and nematic
phases is like that observed in the compounds with Cl. The focus of the paper
is on the growth of toric domains from the nematic melt and on the role of
defects in the domain structure.
