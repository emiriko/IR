We determine from first-principles the finite-temperature
properties--linewidths, line shifts, and lifetimes--of the key vibrational
modes that dominate inelastic losses in graphitic materials. In graphite, the
phonon linewidth of the Raman-active E2g mode is found to decrease with
temperature; such anomalous behavior is driven entirely by electron-phonon
interactions, and does not appear in the nearly-degenerate infrared-active E1u
mode. In graphene, the phonon anharmonic lifetimes and decay channels of the
A'1 mode at K dominate over E2g at G and couple strongly with acoustic phonons,
highlighting how ballistic transport in carbon-based interconnects requires
careful engineering of phonon decays and thermalization.
