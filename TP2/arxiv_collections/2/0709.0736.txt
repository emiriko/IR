Motivated by recent work on instabilities in expanding domains in
reaction-diffusion settings, we propose an analog of such mechanisms in
energy-conserving wave equations. In particular, we consider a nonlinear
Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a finite domain and show how the expansion or
contraction of the domain, under appropriate conditions, can destabilize its
originally stable solutions through the modulational instability mechanism.
Using both real and Fourier spacediagnostics, we monitor and control the
crossing of the instability threshold and, hence, the activation of the
instability. We also consider how the manifestation of this mechanism is
modified in a spatially inhomogeneous setting, namely in the presence of an
external parabolic potential, which is relevant to trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates.
