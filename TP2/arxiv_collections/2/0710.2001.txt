The time evolution of a spin-1/2 particle under the influence of a locally
applied external magnetic field, and interacting with anisotropic spin
environment in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ is studied. The exact
analytical form of the reduced density matrix of the central spin is calculated
explicitly for finite number of bath spins. The case of an infinite number of
environmental spins is investigated using the convergence of the rescaled bath
operators to normal Gaussian random variables. In this limit, we derive the
analytical form of the components of the Bloch vector for antiferromagnetic
interactions within the bath, and we investigate the short-time and long-time
behavior of reduced dynamics. The effect of the external magnetic field, the
anisotropy and the temperature of the bath on the decoherence of the central
spin is discussed.
