In supersymmetric scenarios, the seesaw mechanism involving heavy
right-handed neutrinos implies sizable lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the
slepton sector. We discuss the potential of detecting LFV processes at the LHC
in mSUGRA+seesaw scenarios and for general mixing in either the left- or
right-handed slepton sector. The results are compared with the sensitivity of
rare LFV mu -> e gamma decay experiments.
