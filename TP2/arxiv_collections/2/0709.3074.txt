We introduce analytic solutions for a class of two components bouncing
models, where the bounce is triggered by a negative energy density perfect
fluid. The equation of state of the two components are constant in time, but
otherwise unrelated. By numerically integrating regular equations for scalar
cosmological perturbations, we find that the (would be) growing mode of the
Newtonian potential before the bounce never matches with the the growing mode
in the expanding stage. For the particular case of a negative energy density
component with a stiff equation of state we give a detailed analytic study,
which is in complete agreement with the numerical results. We also perform
analytic and numerical calculations for long wavelength tensor perturbations,
obtaining that, in most cases of interest, the tensor spectral index is
independent of the negative energy fluid and given by the spectral index of the
growing mode in the contracting stage. We compare our results with previous
investigations in the literature.
