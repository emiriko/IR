We consider the semi-classical limit for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In
order to consider non-trivial boundary conditions at infinity, we work in
Zhidkov spaces rather than in Sobolev spaces. For the usual cubic nonlinearity,
we obtain a point-wise description of the wave function as the Planck constant
goes to zero, so long as no singularity appears in the limit system. For a
cubic-quintic nonlinearity, we show that working with analytic data may be
necessary and sufficient to obtain a similar result.
