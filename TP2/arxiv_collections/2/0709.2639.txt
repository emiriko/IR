We study the work fluctuations of two types of finite quantum spin chains
under the application of a time-dependent magnetic field in the context of the
fluctuation relation and Jarzynski equality. The two types of quantum chains
correspond to the integrable Ising quantum chain and the nonintegrable XX
quantum chain in a longitudinal magnetic field. For several magnetic field
protocols, the quantum Crooks and Jarzynski relations are numerically tested
and fulfilled. As a more interesting situation, we consider the forcing regime
where a periodic magnetic field is applied. In the Ising case we give an exact
solution in terms of double-confluent Heun functions. We show that the
fluctuations of the work performed by the external periodic drift are maximum
at a frequency proportional to the amplitude of the field. In the nonintegrable
case, we show that depending on the field frequency a sharp transition is
observed between a Poisson-limit work distribution at high frequencies toward a
normal work distribution at low frequencies.
