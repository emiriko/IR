Studies of the electron beam dynamics for the 4GLS design are presented. 4GLS
will provide three different electron bunch trains to a variety of user
synchrotron sources. The 1 kHz XUV-FEL and 100 mA High Average Current branches
share a common 540 MeV linac, whilst the 13 MHz IR-FEL must be
well-synchronised to them. An overview of the injector designs, electron
transport, and energy recovery is given, including ongoing studies of coherent
synchrotron radiation, beam break-up and wakefields. This work is being pursued
for the forthcoming Technical Design Report due in 2008.
