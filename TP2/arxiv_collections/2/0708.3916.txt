We report a new mechanism for the formation of localized states, which takes
place without front propagation. Correspondingly, localized structures appear
as solitary states, displaying a behavior of single independent cells. The
phenomenon is observed in the liquid crystal light-valve experiment and is
described by a one-dimensional normal form model. We show that such solitary
structures exist when a pattern solution collapses and its ghost remains to
influence the phase portrait.
