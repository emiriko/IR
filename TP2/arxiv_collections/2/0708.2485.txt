In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 227402 (2006),
cond-mat/0611411], it has been demonstrated numerically that a long-range
disorder potential in semiconductor quantum wells can be reconstructed reliably
via single-photon interferometry of spontaneously emitted light.
  In the present paper, a simplified analytical model of independent two-level
systems is presented in order to study the reconstruction procedure in more
detail. With the help of this model, the measured photon correlations can be
calculated analytically and the influence of parameters such as the disorder
length scale, the wavelength of the used light, or the spotsize can be
investigated systematically. Furthermore, the relation between the proposed
angle-resolved single-photon correlations and the disorder potential can be
understood and the measured signal is expected to be closely related to the
characteristic strength and length scale of the disorder.
