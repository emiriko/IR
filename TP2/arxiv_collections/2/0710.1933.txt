I consider the monopole condensate of five colour QCD. The naive lowest
energy state is unobtainable at one-loop for five or more colours due to simple
geometry. The consequent adjustment of the vacuum condensate generates a
hierarchy of confinement scales in a natural Higgs-free manner. QCD and
QED-like forces emerge naturally, acting upon matter fields that may be
interpreted as down quarks, up quarks and electrons.
