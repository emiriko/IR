We report on diffraction measurements on multiferroic TbMnO3 which
demonstrate that the Tb- and Mn-magnetic orders are coupled below the
ferroelectric transition TFE = 28 K. For T < TFE the magnetic propagation
vectors (tau) for Tb and Mn are locked so that tauTb = tauMn, while below TNTb
= 7 K we find that tauTb and tauMn lock-in to rational values of 3/7 b* and 2/7
b*, respectively, and obey the relation 3tauTb - tauMn = 1. We explain this
novel matching of wave vectors within the frustrated ANNNI model coupled to a
periodic external field produced by the Mn-spin order. The tauTb = tauMn
behavior is recovered when Tb magnetization is small, while the tauTb = 3/7
regime is stabilized at low temperatures by a peculiar arrangement of domain
walls in the ordered state of Ising-like Tb spins.
