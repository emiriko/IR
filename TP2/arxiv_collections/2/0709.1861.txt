Modern CPUs with increasing core frequency and power are rapidly reaching a
point where the CPU frequency and performance are limited by the amount of heat
that can be extracted by the cooling technology. In mobile environment, this
issue is becoming more apparent, as form factors become thinner and lighter.
Often, mobile platforms trade CPU performance in order to reduce power and
manage thermals. This enables the delivery of high performance computing
together with improved ergonomics by lowering skin temperature and reducing fan
acoustic noise. Most of available high performance CPUs provide thermal sensor
on the die to allow thermal management, typically in the form of analog thermal
diode. Operating system algorithms and platform embedded controllers read the
temperature and control the processor power. Improved thermal sensors directly
translate into better system performance, reliability and ergonomics. In this
paper we will introduce the new Intel CoreTM Duo processor temperature sensing
capability and present performance benefits measurements and results.
