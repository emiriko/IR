We report the experimental realisation of a multibeam atom laser. A single
continuous atom laser is outcoupled from a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) via
an optical Raman transition. The atom laser is subsequently split into up to
five atomic beams with slightly different momenta, resulting in multiple,
nearly co-propagating, coherent beams which could be of use in interferometric
experiments. The splitting process itself is a novel realization of Bragg
diffraction, driven by each of the optical Raman laser beams independently.
This presents a significantly simpler implementation of an atomic beam
splitter, one of the main elements of coherent atom optics.
