In his Comment, Krakoviack [Phys. Rev. B (2007)] finds that the phase
behavior of the s+p spin-glass model is different from what proposed by
Crisanti and Leuzzi [Phys. Rev. B 73, 014412 (2006)] if s and p are larger than
two and are separated well enough. He proposes a trial picture, based on a one
step replica symmetry breaking solution, displaying a mode-coupling-like
glass-to-glass transition line ending in a A3 singularity. However, actually,
the physics of these systems changes when p-s is large, the instability of
which the one step replica symmetry breaking glassy phase suffers turns out to
be so wide ranging that the whole scenario proposed by Krakoviack must be
seriously reconsidered.
