We present a general theory of thermoacoustic phenomena in supercritical
fluids near the critical point in a one-dimensional cell. We take into account
the effects of the heat conduction in the boundary walls and the bulk viscosity
near the critical point. We introduce a coefficient $Z(\omega)$ characterizing
reflection of sound with frequency $\omega$ at the boundary. As applications,
we examine the acoustic eigenmodes in the cell, the response to time-dependent
perturbations, sound emission and reflection at the boundary. Resonance and
rapid adiabatic changes are noteworthy. In these processes, the role of the
thermal diffusion layers is enhanced near the critical point because of the
strong critical divergence of the thermal expansion.
