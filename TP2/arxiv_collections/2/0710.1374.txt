We describe an electro-optical switch based on a commercial electro-optic
modulator (modified for high-speed operation) and a 340V pulser having a rise
time of 2.2ns (at 250V). It can produce arbitrary pulse patterns with an
average repetition rate beyond 20MHz. It uses a grounded-grid triode driven by
transmitting power transistors. We discuss variations that enable analog
operation, use the step-recovery effect in bipolar transistors, or offer other
combinations of output voltage, size, and cost.
