We establish the unimodality and the asymptotic strong unimodality of the
ordinary multinomials and give their smallest mode leading to the expression of
the maximal probability of convolution powers of the discrete uniform
distribution. We conclude giving the generating functions of the sequence of
generalized ordinary multinomials and for an extension of the sequence of
maximal probabilities for convolution power of discrete uniform distribution.
