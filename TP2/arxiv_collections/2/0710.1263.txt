We discuss some large effects of dynamical fermions. One is a cutoff effect,
others concern the contribution of multi-pion states to correlation functions
and are expected to survive the continuum limit. We then turn to the
preparation for simulations at small lattice spacings which we are planning
down to around a=0.04fm in order to understand the size of O(a^2)-effects of
the standard O(a)-improved theory. The dependence of the lattice spacing on the
bare coupling is determined through the Schr"odinger functional renormalized
coupling.
