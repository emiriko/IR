We analyze lepton flavour violation (LFV) and the generation of the observed
baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) within a generalized minimal
lepton flavour violation framework with three quasi-degenerate heavy Majorana
neutrinos. The BAU which is obtained through radiative resonant leptogenesis
can successfully be generated widely independent of the Majorana scale in this
scenario and flavour effects are found to be relevant. Then we discuss the
specific case in which CP violation is exclusively present at low-energies (a
real R matrix) in the flavour sensitive temperature regime. Successful
leptogenesis in this case leads to strong constraints on low-energy neutrino
parameters.
