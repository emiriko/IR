Non-universal boundary conditions in grand unified theories can lead to
non-universal gaugino masses at the unification scale. In R-parity preserving
theories the lightest supersymmetric particle is a natural candidate for the
dark matter. We have studied the composition of the lightest neutralino in
non-universal gaugino mass cases from the SU(5), and implications on the dark
matter. In the representations of SU(5) thermal relic density agreeing with
WMAP is found. The possibility to observe the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A)
at the LHC via neutralino cascades when the lightest neutralino is dark matter,
is discussed for the representation 24, and the connection to dark matter is
established.
