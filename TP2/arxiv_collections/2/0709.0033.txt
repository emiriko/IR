This paper addresses the fundamental principles of generalized Boltzmann
physical kinetics, as a part of non-local physics. It is shown that the theory
of transport processes (including quantum mechanics) can be considered in the
frame of unified theory based on the non-local physical description. The paper
can be considered also as comments and prolongation of the materials published
in the known author's monograph (Boris V. Alexeev, Generalized Boltzmann
Physical Kinetics. Elsevier. 2004).
