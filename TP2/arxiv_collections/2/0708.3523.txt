Polarized neutron scattering experiments were performed on mixed compound
CeRh0.6Co0.4In5 to clarify the nature of the low-temperature ordered states.
Three nonequivalent Bragg peaks, characterized by the wave vectors of q_h ~
(1/2,1/2,0.3), q_1 ~ (1/2,1/2,0.4) and q_c=(1/2,1/2,1/2), were observed at 1.4
K. These Bragg peaks are found to occur entirely in spin-flip channel. This
indicates that these Bragg peaks originate from the magnetic scattering, i.e.,
the antiferromagnetic orders with three different modulations appear in this
compound.
