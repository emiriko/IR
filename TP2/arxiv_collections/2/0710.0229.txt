We study the transverse and longitudinal momentum spectra of fermions
produced in a strong, time-dependent non-Abelian SU(2) field. Different
time-dependent field strengths are introduced. The momentum spectra are
calculated for the produced fermion pairs in a kinetic model. The obtained
spectra are similar to the Abelian case, and they display exponential or
polynomial behaviour at high p_T, depending on the given time dependence. We
investigated different color initial conditions and discuss the recognized
scaling properties for both Abelian and SU(2) cases.
