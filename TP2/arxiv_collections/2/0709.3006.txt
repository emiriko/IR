We have found a new stable spin state in the A-like phase of superfluid 3He
confined to intrinsically anisotropic aerogel. The state can be formed by
radiofrequency excitation applied while cooling through the superfluid
transition temperature and its NMR properties are different from the standard
A-like phase obtained in the limit of very small excitation. It is possible
that this new state is formed by textural domain walls pinned by aerogel.
