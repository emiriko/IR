Recently, origins of non-deterministic behavior and free will in living
systems obtain growing interest (see, e.g. Maye A, Hsieh C, Sugihara G, Brembs
B (2007) Order in Spontaneous Behavior. PLoS ONE 2(5): e443.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000443). In this text, devoted to electromagnetic
hypersensitivity, in n.2 and n.4, a possible physical mechanism of free will
and consequent indeterminacy in behavior is discussed.
