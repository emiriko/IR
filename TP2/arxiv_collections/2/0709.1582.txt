The energy dependence of light and heavy particle production in
hadron-nucleus collisions is discussed. Whereas the production mechanism at
lower energies can be understood in the Glauber rescattering picture,
experimental data at RHIC indicate that particles are mostly produced in
coherent processes. The importance of energy-momentum conservation is shown to
be crucial at forward rapidities for the whole energy range. We also discuss
the behaviour of $\alpha (x_F)$ with energy for light particles and $J/\psi$.
Finally, we make predictions for the future LHC experiment.
