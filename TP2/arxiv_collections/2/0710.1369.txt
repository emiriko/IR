What determines species diversity is dramatic concern in science. Here we
report the effect of doping on diversity in spatiotemporal rock-paper-scissors
(RPS) games, which can be observed directly in ecological, biological and
social systems in nature. Doping means that there exists some buffer patches
which do not involve the main procession of the conflicts but occupied the game
space. Quantitative lattices simulation finds that (1) decrease of extinction
possibility is exponential dependent on the increase of doping rate, (2) the
possibility of the conflict is independent of doping rate at well mix evolution
beginning, and is buffered by doping in long time coexistence procession.
Practical meaning of doping are discussed. To demonstrate the importance of
doping, we present one practical example for microbial laboratory efficient
operation and one theoretical example for human-environment co-existence system
better understanding. It suggests that, for diversity, doping can not be
neglected.
