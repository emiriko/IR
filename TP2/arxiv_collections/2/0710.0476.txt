We study the stability of Z_2 topological vortex excitations in d+1
dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on the lattice at T=0. This is found to
depend on d and on the coupling considered. We discuss the connection with
lattice artifacts causing bulk transitions in the beta_A-beta_F plane and draw
some conclusions regarding the continuum limit of the theory.
