Uncertainties in knowledge of neutrino interactions directly impact the
ability to measure the parameters of neutrino oscillation. Experiments which
make use of differing technologies and neutrino beams are sensitive to
different uncertainties. Several experimental and theoretical issues are
reviewed.
