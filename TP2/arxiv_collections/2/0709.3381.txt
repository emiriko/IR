We present a treatment of the nonlinear matter wave propagation inspired from
optical methods, which includes interaction effects within the atom optics
equivalent of the aberrationless approximation. The atom-optical ABCD matrix
formalism, considered so far for non-interacting clouds, is extended
perturbatively beyond the linear regime of propagation. This approach, applied
to discuss the stability of a matter-wave resonator involving a free-falling
sample, agrees very well with the predictions of the full nonlinear paraxial
wave equation. An alternative optical treatment of interaction effects, based
on the aberrationless approximation and suitable for cylindrical paraxial beams
of uniform linear density, is also adapted for matter waves.
