We perform a quenched computation of the glue momentum fraction in the pion.
Different discretizations of the gluonic energy-momentum tensor are studied on
the lattice for that purpose. We discuss some implications based on the
momentum sum rule. Finally we point out promising applications of the
techniques developed here.
