Quantum-mechanical analogue of Landau-Lifshitz equation has been derived. It
has been established that Landau-Lifshitz equation is fundamental physical
equation underlying the dynamics of spectroscopic transitions and transitional
phenomena. New phenomenon is predicted: electrical spin wave resonance (ESWR)
being to be electrical analogue of magnetic spin wave resonance.
