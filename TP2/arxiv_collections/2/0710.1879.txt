In this paper, we first propose a novel common subexpression elimination
(CSE) algorithm for matrix-vector multiplications over characteristic-2 fields.
As opposed to previously proposed CSE algorithms, which usually focus on
complexity savings due to recurrences of subexpressions, our CSE algorithm
achieves two types of complexity reductions, differential savings and
recurrence savings, by taking advantage of the cancelation property of
characteristic-2 fields. Using our CSE algorithm, we reduce the additive
complexities of cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs). Using a weighted
sum of the numbers of multiplications and additions as a metric, our CFFTs
achieve smaller total complexities than previously proposed CFFTs and other
FFTs, requiring both fewer multiplications and fewer additions in many cases.
