Coherent control calculations are presented for a spherically symmetric box
potential for non-resonant two photon transition probabilities. With the help
of a genetic algorithm (GA) the population of the excited states are maximized
and minimized. The external driving field is a superposition of three intensive
extreme ultraviolet (XUV) linearly polarized laser pulses with different
frequencies in the femtosecond duration range. We solved the quantum mechanical
problem within the dipole approximation. Our investigation clearly shows that
the dynamics of the electron current has a strong correlation with the
optimized and neutralizing pulse shape.
