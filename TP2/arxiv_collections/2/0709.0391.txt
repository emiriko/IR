We study mappings with bounded (p,q)-distortion associated to Sobolev spaces
on Carnot groups. Mappings of such type have applications to the Sobolev type
embedding theory and classification of manifolds. For this class of mappings,
we obtain estimates of linear distortion, and a geometrical description. We
prove also Liouville type theorems and give some sufficient conditions for
removability of sets.
