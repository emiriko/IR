We calculate the quasi-normal modes of black holes localized on a 3-brane of
finite tension embedded in six-dimensional flat spacetime. Using the WKB
approximation, we obtain the frequencies of various types of perturbation both
analytically and numerically for arbitrary brane tension. We thus extend
earlier analytical results which were derived for a brane of small tension.
