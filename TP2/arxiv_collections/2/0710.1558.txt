We describe the effect of hydrodynamic interactions in the sedimentation of a
pair of inextensible semiflexible filaments under a uniform constant force at
low Reynolds numbers. We have analyzed the different regimes and the morphology
of such polymers in simple geometries, which allow us to highlight the
peculiarities of the interplay between elastic and hydrodynamic stresses.
Cooperative and symmetry breaking effects associated to the geometry of the
fibers gives rise to characteristic motion which give them distinct properties
from rigid and elastic filaments.
