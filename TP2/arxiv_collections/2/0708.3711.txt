A new finite-range representation of the JLM effective nucleon-nucleon
interaction is suggested based on the CDM3Y density dependent functional and
M3Y-Paris interaction. The density dependence has been carefully adjusted at
each energy so that the nucleon optical potential (OP) given by the new density
dependent interaction in the Hartree-Fock calculation of nuclear matter closely
matches the JLM nucleon OP given by the Brueckner-Hatree-Fock calculation. The
new interaction has been used in the double-folding model to calculate the OP
for the elastic $^{6}$Li,$^{6}$He,$^{12}$C + $^{12}$C scattering at different
energies.
