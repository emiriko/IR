In 1997, Bauschke, Borwein, and Lewis have stated a trichotomy theorem that
characterizes when the convergence of the method of alternating projections can
be arbitrarily slow. However, there are two errors in their proof of this
theorem. In this note, we show that although one of the errors is critical, the
theorem itself is correct. We give a different proof that uses the
multiplicative form of the spectral theorem, and the theorem holds in any real
or complex Hilbert space, not just in a real Hilbert space.
