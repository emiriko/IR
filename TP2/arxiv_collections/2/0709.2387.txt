Magnetically pure spinel compound ${\rm LiV_2O_4}$ is a rare $d$-electron
heavy fermion. Measurements on single crystals are needed to clarify the
mechanism for the heavy fermion behavior in the pure material. In addition, it
is known that small concentrations ($< 1$ mol%) of magnetic defects in the
structure strongly affect the properties, and measurements on single crystals
containing magnetic defects would help to understand the latter behaviors.
Herein, we report flux growth of ${\rm LiV_2O_4}$ and preliminary measurements
to help resolve these questions. The magnetic susceptibility of some as-grown
crystals show a Curie-like upturn at low temperatures, showing the presence of
magnetic defects within the spinel structure. The magnetic defects could be
removed in some of the crystals by annealing them at 700 $^\circ$C\@. A very
high specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 450 mJ/(mol K${^2}$\@) was obtained
at a temperature of 1.8 K for a crystal containing a magnetic defect
concentration $n$${\rm_{defect}}$ = 0.5 mol%. A crystal with $n$${\rm
_{defect}}$ = 0.01 mol% showed a residual resistivity ratio of 50.
