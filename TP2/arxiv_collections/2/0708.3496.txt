A resonance-like structure in the $\pi^\pm \psi(2S)$ mass spectrum arising in
$B \to K \pi^\pm \psi(2S)$ has recently been reported. It is noted that the
mass of this structure, $4433 \pm 4 \pm 1$ MeV, is not far from the threshold
for production of $D^* \bar{D}_1(2420)$. A proposed mechanism for production of
this state is suggested, and tests are suggested.
