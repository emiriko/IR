In the first part of this article the various experimental sectors of physics
in which Superluminal motions seem to appear are briefly mentioned, after a
sketchy theoretical introduction. In particular, a panoramic view is presented
of the experiments with evanescent waves (and/or tunneling photons), and with
the "Localized superluminal Solutions" (SLS) to the wave equation, like the
so-called X-shaped waves. In the second part of this paper we present a series
of new SLSs to the Maxwell equations, suitable for arbitrary frequencies and
arbitrary bandwidths: some of them being endowed with finite total energy.
Among the others, we set forth an infinite family of generalizations of the
classic X-shaped wave; and show how to deal with the case of a dispersive
medium. Results of this kind may find application in other fields in which an
essential role is played by a wave-equation (like acoustics, seismology,
geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics, etc.). This e-print, in
large part a review, was prepared for the special issue on "Nontraditional
Forms of Light" of the IEEE JSTQE (2003); and a preliminary version of it
appeared as Report NSF-ITP-02-93 (KITP, UCSB; 2002). Further material can be
found in the recent e-prints arXiv:0708.1655v2 [physics.gen-ph] and
arXiv:0708.1209v1 [physics.gen-ph]. The case of the very interesting (and more
orthodox, in a sense) subluminal Localized Waves, solutions to the wave
equations, will be dealt with in a coming paper. [Keywords: Wave equation; Wave
