After a brief discussion of the mass of the Higgs in supersymmetry, I
introduce \lambdaSUSY, a model with an extra chiral singlet superfield in
addition to the MSSM field content. The key features of the model are: the
superpotential W=\lambda S H_d H_u with a large coupling \lambda and the
resulting lightest Higgs with mass above 200GeV. The main part of my
contribution will be about how \lambdaSUSY manifests itself at the LHC.
Discoveries of gluino, squarks and in particular of the three lightest neutral
Higgs bosons are discussed.
