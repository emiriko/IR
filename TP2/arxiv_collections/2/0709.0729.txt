We elucidate the topological features of the entanglement entropy of a region
in two dimensional quantum systems in a topological phase with a finite
correlation length $\xi$. Firstly, we suggest that simpler reduced quantities,
related to the von Neumann entropy, could be defined to compute the topological
entropy. We use our methods to compute the entanglement entropy for the ground
state wave function of a quantum eight-vertex model in its topological phase,
and show that a finite correlation length adds corrections of the same order as
the topological entropy which come from sharp features of the boundary of the
region under study. We also calculate the topological entropy for the ground
state of the quantum dimer model on a triangular lattice by using a mapping to
a loop model. The topological entropy of the state is determined by loop
configurations with a non-trivial winding number around the region under study.
Finally, we consider extensions of the Kitaev wave function, which incorporate
the effects of electric and magnetic charge fluctuations, and use it to
investigate the stability of the topological phase by calculating the
topological entropy.
