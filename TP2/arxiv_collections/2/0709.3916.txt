From appropriate expressions for effective actions, the Hawking radiation
from charged black holes is derived, using only covariant boundary conditions
at the event horizon. The connection of our approach with the Unruh vacuum and
the recent analysis \cite{Robwilczek,Isowilczek,shailesh} of Hawking radiation
using anomalies is established.
