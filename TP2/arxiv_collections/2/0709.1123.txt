The mass and kinetic energy distribution of nuclear fragments from thermal
neutron induced fission of 235U have been studied using a Monte-Carlo
simulation. Besides reproducing the pronounced broadening on the standard
deviation of the final fragment kinetic energy distribution $\sigma_{e}(m)$
around the mass number m = 109, our simulation also produces a second
broadening around m = 125, that is in agreement with the experimental data
obtained by Belhafaf et al. These results are consequence of the
characteristics of the neutron emission, the variation in the primary fragment
mean kinetic energy and the yield as a function of the mass.
