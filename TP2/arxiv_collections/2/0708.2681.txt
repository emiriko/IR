The transformation converting equations invariant under Lorentz into the
equations invariant under Galileo is obtained. On this basis: (1) the
super-light electromagnetic wave with longitudinal and transversal modes is
found out; (2) it is shown the wave velocity coincides with that of de
Broglie's wave; (3) the connection between Maxwell's electrodynamics and
Shredinger's equation is established; (4) structural elements of space are
discovered and "a horizon of visibility" is found. It is shown Bell's
inequalities and the principle of the light speed constancy are based on the
SRT artifact and "Einstein's local realism" is determined by the wave referred
above. Objectivity of results for quantum and classical objects is discussed
