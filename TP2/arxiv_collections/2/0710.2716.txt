In this paper, the problem of pinning control for synchronization of complex
dynamical networks is discussed. A cost function of the controlled network is
defined by the feedback gain and the coupling strength of the network. An
interesting result is that lower cost is achieved by the control scheme of
pinning nodes with smaller degrees. Some rigorous mathematical analysis is
presented for achieving lower cost in the synchronization of different
star-shaped networks. Numerical simulations on some non-regular complex
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and various star-shaped
networks are shown for verification and illustration.
