We reconcile a long-standing controversy regarding the transition temperature
of the Bose-Einstein condensation in a dilute interacting Bose gas, by showing
that there is a crossover between ideal gas and interacting gas. The former
corresponds to a Knudsen (or collisionless) regime, in which the mean-free-path
is much larger than the system dimension, while the latter corresponds to the
opposite hydrodynamic regime. The deviation of the transition temperature from
that of the non-interacting gas is proportional to the square root of a in the
Knudsen regime, and to a in the hydrodynamic regime, where a is the scattering
length. This crossover may be observable in a Bose gas trapped in a potential
or on an optical lattice.
