Usually, mathematical objects have highly parallel interpretations. In this
paper, we consider them as sequential constructors of other objects. In
particular, we prove that every reflexive directed graph can be interpreted as
a program that builds another and is itself builded by another. That leads to
some optimal memory computations, codings similar to modular decompositions and
other strange dynamical phenomenons.
