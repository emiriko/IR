We have investigated the neutrino induced coherent pion production reaction
at the energies of interest for recent experiments like K2K and MiniBooNE. The
model includes pion, nucleon and the Delta(1232) resonance. Medium effects in
the production mechanism and the distortion of the pion wave function are taken
into account. We find a strong reduction of the cross section due to these
effects and also substantial modifications in the energy distributions of the
final pion. The sensitivity of the results on the axial N-Delta coupling C5A(0)
and the coherent fraction in neutral-current pi0 production are discussed.
