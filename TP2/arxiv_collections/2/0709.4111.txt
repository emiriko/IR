The magnetic flux periodicity of superconducting loops as well as flux
quantization itself are a manifestation of macroscopic quantum phenomena with
far reaching implications. They provide the key to the understanding of many
fundamental properties of superconductors and are the basis for most bulk and
device applications of these materials. In superconducting rings the electrical
current has been known to periodically respond to a magnetic flux with a
periodicity of $\bm{h/2e}$. Here, the ratio of Planck's constant and the
elementary charge defines the magnetic flux quantum $\bm{h/e}$. The well-known
$\bm{h/2e}$ periodicity is viewed to be a hallmark for electronic pairing in
superconductors and is considered evidence for the existence of Cooper pairs.
Here we show that in contrast to this long-term belief, rings of many
superconductor bear an $\bm{h/e}$ periodicity. These superconductors include
the high-$\bm{T_c}$ cuprates, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the heavy-fermion superconductors,
as well as all other unconventional superconductors with nodes in the energy
gap functions, and s-wave superconductors with small gaps or states in the gap.
As we show, the 50-year-old Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory of
superconductivity implies that for multiply connected paths of such
superconductors the ground-state energies and consequently also the
supercurrents are generically $\bm{h/e}$ periodic. The origin of this
periodicity is a magnetic-field driven reconstruction of the condensate and a
concomitant Doppler-shifted energy spectrum. The robust, flux induced
reconstruction of the condensate will be an important aspect to understand the
magnetic properties of mesoscopic unconventional superconductors.
