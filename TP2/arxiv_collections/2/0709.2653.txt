We determine the effects of quantum fluctuations about the T=0 mean field
solution of the BCS-BEC crossover in a dilute Fermi gas using the functional
integral method. These fluctuations are described in terms of the zero point
motion of collective modes and the virtual scattering of gapped quasiparticles.
We calculate their effects on various measurable properties, including chemical
potential, ground state energy, the gap, the speed of sound and the Landau
critical velocity. At unitarity, we find excellent agreement with quantum Monte
Carlo and experimental results. In the BCS limit, we show analytically that we
obtain Fermi liquid interaction corrections to thermodynamics including the
Hartree shift. In the BEC limit, we show that the theory leads to an
approximate description of the reduction of the scattering length for bosonic
molecules and also obtain quantum depletion of the Lee-Yang form. At the end of
the paper, we describe a method to include feedback of quantum fluctuations
into the gap equation, and discuss the problems of self-consistent calculations
in satisfying Goldstone's theorem and obtaining ultraviolet finite results at
unitarity.
