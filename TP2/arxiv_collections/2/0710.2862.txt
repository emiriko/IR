We present results for the non-perturbative renormalisation of four-fermion
operators with two flavours of dynamical quarks. We consider both fully
relativistic left current-left current operators, and a full basis for $\Delta
B=2$ operators with static heavy quarks. The renormalisation group running of
the operators to high energy scales is computed in the continuum limit for a
family of Schroedinger Functional renormalisation schemes, via standard finite
size scaling techniques. The total renormalisation factors relating
renormalisation group invariant to bare operators are computed for a choice of
lattice regularisations.
