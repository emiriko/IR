This paper describes the MC@NLO method for matching next-to-leading order
(NLO) perturbative QCD with the parton shower and hadronization model of the
Monte Carlo (MC) event generator tt Herwig++, for e+e- annihilation and
Drell-Yan lepton pair production. Details of the event generation method as
well as spin, flavour, momentum and colour assignments are presented. We obtain
predictions for various distributions which arecompared with experimental data.
