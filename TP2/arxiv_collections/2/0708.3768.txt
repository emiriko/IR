Choosing the three phenomenological models of the dynamical cosmological term
$\Lambda$, viz., $\Lambda \sim (\dot a/a)^2$, $\Lambda \sim {\ddot a/a}$ and
$\Lambda \sim \rho$ where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor, it has been shown by
the method of numerical analysis that the three models are equivalent for the
flat Universe $k=0$. The evolution plots for dynamical cosmological term
$\Lambda$ vs. time $t$ and also the cosmic scale factor $a$ vs. $t$ are drawn
here for $k=0, +1$. A qualitative analysis has been made from the plots which
supports the idea of inflation and hence expanding Universe.
