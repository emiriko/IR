We report the first observation of $e^+e^-$ annihilations into hadronic
states of positive $C$-parity, $\rho^0 \rho^0$ and $\phi\rho^0$. The angular
distributions support two-virtual-photon annihilation production. We also
report the observations of $e^+e^-\to \phi\eta$ and a preliminary result on
$e^+e^-\to \rho^+\rho^-$.
