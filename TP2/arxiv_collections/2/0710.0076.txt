We investigate the conjectural relations between the
Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten quantum SU(2) invariants and the volume of hyperbolic
3-manifolds. Given a finite set of sufficiently large positive integers, say J,
we construct examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds with the same invariants
at all levels in J and different volume.
