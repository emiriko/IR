The four wavenumbers associated with planewave propagation in a Faraday
chiral medium (FCM) with relatively huge magnetoelectric coupling give rise to
enhanced possibilities for negative-phase-velocity propagation and therefore
negative refraction. They can also give rise to the phenomenon of negative
reflection. In particular, for a nondissipative example, we deduced that an
incident plane wave with positive/negative phase velocity can result in a
negatively reflected plane wave with negative/positive phase velocity, as well
as a positively reflected plane wave with positive/negative phase velocity.
