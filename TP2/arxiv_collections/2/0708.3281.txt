We present results from lattice perturbation theory for the residual mass and
other matrix elements measuring the breaking of chiral symmetry in domain-wall
fermions. We have used the exact propagators corresponding to a finite number
of points in the fifth dimensions, and results were obtained for several
choices of the domain-wall parameters.
