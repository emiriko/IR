We describe a method for private database queries using exchange of quantum
states with bits encoded in mutually incompatible bases. For technology with
limited coherence time, the database vendor can announce the encoding after a
suitable delay to allow the user to privately learn one of two items in the
database without the ability to also definitely infer the second item. This
quantum approach also allows the user to choose to learn other functions of the
items, such as the exclusive-or of their bits, but not to gain more information
than equivalent to learning one item, on average. This method is especially
useful for items consisting of a few bits by avoiding the substantial overhead
of conventional cryptographic approaches.
