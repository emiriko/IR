We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the radiative
lifetime of CO in the $a^3\Pi_{1,2}, v=0$ state. CO molecules in a beam are
prepared in selected rotational levels of this metastable state,
Stark-decelerated and electrostatically trapped. From the phosphorescence decay
in the trap, the radiative lifetime is measured to be $2.63\pm0.03$ ms for the
$a^3\Pi_1, v=0, J=1$ level. From spin-orbit coupling between the $a^3\Pi$ and
the $A^1\Pi$ state a 20% longer radiative lifetime of 3.16 ms is calculated for
this level. It is concluded that coupling to other $^1\Pi$ states contributes
to the observed phosphorescence rate of metastable CO.
