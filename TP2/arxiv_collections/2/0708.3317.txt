In an earlier treatment it was demonstrated that general relativity gives
higher values of surface tension in strange stars with quark matter than
neutron stars.We generate the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to
incorporate anisotropic matter and use this to show that pressure anisotropy
provides for a wide range of behaviour in the surface tension than is the case
with isotropic pressures. In particular it is possible that anisotropy
drastically decreases the value of the surface tension.
