The deformation of rocks is associated with microcracks nucleation and
propagation, i.e. damage. The accumulation of damage and its spatial
localization lead to the creation of a macroscale discontinuity, so-called
"fault" in geological terms, and to the failure of the material, i.e. a
dramatic decrease of the mechanical properties as strength and modulus. The
damage process can be studied both statically by direct observation of thin
sections and dynamically by recording acoustic waves emitted by crack
propagation (acoustic emission). Here we first review such observations
concerning geological objects over scales ranging from the laboratory sample
scale (dm) to seismically active faults (km), including cliffs and rock masses
(Dm, hm). These observations reveal complex patterns in both space (fractal
properties of damage structures as roughness and gouge), time (clustering,
particular trends when the failure approaches) and energy domains (power-law
distributions of energy release bursts). We use a numerical model based on
progressive damage within an elastic interaction framework which allows us to
simulate these observations. This study shows that the failure in rocks can be
the result of damage accumulation.
