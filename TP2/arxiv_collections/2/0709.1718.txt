We present an algorithmic framework for a variant of the quantum Monte Carlo
operator-loop algorithm, where non-local cluster updates are constructed in a
way that makes each individual loop smaller. The algorithm is designed to
increase simulation efficiency in cases where conventional loops become very
large, do not close altogether, or otherwise behave poorly. We demonstrate and
characterize some aspects of the short-loop on a square lattice spin-1/2 XXZ
model where, remarkably, a significant increase in simulation efficiency is
observed in some parameter regimes. The simplicity of the model provides a
prototype for the use of short-loops on more complicated quantum systems.
