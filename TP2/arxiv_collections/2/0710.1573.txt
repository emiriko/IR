We present a study of threshold resummation effects for slepton pair
production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). After confirming the known NLO
QCD corrections and generalizing the NLO SUSY-QCD corrections to the case of
mixing squarks in the virtual loop contributions, we employ the Mellin N-space
resummation formalism to compute logarithmically enhanced soft-gluon terms to
all perturbative orders.
