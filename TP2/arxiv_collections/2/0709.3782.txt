Recently Georgi argued that hypothetical conformally invariant hidden sector
weakly interacting with ordinary particles will have unusual manifestations at
low energies in terms of effective degrees of freedom called unparticles. In
this note we consider Aharonov-Bohm type of interactions due to the vector
unparticle coupled to elementary fermions. We have found that quantum
mechanical phase shift is path-dependent.
