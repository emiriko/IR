Power consumption and heat dissipation become key elements in the field of
high-end integrated circuits, especially those used in mobile and high-speed
applications, due to their increase of transistor count and clock frequencies.
Dynamic thermal management strategies have been proposed and implemented in
order to mitigate heat dissipation. However, there is a lack of a tool that can
be used to evaluate DTM strategies and thermal response of real life systems.
Therefore, in this paper we introduce and define the concepts of thermal
benchmark software and power benchmark software as a software application for
run-time system level thermal and power characterization
