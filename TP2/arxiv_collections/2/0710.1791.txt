It is studied the model on J/psi production allowing to extract parton
distribution functions (PDFs) from the combined analysis with both data on
Drell-Yan and J/psi production processes. It is shown that this, so attractive
from theoretical point of view, model, can be safely used in the low energy
region E<100 GeV. The significance of gluon contributions to the J/psi
cross-sections is investigated. The obtained results in the high energy region
occur to be rather surprising.
