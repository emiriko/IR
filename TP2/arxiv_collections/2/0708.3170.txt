We consider configurations of D4-D8-\bar D8 branes which correspond to large
N QCD with non-vanishing temperature and chemical potential for baryon number
and isospin. We study the holographic dual of this model and find a rich phase
structure. The phases, distinguished by the values of quark condensates, are
separated by the surfaces of first order phase transitions. The picture is in
many respects similar to the expected phase structure of QCD in the chiral
limit.
