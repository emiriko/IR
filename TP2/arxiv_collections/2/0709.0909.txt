In a compact space with non-trivial cycles, for sufficiently small values of
the compact dimensions, charge conjugation (C), spatial reflection (P) and time
reversal (T) are spontaneously broken in QCD. The order parameter for the
symmetry breaking is the trace of the Wilson line wrapping around the compact
dimension, which acquires an imaginary part in the broken phase. We show that a
physical signature for the symmetry breaking is a persistent baryonic current
wrapping in the compact directions. The existence of such a current is derived
analytically at first order in perturbation theory and confirmed in the
non-perturbative regime by lattice simulations.
