We use radio-frequency reflectometry to measure quasiparticle tunneling rates
in the single-Cooper-pair-transistor. Devices with and without quasiparticle
traps in proximity to the island are studied. A $10^2$ to $10^3$-fold reduction
in the quasiparticle tunneling rate onto the island is observed in the case of
quasiparticle traps. In the quasiparticle trap samples we also measure a
commensurate decrease in quasiparticle tunneling rate off the island.
