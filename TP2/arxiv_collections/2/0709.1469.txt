This paper consists of two important theoretical observations on the
interplay between l = 2 condensates; d-density wave (ddw), electronic nematic
and d-wave superconducting states. (1) There is SO(4) invariance at a
transition between the nematic and d-wave superconducting states. The nematic
and d-wave pairing operators can be rotated into each other by pseudospin SU(2)
generators, which are s-wave pairing and electron density operators. The
difference between the current work and the previous O(4) symmetry at a
transition between the ddw and d-wave superconducting states (Nayak 2000 Phys.
Rev. B 62 R6135) is presented. (2) The nematic and ddw operators transform into
each other under a unitary transformation. Thus, when a Hamiltonian is
invariant under such a transformation, the two states are exactly degenerate.
The competition between the nematic and ddw states in the presence of a
degeneracy breaking term is discussed.
