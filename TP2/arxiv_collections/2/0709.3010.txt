The BK equation in the conformal basis is considered and analyzed. It is
shown that at high energy a factorization of the coordinate and rapidity
dependence should hold. This allows to simplify significantly the from of the
equation under discussion. An analytical ansatz for the solution to the BK
equation at high energies is proposed and analyzed. This analytical ansatz
satisfies the initial condition at low energy and does not depend on both
rapidity and the initial condition in the high energy limit. The case of the
final rapidity being not too large is discussed and the properties of the
transition region between small and large final rapidities have been studied.
