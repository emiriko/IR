We present the results of a search for associated production of the lightest
chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino using 1 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt s$ = 1.96
TeV p$\rm \bar p$ data collected with the CDF detector at the Tevatron. We
combine the results of several multi-lepton final states to set upper limits on
the cross section times branching ratio for chargino-neutralino production as a
function of the chargino mass.
