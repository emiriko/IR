We study the SU(2) gluon and ghost propagators in Landau gauge on lattices up
to a size of 112^4. A comparison with the SU(3) case is made and finite-volume
effects are then investigated. We find that for a large range of momenta the
SU(2) and SU(3) propagators are remarkably alike. In the low-momentum region we
compare with recent results obtained in DSE studies on a 4-torus.
