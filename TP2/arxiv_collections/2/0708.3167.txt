We study the dilute fermion gas with pairing between two species and unequal
concentrations in a harmonic trap using the mean field theory and the local
density approximation. We found that the system can exhibit a superfluid shell
structure sandwiched by the normal fermions. This superfluid shell structure
occurs if the mass ratio is larger then certain critical value which increases
from the weak-coupling BCS region to the strong-coupling BEC side. In the
strong coupling BEC regime, the radii of superfluid phase are less sensitive to
the mass ratios and are similar to the case of pairing with equal masses.
However, the lighter leftover fermions are easier to mix with the superfluid
core than the heavier ones. A partially polarized superfluid can be found if
the majority fermions are lighter, whereas phase separation is still found if
they are heavier.
