We investigate the Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice by
means of the cellular dynamical mean field theory. The phase diagram determined
in the Hubbard interaction versus temperature plane shows novel reentrant
behavior in the Mott transition due to the competition between Fermi-liquid
formation and magnetic correlations under geometrical frustration. We
demonstrate that the reentrant behavior is characteristic of the Mott
transition with intermediate geometrical frustration and indeed consistent with
recent experimental results of organic materials.
