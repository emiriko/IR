We study Monge's optimal transportation problem, where the cost is given by
optimal control cost. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal map
under certain regularity conditions on the Lagrangian, absolute continuity of
the measures with respect to Lebesgue, and most importantly the absence of
sharp abnormal minimizers. In particular, this result is applicable in the case
of subriemannian manifolds with a 2-generating distribution and cost given by
$d^2$, where $d$ is the subriemannian distance. Also, we discuss some
properties of the optimal plan when abnormal minimizers are present. Finally,
we consider some examples of displacement interpolation in the case of Grushin
plane.
