This is a numerical study of the conductance of an Aharonov-Bohm
interferometer in a tight-binding model of graphene. Two single-mode ballistic
point contacts with zigzag edges are connected by two arms of a hexagonal ring
enclosing a magnetic flux $\Phi$. The point contacts function as valley
filters, transmitting electrons from one valley of the band structure and
reflecting electrons from the other valley. We find, in the wider rings, that
the magnetoconductance oscillations with the fundamental periodicity
$\Delta\Phi=h/e$ are suppressed when the two valley filters have opposite
polarity, while the second and higher harmonics are unaffected or enhanced.
This frequency doubling is interpreted in terms of a larger probability of
intervalley scattering for electrons that travel several times around the ring.
In the narrowest rings the current is blocked for any polarity of the valley
filters, with small, nearly sinusoidal magnetoconductance oscillations.
Qualitatively similar results are obtained if the hexagonal ring is replaced by
a ring with an irregular boundary.
