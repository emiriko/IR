We establish a condition for the perturbative stability of zero energy nodal
points in the quasi-particle spectrum of superconductors in the presence of
coexisting \textit{commensurate} orders. The nodes are found to be stable if
the Hamiltonian is invariant under time reversal followed by a lattice
translation. The principle is demonstrated with a few examples. Some
experimental implications of various types of assumed order are discussed in
the context of the cuprate superconductors.
