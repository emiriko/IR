The possibility of the crossover from the BCS pairing to the Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) of diquarks with going down in density is discussed in the
framework of in the Nambu Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We find that the quark
matter at moderate density may be close to the intermediate of the crossover,
the precursory regime to the BEC phase.
