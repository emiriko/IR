PROPHECY4f is a Monte Carlo event generator for precise simulations of the
Higgs-boson decay H -> WW/ZZ -> 4fermions, supporting leptonic, semileptonic,
and four-quark final states. Both electroweak and QCD corrections are included.
Treating the intermediate gauge bosons as resonances, the calculation covers
the full Higgs-boson mass range above, near, and below the gauge-boson pair
thresholds. In this article we pay particular attention to the recently
implemented option of PROPHECY4f to generate unweighted events.
