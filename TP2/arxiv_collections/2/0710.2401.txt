It is shown that the energy absorption of a rare-gas cluster from a
vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) pulse can be traced with time-delayed
extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond probe pulses by measuring the kinetic
energy of the electrons detached by the probe pulse. By means of this scheme we
demonstrate, that for pump pulses as short as one femtosecond, the charging of
the cluster proceeds during the formation of an electronic nano-plasma inside
the cluster. Using moderate harmonics for the VUV and high harmonics for the
XUV pulse from the same near-infrared laser source, this scheme with well
defined time delays between pump and probe pulses should be experimentally
realizable. Going to even shorter pulse durations we predict that pump and
probe pulses of about 250 attoseconds can induce and monitor non-equilibrium
dynamics of the nano-plasma.
