We consider propagation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in linear
periodic chains (LPCs) of prolate and oblate metallic spheroids. We show that
the SPP group velocity can be efficiently controlled by varying the aspect
ratio of the spheroids. For sufficiently small aspect ratios, a gap appears in
the first Brillouin zone of the chain lattice in which propagating modes do not
exist. depending on the SPP polarization, the gap extends to certain intervals
of the Bloch wave number q. Thus, for transverse polarization, no propagating
SPPs exist with wave numbers q such that q_c^\perp < | q | < \pi/h, h being the
chain period. For longitudinally polarized SPPs, the gap spans the interval
|q|<q_c^\parallel. Here q_c^\perp and q_c^\parallel are different constants
which depend on the chain parameters, spheroid aspect ratio and its orientation
with respect to the chain axis. The dependence of the dispersion curves on the
spheroid aspect ratio leads to a number of interesting effects. In particular,
bandwidth of SPPs that can propagate in an LPC can be substantially increased
by utilizing prolate or oblate spheroids. When q is close to a critical value,
so that |q - q_c^\perp|<<\pi/h or |q - q_c^\parallel|<<\pi/h, the decay length
of the SPPs is dramatically increased. In addition, the dispersion curves
acquire a very large positive or negative slope. This can be used to achieve
superluminal group velocity for realistic chain parameters. We demonstrate
superluminal propagation of Gaussian wave packets in numerical simulations.
Both theory and simulations are based on Maxwell equations with account of
retardation and, therefore, are fully relativistic.
