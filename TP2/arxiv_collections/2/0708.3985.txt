Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy monitors the transient species
generated by one-photon detachment of an electron from aqueous bromide.
Hydrated bromine atoms with a lifetime of ca. 17 ns were observed, nearly half
of which react with excess Br- to form Br2-. The K-edge spectra of the Br atom
and Br2- anion exhibit distinctive resonant transitions that are absent for the
Br- precursor. The absorption spectra indicate that the solvent shell around a
Br0 atom is defined primarily by hydrophobic interactions, in agreement with a
Monte Carlo simulation of the solvent structure.
