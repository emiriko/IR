We investigate the quantum behavior of a mesoscopic two-boson system produced
by number-squeezing ultracold gases of alkali metal atoms. The quantum Poincare
maps of the wavefunctions are affected by chaos in those regions of the phase
space where the classical dynamics produces features that are comparable to
hbar. We also investigate the possibility for quantum control in the dynamics
of excitations in these systems. Controlled excitations are mediated by pulsed
signals that cause Stimulated Raman Adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from the ground
state to a state of higher energy. The dynamics of this transition is affected
by chaos caused by the pulses in certain regions of the phase space. A
transition to chaos can thus provide a method of controlling STIRAP.
