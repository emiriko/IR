The National Science Foundation has identified a new thrust area in Quantum,
Molecular and High Performance Modeling and Simulation for Devices and Systems
(QMHP) in its core program. The main purpose of this thrust area is to capture
scientific opportunities that result from new fundamental cross-cutting
research involving three core research communities: (1) experts in modeling and
simulation of electronic devices and systems; (2) high performance computing
relevant to devices and systems; and (3) the quantum many-body principles
relevant to devices and systems. ECCS is especially interested in learning how
work in these areas could enable whole new classes of systems or devices,
beyond what is already under development in existing mainstream research. The
workshop helped identify technical areas that will enable fundamental
breakthroughs in the future. Modeling and simulation in the electronics and
optoelectronics areas, in general, have already resulted in important
fundamental scientific understanding and advances in design and development of
devices and systems. With the increasing emphasis on the next generation of
devices and systems at the nano, micro, and macro scales and the
interdisciplinary nature of the research, it is imperative that we explore new
mathematical models and simulation techniques. This workshop report provides a
better understanding of unmet emerging new opportunities to improve modeling,
simulation and design techniques for hybrid devices and systems. The purpose
the QMHP workshop was to define the field and strengthen the focus of the
thrust. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to produce a final report (this
document) that will be posted on the web so that the NSF can use it to guide
reviewers and researchers in this field.
