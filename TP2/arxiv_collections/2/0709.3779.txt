We present a general scheme that allows for construction of scalar
separability criteria from positive but not completely positive maps. The
concept is based on a decomposition of every positive map $\Lambda$ into a
difference of two completely positive maps $\Lambda_1$, $\Lambda_2$, i.e.,
$\Lambda=\Lambda_1-\Lambda_2$. The scheme may be also treated as a
generalization of the known entropic inequalities, which are obtained from the
reduction map. An analysis performed on few classes of states shows that the
new scalar criteria are stronger than the entropic inequalities and
furthermore, when derived from indecomposable maps allow for detection of bound
entanglement.
