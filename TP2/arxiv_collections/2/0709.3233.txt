Entanglement sudden death (ESD), the complete loss of entanglement in finite
time, is demonstrated to occur in a class of bipartite states of qu-d-it pairs
of any finite dimension d > 2, when prepared in so-called `isotropic states'
and subject to multi-local dephasing noise alone. This extends previous results
for qubit pairs [T. Yu, J. H. Eberly, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 140403 (2006)] to
all qu-d-it pairs with d > 2.
