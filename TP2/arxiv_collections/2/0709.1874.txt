Genetic recombination can produce heterogeneous phylogenetic histories within
a set of homologous genes. Delineating recombination events is important in the
study of molecular evolution, as inference of such events provides a clearer
picture of the phylogenetic relationships among different gene sequences or
genomes. Nevertheless, detecting recombination events can be a daunting task,
as the performance of different recombinationdetecting approaches can vary,
depending on evolutionary events that take place after recombination. We
recently evaluated the effects of postrecombination events on the prediction
accuracy of recombination-detecting approaches using simulated nucleotide
sequence data. The main conclusion, supported by other studies, is that one
should not depend on a single method when searching for recombination events.
In this paper, we introduce a two-phase strategy, applying three statistical
measures to detect the occurrence of recombination events, and a Bayesian
phylogenetic approach in delineating breakpoints of such events in nucleotide
sequences. We evaluate the performance of these approaches using simulated
data, and demonstrate the applicability of this strategy to empirical data. The
two-phase strategy proves to be time-efficient when applied to large datasets,
and yields high-confidence results.
