We establish a rigorous quantitative connection between (i) the
interferometric duality relation for which-way information and fringe
visibility and (ii) Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for position and modular
momentum. We apply our theory to atom interferometry, wherein spontaneously
emitted photons provide which way information, and unambiguously resolve the
challenge posed by the metamaterial `perfect lens' to complementarity and to
the Heisenberg-Bohr interpretation of the Heisenberg microscope thought
experiment.
