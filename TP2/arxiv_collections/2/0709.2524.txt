Anholonomies in the parametric dependences of the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors of Floquet operators that describe unit time evolutions of
periodically driven systems, e.g., kicked rotors, are studied. First, an
example of the anholonomies induced by a periodically pulsed rank-1
perturbation is given. As a function of the strength of the perturbation, the
perturbed Floquet operator of the quantum map and its spectrum are shown to
have a period. However, we show examples where each eigenvalue does not obey
the periodicity of the perturbed Floquet operator and exhibits an anholonomy.
Furthermore, this induces another anholonomy in the eigenspaces, i.e., the
directions of the eigenvectors, of the Floquet operator. These two anholonomies
are previously observed in a family of Hamiltonians [T. Cheon, Phys. Lett. A
248, 285 (1998)] and are different from the phase anholonomy known as geometric
phases. Second, the stability of Cheon's anholonomies in periodically driven
systems is established by a geometrical analysis of the family of Floquet
operators. Accordingly, Cheon's anholonomies are expected to be abundant in
systems whose time evolutions are described by Floquet operators. As an
application, a design principle for quantum state manipulations along adiabatic
passages is explained.
