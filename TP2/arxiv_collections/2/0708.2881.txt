Using the Keldysh formalism the tunneling current through a hybrid structure
where a confined magnetic insulator (I) is sandwiched between two non-magnetic
leads is calculated. The leads can be either normal metals (M) or
superconductors (S). Each region is modelled as a single band in tight-binding
approximation in order to understand the formation of the tunneling current as
clearly as possible. The tunneling process itself is simulated by a
hybridization between the lead and insulator conduction bands. The insulator is
assumed to have localized moments which can interact with the tunneling
electrons. This is described by the Kondo Lattice Model (KLM) and treated
within an interpolating self-energy approach. For the superconductor the
mean-field BCS theory is used. The spin polarization of the current shows a
strong dependence both on the applied voltage and the properties of the
materials. Even for this idealized three band model there is a qualitative
agreement with experiment.
