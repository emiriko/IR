Spectroscopy and strong decays of the charmed baryons are reviewed. Possible
spin-parity quantum numbers of several newly observed charmed baryon resonances
are discussed. Strong decays of charmed baryons are analyzed in the framework
of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory in which heavy quark symmetry and
chiral symmetry are synthesized.
