A simple, reliable method for preparation of bulk Cr tips for Scanning
Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is proposed and its potentialities in performing
high-quality and high-resolution STM and Spin Polarized-STM (SP-STM) are
investigated. Cr tips show atomic resolution on ordered surfaces. Contrary to
what happens with conventional W tips, rest atoms of the Si(111)-7x7
reconstruction can be routinely observed, probably due to a different
electronic structure of the tip apex. SP-STM measurements of the Cr(001)
surface showing magnetic contrast are reported. Our results reveal that the
peculiar properties of these tips can be suited in a number of STM experimental
situations.
