The nature of dynamics of opinion formation modeled as a decision-by-majority
process in complex networks is investigated using eigenmode analysis.
Hamiltonian of the system is defined, and estimated by eigenvectors of the
adjacency matrix constructed from several network models. The eigenmodes of
initial and final state of the dynamics are analyzed by numerical studies. We
show that the magnitude of the largest eigenvector at the initial states are
key determinant for the resulting dynamics.
