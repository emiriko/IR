A geometric interpretation and generalisation for the Galois action on finite
group character tables is sketched. The generalisation is a Galois action on
the space Map_G(G^n,\bar{Q})/S_n for each finite G, where G acts by
simultaneous conjugation on the n-tuples G^n and the symmetric group S_n
permutes the components.
