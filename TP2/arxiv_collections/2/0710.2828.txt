A purely fermionic representation is introduced for the ferromagnetic Kondo
lattice model which allows conventional diagrammatic tools to be employed to
study correlation effects. Quantum 1/S corrections to magnon excitations are
investigated using a systematic inverse-degeneracy expansion scheme which
incorporates correlation effects in the form of self-energy and vertex
corrections, while explicitly preserving the continuous spin-rotation symmetry.
Magnon self-energy is studied in the full range of interaction strength, and
shown to result in strong magnon damping and anomalous softening for zone
boundary modes, which accounts for several zone-boundary anomalies observed in
recent spin-wave measurements of ferromagnetic manganites.
