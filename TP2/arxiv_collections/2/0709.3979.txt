We propose a novel approach to the analysis of experimental data obtained in
relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions which borrows from methods developed
within the context of Random Matrix Theory. It is applied to the detection of
correlations in momentum distributions of emitted particles. We find good
agreement between the results obtained in this way and a standard analysis
based on the two-pair correlation function often used in high energy physics.
The method introduced here is free from unwanted background contributions.
