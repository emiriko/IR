The dynamics of the expansion of a Lennard-Jones system, initially confined
at high density and subsequently expanding freely in the vacuum, is confronted
to an expanding statistical ensemble, derived in the diluted quasi-ideal
Boltzmann approximation. The description proves to be fairly accurate at
predicting average one-body global observables, but important deviations are
observed in the configuration-space structure of the events. Possible
implications for finite expanding physical systems are outlined.
