We summarize the works presented in Refs. \cite{1,2} on collider
phenomenology of the unparticle physics associated with an exact scale
invariant sector possessing a non-trivial infrared fixed point at a high energy
scale. We give highlights on the motivations of unparticle and derivation of
the phase space and the unparticle propagator. We study two categories of
phenomenology: (i) real emission of unparticle that gives rise to peculiar
missing energy signatures, and (ii) virtual exchange of unparticle that
interferes with the standard model amplitudes.
