This paper is part of a study of the frictional dynamics of a confined solid
lubricant film - modelled as a one-dimensional chain of interacting particles
confined between two ideally incommensurate substrates, one of which is driven
relative to the other through an attached spring moving at constant velocity.
This model system is characterized by three inherent length scales; depending
on the precise choice of incommensurability among them it displays a strikingly
different tribological behavior. Contrary to two length-scale systems such as
the standard Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model, for large chain stiffness one finds
that here the most favorable (lowest friction) sliding regime is achieved by
chain-substrate incommensurabilities belonging to the class of non-quadratic
irrational numbers (e.g., the spiral mean). The well-known golden mean
(quadratic) incommensurability which slides best in the standard FK model shows
instead higher kinetic-friction values. The underlying reason lies in the
pinning properties of the lattice of solitons formed by the chain with the
substrate having the closest periodicity, with the other slider.
