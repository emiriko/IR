We demonstrate the first operation of CdZnTe room-temperature detectors in a
liquid scintillator environment. This work follows conceptually the
Heusser-type detector method of operating HPGe detectors in liquid nitrogen and
liquid argon but instead for a far more practical room-temperature ensemble
with the aim of achieving ultra-low background levels for radiation detection.
