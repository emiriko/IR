We suggest a short review of literature on various solitonic lattices and
individual solitons in quasi one-dimensional conductors. This information seems
to be quite relevant to topics of stripes and their melted phases
correspondingly. We shall quote also the latest experiments, which access
solitons as elementary excitations in organic conductors and in charge density
waves. We shall outline a theory for ordered phases, where solitons should
acquire forms of combined topological configurations (kink-roton complexes).
The extension of this picture to cuprates allows interpretation the latest STM
observations on local rod-like structures.
