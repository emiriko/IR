We propose a way of detecting CP violation in a single neutrino oscillation
channel at very long baselines (on the order of several thousands of
kilometers), given precise knowledge of the smallest mass-squared difference.
It is shown that CP violation can be characterized by a shift in $L/E$ of the
peak oscillation in the $\nu_e$--$\nu_\mu$ appearance channel, both in vacuum
and in matter. In fact, matter effects enhance the shift at a fixed energy. We
consider the case in which sub-GeV neutrinos are measured with varying baseline
and also the case of a fixed baseline. For the varied baseline, accurate
knowledge of the absolute neutrino flux would not be necessary; however,
neutrinos must be distinguishable from antineutrinos. For the fixed baseline,
it is shown that CP violation can be distinguished if the mixing angle
$\theta_{13}$ were known.
