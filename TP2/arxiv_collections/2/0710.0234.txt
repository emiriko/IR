Let $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $K\geq 1$, and $d=2\frac{1+\alpha K}{1+K}$. Given a
compact set $E\subset\C$, it is known that if $\H^d(E)=0$ then $E$ is removable
for $\alpha$-H\"older continuous $K$-quasiregular mappings in the plane. The
sharpness of the index $d$ is shown with the construction, for any $t>d$, of a
set $E$ of Hausdorff dimension $\dim(E)=t$ which is not removable. In this
paper, we improve this result and construct compact nonremovable sets $E$ such
that $0<\H^d(E)<\infty$. For the proof, we give a precise planar
$K$-quasiconformal mapping whose H\"older exponent is strictly bigger than
$\frac{1}{K}$, and that exhibits extremal distortion properties.
