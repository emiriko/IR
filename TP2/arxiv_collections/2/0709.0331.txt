The muon intensity attenuation method to detect heterogeneities in large
matter volumes is analyzed. Approximate analytical expressions to estimate the
collection time and the signal to noise ratio, are proposed and validated by
Monte Carlo simulations. Important parameters, including point spread function
and coordinate reconstruction uncertainty are also estimated using Monte Carlo
simulations.
