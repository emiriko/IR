We consider the evolution of a family of 2D dispersive turbulence models. The
members of this family involve the nonlinear advection of a dynamically active
scalar field, the locality of the streamfunction-scalar relation is denoted by
$\alpha$, with smaller $\alpha$ implying increased locality. The dispersive
nature arises via a linear term whose strength is characterized by a parameter
$\epsilon$. Setting $0 < \epsilon \le 1$, we investigate the interplay of
advection and dispersion for differing degrees of locality. Specifically, we
study the forward (inverse) transfer of enstrophy (energy) under large-scale
(small-scale) random forcing. Straightforward arguments suggest that for small
$\alpha$ the scalar field should consist of progressively larger eddies, while
for large $\alpha$ the scalar field is expected to have a filamentary structure
resulting from a stretch and fold mechanism. Confirming this, we proceed to
forced/dissipative dispersive numerical experiments under weakly non-local to
local conditions. For $\epsilon \sim 1$, there is quantitative agreement
between non-dispersive estimates and observed slopes in the inverse energy
transfer regime. On the other hand, forward enstrophy transfer regime always
yields slopes that are significantly steeper than the corresponding
non-dispersive estimate. Additional simulations show the scaling in the inverse
regime to be sensitive to the strength of the dispersive term : specifically,
as $\epsilon$ decreases, the inertial-range shortens and we also observe that
the slope of the power-law decreases. On the other hand, for the same range of
$\epsilon$ values, the forward regime scaling is fairly universal.
