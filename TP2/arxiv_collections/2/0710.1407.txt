The effect of the quality of starting powders on the microstructure and
superconducting properties of in-situ processed Fe-sheathed MgB2 tapes has been
investigated. Three different types of commercial atomized spherical magnesium
powder and two different purities of amorphous boron powder were employed. When
using the 10-micrometre magnesium as precursor powders, the Mg reacted with
boron more uniformly and quickly, thus the uniformity of the fabricated MgB2
was improved and the grain size of the MgB2 was decreased, hence significant
critical current density (Jc) enhancements were achieved for MgB2 tapes. Jc at
4.2 K for MgB2 tapes made from the 10 um Mg and high purity boron powders was
at least a factor of ten higher than values measured for MgB2 samples made from
all other starting powders. At 20 K, 5 T, the typical Jc values of the tapes
were over 1.0x10^4 A/cm^2 and were much better than those of tape samples
reported recently.
