We show that for two quivers without oriented cycles related by a BGP
reflection, the posets of their cluster tilting objects are related by a simple
combinatorial construction, which we call a flip-flop.
  We deduce that the posets of cluster tilting objects of derived equivalent
path algebras of quivers without oriented cycles are universally derived
equivalent. In particular, all Cambrian lattices corresponding to the various
orientations of the same Dynkin diagram are universally derived equivalent.
