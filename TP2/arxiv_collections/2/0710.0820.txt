We show that regular changes of signature on brane-worlds in AdS bulks may
account for some types of the recently fashionable sudden singularities.
Therefore, the possibility that the Universe seems to approach a future sudden
singularity at an accelerated rate of expansion might simply be an indication
that our braneworld is about to change from Lorentzian to Euclidean signature.
Both the brane and the bulk remain fully regular everywhere. We present a model
in which the weak and strong energy conditions hold on the brane, in contrast
with the standard cosmologies leading to the analogous kinematical behaviour
(that is, with a diverging Hubble factor).
