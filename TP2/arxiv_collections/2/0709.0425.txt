We study a quenched SU(2) lattice gauge theory in 4d in which the spatial
gauge ensemble $\{U_i\}$ is generated from a 3d gauge-Higgs model and the
timelike link variables are ``reconstructed'' from the Higgs fields. The
resulting ensemble is used to study quenched quark propagation with non-zero
chemical potential $\mu$. While it proves possible to alter the strength of the
inter-quark interaction by changing the parameters of the dimensionally reduced
model, there is no evidence for any region of parameter space where quarks
exhibit deconfined behaviour or thermodynamic observables scale as if there
were a Fermi surface.
