Ettore Majorana was a member of Enrico Fermi's research group in Rome, Italy.
Fermi did regard Majorana as much brihter than himself as far as theoretical
physics was concerned (more information can be found particularly in the
arXives' e-print physics/9810023, in Italian, and refs therein, and also in the
recent multilanguage arXiv:0708.2855v1 [physics.hist-ph]). In 1937 Majorana
partecipated in the national Italian competition, for a chair in theoretical
phyics, requested by Emilio Segre' at that time at Palermo University: Other
competitors being GC.Wick, G.Racah, and G.Gentile jr. After a proposal of the
judging Commette, chaired by E.Fermi, Majorana got a full-professorship at
Naples University, for exceptional scientific merits, outside the competition
normal procedures. In this e-print we make known the notes prepared by Majorana
for his Inaugural Lecture (and discovered long ago, in 1973, by one of the
present editors (ER)),together with some comments of ours: everything being
both in English (first article) and in Italian (second article, with a short
Bibliography at its end). The present articles have been prepared on the
occasion of the Centenary (2006) of Majorana's birth. The preliminary notes for
his Inaugural Lecture reveal Majorana's interest not only for scientific
research, but also for the best didactical methods to be followed in order to
teach classical and quantum physics in the most effective way (while his
approach to Special Relativity is known to us from his lecture notes, published
elesewhere). P.S.: Il Riassunto in Italiano appare all'inizio della versione
italiana.
