The Hf-O system has been modeled by combining existing experimental data and
first-principles calculations results through the CALPHAD approach. Special
quasirandom structures of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ hafnium were generated to
calculate the mixing behavior of oxygen and vacancies. For the total energy of
oxygen, vibrational, rotational and translational degrees of freedom were
considered. The Hf-O system was combined with previously modeled Hf-Si and Si-O
systems, and the ternary compound in the Hf-Si-O system, HfSiO$_4$ has been
introduced to calculate the stability diagrams pertinent to the thin film
processing.
