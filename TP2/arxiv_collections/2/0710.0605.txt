We calculate and compare bremsstrahlung and collisional energy loss of hard
partons traversing a quark-gluon plasma. Our treatment of both processes is
complete at leading order in the coupling and accounts for the probabilistic
nature of the jet energy loss. We find that the nuclear modification factor
$R_{AA}$ for neutral $\pi^0$ production in heavy ion collisions is sensitive to
the inclusion of collisional and radiative energy loss contributions while the
averaged energy loss only slightly increases if collisional energy loss is
included for parent parton energies $E\gg T$. These results are important for
the understanding of jet quenching in Au+Au collisions at $200 {\rm AGeV}$ at
RHIC. Comparison with data is performed applying the energy loss calculation to
a relativistic ideal (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamic description of the
thermalized medium formed at RHIC.
