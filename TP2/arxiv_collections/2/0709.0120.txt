We show that all finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras with the same
diagram in the classification scheme of Andruskiewitsch and Schneider are
cocycle deformations of each other. This is done by giving first a suitable
characterization of such Hopf algebras, which allows for the application of a
result of Masuoka about Morita-Takeuchi equivalence and of Schauenburg about
Hopf Galois extensions. The "infinitesimal" part of the deforming cocycle and
of the deformation determine the deformed multiplication and can be described
explicitly in terms of Hochschild cohomology. Applications to, and results for
copointed Hopf algebras are also considered.
