In the complex plane, the frequency response of a univariate polynomial is
the set of values taken by the polynomial when evaluated along the imaginary
axis. This is an algebraic curve partitioning the plane into several connected
components. In this note it is shown that the component including the origin is
exactly representable by a linear matrix inequality if and only if the
polynomial is stable, in the sense that all its roots have negative real parts.
