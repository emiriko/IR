Considering a basic enzyme-catalysed reaction, in which the rate of input of
the substrate varies periodically in time, we give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of a periodic solution of the reaction equations.
The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree, applied to an appropriately
constructed homotopy.
