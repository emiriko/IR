In this work we suggest a simple mathematical model for the dynamics of the
population of children and adolescents without problematic behavior (criminal
activities etc.). This model represents a typical population growth equation
but with time dependent (linearly decreasing) population growth coefficient.
Given equation admits definition of the half-life time of the non-problematic
children behavior as well as a criterion for estimation of the social
regulation of the children behavior.
