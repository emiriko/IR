The K+K+ scattering length is calculated in fully-dynamical lattice QCD with
domain-wall valence quarks on the MILC asqtad-improved gauge configurations
with rooted staggered sea quarks. Three-flavor mixed-action chiral perturbation
theory at next-to-leading order, which includes the leading effects of the
finite lattice spacing, is used to extrapolate the results of the lattice
calculation to the physical value of m_{K+}/f_{K+}. We find m_{K+} a_{K+K+} =
-0.352 +- 0.016, where the statistical and systematic errors have been combined
in quadrature.
