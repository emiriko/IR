We discuss the relevance of studying ecology within the framework of
Complexity Science from a statistical mechanics approach. Ecology is concerned
with understanding how systems level properties emerge out of the multitude of
interactions amongst large numbers of components, leading to ecosystems that
possess the prototypical characteristics of complex systems. We argue that
statistical mechanics is at present the best methodology available to obtain a
quantitative description of complex systems, and that ecology is in urgent need
of ``integrative'' approaches that are quantitative and non-stationary. We
describe examples where combining statistical mechanics and ecology has led to
improved ecological modelling and, at the same time, broadened the scope of
statistical mechanics.
