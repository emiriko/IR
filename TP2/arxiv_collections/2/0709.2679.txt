Recent studies about CP violation in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) with complex parameters are reviewed. In order to unambiguously
identify the CP-violating phenomena it is necessary to study CP-odd or T-odd
observables. In chargino and neutralino production and decay at the
International Linear Collider (ILC) triple product asymmetries and asymmetries
defined via transverse beam polarization have been analyzed. It has been found
that these asymmetries can be measured at the ILC in a large region of the MSSM
parameter space and are thus an important tool to establish CP violation in
supersymmetry.
