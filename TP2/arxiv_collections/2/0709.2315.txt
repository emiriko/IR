We examine how the misorientation of a few stacked graphene layers affects
the electronic structure of carbon nanosystems. We present {\it ab initio}
calculations on bi- and trilayer systems to demonstrate that the massless
Fermion behavior typical of single layered graphene is also found in
incommensurate multilayered graphitic systems. We also investigate the
consequences of this property on experimental fingerprints, such as Raman
spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our simulations reveal
that STM images of turbostratic few layer graphite are sensitive to the layer
arrangement. We also predict that resonant raman signal of graphitic samples
are more sensitive to the orientation of the layers than to their number.
