We present a general method to add KK-monopole charge to any asymptotically
flat stationary axisymmetric solution of five dimensional General Relativity.
The technique exploits the underlying SL(3,R) invariance of the system by
identifying a particular element of the symmetry group which changes the
asymptotic boundary condition and adds KK-monopole charge. Furthermore, we
develop a set of technical tools which allow us to apply the SL(3,R)
transformations to solutions produced by the Inverse Scattering method. As an
example of our methods, we construct the exact solution describing a static
black ring carrying KK-monopole charge.
