We discuss CP violation in the process e^+e^- \to
\tilde\chi^+_i\tilde\chi^-_j with unpolarized beams. When the scalars are
heavy, the box-diagram results constitute a major part of the full result.
However, there are situations when the vertex and self-energy corrections
dominate over the box diagrams. We also comment on CP violation in the final
chargino decay.
