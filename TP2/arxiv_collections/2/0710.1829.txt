We show that all IIB supergravity backgrounds which admit more than 28
Killing spinors are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we find that for
all N>28 backgrounds the supercovariant curvature vanishes, and that the
quotients of maximally supersymmetric backgrounds either preserve all 32 or
N<29 supersymmetries.
