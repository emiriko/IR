Discovering the 'Neural Code' from multi-neuronal spike trains is an
important task in neuroscience. For such an analysis, it is important to
unearth interesting regularities in the spiking patterns. In this report, we
present an efficient method for automatically discovering synchrony, synfire
chains, and more general sequences of neuronal firings. We use the Frequent
Episode Discovery framework of Laxman, Sastry, and Unnikrishnan (2005), in
which the episodes are represented and recognized using finite-state automata.
Many aspects of functional connectivity between neuronal populations can be
inferred from the episodes. We demonstrate these using simulated multi-neuronal
data from a Poisson model. We also present a method to assess the statistical
significance of the discovered episodes. Since the Temporal Data Mining (TDM)
methods used in this report can analyze data from hundreds and potentially
thousands of neurons, we argue that this framework is appropriate for
discovering the `Neural Code'.
