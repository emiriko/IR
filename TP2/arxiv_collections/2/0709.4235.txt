Recently, a topological field theory of membrane-matter coupled to BF theory
in arbitrary spacetime dimensions was proposed [1]. In this paper, we discuss
various aspects of the four-dimensional theory. Firstly, we study classical
solutions leading to an interpretation of the theory in terms of strings
propagating on a flat spacetime. We also show that the general classical
solutions of the theory are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions of
Einstein's equations in the presence of distributional matter (cosmic strings).
Secondly, we quantize the theory and present, in particular, a prescription to
regularize the physical inner product of the canonical theory. We show how the
resulting transition amplitudes are dual to evaluations of Feynman diagrams
coupled to three-dimensional quantum gravity. Finally, we remove the regulator
by proving the topological invariance of the transition amplitudes.
