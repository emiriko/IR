We demonstrate an all-optical switch that operates at ultra-low-light levels
and exhibits several features necessary for use in optical switching networks.
An input switching beam, wavelength $\lambda$, with an energy density of
$10^{-2}$ photons per optical cross section [$\sigma=\lambda^2/(2\pi)$] changes
the orientation of a two-spot pattern generated via parametric instability in
warm rubidium vapor. The instability is induced with less than 1 mW of total
pump power and generates several $\mu$Ws of output light. The switch is
cascadable: the device output is capable of driving multiple inputs, and
exhibits transistor-like signal-level restoration with both saturated and
intermediate response regimes. Additionally, the system requires an input power
proportional to the inverse of the response time, which suggests thermal
dissipation does not necessarily limit the practicality of optical logic
devices.
