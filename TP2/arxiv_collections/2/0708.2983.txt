We consider the velocity fluctuations of a system of particles described by
the Inelastic Maxwell Model. The present work extends the methods, previously
employed to obtain the one-particle velocity distribution function, to the
study of the two particle correlations. Results regarding both the homogeneous
cooling process and the steady state driven regime are presented. In particular
we obtain the form of the pair correlation function in the scaling region of
the homogeneous cooling process and show that some of its moments diverge. This
fact has repercussions on the behavior of the energy fluctuations of the model.
