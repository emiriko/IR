The thermal characteristics of silicon between 15 and 300 deg K are
investigated by applying a computer program on the solution of the differential
heat diffusion equation. The computer model is linked to high-purity silicon
through a set of experimental data. The numerical results are given in graphic
form and show, in particular, very short diffusion transit times across long
distances. The computed figures require experimental confrontations; a test
set-up is proposed.
