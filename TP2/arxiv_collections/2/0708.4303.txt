We construct the effective potential for the ghost condensate
<f^{abi}\bar{c}^a c^b> in the maximal Abelian gauge. This condensate is an
order parameter for a global continuous symmetry, which is spontaneously broken
since a nonvanishing value of <f^{abi}\bar{c}^a c^b> lowers the vacuum energy.
The associated Goldstone mode turns out to be unphysical.
