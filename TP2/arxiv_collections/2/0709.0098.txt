We explore `benchmark surfaces' suitable for studying the phenomenology of
Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model
(MSSM), which are chosen so that the supersymmetric relic density is generally
compatible with the range of cold dark matter density preferred by WMAP and
other observations. These benchmark surfaces are specified assuming that
gaugino masses m_{1/2}, soft trilinear supersymmetry-breaking parameters A_0
and the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions m_0 to the squark and slepton
masses are universal, but not those associated with the Higgs multiplets (the
NUHM framework). The benchmark surfaces may be presented as M_A-tan_beta planes
with fixed or systematically varying values of the other NUHM parameters, such
as m_0, m_{1/2}, A_0 and the Higgs mixing parameter mu. We discuss the
prospects for probing experimentally these benchmark surfaces at the Tevatron
collider, the LHC, the ILC, in B physics and in direct dark-matter detection
experiments. An Appendix documents developments in the FeynHiggs code that
enable the user to explore for her/himself the WMAP-compliant benchmark
surfaces.
