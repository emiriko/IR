We apply the method of Banerjee and Kulkarni (arXiv:0707.2449, [hep-th]) to
provide a derivation of Hawking radiation from the GHS (stringy) blackhole
which falls in the class of the most general spherically symmetric blackholes
($\sqrt{-g}\neq 1$) and also the non-extremal $D1-D5$ blackhole using only
covariant gravitational anomalies.
