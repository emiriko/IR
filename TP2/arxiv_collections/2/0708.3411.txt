In real-life statistical data, it seems that conditional probabilities for
the effect given their causes tend to be less complex and smoother than
conditionals for causes, given their effects. We have recently proposed and
tested methods for causal inference in machine learning using a formalization
of this principle.
  Here we try to provide some theoretical justification for causal inference
methods based upon such a ``causally asymmetric'' interpretation of Occam's
Razor. To this end, we discuss toy models of cause-effect relations from
classical and quantum physics as well as computer science in the context of
various aspects of complexity.
  We argue that this asymmetry of the statistical dependences between cause and
effect has a thermodynamic origin. The essential link is the tendency of the
environment to provide independent background noise realized by physical
systems that are initially uncorrelated with the system under consideration
rather than being finally uncorrelated. This link extends ideas from the
literature relating Reichenbach's principle of the common cause to the second
law.
