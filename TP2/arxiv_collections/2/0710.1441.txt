We analyze the CP violation in the semileptonic | \Delta S|=1 tau-decays in
supersymmetric extensions of the standard model (SM) with R parity violating
term. We show that the CP asymmetry of tau-decay is enhanced significantly and
the current experimental limits obtained by CLEO collaborations can be easily
accommodated. We argue that observing CP violation in semi leptonic tau-decay
would be a clear evidence for R-parity violating SUSY extension of the SM.
