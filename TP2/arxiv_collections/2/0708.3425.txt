This text is addressed to mathematicians who are interested in generalized
functions and unbounded operators on a Hilbert space. We expose in detail (in a
"formal way" - as done by Heisenberg and Pauli - i.e. without mathematical
definitions and then, of course, without mathematical rigour) the
Heisenberg-Pauli calculations on the simplest model close to physics. The
problem for mathematicians is to give a mathematical sense to these
calculations, which is possible without any knowledge in physics, since they
mimick exactly usual calculations on infinitely differentiable functions and on
bounded operators, and can be considered at a purely mathematical level,
ignoring physics in a first step. The mathematical tools to be used are
nonlinear generalized functions, unbounded operators on a Hilbert space and
computer calculations.
