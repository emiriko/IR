I discuss various formulations of stochastic Einstein locality (SEL), which
is a version of the idea of relativistic causality, i.e. the idea that
influences propagate at most as fast as light. SEL is similar to Reichenbach's
Principle of the Common Cause (PCC), and Bell's Local Causality.
  My main aim is to discuss formulations of SEL for a fixed background
spacetime. I previously argued that SEL is violated by the outcome dependence
shown by Bell correlations, both in quantum mechanics and in quantum field
theory. Here I re-assess those verdicts in the light of some recent literature
which argues that outcome dependence does not violate the PCC. I argue that the
verdicts about SEL still stand.
  Finally, I briefly discuss how to formulate relativistic causality if there
is no fixed background spacetime.
