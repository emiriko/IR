The physical property characterization of Al doped Mg1-xAlxB2 system with x =
0.0 to 0.50 is reported. The results related to phase formation, structural
transition, resistivity R(T) and magnetization M(T) measurements are discussed
in detail. It is shown that the addition of electrons to MgB2 through Al
results in loss of superconductivity. Also seen is a structural transition
associated with the collapse of boron layers reflected by the continuous
decrease in the c parameter. The main emphasis in this paper is on slow scan
X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, which confirm the existence of a
superstructure along the c-direction for the x = 0.50 sample. The appearance of
some additional peaks, viz. [103], [004], [104] and [112], results in doubling
of the lattice parameter along the c-axis. This possibly indicates the
alternative ordering of Al and Mg in MgAlB4 separated by hexagonal boron layers
but still maintaining the same hexagonal AlB2 type structure.
