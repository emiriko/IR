This works presents a perturbative analysis of the supersymmetric
Chern-Simons model in three spacetime dimensions coupled to a Higgs field,
using the superfield formalism. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking of
the U(1) gauge symmetry and evaluate the first quantum corrections to the
effective action in the broken phase. We show that the infinite renormalization
of the gap equation is enough to ensure the renormalizability of the model at
the first loop level.
