Probability interference is a fundamental characteristic of quantum
mechanics. In this paper we attempt to show with the help of some examples,
where this fundamental trait of quantum physics can be found back in a social
science environment. In order to support our thesis that interference can
possibly be found back in many other macro-scopic areas, we proceed in setting
up an experimental test.
