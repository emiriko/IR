Based on the analogy between the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model of chiral symmetry
breaking and the BCS theory of superconductivity, we investigate the effect of
$\bar q q$ pair fluctuations on the chiral phase transition. We include
uncondensed $\bar q q$ pairs at finite temperature and chemical potential in a
self-consistent T-matrix formalism, the so-called $G_0 G$ scheme. The pair
fluctuations reduce significantly the critical temperature and make quarks
massive above the critical temperature.
