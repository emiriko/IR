Static magnetic susceptibility \chi, ac susceptibility \chi_{ac} and specific
heat C versus temperature T measurements on polycrystalline samples of In2VO5
and \chi and C versus T measurements on the isostructural, nonmagnetic compound
In2TiO5 are reported. A Curie-Wiess fit to the \chi(T) data above 175 K for
In2VO5 indicates ferromagnetic exchange between V^{4+} (S = 1/2) moments. Below
150 K the \chi(T) data deviate from the Curie-Weiss behavior but there is no
signature of any long range magnetic order down to 1.8 K. There is a cusp at
2.8 K in the zero field cooled (ZFC) \chi(T) data measured in a magnetic field
of 100 Oe and the ZFC and field cooled (FC) data show a bifurcation below this
temperature. The frequency dependence of the \chi_{ac}(T) data indicate that
below 3 K the system is in a spin-glass state. The difference \Delta C between
the heat capacity of In2VO5 and In2TiO5 shows a broad anomaly peaked at 130 K.
The entropy upto 300 K is more than what is expected for S = 1/2 moments. The
anomaly in \Delta C and the extra entropy suggests that there may be a
structural change below 130 K in In2VO5.
