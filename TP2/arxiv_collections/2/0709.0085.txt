The sodium cobaltate family (NaxCoO2) is unique among transition metal oxides
because the Co sits on a triangular lattice and its valence can be tuned over a
wide range by varying the Na concentration x. Up to now detailed modeling of
the rich phenomenology (which ranges from unconventional superconductivity to
enhanced thermopower) has been hampered by the difficulty of controlling pure
phases. We discovered that certain Na concentrations are specially stable and
are associated with superlattice ordering of the Na clusters. This leads
naturally to a picture of co-existence of localized spins and itinerant charge
carriers. For x = 0.84 we found a remarkably small Fermi energy of 87 K. Our
picture brings coherence to a variety of measurements ranging from NMR to
optical to thermal transport. Our results also allow us to take the first step
towards modeling the mysterious ``Curie-Weiss'' metal state at x = 0.71. We
suggest the local moments may form a quantum spin liquid state and we propose
experimental test of our hypothesis.
