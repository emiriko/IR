This paper focuses on the temporal discretization of the Langevin dynamics,
and on different resulting numerical integration schemes. Using a method based
on the exponentiation of time dependent operators, we carefully derive a
numerical scheme for the Langevin dynamics, that we found equivalent to the
proposal of Ermak, and not simply to the stochastic version of the
velocity-Verlet algorithm. However, we checked on numerical simulations that
both algorithms give similar results, and share the same ``weak order two''
accuracy. We then apply the same strategy to derive and test two numerical
schemes for the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). The first one of them was
found to compare well, in terms of speed and accuracy, with the best currently
available algorithms.
