The confinement of critical fluctuations in soft media induces critical
Casimir forces acting on the confining surfaces. The temperature and geometry
dependences of such forces are characterized by universal scaling functions. A
novel approach is presented to determine them for films via Monte Carlo
simulations of lattice models. The method is based on an integration scheme of
free energy differences. Our results for the Ising and the XY universality
class compare favourably with corresponding experimental results for wetting
layers of classical binary liquid mixtures and of 4He, respectively.
