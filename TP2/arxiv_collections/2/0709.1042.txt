In this review, we give an overview of the experimental and theoretical
advances in the physics of quantized vortices in dilute atomic-gas
Bose--Einstein condensates in a trapping potential, especially focusing on
experimental research activities and their theoretical interpretations. Making
good use of the atom optical technique, the experiments have revealed many
novel structural and dynamic properties of quantized vortices by directly
visualizing vortex cores from an image of the density profiles. These results
lead to a deep understanding of superfluid hydrodynamics of such systems.
Typically, vortices are stabilized by a rotating potential created by a laser
beam, magnetic field, and thermal gas. Finite size effects and inhomogeneity of
the system, originating from the confinement by the trapping potential, yield
unique vortex dynamics coupled with the collective excitations of the
condensate. Measuring the frequencies of the collective modes is an accurate
tool for clarifying the character of the vortex state. The topics included in
this review are the mechanism of vortex formation, equilibrium properties, and
dynamics of a single vortex and those of a vortex lattice in a rapidly rotating
condensate.
