The resistivity of gated graphene is studied taking into account electron and
hole scattering by short- and long-range structural imperfections the
characteristics of disorder were taken from the scanning tunneling microscopy
data and by acoustic phonons. The calculations are based on the quasiclassical
kinetic equation with the normalization condition fixed by surface charge. The
gate-voltage and temperature effects on the resistance peak, which is centered
at the point of intrinsic conductivity, are found to be in agreement with the
transport measurements.
