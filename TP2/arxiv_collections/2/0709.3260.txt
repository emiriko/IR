We measure transport at finite bias through a double quantum dot formed by
top-gates in an InAs nanowire. Pauli spin-bockade is confirmed with several
electrons in the dot. This is expected due to the small exchange interactions
in InAs and the large singlet-triplet splitting, which can be measured and
tuned by a gate voltage.
