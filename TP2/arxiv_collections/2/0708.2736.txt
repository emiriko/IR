New results are presented for the stress conjugate to arbitrary Eulerian
strain measures. The conjugate stress depends on two arbitrary quantities: the
strain measure f(V) and the corotational rate defined by the spin \Omega. It is
shown that for every choice of f there is a unique spin, called the f-spin,
which makes the conjugate stress as close as possible to the Cauchy stress. The
f-spin reduces to the logarithmic spin when the strain measure is the Hencky
strain log(V). The formulation and the results emphasize the similarities in
form of the Eulerian and Lagrangian stresses conjugate to the strains f(V) and
f(U), respectively. Many of the results involve the solution to the equation
AX-XA=Y, which is presented in a succinct format.
