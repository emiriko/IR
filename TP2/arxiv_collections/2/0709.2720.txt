An equivariant bundle gerbe \`a la Meinrenken over a $G$-manifold $M$ is
known to be a special type of $S^1$-gerbe over the differentiable stack
$[M/G]$. We prove that the natural morphism relating the Cartan and simplicial
models of equivariant cohomology in degree 3 maps the Dixmier-Douady class of
an equivariant bundle gerbe \`a la Meinrenken to the Behrend-Xu-Dixmier-Douady
class of the corresponding $S^1$-gerbe.
