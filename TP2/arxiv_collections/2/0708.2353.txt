Defensive forecasting is a method of transforming laws of probability (stated
in game-theoretic terms as strategies for Sceptic) into forecasting algorithms.
There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: "continuous", in which
Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous
manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and "randomized", in which
the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and
Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the
randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing
Sceptic's moves to make them continuous.
