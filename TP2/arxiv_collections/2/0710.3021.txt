Random walks defined on undirected graphs assign the absolute scores to all
nodes based on the quality of path they provide for random walkers. In city
space syntax, the notion of segregation acquires a statistical interpretation
with respect to random walks. We analyze the spatial network of Venetian canals
and detect its most segregated part which can be identified with canals
adjacent to the Ghetto of Venice.
