We have determined the finite temperature coherence length of edge states in
the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) regime. This was realized by measuring
the visibility of electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometers of different sizes,
at filling factor 2. The visibility shows an exponential decay with the
temperature. The characteristic temperature scale is found inversely
proportional to the length of the interferometer arm, allowing to define a
coherence length $\l_\phi$. The variations of $\l_\phi$ with magnetic field are
the same for all samples, with a maximum located at the upper end of the
quantum hall plateau. Our results provide the first accurate determination of
$\l_\phi$ in the quantum Hall regime.
