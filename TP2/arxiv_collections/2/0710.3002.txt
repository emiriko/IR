Using a modified WKB approach, we present a rigorous semi-classical analysis
for solutions of nonlinear Schroedinger equations with rotational forcing. This
yields a rigorous justification for the hydrodynamical system of rotating
superfluids. In particular it is shown that global-in-time semi-classical
convergence holds whenever the limiting hydrodynamical system has global smooth
solutions and we also discuss the semi-classical dynamics of several physical
quantities describing rotating superfluids.
