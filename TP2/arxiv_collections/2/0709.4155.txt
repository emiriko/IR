Photonuclear reaction is described with an approach based on the
quasideuteron nuclear photoabsorption model followed by the process of
competition between light particle evaporation and fission for the excited
nucleus. Thus fission process is considered as a decay mode. The
evaporation-fission process of the compound nucleus is simulated in a
Monte-Carlo framework. Photofission reaction cross sections are analysed in a
systematic manner in the energy range $\sim$~50-70 MeV for the actinides
$^{232}$Th, $^{233}$U, $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U and $^{237}$Np and the pre-actinide
nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{209}$Bi. The study reproduces satisfactorily well the
available experimental data of photofission cross sections at energies
$\sim$~50-70 MeV and the increasing trend of nuclear fissility with the
fissility parameter $Z^2/A$ for the actinides and pre-actinides at intermediate
energies [$\sim$~20-140 MeV].
