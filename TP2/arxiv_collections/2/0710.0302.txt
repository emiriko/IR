We discuss an explicit protocol which allows one to externally cool and
control a composite system by operating on a small subset of it. The scheme
permits to transfer arbitrary and unknown quantum states from a memory on the
network ("upload access") as well as the inverse ("download access"). In
particular it yields a method for cooling the system.
