Measuring very small forces, particularly those of a gravitational nature,
has always been of great interest, as fundamental tests of our understanding of
the physical laws. Ultra-long period mechanical oscillators, typically used in
such measurements, will have kT/2 of thermal energy associated with each degree
of freedom, owing to the equal-partition of energy. Moreover, additional
seismic fluctuations in the low frequency band can raise this equivalent
temperature significantly to 10^5 K. Recently, various methods using
opto-mechanical forces have been reported to decrease this thermal energy for
MHz, micro-cantilever oscillators, effectively cooling them. Here we show the
direct, dynamical cooling of a gram-size, macroscopic oscillator to 300 mK in
equivalent temperature - noise reduction by a factor of 10^6. By precisely
measuring the torsional oscillator's position, we dynamically provide an
external 'viscous' damping force. Such an added, dissipative force is
essentially free of noise, resulting in rapid cooling of the oscillator.
Additionally, we observe the time-dependent cooling process, at various cooling
force parameters. This parameter dependence agrees well with a simple physical
model which we provide. We further show that the device is sensitive to forces
as small as <100 fN - a force only a few percent of that typically exerted by a
single biological molecule or that observed in a typical gravity experiment. We
also demonstrate the dynamic control of the oscillator's natural frequency,
over a span of nearly two decades. The method may find important applications
in precision measurements of very weak forces.
