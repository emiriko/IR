Manufacturing electronic devices by printing techniques with low temperature
sintering of nano-size material particles can revolutionize the electronics
industry in coming years. The impact of this change to the industry can be
significant enabling low-cost products and flexibility in manufacturing.
implementation of a new production technology with new materials requires
thorough elementary knowledge creation. It should be noticed that although some
of first electronic devices ideally can be manufactured by printing, at the
present several modules are in fact manufactured by using hybrid techniques
(for instance photolithography, vapor depositions, spraying, etc...).
