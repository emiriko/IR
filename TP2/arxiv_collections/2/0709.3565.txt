We present a proposal to manipulate the Goos-Hanchen shift of a light beam
via a coherent control field, which is injected into a cavity configuration
containing the two-level atomic medium. It is found that the lateral shifts of
the reflected and transmitted probe beams can be easily controlled by adjusting
the intensity and detuning of the control field. Using this scheme, the lateral
shift at the fixed incident angle can be enhanced (positive or negative) under
the suitable conditions on the control field, without changing the structure of
the cavity.
