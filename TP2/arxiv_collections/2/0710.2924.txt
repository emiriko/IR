Chiral Effective Field Theory is for photon energies up to 200 MeV the tool
to accurately determine the polarisabilities of the neutron from deuteron
Compton scattering. A multipole analysis reveals that dispersive effects from
an explicit Delta(1232) prove in particular indispensable to understand the
data at 95 MeV measured at SAL. Simple power-counting arguments derived from
nuclear phenomenology lead to the correct Thomson limit and gauge invariance.
At next-to-leading order, the static scalar dipole polarisabilities are
extracted as identical for proton and neutron within the error-bar of available
data: \alpha^n=11.6\pm1.5_stat\pm0.6_Baldin,
\beta^n=3.6\mp1.5_stat\pm0.6_Baldin for the neutron, in units of 10^-4 fm^3,
compared to \alpha^p=11.0\pm1.4_stat\pm0.4_Baldin,
\beta}^p=2.8\mp1.4_stat\pm0.4_Baldin for the proton in the same framework. New
experiments e.g. at MAXlab (Lund) will improve the statistical error-bar.
