We present the general framework and building blocks of a recent derivation
of the fact that the SU(2) LGT is in a confining phase for all values of the
coupling $0 < \beta < \infty$, for space-time dimension $d \leq 4$. The method
employs approximate but explicitly computable RG decimations that are shown to
constrain the exact partition function and order parameters from above and
below, and flow from the weak to the strong coupling regime without
encountering a fixed point.
