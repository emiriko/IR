Pure t-motives were introduced by G. Anderson as higher dimensional
generalizations of Drinfeld modules, and as the appropriate analogs of abelian
varieties in the arithmetic of function fields. In order to construct moduli
spaces for pure t-motives the second author has previously introduced the
concept of abelian \tau-sheaf. In this article we clarify the relation between
pure t-motives and abelian \tau-sheaves. We obtain an equivalence of the
respective quasi-isogeny categories. Furthermore, we develop the elementary
theory of both structures regarding morphisms, isogenies, Tate modules, and
local shtukas. The later are the analogs of p-divisible groups.
