The parameter space of the Constrained Minimal supersymmetric Standard Model
is considered. It is shown that for the particular choice of parameters there
are some regions where long-living charged superparticles exist. Two regions of
interest are the co-annihilation region with light staus, and the region with
large negative trilinear scalar coupling A distinguished by light stops. The
phenomenology of long-living superparticles is briefly discussed.
