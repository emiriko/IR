In this paper we analyse the vacuum polarization effects associated with a
massless fermionic field in a higher-dimensional global monopole spacetime in
the "braneworld" scenario. In this context we admit that the our Universe, the
bulk, is represented by a flat $(n-1)-$dimensional brane having a global
monopole in a extra transverse three dimensional submanifold. We explicitly
calculate the renormalized vacuum average of the energy-momentum tensor,
$<T_A^B(x)>_{Ren.}$, admitting the global monopole as being a point-like
object. We observe that this quantity depends crucially on the value of $n$,
and we provide explicit expressions to it for specific values attributed to
$n$.
