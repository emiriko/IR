We apply a version of the dressing method to a system of four dimensional
nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which contains both Pohlmeyer
equation (i.e. nonlinear PDE integrable by the Inverse Spectral Transform
Method) and nonlinear matrix PDE integrable by the method of characteristics as
particular reductions. Some other reductions are suggested.
