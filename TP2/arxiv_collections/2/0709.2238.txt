In the last one and a half centuries, the analysis of quaternions has not
only led to further developments in mathematics but has also been and remains
an important catalyst for the further development of theories in physics. At
the same time, Hestenes geometric algebra provides a didactically promising
instrument to model phenomena in physics mathematically and in a tangible
manner. Quaternions particularly have a catchy interpretation in the context of
geometric algebra which can be used didactically. The relation between
quaternions and geometric algebra is presented with a view to analysing its
didactical possibilities.
