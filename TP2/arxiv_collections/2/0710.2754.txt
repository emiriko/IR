A collisional-radiative model describing nonlocal-thermodynamic-equilibrium
plasmas is developed. It is based on the HULLAC (Hebrew University Lawrence
Livermore Atomic Code) suite for the transitions rates, in the zero-temperature
radiation field hypothesis. Two variants of the model are presented: the first
one is configuration averaged, while the second one is a detailed level
version. Comparisons are made between them in the case of a carbon plasma; they
show that the configuration-averaged code gives correct results for an
electronic temperature Te=10 eV (or higher) but fails at lower temperatures
such as Te=1 eV. The validity of the configuration-averaged approximation is
discussed: the intuitive criterion requiring that the average
configuration-energy dispersion must be less than the electron thermal energy
turns out to be a necessary but far from sufficient condition. Another
condition based on the resolution of a modified rate-equation system is
proposed. Its efficiency is emphasized in the case of low-temperature plasmas.
Finally, it is shown that near-threshold autoionization cascade processes may
induce a severe failure of the configuration-average formalism.
