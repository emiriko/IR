We study how the entanglement of a maximally entangled pair of particles is
affected when one or both of the pair are uniformly accelerated, while the
detector remains in an inertial frame. We find that the entanglement is
unchanged if all degrees of freedom are considered. However, particle pairs are
produced, and the entanglements of different bipartite systems may change with
the acceleration. In particular, the entanglement between accelerating fermions
is transferred preferentially to the produced antiparticles when the
acceleration is large, and the entanglement transfer is complete when the
acceleration approaches infinity. However, for scalar particles, no
entanglement transfer to the antiparticles is observed.
