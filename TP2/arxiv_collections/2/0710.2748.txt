In this paper we extend the eliminant construction of Burchnall and Chaundy
for commuting differential operators in the Heisenberg algebra to the
q-deformed Heisenberg algebra and show that it again provides annihilating
curves for commuting elements, provided q satisfies a natural condition. As a
side result we obtain estimates on the dimensions of the eigenspaces of
elements of this algebra in its faithful module of Laurent series.
