Edge shunts are among the main factors causing reduction in solar cell open
circuit voltage that is why their isolation is one of the main steps in solar
cell manufacturing. Many techniques have been employed to achieve this goal,
e.g. plasma etching, grinding, wet etching, etc. Unfortunately, these methods
have the disadvantages of being very expensive, single cell process and consume
a lot of dangerous chemicals. This work introduces a simple technique for edge
shunt isolation, by making a mechanical grove through the emitter and uses it
as back contact. It was found that with this technique the solar cell open
circuit voltage can be increased by an amount up to 200 mV. This technique is
simple, cheap and environmentally friendly in the sense that it uses no
chemicals.
