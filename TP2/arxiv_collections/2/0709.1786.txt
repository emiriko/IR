We have recently shown that, if the inflaton has a nonzero vacuum expectation
value, it generically couples to any matter fields that appear in the
superpotential at the tree level, and to any gauge sectors through anomalies in
the supergravity. Through these processes, the inflaton decays into the
supersymmetry breaking sector, producing many gravitinos. The inflaton also
directly decays into a pair of the gravitinos. Taking account of these
processes, we derive constraints on both inflation models and supersymmetry
breaking scenarios for avoiding overproduction of the gravitinos.
