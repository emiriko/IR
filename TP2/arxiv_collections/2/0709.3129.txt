We study theoretically the generation of photon pairs by spontaneous
four-wave mixing (SFWM) in photonic crystal optical fiber. We show that it is
possible to engineer two-photon states with specific spectral correlation
(``entanglement'') properties suitable for quantum information processing
applications. We focus on the case exhibiting no spectral correlations in the
two-photon component of the state, which we call factorability, and which
allows heralding of single-photon pure-state wave packets without the need for
spectral post filtering. We show that spontaneous four wave mixing exhibits a
remarkable flexibility, permitting a wider class of two-photon states,
including ultra-broadband, highly-anticorrelated states.
