This review is focused on the search for new processes, performed with top
quark events in D{\O}. It presents four updated or new D{\O} results. The two
first analyses deal with top production properties: they search for a new heavy
resonance decaying to top-antitop. The two last results concern top decay
properties: the measurement of the $W$ helicity as a probe of the $tWb$
coupling structure, and the top quark branching ratio to $Wb$. Neither of these
measurements reveal any deviation with respect to the standard model
predictions.
