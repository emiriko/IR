In classical tsunami-generation techniques, one neglects the dynamic sea bed
displacement resulting from fracturing of a seismic fault. The present study
takes into account these dynamic effects. Earth's crust is assumed to be a
Kelvin-Voigt material. The seismic source is assumed to be a dislocation in a
viscoelastic medium. The fluid motion is described by the classical nonlinear
shallow water equations (NSWE) with time-dependent bathymetry. The
viscoelastodynamic equations are solved by a finite-element method and the NSWE
by a finite-volume scheme. A comparison between static and dynamic
tsunami-generation approaches is performed. The results of the numerical
computations show differences between the two approaches and the dynamic
effects could explain the complicated shapes of tsunami wave trains.
