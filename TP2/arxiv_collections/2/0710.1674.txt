Interference patterns of surface plasmon polaritons(SPPs) are observed in the
extraordinary optical transmission through subwavelength holes in optically
thick metal plate. It is found that the phase of incident light can be
transferred to SPPs. We can control the destructive and constructive
interference of SPPs by modulating the relative phase between two incident
beams. Using a slightly displaced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we also observe
a SPPs interference pattern composed of bright and dark stripes.
