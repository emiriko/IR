A group is properly 3-realizable if it is the fundamental group of a compact
polyhedron whose universal covering is proper homotopically equivalent to some
3-manifold. We prove that when such a group is also quasi-simply filtered then
it has {\em pro-(finitely generated free) fundamental group at infinity} and
{\em semi-stable ends}. Conjecturally the quasi-simply filtration assumption is
superfluous. Using these restrictions we provide the first examples of finitely
presented groups which are not properly 3-realizable, for instance large
families of Coxeter groups.
