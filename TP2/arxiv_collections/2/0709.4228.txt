We study the spectral properties of charge density wave (CDW) phase of the
half-filled spinless Falicov-Kimball model within the framework of the
Dynamical Mean Field Theory. We present detailed results for the spectral
function in the CDW phase as function of temperature and $U$. We show how the
proximity of the non-fermi liquid phase affects the CDW phase, and show that
there is a region in the phase diagram where we get a CDW phase without a gap
in the spectral function. This is a radical deviation from the mean-field
prediction where the gap is proportional to the order parameter.
