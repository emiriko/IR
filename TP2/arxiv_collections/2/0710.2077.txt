It is shown that the nearest neighbor coupling between the carbon atoms is
not enough to reproduce the phonon spectrum as observed in graphene, the second
neighbor force constant is essential. For completeness we have rederived the
phonon spectrum of one dimensional chains and two dimensional lattices like
square lattice and triangular lattice with nearest and next nearest neighbor
coupling among the atoms. This article is essentially an account of the
technical details of a review talk on phonon spectrum of graphene presented at
Institute of Physics.
