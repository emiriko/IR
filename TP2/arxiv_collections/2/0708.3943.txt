We address the issue of massive phase separation (PS) in manganite family of
doped Mott insulators through ac conductivity measurements on
La$_{0.625-y}$Pr$_{y}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_{3}$ (0.375 $\leq$ y $\leq$ 0.275), and
establish applicability of the scaling theory of percolation in the critical
regime of the PS. Measurements of dc resistivity, magnetization (M(T)) and
electron diffraction show incomplete growth of a ferromagnetic (FM) metallic
component on cooling the high temperature charge ordered (CO) phase well below
Curie temperature. The impedance $\mid$Z(T,f)$\mid$ measured over a frequency
(f) range of 10 Hz to 10 MHz in the critical regime follows a universal scaling
of the form $\approx$ R(T,0)g(f$\xi^{2+\theta}$) with $\theta$ $\approx$ 0.86
and the normalized correlation length varying from 1 to 4, suggesting anomalous
diffusion of holes in percolating FM clusters.
