The thermal response function given to a unit-step dissipation accurately
characterizes the thermal system. Instead of the thermal response function the
so-called structure function describing three-dimensional as the equivalent
model of one-dimensional heat-spreading, created from the thermal response
function with the help of complex mathematical procedures, is often used. Using
the structure function the partial thermal capacity and partial heat resistance
of certain elements of the thermal system can be identified. If the geometrical
measurements of a thermal system of simple geometry and homogeneous material
(such as a homogeneous rod or board, etc.) are known, the coefficient of
thermal conductivity of the material in question can be determined from two
points of the structure function at 2-5 per cent of accuracy. In this paper a
method is presented which applies a wide range/section instead of two points of
the cumulative structure function to determine the thermal coefficient, thus
reducing the subjective error deriving from the selection of the two points.
The above method is presented and illustrated in simulated as well as measured
thermal transient responses.
