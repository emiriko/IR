We present an approach using quantum walks (QWs) to redistribute ultracold
atoms in an optical lattice. Different density profiles of atoms can be
obtained by exploiting the controllable properties of QWs, such as the variance
and the probability distribution in position space using quantum coin
parameters and engineered noise. The QW evolves the density profile of atoms in
a superposition of position space resulting in a quadratic speedup of the
process of quantum phase transition. We also discuss implementation in
presently available setups of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
