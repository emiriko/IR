Non-reversing relaxation enthalpies (DHnr) at glass transitions Tg(x) in the
PxGexSe1-2x ternary display wide, sharp and deep global minima (~ 0) in the
0.09 < x < 0.145 range, within which Tgs become thermally reversing. In this
reversibility window, glasses are found not to age, in contrast to aging
observed for fragile glass compositions outside the window. Thermal
reversibility and lack of aging seem to be paradigms of self-organization which
molecular glasses share with protein structures which repetitively and
reversibly change conformation near Tg and the folding temperature
respectively.
