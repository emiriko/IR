We generate conical second-harmonic radiation by transverse excitation of a
two-dimensional annular periodically-poled nonlinear photonic structure with a
fundamental Gaussian beam. We show that these conical waves are the far-field
images of the Bessel beams generated in a crystal by parametric frequency
conversion assisted by nonlinear Bragg diffraction.
