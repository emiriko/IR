We consider an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation for the Dirac spinor
field on the combined background of a gravitational wave and constant uniform
magnetic field. By taking the classical limit of the spinor field Hamiltonian
we arrive at the equations of motion for the non-relativistic spinning
particle. Two different kinds of the gravitational fields are considered and in
both cases the effect of the gravitational wave on the spinor field and on the
corresponding spinning particle may be enforced by the sufficiently strong
magnetic field. This result can be relevant for the astrophysical applications
and, in principle, useful for creating the gravitational wave detectors based
on atomic physics and precise interferometry.
