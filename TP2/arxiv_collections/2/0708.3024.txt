We present magnetization measurements on the single molecule magnet Fe8 in
the presence of pulsed microwave radiation. A pump-probe technique is used with
two microwave pulses with frequencies of 107 GHz and 118 GHz and pulse lengths
of several nanoseconds to study the spin dynamics via time-resolved
magnetization measurements using a Hall probe magnetometer. We find evidence
for short spin-phonon relaxation times of the order of one microsecond. The
temperature dependence of the spin-phonon relaxation time in our experiments is
in good agreement with previously published theoretical results. We also
established the presence of very short energy diffusion times, that act on a
timescale of about 70 ns.
