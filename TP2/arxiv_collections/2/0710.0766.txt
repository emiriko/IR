We present an analysis of atomic diffraction due to the interaction of an
atomic beam with a pair of Gaussian light pulses. We derive a simple analytical
expression for the populations in different diffraction orders. The validity of
the obtained solution extends beyond the Raman-Nath regime, where the kinetic
energy associated with different diffraction peaks is neglected, into the
so-called channeling regime where accurate analytical expressions have not
previously been available for the diffraction. Comparison with experimental
results and exact numerical solutions demonstrate the validity of our
analytical formula.
