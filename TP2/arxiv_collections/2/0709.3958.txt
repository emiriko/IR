The Einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant are coupled to
the pressureless perfect fluid matter in plane symmetry. Under suitable
restrictions on the initial data, the resulting Einstein-dust system is proved
to have a global classical solution in the future time direction. Some late
time asymptotic properties are obtained as well.
