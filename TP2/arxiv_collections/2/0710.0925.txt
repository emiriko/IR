Angular Voronoi diagram was introduced by Asano et al. as fundamental
research for a mesh generation. In an angular Voronoi diagram, the edges are
curves of degree three. From view of computational robustness we need to treat
the curves carefully, because they might have a singularity.
  We enumerate all the possible types of curves that appear as an edge of an
angular Voronoi diagram, which tells us what kind of degeneracy is possible and
tells us necessity of considering a singularity for computational robustness.
