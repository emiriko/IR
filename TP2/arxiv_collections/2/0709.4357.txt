Collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate under periodic
oscillations of a quadratic plus quartic trap position has been studied. A
coupled set of variational equations is derived for the width and the
condensate wave function center. Analytical expressions for the growth of
oscillation amplitudes in the resonance case are derived. It is shown that
jittering of an anharmonic trap position can cause double resonance of the BEC
width and the center of mass oscillation in the wide range of the BEC
parameters values. The predictions of variational approach are confirmed by
full numerical simulations of the 1D GP equation.
