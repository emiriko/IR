Recent JLab experimental data on quasi elastic 3He(e,e'p)2H(pn) and
4He(e,e'p)3H processes are interpreted using an approach based upon realistic
wave functions and Glauber multiple scattering theory within a generalized
eikonal approximation (GEA). The results of a non factorized calculation of the
left-right asymmetry A_{TL} of the process 3He(e,e'p)2H, obtained using the
full covariant form of the electromagnetic operator, are also presented.
