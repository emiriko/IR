I describe the work of the CEDAR collaboration in developing tools for tuning
and validating Monte Carlo event generator programs. The core CEDAR task is to
interface the Durham HepData database of experimental measurements to event
generator validation tools such as the UCL JetWeb system - this has
necessitated the migration of HepData to a new relational database system and a
Java-based interaction model. The "number crunching" part of JetWeb is also
being upgraded, from the Fortran HZTool library to the new C++ Rivet system and
a generator interfacing layer named RivetGun. Finally, I describe how Rivet is
already being used as a central part of a new generator tuning system, and
summarise two other CEDAR activities, HepML and HepForge.
