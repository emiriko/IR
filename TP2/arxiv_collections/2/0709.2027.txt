The transfer of genetic materials across species (lateral genetic transfer,
LGT) contributes to genomic and physiological innovation in prokaryotes. The
extent of LGT in prokaryotes has been examined in a number of studies, but the
unit of transfer has not been studied in a rigorous manner. Using a rigorous
phylogenetic approach, we analysed the units of LGT within families of
single-copy genes obtained from 144 fully sequenced prokaryote genomes. A total
of 30.3% of these gene families show evidence of LGT. We found that the
transfer of gene fragments has been more frequent than the transfer of entire
genes, suggesting the extent of LGT has been underestimated. We found little
functional bias between within-gene (fragmentary) and whole-gene
(non-fragmentary) genetic transfer, but non-fragmentary transfer has been more
frequent into pathogens than into non-pathogens. As gene families that contain
probable paralogs were excluded from the current study, our results may still
underestimate the extent of LGT; nonetheless this is the most-comprehensive
study to date of the unit of LGT among prokaryote genomes.
