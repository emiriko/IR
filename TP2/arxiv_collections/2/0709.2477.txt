Two-proton and two-deuteron correlations have been studied in the target
fragmentation region of central Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A GeV. Protons and
deuterons were measured with the Plastic Ball spectrometer of the WA98
experiment at the CERN SPS. The results of one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional analyses using both the Bertsch-Pratt and
Yano-Koonin-Podgoretsky parameterizations of the two-particle correlation
functions are presented. The proton source exhibits a volume emission, while
the deuteron source, with small outward radius, appears opaque. Both proton and
deuteron sources have cross-terms R_{ol}^2 and longitudinal velocities beta
consistent with zero, indicating a boost-invariant expansion. The invariant
radius parameter R follows an approximate A/sqrt{m} scaling while the
longitudinal and transverse radii,
  R_{L} and R_{T}, scale approximately as A/sqrt{m_{T}} with A ~ 3 fm GeV^{1/2}
in both cases.
