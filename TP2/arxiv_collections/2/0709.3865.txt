A new mechanism of tunnelling at macroscopic distances is proposed for a wave
packet localized in one-dimensional disordered potential with mirror symmetry,
V(-x)=V(x). Unlike quantum tunnelling through a regular potential barrier,
which occurs only at the energies lower then the barrier height, the proposed
mechanism of tunnelling exists even for weak white-noise-like scattering
potentials. It also exists in classical circuits of resonant contours with
random resonant frequencies. The latter property may be used as a new method of
secure communication, which does not require coding and decoding of the
transmitting signal.
