We study here the random diffusion model. This is a continuum model for a
conserved scalar density field $\phi$ driven by diffusive dynamics. The
interesting feature of the dynamics is that the {\it bare} diffusion
coefficient $D$ is density dependent. In the simplest case
$D=\bar{D}+D_{1}\delta \phi $ where $\bar{D}$ is the constant average diffusion
constant. In the case where the driving effective Hamiltonian is quadratic the
model can be treated using perturbation theory in terms of the single nonlinear
coupling $D_{1}$. We develop perturbation theory to fourth order in $D_{1}$.
The are two ways of analyzing this perturbation theory. In one approach,
developed by Kawasaki, at one-loop order one finds mode coupling theory with an
ergodic-nonergodic transition. An alternative more direct interpretation at
one-loop order leads to a slowing down as the nonlinear coupling increases.
Eventually one hits a critical coupling where the time decay becomes algebraic.
Near this critical coupling a weak peak develops at a wavenumber well above the
peak at $q=0$ associated with the conservation law. The width of this peak in
Fourier space decreases with time and can be identified with a characteristic
kinetic length which grows with a power law in time. For stronger coupling the
system becomes metastable and then unstable. At two-loop order it is shown that
the ergodic-nonergodic transition is not supported. It is demonstrated that the
{\it critical} properties of the direct approach survive going to higher order
in perturbation theory.
