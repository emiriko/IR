The analysis of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking of N=1 supersymmetric
SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory with matter is performed. The supersymmetric
$R_\xi$-gauge is used and its non-local effects investigated. Superpropagators
and vertices are computed, and it is shown that the non-local terms introduced
by the $R_\xi$-gauge-fixing are well-behaved in general gauge at one-loop. It
is argued that this feature generalizes to multiple loops.
