We analyze CiteULike, an online collaborative tagging system where users
bookmark and annotate scientific papers. Such a system can be naturally
represented as a tripartite graph whose nodes represent papers, users and tags
connected by individual tag assignments. The semantics of tags is studied here,
in order to uncover the hidden relationships between tags. We find that the
clustering coefficient reflects the semantical patterns among tags, providing
useful ideas for the designing of more efficient methods of data classification
and spam detection.
