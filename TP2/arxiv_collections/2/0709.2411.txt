Direct constraints on the masses of new heavy bosons by the Tevatron data are
discussed. Some excesses in the experimental data are interpreted as a
resonance production of new charged and `leptophobic' neutral chiral bosons
with masses around 500 GeV and 700 GeV, respectively. The interpretation was
provided on the basis of the theoretical model, proposed by the author about 15
years ago. New Tevatron data and the LHC results will definitely confirm or
reject this interpretation. The ILC with an energy above 1 TeV would be an
ideal place to produce and to study the properties of these particles.
