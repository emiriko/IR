Resistivity under magnetic field, thermopower and Hall coefficient are
systematically studied for
[Bi$_2$Ba$_{1.3}$K$_{0.6}$Co$_{0.1}$]$^{RS}$[CoO$_2$]$_{1.97}$ single crystal.
In-plane resistivity ($\rho_{ab}$(T)) shows metallic behavior down to 2 K with
a $T^2$ dependence below 30 K; while out-of-plane resistivity ($\rho_{c}(T)$)
shows metallic behavior at high temperature and a thermal activation
semiconducting behavior below about 12 K. Striking feature is that magnetic
field induces a ln(1/$T$) diverging behavior in both $\rho_{ab}$ and
$\rho_{c}(T)$ at low temperature. The positive magnetoresistance (MR) could be
well fitted by the formula based on multi-band electronic structure. The
ln(1/$T$) diverging behavior in $\rho_{ab}$ and $\rho_{c}(T)$ could arise from
the magnetic-field-induced 2D weak localization or spin density wave.
