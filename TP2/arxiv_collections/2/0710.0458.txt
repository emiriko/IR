After commenting on the present value of the Higgs particle mass from
radiative corrections, we explore the phenomenological implications of an
alternative, non-perturbative renormalization of the scalar sector where the
mass of the Higgs particle does not represent a measure of observable
interactions at the Higgs mass scale. In this approach the Higgs particle could
be very heavy, even heavier than 1 TeV, and remain nevertheless a relatively
narrow resonance.
