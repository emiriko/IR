A simple model is proposed for the direct correlation function (DCF) for
simple fluids consisting of a hard-core contribution, a simple parametrized
core correction, and a mean-field tail. The model requires as input only the
free energy of the homogeneous fluid, obtained, e.g., from thermodynamic
perturbation theory. Comparison to the DCF obtained from simulation of a
Lennard-Jones fluid shows this to be a surprisingly good approximation for a
wide range of densities. The model is used to construct a density functional
theory for inhomogeneous fluids which is applied to the problem of calculating
the surface tension of the liquid-vapor interface. The numerical values found
are in good agreement with simulation.
