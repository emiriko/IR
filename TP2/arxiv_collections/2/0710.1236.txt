We show that spin correlations of atoms in an optical lattice can be
reconstructed by coupling the system to the light, and by measuring
correlations between the emitted photons. This principle is the basis for a
method to characterize states in quantum computation and simulation with
optical lattices. As examples, we study the detection of spin correlations in a
quantum magnetic phase, and the characterization of cluster states.
