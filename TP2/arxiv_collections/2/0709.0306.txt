Consider a system of particles performing nearest neighbor random walks on
the lattice $\ZZ$ under hard--core interaction. The rate for a jump over a
given bond is direction--independent and the inverse of the jump rates are
i.i.d. random variables belonging to the domain of attraction of an
$\a$--stable law, $0<\a<1$. This exclusion process models conduction in
strongly disordered one-dimensional media. We prove that, when varying over the
disorder and for a suitable slowly varying function $L$, under the
super-diffusive time scaling $N^{1 + 1/\alpha}L(N)$, the density profile
evolves as the solution of the random equation $\partial_t \rho = \mf L_W
\rho$, where $\mf L_W$ is the generalized second-order differential operator
$\frac d{du} \frac d{dW}$ in which $W$ is a double sided $\a$--stable
subordinator. This result follows from a quenched hydrodynamic limit in the
case that the i.i.d. jump rates are replaced by a suitable array $\{\xi_{N,x} :
x\in\bb Z\}$ having same distribution and fulfilling an a.s. invariance
principle. We also prove a law of large numbers for a tagged particle.
