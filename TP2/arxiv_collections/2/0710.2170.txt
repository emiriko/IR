We have performed x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and valence-band
photoemission studies of the diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor
Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$Te. XMCD signals due to ferromagnetism were observed at the Cr
2p absorption edge. Comparison with atomic multiplet calculations suggests that
the magnetically active component of the Cr ion was divalent under the
tetrahedral crystal field with tetragonal distortion along the crystalline a-,
b-, and c-axes. In the valence-band spectra, spectral weight near the Fermi
level was strongly suppressed, suggesting the importance of Jahn-Teller effect
and the strong Coulomb interaction between the Cr 3d electrons.
