In this paper, urban traffic is modeled using dual graph representation of
urban transportation network where roads are mapped to nodes and intersections
are mapped to links. The proposed model considers both the navigation of
vehicles on the network and the motion of vehicles along roads. The road's
capacity and the vehicle-turning ability at intersections are naturally
incorporated in the model. The overall capacity of the system can be quantified
by a phase transition from free flow to congestion. Simulation results show
that the system's capacity depends greatly on the topology of transportation
networks. In general, a well-planned grid can hold more vehicles and its
overall capacity is much larger than that of a growing scale-free network.
