Electron hopping models on the honeycomb lattice are studied. The lattice
consists of two triangular sublattices, and it is non-Bravais. The dual space
has non-trivial topology. The gauge fields of Bloch electrons have the U(1)
symmetry and thus represent superconducting states in the dual space. Two
quantized Abrikosov fluxes exist at the Dirac points and have fluxes $2pi$ and
$-2pi$, respectively. We define the non-Abelian SO(3) gauge theory in the
extended 3$d$ dual space and it is shown that a monopole and anti-monoplole
solution is stable. The SO(3) gauge group is broken down to U(1) at the 2$d$
boundary.The Abrikosov fluxes are related to quantized Hall conductance by the
topological expression. Based on this, monopole confinement and deconfinement
are discussed in relation to time reversal symmetry and QHE.
  The Jahn-Teller effect is briefly discussed.
