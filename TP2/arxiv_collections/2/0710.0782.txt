Metadynamics is a powerful computational tool to obtain the free energy
landscape of complex systems. The Monte Carlo algorithm has proven useful to
calculate thermodynamic quantities associated with simplified models of
proteins, and thus to gain an ever-increasing understanding on the general
principles underlying the mechanism of protein folding. We show that it is
possible to couple metadynamics and Monte Carlo algorithms to obtain the free
energy of model proteins in a way which is computationally very economical.
