We studied single-crystals of the antiferromagnetic compound UNi0.5Sb2 (TN ~
161 K) by means of measurements of magnetic susceptibility (chi), specific heat
(Cp), and electrical resistivity (rho) at ambient pressure, and resistivity
under hydrostatic pressures up to 20 kbar, in the temperature range from 1.9 to
300 K. The thermal coefficient of the electrical resistivity (drho/dT) changes
drastically from positive below TN to negative above, reflecting the loss of
spin-disorder scattering in the ordered phase. Two small features in the rho vs
T data centered near 40 and 85 K correlate well in temperature with features in
the magnetic susceptibility and are consistent with other data in the
literature. These features are quite hysteretic in temperature, i.e., the
difference between the warming and cooling cycles are about 10 and 6 K,
respectively. The effect of pressure is to raise TN at the approximate rate of
0.76 K/kbar, while progressively suppressing the amplitude of the small
features in rho vs T at lower temperatures and increasing the thermal
hysteresis.
