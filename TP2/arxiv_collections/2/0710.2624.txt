The polarizability measures how the system responds to an applied electrical
field. Computationally, there are many different ways to evaluate this
tensorial quantity, some of which rely on the explicit use of the external
perturbation and require several individual calculations to obtain the full
tensor. In this work, we present some considerations about symmetry that allow
us to take full advantage of Neumann's principle and decrease the number of
calculations required by these methods. We illustrate the approach with two
examples, the use of the symmetries in real space and in spin space in the
calculation of the electrical or the spin response.
