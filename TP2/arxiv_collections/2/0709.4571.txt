We analyze some of Einstein's failures to accomplish tasks which he posed to
himself, notably deterministic interpretation of Quantum mechanics and
formulation of the Unified theory of physical interactions, putting them into
broader ontological and epistemological context. We highlight, on the other
hand, a number of his contributions that have been unjustly neglected by the
physical community, like the semiclassical quantization principle and the
concept of antiparticle. Finally, we mention briefly three issues, which are
related to Einstein, but are subject to controversy.
