Combining the mutual information criterion with a forward feature selection
strategy offers a good trade-off between optimality of the selected feature
subset and computation time. However, it requires to set the parameter(s) of
the mutual information estimator and to determine when to halt the forward
procedure. These two choices are difficult to make because, as the
dimensionality of the subset increases, the estimation of the mutual
information becomes less and less reliable. This paper proposes to use
resampling methods, a K-fold cross-validation and the permutation test, to
address both issues. The resampling methods bring information about the
variance of the estimator, information which can then be used to automatically
set the parameter and to calculate a threshold to stop the forward procedure.
The procedure is illustrated on a synthetic dataset as well as on real-world
examples.
