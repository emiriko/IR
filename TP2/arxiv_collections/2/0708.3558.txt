In this short paper we establish the definition of the Lie derivative of a
second rank tensor in the context of teleparallel theory of gravity and also
extend it for a general tensor of rank $p+q$. This definition is then used to
find Killing vectors of the Einstein universe. It turns out that Killing
vectors of the Einstein universe in the teleparallel theory are the same as in
General Relativity.
