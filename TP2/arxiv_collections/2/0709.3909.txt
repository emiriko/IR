We remind the viewpoint that violation of Bell's inequality might be
interpreted not only as an evidence of the alternative -- either nonlocality or
``death of reality'' (under the assumption the quantum mechanics is
incomplete). Violation of Bell's type inequalities is a well known sufficient
condition of incompatibility of random variables -- impossibility to realize
them on a single probability space. Thus, in fact, we should take into account
an additional interpretation of violation of Bell's inequality -- a few pairs
of random variables (two dimensional vector variables) involved in the EPR-Bohm
experiment are incompatible. They could not be realized on a single Kolmogorov
probability space. Thus one can choose between: a) completeness of quantum
mechanics; b) nonlocality; c) `` death of reality''; d) non-Kolmogorovness. In
any event, violation of Bell's inequality has a variety of possible
interpretations. Hence, it could not be used to derive the unique conclusion on
the relation between quantum and classical models.
