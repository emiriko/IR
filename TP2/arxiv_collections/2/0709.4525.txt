In this talk, we shortly report results from our recent global DGLAP analysis
of nuclear parton distributions. This is an extension of our former
EKS98-analysis improved with an automated $\chi^2$ minimization procedure and
uncertainty estimates. Although our new analysis show no significant deviation
from EKS98, a sign of a significantly stronger gluon shadowing could be seen in
the RHIC BRAHMS data.
