We present results for the effect of a second massive quark in the relation
between the pole and the minimal subtracted quark mass at the three loop level.
We also consider the analogous effect for the wave function renormalisation
constant. Some technical details of the calculation are given. Our result is
phenomenologically relevant for the bottom quark including virtual charm
effects.
