The interface between classical physics and quantum physics is explained from
the point of view of quantum information theory (Feynman Processes). The
interpretation depends on a hefty sacrifice: the classical determinism or the
arrow of time.
  The wave-particle duality steams from the qubit model, as the root of
creation and annihilation of possibilities. A few key experiments are briefly
reviewed from the above perspective: quantum erasure, delayed-choice and
wave-particle correlation.
  The CPT-Theorem is interpreted in the framework of categories with duality
and a timeless interpretation of the Feynman Processes is proposed. A
connection between the fine-structure constant and algebraic number theory is
suggested.
