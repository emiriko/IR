We have considered the processes of excitation and ionization of light
multicharged ions by impact of high-energy particles, which proceed with
participation of the $ns$ electrons. The screening corrections to the energy
levels and photoionization cross sections are evaluated analytically within the
framework of the non-relativistic perturbation theory with respect to the
electron-electron interaction. The universal scalings for the excitation and
ionization cross sections are studied for arbitrary principal quantum numbers
$n$.
