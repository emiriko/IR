After approximate replacing of Maxwellian distribution exponent with the
rational polynomial fraction we have obtained precise analytical expression for
and calculated the principal value of logarithmically divergent integral in the
electron wave dispersion equation. At the same time our calculations have shown
the presence of strong collisionless damping of the electromagnetic
low-velocity (electron) wave in plasmas with Maxwellian-like electron velocity
distribution function at some small, of the order of several per cents,
differences from Maxwellian distribution in the main region of large electron
densities, however due to the differences in the distribution tail, where
electron density itself is negligibly small.
