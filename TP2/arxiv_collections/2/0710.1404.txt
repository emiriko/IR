One of the essential and most complex components in the software development
process is the database. The complexity increases when the "orientation" of the
interacting components differs. A persistence framework moves the program data
in its most natural form to and from a permanent data store, the database. Thus
a persistence framework manages the database and the mapping between the
database and the objects. This paper compares the performance of two
persistence frameworks ? Hibernate and iBatis?s SQLMaps using a banking
database. The performance of both of these tools in single and multi-user
environments are evaluated.
