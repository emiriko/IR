While it is widely accepted that lead-based paint and leaded gasoline are
primary sources of elevated concentrations of lead in residential soils,
conclusions regarding their relative contributions are mixed and generally
study specific. We develop a novel nonlinear regression for soil lead
concentrations over time. It is argued that this methodology provides useful
insights into the partitioning of the average soil lead concentration by source
and time over large residential areas. The methodology is used to investigate
soil lead concentrations from the 1987 Minnesota Lead Study and the 1990
National Lead Survey. Potential litigation issues are discussed briefly.
