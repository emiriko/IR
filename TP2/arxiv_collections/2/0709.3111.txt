The group of the p-brane world volume preserving diffeomorphism is
considered. The infinite-dimensional spinors of this group are related, by the
nonlinear realization techniques, to the corresponding spinors of its linear
subgroup, that are constructed explicitly. An algebraic construction of the
Virasoro and Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebras, based on this infinite-dimensional
spinors and tensors, is demonstrated.
