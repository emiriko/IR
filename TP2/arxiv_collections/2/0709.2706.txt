I report final CLEO-c results on the purely leptonic decays of the D_s^+ ->
l^+ nu, for the cases when l^+ is a mu^+ or tau^+, when it decays into pi^+
anti-nu, using 314/pb of data at 4.170 GeV. I also include preliminary results
from the tau^+ -> e^+ nu anti-nu channel using 195/pb. Combining both we
measure f_{D_s}= 275 +/- 10 +/- 5 MeV, and f_{D_s^+}/{f_{D^+}=1.24 +/- 0.10 =/-
0.03 .
