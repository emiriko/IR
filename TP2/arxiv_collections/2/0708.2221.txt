InN phase is grown in crystalline InP(100) substrates by 50 keV N+
implantation at an elevated temperature of 400 deg C followed by annealing at
525 deg C in N2 ambient. Crystallographic structural and Raman scattering
studies are performed for the characterization of grown phases. Temperature-
and power-dependent photoluminescence studies show direct band-to-band
transition peak ~1.06 eV at temperatures <=150K. Implantations at an elevated
temperature with a low ion beam current and subsequent low temperature
annealing step are found responsible for the growth of high-quality InN phase.
