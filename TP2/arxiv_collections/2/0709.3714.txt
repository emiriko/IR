In this paper, we investigate the evolution of classical wave propagation in
the canonical acoustic black hole by numerical method and discuss the details
of tail phenomenon. The oscillating frequency and damping time scale both
increase with the angular momentum $l$. For the lower $l$, numerical results
show the lowest WKB approximation gives the most reliable result. We also find
that time scale of the interim region from ringing to tail is not affected
obviously by changing $l$.
