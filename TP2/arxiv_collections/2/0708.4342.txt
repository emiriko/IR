We continue our investigation of the Z_N-Baxter-Bazhanov-Stroganov model
using the method of separation of variables [nlin/0603028]. In this paper we
calculate the norms and matrix elements of a local Z_N-spin operator between
eigenvectors of the auxiliary problem. For the norm the multiple sums over the
intermediate states are performed explicitly. In the case N=2 we solve the
Baxter equation and obtain form-factors of the spin operator of the periodic
Ising model on a finite lattice.
