Using an explicit computable expression of ordinary multinomials, we
establish three remarkable connections, with the q-generalized Fibonacci
sequence, the exponential partial Bell partition polynomials and the density of
convolution powers of the discrete uniform distribution. Identities and various
combinatorial relations are derived.
