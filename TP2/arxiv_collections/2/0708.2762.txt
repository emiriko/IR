An FPGA based digital signal processing (DSP) system for biasing and reading
out multiplexed bolometric detectors for mm-wavelength telescopes is presented.
This readout system is being deployed for balloon-borne and ground based
cosmology experiments with the primary goal of measuring the signature of
inflation with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. The system consists
of analog superconducting electronics running at 250mK and 4K, coupled to
digital room temperature backend electronics described here. The digital
electronics perform the real time functionality with DSP algorithms implemented
in firmware. A soft embedded processor provides all of the slow housekeeping
control and communications. Each board in the system synthesizes
multi-frequency combs of 8 to 32 carriers in the MHz band to bias the
detectors. After the carriers have been modulated with the sky-signal by the
detectors, the same boards digitize the comb directly. The carriers are mixed
down to base-band and low pass filtered. The signal bandwidth of 0.050 Hz - 100
Hz places extreme requirements on stability and requires powerful filtering
techniques to recover the sky-signal from the MHz carriers.
