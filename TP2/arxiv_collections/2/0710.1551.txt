It is well known that kernels in graphs are powerful and useful structures,
for instance in the theory of games. However, a kernel does not always exist
and Chv\'atal proved in 1973 that it is an NP-Complete problem to decide its
existence. We present here an alternative definition of kernels that uses an
inductive machinery : the inductive kernels. We prove that inductive kernels
always exist and a particular one can be constructed in quadratic time.
However, it is an NP-Complete problem to decide the existence of an inductive
kernel including (resp. excluding) some fixed vertex.
