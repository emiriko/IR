We report the statistical properties of three bus-transport networks (BTN) in
three different cities of China. These networks are composed of a set of bus
lines and stations serviced by these. Network properties, including the degree
distribution, clustering and average path length are studied in different
definitions of network topology. We explore scaling laws and correlations that
may govern intrinsic features of such networks. Besides, we create a weighted
network representation for BTN with lines mapped to nodes and number of common
stations to weights between lines. In such a representation, the distributions
of degree, strength and weight are investigated. A linear behavior between
strength and degree s(k) ~ k is also observed.
