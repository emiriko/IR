We report the results of a numerical simulation of a lattice formulation of
the two-dimensional N=(2,2) super Yang-Mills theory proposed by Suzuki and
Taniguchi. We measure the 1-point functions and 2-point functions. The scenario
is that only tuning of the scalar mass to a specific value gives a
supersymmetric continuum limit. Our results are consistent with this scenario
although conclusive results on the restoration of supersymmetry have not been
obtained.
