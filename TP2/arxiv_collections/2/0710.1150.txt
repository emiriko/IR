We complete and improve the fits to experimental $\pi\pi$ scattering
amplitudes, both at low and high energies, that we performed in the previous
papers of this series. We then verify that the corresponding amplitudes satisfy
analyticity requirements, in the form of partial wave analyticity at low
energies, forward dispersion relations (FDR) at all energies, and Roy equations
below$\bar{K}K$ threshold; the first by construction, the last two, inside
experimental errors. Then we repeat the fits including as constraints FDR and
Roy equations. The ensuing central values of the various scattering amplitudes
verify very accurately FDR and, especially, Roy equations, and change very
little from what we found by just fitting data, with the exception of the D2
wave phase shift, for which one parameter moves by $1.5 \sigma$. These improved
parametrizations therefore provide a reliable representation of pion-pion
amplitudes with which one can test various physical relations. We also present
a list of low energy parameters and other observables. In particular, we find
$a_0^{(0)}=0.223\pm0.009 M^{-1}_\pi$, $a_0^{(2)}=-0.0444\pm0.0045 M^{-1}_\pi$
and $\delta_0^{(0)}(m^2_K)-\delta_0^{(2)}(m^2_K)=50.9\pm1.2^{\rm o}$.
