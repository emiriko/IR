Intensive investigations of freeze-out criteria in a hot and dense fireball
provide important information regarding particle emission from the fireball. A
systematic comparison of these proposals is presented here in the framework of
a thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model which has been found to
describe the properties of hadron gas (HG) quite well. We find that the impact
of excluded volume correction is considerably large and the average energy per
hadron is 0.9 GeV, $n_b+n_{\bar b}$ stays nearly constant at 0.12/fm$^3$ and
the normalized entropy density $s/T^3\approx 6$ in this model. Moreover, these
values are independent of the beam or center-of-mass energy and also of the
target and beam nuclei. In ideal HG model these quantities show substantial
energy dependence. Further we have compared the predictions of various excluded
volume models in the precise determination of these criteria and we find that
the thermodynamically consistent excluded volume models give the best results.
In addition, we find another important criterion that entropy per hadron has a
constant value at 6 in our model. We hope that these findings will throw
considerable light on the expansion dynamics and the bulk thermodynamic
properties of the fireball before chemical freeze-out.
