The critical properties of the Frank model of spontaneous chiral synthesis
are discussed by applying results from the field theoretic renormalization
group (RG). The long time and long wavelength features of this microscopic
reaction scheme belong to the same universality class as multi-colored directed
percolation processes. Thus, the following RG fixed points (FP) govern the
critical dynamics of the Frank model for d<4: one unstable FP that corresponds
to complete decoupling between the two enantiomers, a saddle-point that
corresponds to symmetric interspecies coupling, and two stable FPs that
individually correspond to unidirectional couplings between the two chiral
molecules. These latter two FPs are associated with the breakdown of mirror or
chiral symmetry. In this simplified model of molecular synthesis, homochirality
is a natural consequence of the intrinsic reaction noise in the critical
regime, which corresponds to extremely dilute chemical systems.
