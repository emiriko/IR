An electroweak model is formulated in a finite, four-dimensional quantum
field theory without a Higgs particle. The W and Z masses are induced from the
electroweak symmetry breaking of one-loop vacuum polarization graphs. The
theory contains only the observed particle spectrum of the standard model. In
terms of the observed twelve lepton and quark masses, a loop calculation of the
non-local electroweak energy scale $\Lambda_W$ and $\rho$ predicts the values
$\Lambda_W(M_Z)=541$ GeV and $\rho(M_Z)=0.993$, yielding
$s^2_Z\equiv\sin^2\theta_W(M_Z)=0.21686\pm 0.00097$. Possible ways to detect a
non-local signal in scattering amplitudes involving loop graphs at the LHC are
discussed. Fermion masses are generated from a ``mass gap'' equation obtained
from the lowest order, finite fermion self-energy with a broken symmetry vacuum
state. The cross section for $W_L^+ W_L^-\to W_L^+ W_L^-$ is predicted to
vanish for $\sqrt{s} > {1 \rm TeV}$, avoiding a violation of the unitarity
bound. The Brookhaven National Laboratory measurement of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon and the residual difference between the measured value and
the standard model can provide a test of a non-local deviation from the
standard model.
