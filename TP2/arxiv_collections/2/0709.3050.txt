We report on the first experimental demonstration of light transfer in an
engineered triple-well optical waveguide structure which provides a classic
analogue of Coherent Tunnelling by Adiabatic Passage (CTAP) recently proposed
for coherent transport in space of neutral atoms or electrons among
tunneling-coupled optical traps or quantum wells [A.D. Greentree et al., Phys.
Rev. B 70, 235317 (2004); K. Eckert et al., Phys. Rev. A 70, 023606 (2004)].
The direct visualization of CTAP wavepacket dynamics enabled by our simple
optical system clearly shows that in the counterintuitive passage scheme light
waves tunnel between the two outer wells without appreciable excitation of the
middle well.
