We study orthonormal normal sections of two-dimensional immersions in
$\mathbb R^{n+2},$ $n\ge 2$, at which these sections are critical for a
functional of total torsion. In particular, we establish upper bounds for the
torsion coefficients in the case of non-flat normal bundles. With these notes
we continue a foregoing paper on surfaces in $\mathbb R^4.$
