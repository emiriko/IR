We compute the asymptotics of the number of integral quadratic forms with
prescribed orthogonal decompositions and, more generally, the asymptotics of
the number of lattice points lying in sectors of affine symmetric spaces. A new
key ingredient in this article is the strong wavefront lemma, which shows that
the generalized Cartan decomposition associated to a symmetric space is
uniformly Lipschitz.
