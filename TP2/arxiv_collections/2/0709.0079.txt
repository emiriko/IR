We re-express the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions as non-Abelian
spin-orbit gauges and provide a new perspective in understanding the persistent
spin helix [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 236601 (2006)]. A spin-orbit interacting
system can be transformed into a free electron gas in the equal-strength
Rashba-Dresselhaus [001] linear model, the Dresselhaus [110] linear model, and
a one-dimensional system. A general tight-binding Hamiltonian for non-uniform
spin-orbit interactions and hoppings along arbitrary directions, within the
framework of finite difference method, is obtained. As an application based on
this Hamiltonian, a quantum square ring in contact with two ideal leads is
found to exhibit four states, insulating, spin-filtering, spin-flipping, and
spin-keeping states.
