This work introduces a thermoreflectance-based system designed to measure the
surface temperature field of activated microelectronic devices at submicron
spatial resolution with either a laser or a CCD camera. The article describes
the system, outlines the measurement methodology, and presents validation
results. The thermo-reflectance thermography (TRTG) system is capable of
acquiring device surface temperature fields at up to 512x512 points with 0.2
$\mu$m resolution. The setup and measurement methodology are presented, along
with details of the calibration process required to convert changes in measured
surface reflectivity to absolute temperatures. To demonstrate the system's
capabilities, standard gold micro-resistors are activated and their surface
temperature fields are measured. The results of the CCD camera and our existing
laser-based measurement approaches are compared and found to be in very good
agreement. Finally, the system is validated by comparing the temperatures
obtained with the TRTG method with those obtained from electrical resistance
measurements.
