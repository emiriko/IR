In 2004, Tohoku University created a new introductory science experimental
course for freshmen. The course is a compulsory subject for students in all
natural science fields. The course is not designed for a professional
education, but as a liberal education, in which students are trained to become
familiar with nature and to discover natural laws for themselves. We present
here one of 12 themes - "science and culture: vibration of string instrument
and music", in which we expect students to study two aspects: 1) the
universality of natural laws and 2) the variety of value judgments from the
evidence.
