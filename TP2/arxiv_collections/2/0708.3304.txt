For a system composed of nine qubits, we show that natural interactions among
the qubits induce the time evolution that can be regarded, at discrete times,
as the Rabi oscillation of a logical qubit. Neither fine tuning of the
parameters nor switching of the interactions is necessary. Although
straightforward application of quantum error correction fails, we propose a
protocol by which the logical Rabi oscillation is protected against all
single-qubit errors. The present method thus opens a simple and realistic way
of protecting the unitary time evolution against noise.
