The coin-position entanglement generated by the evolution operator of a
discrete--time quantum walk converges, in the long time limit, to a well
defined value which depends on the initial state. We also discuss the
asymptotic bi-partite entanglement generated by several non-separable coin
operations for two coherent quantum walkers, for which the entropy of
entanglement increases logarithmically.
