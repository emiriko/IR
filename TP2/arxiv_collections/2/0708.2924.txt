We consider the effect of a short antiferromagnetic correlation length $\xi$
on the electronic bandstructure of the underdoped cuprates. Starting with a
Fermi-surface topology similar to that detected in magnetic quantum-oscillation
experiments, we show that a reduced $\xi$ gives an assymmetric broadening of
the quasiparticle dispersion, resulting in simulated ARPES data very similar to
those observed in experiment. Predicted features include the presence of `Fermi
arcs' close to $a{\bf k}=(\pi/2,\pi/2)$, without the need to invoke a d-wave
pseudogap order parameter. The statistical variation in the ${\bf k}$-space
areas of the reconstructed Fermi surface pockets causes the quantum
oscillations to be strongly damped, even in very strong magnetic fields, in
agreement with experiment.
