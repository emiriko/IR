From Sturmian and Christoffel words we derive a strictly increasing function
$\Delta:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$. This function is continuous at every
irrational point, while at rational points, left-continuous but not
right-continuous. Moreover, it assumes algebraic integers at rationals, and
transcendental numbers at irrationals. We also see that the differentiation of
$\Delta$ distinguishes some irrationality measures of real numbers.
