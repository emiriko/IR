We study management of localized modes in two-component (spinor)
Bose-Einstein condensates embedded in optical lattices by changing interspecies
interactions. By numerical integration of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii
equations, we find three different regimes of the delocalizing transition: i)
the partial delocalization when the chemical potential of one of the components
collapses with a gap edge and the respective component transforms into a Bloch
state, while the other component remains localized; ii) the partial
delocalization as consequence of instability of one of the components; and iii)
the situation where the vector soliton reaches limits of the existence domain.
It is shown that there exists a critical value for interspecies scattering
length, below which solutions can be manipulated and above which one of the
components is irreversibly destroyed.
