S. Longhi [1] studied the survival probability P(t) of an unstable state
coupled to a tight-binding lattice finding an exact analytical solution that
describes the nonexponential decay. When the first coupling is smaller than the
others, he shows that P(t) has a natural decomposition into two terms; one is
the exponential decay, consistent with the Gamow's approach, and the other is
the correction to this decay. The first purpose of this Comment is to show that
the condition imposed on the system; the site energy of the first site is set
in the center of the band, limits the generality of the results. A
decomposition based on the spectral properties of the system removes this
restriction [2]. Other point of this Comment is that, for the weak coupling
limit, the author stated that a Zeno effect occurs for t less than t*, where t*
is the smallest root of the equation g_eff(t*)=g_0, and for the strong coupling
limit an anti-Zeno effect occurs for t close to t**, where t** is the first
peak of g_eff. By using a spectral formulation we show that, the anti-Zeno
effect not only requires a strong coupling limit, also is necessary to choose
the resonance energy and width such that a destructive interference can occur.
We present this interference and give an analytical expression and physically
interpretation for t* and t**.
