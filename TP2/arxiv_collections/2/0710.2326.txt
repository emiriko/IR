We introduce a notion of resultant of two meromorphic functions on a compact
Riemann surface and demonstrate its usefulness in several respects. For
example, we exhibit several integral formulas for the resultant, relate it to
potential theory and give explicit formulas for the algebraic dependence
between two meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface. As a particular
application, the exponential transform of a quadrature domain in the complex
plane is expressed in terms of the resultant of two meromorphic functions on
the Schottky double of the domain.
