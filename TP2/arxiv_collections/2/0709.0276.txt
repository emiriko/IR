We introduce a variation of the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
thermostat that allows for controlling transport properties of molecular
fluids. The standard DPD thermostat acts only on a relative velocity along the
interatomic axis. Our extension includes the damping of the perpendicular
components of the relative velocity, yet keeping the advantages of conserving
Galilei invariance and within our error bar also hydrodynamics. This leads to a
second friction parameter for tuning the transport properties of the system.
Numerical simulations of a simple Lennard-Jones fluid and liquid water
demonstrate a very sensitive behaviour of the transport properties, e.g.,
viscosity, on the strength of the new friction parameter. We envisage that the
new thermostat will be very useful for the coarse-grained and adaptive
resolution simulations of soft matter, where the diffusion constants and
viscosity of the coarse-grained models are typically too high/low,
respectively, compared to all-atom simulations.
