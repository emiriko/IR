In these notes we review Klimcik's construction of noncommutative gauge
theory on the fuzzy supersphere. This theory has an exact SUSY gauge symmetry
with a finite number of degrees of freedom and thus in principle it is amenable
to the methods of matrix models and Monte Carlo numerical simulations. We also
write down in this article a novel fuzzy supersymmetric scalar action on the
fuzzy supersphere.
