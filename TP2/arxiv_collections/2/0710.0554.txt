We review the basic mechanisms of neutrino mass generation and the
corresponding structure of the lepton mixing matrix. We summarize the status of
three-neutrino oscillation parameters as determined from current observations,
using state-of-the-art solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes, as well as latest
experimental data as of September 2007. We also comment on recent attempts to
account for these results and to understand flavour from first principles. We
discuss extensively the prospects for probing the strength of CP violation in
two near term accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOvA, as
well as possible extensions such as T2KK and a second large off-axis detector
near the NOvA detector. We also briefly discuss the possibility of probing the
effect of Majorana phases in future neutrinoless double beta decay searches and
discuss other implications of leptonic CP violation such as leptogenesis.
Finally we comment on the issue of robustness of the current oscillation
interpretation and possible ways of probing for non-standard neutrino
interactions in precision oscillation studies.
