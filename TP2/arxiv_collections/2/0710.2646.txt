We study the high-velocity-projectile limit of the polarizational
contribution to the in-plane stopping power in a strongly coupled
two-dimensional electron liquid. The dielectric formalism based on the method
of moments is employed. The frequency moments of the loss function are
calculated using the model Hamiltonian including the two-dimensional Coulomb
interaction potential proportional to the inverse power of k. We prove that the
leading term of the high-velocity asymptote, like in the random-phase
approximation, is not affected by correlations.
