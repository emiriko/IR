We study the non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene taking into
account the self-consistent-field effects. Response of the system to a strong
pulse excitation is calculated. It is shown that radiative decay in graphene
differs from that of conventional two-dimensional electron systems both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Possible applications of the predicted
effects for generation of terahertz radiation are discussed.
