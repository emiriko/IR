Kinetic equations are derived from the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon
(BBGKY) hierarchy for point vortex systems in an infinite plane. As the level
of approximation for the Landau equation, the collision term of the kinetic
equation derived coincides with that by Chavanis ({\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 64},
026309 (2001)). Furthermore, we derive a kinetic equation corresponding to the
Balescu-Lenard equation for plasmas, using the theory of the Fredholm integral
equation. For large $N$, this kinetic equation is reduced to the Landau
equation above.
