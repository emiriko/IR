It is shown that a new type of metamaterial, a 3D-array of toroidal
solenoids, displays a significant toroidal response that can be readily
measured. This is in sharp contrast to materials that exist in nature, where
the toroidal component is weak and hardly measurable. The existence of an
optimal configuration, maximizing the interaction with an external
electromagnetic field, is demonstrated. In addition, it is found that a
characteristic feature of the magnetic toroidal response is its strong
dependence on the background dielectric permittivity of the host material,
which suggests possible applications. Negative refraction and backward waves
exist in a composite toroidal metamaterial, consisting of an array of wires and
an array of toroidal solenoids.
