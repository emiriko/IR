Recent developments in the measurement of precision electroweak measurements
are summarised, notably new results on the mass of the top quark and mass and
width of the W boson. Predictions of the Standard Model are compared to the
experimental results which are used to constrain the input parameters of the
Standard Model, in particular the mass of the Higgs boson. The agreement
between measurements and expectations from theory is discussed.
