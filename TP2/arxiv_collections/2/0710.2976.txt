An alternative version of Hamiltonian formalism for higher-derivative
theories is presented. It is related to the standard Ostrogradski approach by a
canonical transformation. The advantage of the approach presented is that the
Lagrangian is nonsingular and the Legendre transformation is performed in a
straightforward way.
