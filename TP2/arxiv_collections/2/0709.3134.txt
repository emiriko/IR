We analyze the relevance of finite-size effects to the electronic structure
of long graphene nanoribbons using a divide and conquer density functional
approach. We find that for hydrogen terminated graphene nanoribbons most of the
physical features appearing in the density of states of an infinite graphene
nanoribbon are recovered at a length of 40 nm. Nevertheless, even for the
longest systems considered (72 nm long) pronounced edge effects appear in the
vicinity of the Fermi energy. The weight of these edge states scales inversely
with the length of the ribbon and they are expected to become negligible only
at ribbons lengths of the order of micrometers. Our results indicate that
careful consideration of finite-size and edge effects should be applied when
designing new nanoelectronic devices based on graphene nanoribbons. These
conclusions are expected to hold for other one-dimensional systems such as
carbon nanotubes, conducting polymers, and DNA molecules.
