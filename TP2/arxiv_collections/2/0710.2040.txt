We study some rare B decays induced by $b \to s$ transition within the
Standard Model and in the Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu model, which is a New
Physics scenario with a single universal extra dimension. In particular, we
discuss the dependence on the radius $R$ of the compactified extra-dimension of
the branching ratio, the forward-backward asymmetry and the $K^*$ helicity
distributions for the decay modes $B \to K^* \ell^+ \ell^-$, with
$\ell^-=e^-,\mu^-$, and the tau polarization asymmetries for the mode $B \to
K^* \tau^+ \tau^-$.
