We present theoretical and experimental studies of the optical response of
L-shaped silver nanoparticles. The scattering spectrum exhibits several plasmon
resonances that depend sensitively on the polarization of the incident
electromagnetic field. The physical origin of the resonances is traced to
different plasmon phenomena. In particular, a high energy band with unusual
properties is interpreted in terms of volume plasmon oscillations arising from
the asymmetry of a nanoparticle.
