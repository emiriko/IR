Quantum fluctuation of the energy is studied for an ultracold gas of
interacting fermions trapped in a three-dimensional potential. Periodic-orbit
theory is explored, and energy fluctuations are studied versus particle number
for generic regular and chaotic systems, as well for a system defined by a
harmonic confinement potential. Temperature effects on the energy fluctuations
are investigated.
