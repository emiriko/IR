We study the transport properties of a neutral graphene sheet with curved
regions induced or stabilized by topological defects. The proposed model gives
rise to Dirac fermions in a random magnetic field and in the random space
dependent Fermi velocity induced by the curvature. This last term leads to
singular long range correlated disorder with special characteristics. The Drude
minimal conductivity at zero energy is found to be inversely proportional to
the density of topological disorder, a signature of diffusive behavior.
