A QCD analysis of the nuclear parton distributions and structure functions in
the NLO is performed by using the world data. By having bounded parton
distributions for a nuclear with atomic number A, we can obtain the nuclear
structure function in x space. Our results for nuclear structure function ratio
$F^A_2 /F^D_2$ for some different values of A, are in good agreement with the
experimental data. We compare our results for LO and NLO approximation.
