We calculate the effect of order parameter fluctuations on the fermionic
single-particle excitations in the superfluid state of neutral fermions
interacting with short range attractive forces. We show that in dimensions D
\leq 3 the singular effective interaction between the fermions mediated by the
gapless Bogoliubov-Anderson mode prohibits the existence of well-defined
quasi-particles. We explicitly calculate the single-particle spectral function
in the BEC regime in D=3 and show that in this case the quasi-particle residue
and the density of states are logarithmically suppressed.
