Asymptotic safety is a set of conditions, based on the existence of a
nontrivial fixed point for the renormalization group flow, which would make a
quantum field theory consistent up to arbitrarily high energies. After
introducing the basic ideas of this approach, I review the present evidence in
favor of an asymptotically safe quantum field theory of gravity.
