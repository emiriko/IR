We show that the inclusion of counter rotating terms, usually dropped, in the
interaction Hamiltonian of the electric dipole of a two level atom with an
electromagnetic field leads to significant modification of the splitting of an
atomic beam known as Optical Stern Gerlach Effect which now acquires a fine
structure.
