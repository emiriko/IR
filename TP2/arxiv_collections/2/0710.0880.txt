We report the first calculations of nuclear properties near the drip-lines
using the spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field theory with a
finite-range force supplemented by continuum and particle number projection
effects. Calculations were carried out in a basis made of the eigenstates of a
Woods-Saxon potential computed in a box, thereby garanteeing that continuum
effects were properly taken into account. Projection of the self-consistent
solutions on good particle number was carried out after variation, and an
approximation of the variation after projection result was used. We give the
position of the drip-lines and examine neutron densities in neutron-rich
nuclei. We discuss the sensitivity of nuclear observables upon continuum and
particle-number restoration effects.
