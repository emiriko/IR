We present results for the couplings of light vector mesons to vector and
tensor currents and on the low moments of the light-cone distribution
amplitudes of the pion and kaon. The calculations are performed on the RBC and
UKQCD collaborations' ensembles generated with the Iwasaki gauge action and
with 2+1 flavours of domain wall fermions. The (preliminary) results for the
ratios of the couplings of the vector meson to the vector and tensor currents
(f_V and f^T_V respectively) in the MSbar scheme at 2GeV are:
f_\rho^T/f_\rho=0.681(20); f_{K^\ast}^T/f_{K^\ast}=0.712(11) and
f_\phi^T/f_\phi=0.751(9). For the first moment of the kaon's distribution
amplitude we find (in the same scheme and at the same scale) <xi>_K=0.029(2)
and for the second moment <xi^2>_\pi=0.28(3) and <xi^2>_K=0.27(2).
