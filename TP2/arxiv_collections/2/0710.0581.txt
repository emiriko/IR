We explore in detail the effective matter fermion mass sum-rules in a class
of renormalizable SUSY SO(10) grand unified models where the quark and lepton
mass and mixing patterns originate from non-decoupling effects of an extra
vector matter multiplet living around the unification scale. If the
renormalizable type-II contribution governed by the SU(2)_L-triplet in 54_H
dominates the seesaw formula, we obtain an interesting correlation between the
maximality of the atmospheric neutrino mixing and the proximity of y_s/y_b to
V_cb in the quark sector.
