I discuss the relation between the nuclear response and the Green function
describing the propagation of a nucleon in the nuclear medium. Within this
formalism, the widely used expressions in terms of spectral functions can be
derived in a consistent and rigorous fashion. The results of recent
applications to the study of the inclusive electron-nucleus cross section in
the impulse approximation regime are brielfy analyzed.
