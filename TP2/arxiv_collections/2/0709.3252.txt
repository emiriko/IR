We calculate the Born order cross-section for the exclusive production of rho
meson pairs in e+e- scattering in the Regge limit of QCD and we show the
feasibility of the measurement of this process at the ILC. We also investigate
the leading and next-to-leading order BFKL evolution, making this process a
very clean test of the BFKL resummation effects.
