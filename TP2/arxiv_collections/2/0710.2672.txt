We calculate the double spin asymmetry A_LL(x, y, z, P_hT) of pi^0 production
with the spectator model and the model based on the factorization ansatz. We
also calculate the double spin asymmetry for the integration over the range of
(x,y,z) for the setups of the experiments of COMPASS, HERMES, and JLab. We find
that the results are characteristically dependent on the model used. Therefore,
we suggest that the measurements of the double spin asymmetry provides a method
of experimentally probing the transeverse momentum dependent distributions.
