Here we propose a method, based on detrended covariance which we call
detrended cross-correlation analysis (DXA), to investigate power-law
cross-correlations between different simultaneously-recorded time series in the
presence of non-stationarity. We illustrate the method by selected examples
from physics, physiology, and finance.
