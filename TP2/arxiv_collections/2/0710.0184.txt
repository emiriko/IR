The scaling behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent near the transition to chaos
via type-III intermittency is determined for a generic map. A critical exponent
$\beta$ expressing the scaling of the Lyapunov exponent as a function of both,
the reinjection probability and the nonlinearity of the map is calculated. It
is found that the critical exponent varies on the interval $0 < \beta < 1$.
This contrasts with earlier predictions for the scaling behaviour of the
Lyapunov exponent in type-III intermittency.
