We analyze the difference in the local distinguishability among the following
three restrictions; (i) Local operations and only one-way classical
communications (one-way LOCC) are permitted. (ii) Local operations and two-way
classical communications (two-way LOCC) are permitted. (iii) All separable
operations are permitted. We obtain two main results concerning the
discrimination between a given bipartite pure state and the completely mixed
state with the condition that the given state should be detected perfectly. As
the first result, we derive the optimal discrimination protocol for a bipartite
pure state in the cases (i) and (iii). As the second result, by constructing a
concrete two-way local discrimination protocol, it is proven that the case (ii)
is much better than the case (i), i.e., two-way classical communication
remarkably improves the local distinguishability in comparison with one-way
classical communication at least for a low-dimensional bipartite pure state.
