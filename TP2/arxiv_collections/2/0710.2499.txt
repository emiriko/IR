We calculate the spectrum of collective excitations of the XY spiral state
prepared adiabatically or suddenly from a uniform ferromagnetic F=1 condensate.
For spiral wavevectors past a critical value, spin wave excitation energies
become imaginary indicating a dynamical instability. We construct phase
diagrams as functions of spiral wavevector and quadratic Zeeman energy.
