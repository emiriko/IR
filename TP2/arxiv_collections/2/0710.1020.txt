A novel approach has been developed to calculate the temperature dependence
of the optical response of a semiconductor. The dielectric function is averaged
over several thermally perturbed configurations that are extracted from
molecular dynamic simulations. The calculated temperature dependence of the
imaginary part of the dielectric function of GaAs is presented in the range
from 0 to 700 K. This approach that explicitly takes into account lattice
vibrations describes well the observed thermally-induced energy shifts and
broadening of the dielectric function.
