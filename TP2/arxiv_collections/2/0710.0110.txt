Efficient control of spin squeezing in a two-component Bose-Einstein
Condensate is studied by rapidly turning-off the external field at a time that
maximal spin squeezing appears. We show that strong reduction of spin
fluctuation can be maintained in a nearly fixed direction for a long time. We
explain the underlying physics unambiguously, and present analytical
expressions of the maximal-squeezing time.
