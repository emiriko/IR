Strong deformation potential (DP) dominated Raman spectra are reported for
quantum confined cubic ZnS nanoclusters under off-resonance conditions allowed
only in quantum dots. A flurry of zone boundary phonons is demonstrated in the
scattering process. Transverse optic (TO) mode in the multi-phonon process
shows only even order overtones suggesting the dominance of a two-phonon
process (having large DP value in ZnS) and its integral multiples. Two-phonon
TO modes corresponding to A1 and B2 symmetries are also demonstrated under
off-resonance conditions which are allowed only in quantum dots.
