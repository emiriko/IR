We investigate numerically various properties of the one-dimensional (1D)
breathing-mode polaron. We use an extension of a variational scheme to compute
the energies and wave-functions of the two lowest-energy eigenstates for any
momentum, as well as a scheme to compute directly the polaron Greens function.
We contrast these results with results for the 1D Holstein polaron. In
particular, we find that the crossover from a large to a small polaron is
significantly sharper. Unlike for the Holstein model, at moderate and large
couplings the breathing-mode polaron dispersion has non-monotonic dependence on
the polaron momentum k. Neither of these aspects is revealed by a previous
study based on the self-consistent Born approximation.
