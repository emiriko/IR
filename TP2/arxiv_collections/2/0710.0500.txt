An algebra previously proposed as an asymptotic field structure in
electrodynamics is considered in respect of localization properties of fields.
Fields are 'spatially local' -- localized in regions resulting as unions of two
intersecting (solid) lightcones: a future- and a past-lightcone. This
localization remains in concord with the usual idealizations connected with the
scattering theory. Fields thus localized naturally include infrared
characteristics normally placed at spacelike infinity and form a structure
respecting Gauss law. When applied to the description of the radiation of an
external classical current the model is free of 'infrared catastrophe'.
