We perform a systematic study of sneutrino production and decays in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with slepton generation mixing. We
study both fermionic decays like sneutrino \to l^- chargino^+, nu neutralino
and bosonic decays such as sneutrino \to slepton^- H^+, slepton^- W^+. We show
that the effect of slepton generation mixing on the sneutrino production cross
sections and its decay branching ratios can be quite large in a significant
part of the MSSM parameter space despite the very strong experimental limits on
lepton flavour violating processes. This could have an important impact on the
search for sneutrinos and the determination of the MSSM parameters at future
colliders, such as LHC, ILC, CLIC and muon collider.
