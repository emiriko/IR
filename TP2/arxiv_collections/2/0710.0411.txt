The Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons extension of electrodynamics is
considered. In the context of N=4 supergravity in four spacetime dimensions, it
is argued that cosmological solutions can generate this extension. Within
Chern-Simons electrodynamics, theoretical and phenomenological topics are
reviewed that concern the number of the remaining spacetime symmetries and the
vacuum Cherenkov effect, respectively.
