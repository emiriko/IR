We study the transfer matrix for domain wall fermions to understand the
origin and significance of oscillatory contributions to hadron correlation
functions that arise for M >1. For a free particle in one space, one time, and
one flavor dimension, the eigenmodes of the one-body operator appearing in the
transfer matrix are calculated, and the role of the negative eigenmodes arising
when M > 1 is studied. In the case of three space dimensions, oscillatory
behavior for hadron correlation functions in QCD is shown to emerge for free
fermions when M exceeds 1, and to increase with increasing M. Analogous
behavior is observed for domain wall fermions on HYP smeared MILC lattices, and
a procedure is demonstrated for subtracting oscillating terms from physical
observables.
