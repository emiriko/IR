On the basis of the confinement mechanism earlier proposed by author, the
electric form factor of $\eta$-meson is nonperturbatively calculated. The
latter is then applied to describe electromagnetic decay $\eta\to2\gamma$ which
entails estimates for parameters of the confining SU(3)-gluonic field in
$\eta$-meson. The corresponding estimates of the gluon concentrations, electric
and magnetic colour field strengths are also adduced for the mentioned field.
