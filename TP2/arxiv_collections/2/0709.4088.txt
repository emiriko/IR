Recently, several experiments were reported using ambient vibration surveys
in buildings to estimate the modal parameters of buildings. Their modal
properties are full of relevant information concerning its dynamic behaviour in
its elastic domain. The main scope of this paper is to determine relevant,
though simple, beam modelling whose validity could be easily checked with
experimental data. In this study, we recorded ambient vibrations in 3 buildings
in Grenoble selected because of their vertical structural homogeneity. First, a
set of recordings was done using a 18 channels digital acquisition system
(CityShark) connected to six 3C Lennartz 5s sensors. We used the Frequency
Domain Decomposition (FDD) technique to extract the modal parameters of these
buildings. Second, it is shown in the following that the experimental
quasi-elastic behaviour of such structure can be reduced to the behaviour of a
vertical continuous Timoshenko beam. A parametric study of this beam shows that
a bijective relation exists between the beam parameters and its
eigenfrequencies distribution. Consequently, the Timoshenko beam parameters can
be estimated from the experimental sequence of eigenfrequencies. Having the
beam parameters calibrated by the in situ data, the reliability of the
modelling is checked by complementary comparisons. For this purpose, the mode
shapes and eigenfrequencies of higher modes are calculated and compared to the
experimental data. A good agreement is also obtained. In addition, the beam
model integrates in a very synthetic way the essential parameters of the
dynamic behaviour.
