We present a detailed phenomenological study of the prospects of open charm
physics at the future $\bar{p}p$ and $pp$ facilities GSI-FAIR and J-PARC,
respectively. In particular, we concentrate on differential cross sections and
the charge and longitudinal double-spin asymmetries at next-to-leading order
accuracy. Theoretical uncertainties for the proposed observables are estimated
by varying the charm quark mass and the renormalization and factorization
scales.
