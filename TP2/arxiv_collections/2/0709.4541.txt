Gravitational collapse in (n+2) dimensional quasi-spherical space-time is
studied for a fluid with non vanishing radial pressure. An exact analytic
solution is obtained (ignoring the arbitrary integration function) for the
equation of state $p_{r}=(\gamma-1)\rho.$ The singularity is studied locally by
comparing the time of formation of apparent horizon and the central shell
focusing singularity while the global nature of the final fate of collapse is
characterized by the existence of radial null geodesic. It is revealed that the
end state of collapse for D dimension with equation of state $p=-\rho$, for
(D$-$1) dimensional dust and (D$-$2)dimension with equation of state $p=\rho$
are identical.
