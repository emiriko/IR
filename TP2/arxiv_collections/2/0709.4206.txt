The identification of genes essential for survival is important for the
understanding of the minimal requirements for cellular life and for drug
design. As experimental studies with the purpose of building a catalog of
essential genes for a given organism are time-consuming and laborious, a
computational approach which could predict gene essentiality with high accuracy
would be of great value. We present here a novel computational approach, called
NTPGE (Network Topology-based Prediction of Gene Essentiality), that relies on
network topology features of a gene to estimate its essentiality. The first
step of NTPGE is to construct the integrated molecular network for a given
organism comprising protein physical, metabolic and transcriptional regulation
interactions. The second step consists in training a decision tree-based
machine learning algorithm on known essential and non-essential genes of the
organism of interest, considering as learning attributes the network topology
information for each of these genes. Finally, the decision tree classifier
generated is applied to the set of genes of this organism to estimate
essentiality for each gene. We applied the NTPGE approach for discovering
essential genes in Escherichia coli and then assessed its performance.
