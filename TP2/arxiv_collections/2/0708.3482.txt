We propose a scheme for using a spin chain with fixed symmetry interaction as
a channel for perfect quantum communication. The perfect quantum communication
is determined by the eigenvalues that form a special arithmetical progression,
the concrete interaction parameter $J_i$ is obtained as a function of integer
and perfect transmission time $t_p$. There are infinite choices of $J_i$ for
perfect transmission and one can design the channel according to the
requirement of $t_p$. This scheme will provide more choices of spin chain for
future experiment in quantum communication.
