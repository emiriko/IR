We report on a detailed analysis of a SO(10) SUSY GUT model of Dermisek and
Raby (DR) with a D3 family symmetry. The model is completely specified in terms
of only 24 parameters and is able to successfully describe both quark and
lepton masses and mixings, except for |Vub| that turns out to be too low.
However, a global fit shows that flavor changing (FC) processes like Bs --> mu+
mu-, Bs-mixing, B+ --> tau+ nu, B --> Xs gamma and B --> Xs l+ l- pose a
serious problem to the DR model. The simultaneous description of these FC
processes forces squarks to have masses well above 1 TeV, not appealing on
grounds of naturalness and probably beyond the reach of the LHC.
