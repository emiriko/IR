This is the second paper concerning gauge-invariant coherent states for Loop
Quantum Gravity. Here, we deal with the gauge group SU(2), this being a
significant complication compared to the abelian U(1) case encountered in the
previous article. We study gauge-invariant coherent states on certain special
graphs by analytical and numerical methods. We find that their overlap is
Gauss-peaked in gauge-invariant quantities, as long as states are not labeled
by degenerate gauge orbits, i.e. points where the gauge-invariant configuration
space has singularities. In these cases the overlaps are still concentrated
around these points, but the peak profile exhibits a plateau structure. This
shows how the semiclassical properties of the states are influenced by the
geometry of the gauge-invariant phase space.
