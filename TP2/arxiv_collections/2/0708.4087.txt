We compute the two-loop renormalization functions, in the RI' scheme, of
local bilinear quark operators $\bar\psi\Gamma\psi$, where $\Gamma$ denotes the
Scalar and Pseudoscalar Dirac matrices, in the lattice formulation of QCD. We
consider both the flavor non-singlet and singlet operators; the latter, in the
scalar case, leads directly to the two-loop fermion mass renormalization,
$Z_m$.
  As a prerequisite for the above, we also compute the quark field
renormalization, $Z_\psi$, up to two loops.
  We use the clover action for fermions and the Wilson action for gluons. Our
results are given as a polynomial in $c_{SW}$, in terms of both the
renormalized and bare coupling constant, in the renormalized Feynman gauge. We
also confirm the 1-loop renormalization functions, for generic gauge.
  A longer write-up of the present work, including the conversion of our
results to the MSbar scheme and a generalization to arbitrary fermion
representations, can be found in arXiv:0707.2906 .
