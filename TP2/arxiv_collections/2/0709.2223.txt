The field and temperature dependence of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations
spectrum is studied for an ideal two-dimensional compensated metal. It is shown
that the chemical potential oscillations, involved in the frequency
combinations observed in the case of uncompensated orbits, are strongly damped
and can even be suppressed when the effective masses of the electron- and
hole-type orbits are the same. When magnetic breakdown between bands occurs,
this damping is even more pronounced and the Lifshits-Kosevich formalism
accounts for the data in a wide field range.
