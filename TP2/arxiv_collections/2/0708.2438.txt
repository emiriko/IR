Both in the plane and in space, we invert the nonlinear Ullman transformation
for 3 points and 3 orthographic cameras. While Ullman's theorem assures a
unique reconstruction modulo a reflection for 3 cameras and 4 points, we find a
locally unique reconstruction for 3 cameras and 3 points. Explicit
reconstruction formulas allow to decide whether picture data of three cameras
seeing three points can be realized as a point-camera configuration.
