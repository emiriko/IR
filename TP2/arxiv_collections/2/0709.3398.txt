We develop general formalism of how to relate cross-section for exclusive
processes to spatial image of reaction area. More precisely we show how to
determine the spatial distribution of outgoing particles in the space of
so-called nearest approach parameter. This parameter characterizes the position
in the coordinate space the place where the final particle is produced.
