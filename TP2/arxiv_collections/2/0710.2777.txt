We consider two-mode squeezed states which are parametrized by the squeezing
parameter and the phase. We present a scheme for teleporting such entangled
states of continuous variables from Alice to Bob. Our protocol is
operationalized through the creation of a four-mode entangled state shared by
Alice and Bob using linear amplifiers and beam splitters. Teleportation of the
entangled state proceeds with local operations and the classical communication
of four bits. We compute the fidelity of teleportation and find that it
exhibits a trade-off with the magnitude of entanglement of the resultant
teleported state.
