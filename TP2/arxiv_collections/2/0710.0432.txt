In the Hopf algebra approach of Connes and Kreimer on renormalization of
quantum field theory, the renormalization process is views as a special case of
the Algebraic Birkhoff Decomposition. We give a differential algebra variation
of this decomposition and apply this to the study of multiple zeta values.
