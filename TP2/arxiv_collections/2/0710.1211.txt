The BaBar and Belle collaborations have recently found evidence for mixing
within the D meson system. We present some of the mixing search techniques used
by BaBar and their status as of the beginning of the summer 2007. These have
culminated in a measurement in the K decay final state of the D that is
inconsistent with the no-mixing hypothesis with a significance of 3.9 standard
deviations.
