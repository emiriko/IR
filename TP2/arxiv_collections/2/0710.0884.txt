We report on the basic properties of recently observed magnetic field
resonance, induced time dependent oscillation, and hysteresis effects in the
current flowing through two weakly coupled vertical quantum dots at high
source-drain bias (up to a few tens of mV). These effects bare some similarity
to those reported in the N=2 spin-blockade regime, usually for weak in-plane
magnetic field, of quantum dot molecules and attributed to hyperfine coupling,
except here the measurements are conducted outside of the spin-blockade regime
and the out-of-plane magnetic field is up to ~6 T.
