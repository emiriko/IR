The status of two Monte Carlo generators, HELAC-PHEGAS, a program for
multi-jet processes and VBFNLO, a parton level program for vector boson fusion
processes at NLO QCD, is briefly presented. The aim of these tools is the
simulation of events within the Standard Model at current and future high
energy experiments, in particular the LHC. Some results related to the
production of multi-jet final states at the LHC are also shown.
