We summarize recent data on 4-body charm semileptonic decay concentrating on
\kklndk{} and \kpilndk{}. We begin with giving some motivation for the study of
these decays. We discuss several of the models traditionally used to describe
these decays and conclude by presenting a non-parametric analysis of \kpiendk{}
and its possible extension into non-parametric studies of \kpimndk{}.
