We study two general approaches how to describe spin one particles, using
vector and antisymmetric tensor fields within RChT. In this paper we focus on
the question of an equivalence of both ways. The appearing problems lead us to
the introduction of a new type of the description - the first order formalism
which naturally connects both traditional formalisms. Moreover, it gives a more
general result on the level of the effective chiral Lagrangian that contain all
terms from effective chiral Lagrangians in vector and antisymmetric tensor
formulations.
