We study the dynamics of parallel tempering simulations, also known as the
replica exchange technique, which has become the method of choice for
simulation of proteins and other complex systems. Recent results for the
optimal choice of the control parameter discretization allow a treatment
independent of the system in question. Analyzing mean first passage times
across control parameter space, we find an expression for the optimal number of
replicas in simulations covering a given temperature range. Our results suggest
a particular protocol to optimize the number of replicas in actual simulations.
