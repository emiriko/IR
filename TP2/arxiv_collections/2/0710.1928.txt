We describe an entanglement witness for $N$-qubit mixed states based on the
properties of $N$-point correlation functions. Depending on the degree of
violation, this witness can guarantee that no more than $M$ qubits are
separable from the rest of the state for any $M\leq N$, or that there is some
genuine $M$-party or greater multipartite entanglement present. We illustrate
the use our criterion by investigating the existence of entanglement in thermal
stabilizer states, where we demonstrate that the witness is capable of
witnessing bound-entangled states. Intriguingly, this entanglement can be shown
to persist in the thermodynamic limit at arbitrary temperature.
