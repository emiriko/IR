We consider the sl(3,C) affine Toda model coupled to matter (Dirac spinor)
(ATM) and through a gauge fixing procedure we obtain the classical version of
the generalized sl(3,C) sine-Gordon model (cGSG) which completely decouples
from the Dirac spinors. The GSG models are multifield extensions of the
ordinary sine-Gordon model. In the spinor sector we are left with Dirac fields
coupled to cGSG fields. Based on the equivalence between the U(1) vector and
topological currents, which holds in the theory, it is shown the confinement of
the spinors inside the solitons and kinks of the cGSG model providing an
extended hadron model for "quark" confinement [JHEP0701(2007)027]. Moreover,
the solitons and kinks of the generalized sine-Gordon (GSG) model are shown to
describe the normal and exotic baryon spectrum of two-dimensional QCD. The GSG
model arises in the low-energy effective action of bosonized QCD2 with unequal
quark mass parameters [JHEP0703(2007)055]. The GSG potential for three flavors
resembles the potential of the effective chiral lagrangian proposed by Witten
to describe low-energy behavior of four dimensional QCD. Among the attractive
features of the GSG model are the variety of soliton and kink type solutions
for QCD2 unequal quark mass parameters. Exotic baryons in QCD2 [ Ellis and
Frishman, JHEP0508(2005)081] are discussed in the context of the GSG model.
Various semi-classical computations are performed improving previous results
and clarifying the role of unequal quark masses. The remarkable double sine
Gordon model also arises as a reduced GSG model bearing a kink(K) type solution
describing a multi-baryon.
