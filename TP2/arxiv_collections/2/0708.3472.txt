We study the distributions of event-time returns and clock-time returns at
different microscopic timescales using ultra-high-frequency data extracted from
the limit-order books of 23 stocks traded in the Chinese stock market in 2003.
We find that the returns at the one-trade timescale obey the inverse cubic law.
For larger timescales (2-32 trades and 1-5 minutes), the returns follow the
Student distribution with power-law tails. With the decrease of timescale, the
tail becomes fatter, which is consistent with the vibrational theory.
