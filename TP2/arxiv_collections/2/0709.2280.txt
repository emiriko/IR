We report new experiments on polarization squeezing using ultrashort photonic
pulses in a single pass of a birefringent fiber. We measure what is to our
knowledge a record squeezing of -6.8 +/- 0.3 dB in optical fibers which when
corrected for linear losses is -10.4 +/- 0.8 dB. The measured polarization
squeezing as a function of optical pulse energy, which spans a wide range from
3.5-178.8 pJ, shows a very good agreement with the quantum simulations and for
the first time we see the experimental proof that Raman effects limit and
reduce squeezing at high pulse energy.
