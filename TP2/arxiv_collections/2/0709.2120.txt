The magnetic stray field from Fe gates is used to modify the spin precession
frequency of InGaAs/GaAs quantum-well electrons in an external magnetic field.
By using an etching process to position the gates directly in the plane of the
quantum well, the stray-field influence on the spin precession increases
significantly compared with results from previous studies with top-gated
structures. In line with numerical simulations, the stray-field-induced
precession frequency increases as the gap between the ferromagnetic gates is
reduced. The inhomogeneous stray field leads to additional spin dephasing.
