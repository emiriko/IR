The strategy for track based alignment of the CMS tracking and muon detectors
is presented. After an overview over the used data samples, the general
alignment strategy is presented, with a focus of the procedures envisaged at
the start of data taking in 2008. The three currently used alignment algorithms
are discussed and first results on their application to the CMS tracker are
presented, as well as studies on the alignment of the Muon detector with
tracks.
