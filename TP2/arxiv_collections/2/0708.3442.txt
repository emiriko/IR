This article provides a complete description of the differential Gerstenhaber
algebras of all nilpotent complex structures on any real six-dimensional
nilpotent algebra. As an application, we classify all pseudo-K\"ahlerian
complex structures on six-dimensional nilpotent algebras such that the
differential Gerstenhaber algebra of its complex structure is quasi-isomorphic
to that of its symplectic structure. In a weak sense of mirror symmetry, it is
a classification of pseudo-K\"ahler structures on six-dimensional nilpotent
algebras whose mirror images are themselves.
