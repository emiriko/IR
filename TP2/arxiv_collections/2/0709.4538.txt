We investigate exact solution in higher dimensional Husain model for a null
fluid source with pressure $p$ and density $\rho$ are related by the following
relations (i) $p=k\rho$, (ii) $p=k\rho-\frac{B(v)}{\rho^{\alpha}}$ (variable
modified Chaplygin) and (iii) $p=k\rho^{\alpha}$ (polytropic). We have studied
the nature of singularity in gravitational collapse for the above equations of
state and also for different choices of the of the parameters $k$ and $B$
namely, (i) $k=0$, $B=$ constant (generalized Chaplygin), (ii) $B=$ constant
(modified Chaplygin). It is found that the nature of singularity is independent
of these choices of different equation of state except for variable Chaplygin
model. Choices of various parameters are shown in tabular form. Finally,
matching of Szekeres model with exterior Husain space-time is done.
