We examine the phenomenon of {\it entanglement sudden death} (ESD) for $(2
\times 3)$-dimensional systems. As for $2 \times 2$ systems, the negativity
vanishes in finite time for some entangled pure as well as mixed states. While
locally equivalent pure states do so asymptotically. Interference between the
decay of the two upper levels to the lowest one in the qutrit adds further
richness to ESD in this systems.
