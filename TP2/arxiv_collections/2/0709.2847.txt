Dependence of frequency spectra of the lattice oscillations of organic
nano-crystals on temperature is studied at presence of vacancies in structure.
In a frequency spectrum a number of additional lines monotonously changing with
temperature is observed. Also, the spectrum of the surface oscillations is
calculated at temperature change. At the same time, the low-frequency line has
non-linear behavior with temperature change.
