Emissions of free neutrons and protons from the central collisions of
124Sn+124Sn and 112Sn+112Sn reactions are simulated using the Improved Quantum
Molecular Dynamics model with two different density dependence of the symmetry
energy in the nuclear equation of state. The constructed double ratios of the
neutron to proton ratios of the two reaction systems are found to be sensitive
to the symmetry terms in the EOS. The effect of cluster formation is examined
and found to affect the double ratios mainly in the low energy region. In order
to extract better information on symmetry energy with transport models, it is
therefore important to have accurate data in the high energy region which also
is affected minimally by sequential decays.
