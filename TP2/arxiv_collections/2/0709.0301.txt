We show that the geometry of the set of quantum states plays a crucial role
in the behavior of entanglement in different physical systems. More
specifically it is shown that singular points at the border of the set of
unentangled states appear as singularities in the dynamics of entanglement of
smoothly varying quantum states. We illustrate this result by implementing a
photonic parametric down conversion experiment. Moreover, this effect is
connected to recently discovered singularities in condensed matter models.
