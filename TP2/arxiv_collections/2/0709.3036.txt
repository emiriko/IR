This paper presents the current achievements of a long term project aiming at
predicting and assessing the impact of tongue and mouth floor surgery on tongue
mobility. The ultimate objective of this project is the design of a software
with which surgeons should be able (1) to design a 3D biomechanical model of
the tongue and of the mouth floor that matches the anatomical characteristics
of each patient specific oral cavity, (2) to simulate the anatomical changes
induced by the surgery and the possible reconstruction, and (3) to
quantitatively predict and assess the consequences of these anatomical changes
on tongue mobility and speech production after surgery.
