The ground state and finite temperature properties of polarons are studied
considering a two-site and a four-site Holstein model by exact diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian. The kinetic energy, Drude weight, correlation functions
involving charge and lattice deformations, and the specific heat have been
evaluated as a function of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling strength and
temperature. The effects of site diagonal disorder on the above properties have
been investigated. The disorder is found to suppress the kinetic energy and the
Drude weight, reduces the spatial extension of the polaron, and makes the
large-to-small polaron crossover smoother. Increasing temperature also plays
similar role. For strong coupling the kinetic energy arises mainly from the
incoherent hopping processes owing to the motion of electrons within the
polaron and is almost independent of the disorder strength. From the coherent
and incoherent contributions to the kinetic energy, the temperature above which
the incoherent part dominates is determined as a function of e-ph coupling
strength.
