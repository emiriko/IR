On the basis of angular spectrum representation, the reversed propagation
dynamics of Laguerre-Gaussian beam in left-handed materials (LHMs) is
presented. We show that negative phase velocity gives rise to a reversed screw
of wave-front, and ultimately leads to a reversed rotation of optical vortex.
Furthermore, negative Gouy-phase shift causes an inverse spiral of Poynting
vector. It is found that the Laguerre-Gaussian beam in LHMs will present the
same propagation characteristics as the counterpart with opposite topological
charges in regular right-handed materials (RHMs). The momentum conservation
theorem insures that the tangential component of the wave momentum at the
RHM-LHM boundary is conserved. It is shown that although the linear momentum
reverses its direction, the angular momentum remains unchanged.
