We review the application and successes of a phase-space coalescence plus
fragmentation model that has been applied for hadronization at RHIC. The
physical concept is discussed together with the practical implementation. The
robustness of main predictions is reviewed together with several open issues
like relevance of three dimensional calculation, finite width of the wave
functions, effects of quark masses, energy-entropy conservation, space-momentum
correlation. Eventually the relevance of coalescence also for the study of the
microscopic interaction of heavy quarks is highlighted.
