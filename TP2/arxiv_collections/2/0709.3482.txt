We report on a special type of solutions for the gluon propagator of pure
QCD, obtained from the corresponding non-linear Schwinger-Dyson equation
formulated in the Feynman gauge of the background field method. These solutions
reach a finite value in the deep infrared and may be fitted using a massive
propagator, with the crucial characteristic that the effective ``mass''
employed depends on the momentum transfer. Specifically, the gluon mass falls
off as the inverse square of the momentum, as expected from the
operator-product expansion. In addition, one may define a dimensionless
quantity, which constitutes the generalization in a non-Abelian context of the
universal QED effective charge. This strong effective charge displays
asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet whereas in the low-energy regime it
freezes at a finite value, giving rise to an infrared fixed point for QCD.
