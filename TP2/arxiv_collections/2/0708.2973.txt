We show that whenever data are gathered using a device that performs a
normalization-preprocessing, the ensuing normalized input, as recorded by the
measurement device, will always be q-Gaussian distributed if the incoming data
exhibit elliptical symmetry. As a consequence, great care should be exercised
when detecting q-Gaussians. As an example, Gaussian data will appear, after
normalization, in the guise of q-Gaussian records. Moreover, we show that the
value of the resulting parameter q can be deduced from the normalization
technique that characterizes the device.
