We consider cosmological implications of supersymmetric models with
right-handed (s)neutrinos where the neutrino masses are purely Dirac-type. We
pay particular attention to the case where gravitino is the lightest
superparticle while one of the right-handed sneutrinos is next-to-the-lightest
superparticle. We study constraints from big-bang nuleosynthesis and show that
the constraints could be relaxed compared to the case without right-handed
sneutrinos. As a result, the gravitino-dark-matter scenario becomes viable with
relatively large value of the gravitino mass. We also discuss constraints from
the structure formation; in our model, the free-streaming length of the
gravitino dark matter may be as long as O(1 Mpc), which is comparable to the
present observational upper bound on the scale of free-streaming.
