We present graphic results with high-levels of abstraction to desribe the
basic principles and rules of thumb for acoustic or phononic band-gap
engineering. We use these rules for developing an improved machien mount for
damping acoustic vibrations, a phononic lens and a frequency selective filter
in the acoustic regime.
