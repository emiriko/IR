We extend the shell model Monte Carlo approach to heavy deformed nuclei using
a new proton-neutron formalism. The low excitation energies of such nuclei
necessitate calculations at low temperatures for which a stabilization method
is implemented in the canonical ensemble. We apply the method to study a well
deformed rare-earth nucleus, 162Dy. The single-particle model space includes
the 50-82 shell plus 1f_{7/2} orbital for protons and the 82-126 shell plus
0h_{11/2}, 1g_{9/2} orbitals for neutrons. We show that the spherical shell
model reproduces well the rotational character of 162Dy within this model
space. We also calculate the level density of 162Dy and find it to be in
excellent agreement with the experimental level density, which we extract from
several experiments.
