Quantal systems are predicted to show a change-over from exponential decay to
power law decay at very long times. Although most theoretical studies predict
integer power-law exponents, recent measurements by Rothe et al. of decay
luminescence of organic molecules in solution {Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 (2006)
163601} found non-integer exponents in most cases. We propose a physical
mechanism, within the realm of scattering from potentials with long tails,
which produces a continuous range of power law exponents. In the tractable case
of the repulsive inverse square potential, we demonstrate a simple relation
between the strength of the long range tail and the power law exponent. This
system is amenable to experimental scrutiny.
