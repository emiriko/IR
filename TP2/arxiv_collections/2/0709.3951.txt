The concept of p-orthogonality (1=< p =< n) between n-particle states is
introduced. It generalizes common orthogonality, which is equivalent to
n-orthogonality, and strong orthogonality between fermionic states, which is
equivalent to 1-orthogonality. Within the class of non p-orthogonal states a
finer measure of non p-orthogonality is provided by Araki's angles between
p-internal spaces. The p-orthogonality concept is a geometric measure of
indistinguishability that is independent of the representation chosen for the
quantum states. It induces a new hierarchy of approximations for group function
methods. The simplifications that occur in the calculation of matrix elements
between p-orthogonal group functions are presented.
