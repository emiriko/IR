Graphs on surfaces is an active topic of pure mathematics belonging to graph
theory. It has also been applied to physics and relates discrete and continuous
mathematics. In this paper we present a formal mathematical description of the
relation between graph theory and the mathematical physics of discrete string
theory. In this description we present problems of the combinatorial world of
real importance for graph theorists. The mathematical details of the paper are
as follows: There is a combinatorial description of the partition function of
bosonic string theory. In this combinatorial description the string world sheet
is thought as simplicial and it is considered as a combinatorial graph. It can
also be said that we have embeddings of graphs in closed surfaces. The discrete
partition function which results from this procedure gives a sum over
triangulations of closed surfaces. This is known as the vacuum partition
function. The precise calculation of the partition function depends on
combinatorial calculations involving counting all non-isomorphic triangulations
and all spanning trees of a graph. The exact computation of the partition
function turns out to be very complicated, however we show the exact
expressions for its computation for the case of any closed orientable surface.
We present a clear computation for the sphere and the way it is done for the
torus, and for the non-orientable case of the projective plane.
