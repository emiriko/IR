In the weak coupling limit, we establish the phase diagram of a two-leg
ladder with a unit cell containing both Cu and O atoms, as a function of
doping. We use bosonization and design a specific RG procedure to handle the
additional degrees of freedom. Significant differences are found with the
single orbital case; for purely repulsive interactions, a completely massless
quantum critical region is obtained at intermediate carrier concentrations
(well inside the bands) where the ground state consists of an incommensurate
pattern of orbital currents plus a spin density wave (SDW) structure.
