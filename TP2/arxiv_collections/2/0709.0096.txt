We introduce the notion of magic functions of a general domain in
d-dimensional complex space and show that the set of magic functions of a given
domain is an intrinsic complex-geometric object. We determine the set of magic
functions of the symmetrised bidisc G, and thereby find all automorphisms of G
and a formula for the Caratheodory distance on G.
