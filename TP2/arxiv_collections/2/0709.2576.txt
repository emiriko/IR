Fixing the value of Avogadro's constant, the number of atoms in 12 grams of
carbon-12, at exactly 84446886^3 would imply that one gram is the mass of
exactly 18x14074481^3 carbon-12 atoms. This new definition of the gram, and
thereby also the kilogram, is precise, elegant and unchanging in time, unlike
the current 118-year-old artifact kilogram in Paris and the proposed
experimental definitions of the kilogram using man-made silicon spheres or the
watt balance apparatus.
