We have recently given a construction of the overlap Dirac operator at
nonzero quark chemical potential. Here, we introduce a quark chemical potential
in the domain-wall fermion formalism and show that our earlier result is
reproduced if the extent of the fifth dimension is taken to infinity and its
lattice spacing is taken to zero. We also extend this result to include a bare
quark mass, consider its continuum limit, and prove a number of properties of
the overlap operator at nonzero quark chemical potential. In particular, we
show that the relation between the anomaly and the index of the overlap
operator remains valid.
