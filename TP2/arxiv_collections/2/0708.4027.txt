The recent observation of Sigma_b^{+-} (uub and ddb) and Xi_b^- (dsb) baryons
at the Tevatron within 2 MeV of our theoretical predictions provides a strong
motivation for applying the same theoretical approach, based on modeling the
color hyperfine interaction, to predict the masses of other bottom baryons
which might be observed in the foreseeable future. For S-wave qqb states we
predict M(Omega_b) = 6052.1+-5.6 MeV, M(Omega^*_b) = 6082.8+-5.6 MeV, and
M(Xi_b^0) = 5786.7 +- 3.0 MeV. For states with one unit of orbital angular
momentum between the b quark and the two light quarks we predict
M(Lambda_{b[1/2]}) = 5929+-2 MeV, M(Lambda_{b[3/2]}) = 5940+-2 MeV,
M(Xi_{b[1/2]}) = 6106+-4 MeV, and M(Xi_{b[3/2]}) = 6115+-4 MeV.
