The thermodynamic properties of nuclei are studied in a mean field model
using a Skryme interaction. Properties of two component systems are
investigated over the complete range of proton fraction from a system of pure
neutrons to a system of only protons. Besides volume, symmetry, and Coulomb
effects we also include momentum or velocity dependent forces. Applications of
the results developed are then given which include nuclear mechanical and
chemical instability and an associated liquid/gas phase transition in two
component systems. The velocity dependence leads to further changes in the
coexistence curve and nuclear mechanical and chemical instability curves.
