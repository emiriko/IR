This article provides a concise review of selected topics in the many-body
physics of low density nuclear systems. The discussion includes the
condensation of alpha particles in supernova envelopes, formation of three-body
bound states and the BEC-BCS crossover in dilute nuclear matter, and neutrino
production in $S$-wave paired superfluid neutron matter.
