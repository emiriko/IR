Amplification of a single spin state using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
techniques in a rotating frame is considered. The main aim is to investigate
the efficient of various schemes for quantum detection. Results of numerical
simulation of the time dependence of individual and total nuclear polarizations
for one-, two-, and three-dimensional configurations of the spin systems are
presented.
