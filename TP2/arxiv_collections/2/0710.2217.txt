We report electronic Raman scattering measurements on optimally doped
YBa2Cu3O7 where Zn or Ni impurities have been substituted by Cu. Using Raman
selection rules, we have probed the superconducting gap in the nodal and
antinodal regions. We show that under impurity substitutions, the energy of the
antinodal peak detected in the superconducting state is not related to the
critical temperature Tc and that signatures of superconductivity disappear in
the nodal regions. Our experimental findings advocate in favor of gapless arcs
around the nodes. The breakdown of the relationship between the antinodal gap
amplitude and Tc is discussed in terms of local superconducting gap and
pseudogap.
