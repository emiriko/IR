We calculate the electroweak and QCD corrections to W-W+ -> tt and ZZ -> tt.
We also consider the interplay of these corrections with the effect of
anomalous interactions that affect the massive weak bosons and the top. The
results at the VV level fusion are convoluted with the help of the effective
vector boson approximation to give predictions for a high energy e+e- collider.
