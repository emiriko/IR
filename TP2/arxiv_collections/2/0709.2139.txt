The spectral functions for calcium and argon are constructed. It is verified
that their predictions for the quasielastic electron-nucleus cross sections in
the energy range ~1 GeV agree with the data. The argon spectral function is
then used to obtain the quasielastic neutrino-nucleus cross section.
