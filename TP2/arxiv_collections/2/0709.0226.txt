Combining Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) experiments and simulations, we
demonstrate low temperature imaging of electron probability density
$|\Psi|^{2}(x,y)$ in embedded mesoscopic quantum rings (QRs). The tip-induced
conductance modulations share the same temperature dependence as the
Aharonov-Bohm effect, indicating that they originate from electron wavefunction
interferences. Simulations of both $|\Psi|^{2}(x,y)$ and SGM conductance maps
reproduce the main experimental observations and link fringes in SGM images to
$|\Psi|^{2}(x,y)$.
