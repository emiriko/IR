We have used the Chiral-Quark Soliton Model formulated in the Infinite
Momentum Frame to investigate the octet, decuplet and antidecuplet tensor
charges up to the 5Q level. Using flavor SU(3) symmetry we have obtained for
the proton $\delta u=1.172$ and $\delta d=-0.315$ in fair agreement previous
model estimations. The 5Q allowed us to estimate also the strange contribution
to the proton tensor charge $\delta s=-0.011$. All those values have been
obtained at the model scale Q^2=0.36 GeV^2.
