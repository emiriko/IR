The RHIC experiments have measured the nuclear modification factor R_AA of
non-photonic electrons in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. This R_AA
exhibits a large suppression for pt > 2 GeV/c which is commonly attributed to
heavy-quark energy loss. It is expected that the heavy-quark radiative energy
loss is smaller than the light quark one because of the so-called dead-cone
effect. An enhancement of the charm baryon yield with respect to the charm
meson yield, as it is observed for light and strange hadrons, can explain part
of the suppression. This phenomenon has been put forward in a previous work. We
present in this paper a more complete study based on a detailed simulation
which includes electrons from charm and bottom decay, charm and bottom quark
realistic energy loss as well as a more realistic modeling of the Lambda_c/D
enhancement. We show that a Lambda_c/D ratio close to unity, as observed for
light and strange quarks, could explain 20-25% of the suppression of
non-photonic electrons in central Au+Au collisions. This effect remains
significant at relatively high non-photonic electron transverse momenta of 8-9
GeV/c.
