Effective coupling constant in quantum electrodynamics is investigated. A
pole appears in the effective coupling constant for the space-like momentum if
it is calculated by perturbation. The pole can be eliminated by the analytic
regularization. For QED the effective coupling constant is written in terms of
the scale parameter, $\Lambda$, having the dimension of mass as in the case of
QCD. $\Lambda$ is determined by comparing with the experimental data. The
calculated result agrees with experiment with $\Lambda\approx 1.64\times
10^{47}$ GeV; it is very large but much smaller than the mass scale of Landau
ghost.
