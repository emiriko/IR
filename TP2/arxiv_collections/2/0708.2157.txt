We report on self-consistent calculations of single-K^- nuclear states and
multi-Kbar nuclear states in 12C, 16O, 40Ca and 208Pb within the relativistic
mean-field (RMF) approach. Gradient terms motivated by the p-wave resonance
Sigma(1385) are found to play a secondary role for single-K^- nuclear systems
where the mean-field concept is acceptable. Significant contributions from the
Kbar N -> pi Lambda conversion mode, and from the nonmesonic Kbar NN -> YN
conversion modes which are assumed to follow a rho^2 density dependence, are
evaluated for the deep binding-energy range of over 100 MeV where the decay
channel Kbar N -> pi Sigma is closed. Altogether we obtain K^- total decay
widths of 50-100 MeV for binding energies exceeding 100 MeV in single-K^-
nuclei. Multi-Kbar nuclear calculations indicate that the binding energy per
Kbar meson saturates upon increasing the number of Kbar mesons embedded in the
nuclear medium. The nuclear and Kbar densities increase only moderately and are
close to saturation, with no indication of any kaon-condensation precursor.
