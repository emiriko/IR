I propose three new curved spacetime versions of the Dirac Equation. These
equations have been developed mainly to try and account in a natural way for
the observed anomalous gyromagnetic ratio of Fermions. The derived equations
suggest that particles including the Electron which is thought to be a point
particle do have a finite spatial size which is the reason for the observed
anomalous gyromagnetic ratio. A serendipitous result of the theory, is that,
two of the equation exhibits an asymmetry in their positive and negative energy
solutions the first suggestion of which is clear that a solution to the problem
as to why the Electron and Muon - despite their acute similarities - exhibit an
asymmetry in their mass is possible. The Mourn is often thought as an Electron
in a higher energy state. Another of the consequences of three equations
emanating from the asymmetric serendipity of the energy solutions of two of
these equations, is that, an explanation as to why Leptons exhibit a three
stage mass hierarchy is possible.
