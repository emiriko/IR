A general class of Newton algorithms on Gra{\ss}mann and
Lagrange-Gra{\ss}mann manifolds is introduced, that depends on an arbitrary
pair of local coordinates. Local quadratic convergence of the algorithm is
shown under a suitable condition on the choice of coordinate systems. Our
result extends and unifies previous convergence results for Newton's method on
a manifold. Using special choices of the coordinates, new numerical algorithms
are derived for principal component analysis and invariant subspace
computations with improved computational complexity properties.
