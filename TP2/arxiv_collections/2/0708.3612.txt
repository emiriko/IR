We examine the effect of a general HZZ coupling through a study of the Higgs
decay to leptons via Z bosons at the LHC. We discuss various methods for
placing limits on additional couplings, including measurement of the partial
width, threshold scans, and asymmetries constructed from angular observables.
We find that only the asymmetries provide a definitive test of additional
couplings. We further estimate the significances they provide.
