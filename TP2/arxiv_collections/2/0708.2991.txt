We develop a simple model of shape resonances in electron-molecule collisions
that is based on the modified effective-range expansion and analytical
solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the long-range part of the
interaction potential. We apply our model to electron scattering on N$_2$ and
CO$_2$. The parameters of the effective-range expansion (i.e. the scattering
length and the effective range) are determined from experimental, integral
elastic cross sections in the 0.1 - 1.0 eV energy range. For both molecular
targets our treatment predicts shape resonances that appear slightly higher
than experimentally known resonances in total cross sections. Agreement with
the experiment can be improved by assuming the position of the resonance in a
given partial wave. Influence of quadrupole potential on resonances is also
discussed: it can be disregarded for N$_2$ but gets significant for CO$_2$. In
conclusion, our model developed within the effective range formalism reproduces
well both the very low-energy behavior of the integral cross section as well as
the presence of resonances in the few eV range.
