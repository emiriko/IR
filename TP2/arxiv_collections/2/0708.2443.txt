In this article, we describe a new algorithm for the expansion of
hypergeometric functions about half-integer parameters. The implementation of
this algorithm for certain classes of hypergeometric functions in the already
existing Mathematica package HypExp is described. Examples of applications in
Feynman diagrams with up to four loops are given.
