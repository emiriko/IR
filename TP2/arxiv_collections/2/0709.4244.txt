We point out that unidirectional bond-centered charge-density-wave states in
cuprates involve electronic order in both s- and d-wave channels, with
non-local Coulomb repulsion suppressing the s-wave component. The resulting
bond-charge-density wave, coexisting with superconductivity, is compatible with
recent photoemission and tunneling data and as well as neutron-scattering
measurements, once long-range order is destroyed by slow fluctuations or glassy
disorder. In particular, the real-space structure of d-wave stripes is
consistent with the scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on both
underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 of Kohsaka et al. [Science 315,
1380 (2007), arXiv:cond-mat/0703309].
