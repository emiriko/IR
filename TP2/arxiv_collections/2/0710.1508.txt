Form factors of rare (B -> K_0*(1430) l^+ l^-$ decay) decay are calculated
within three-point QCD sum rules, with (K_0* (1430)) being the p-wave scalar
meson. The branching ratios are estimated when only short, as well as short and
long distance effects, are taken into account.It is obtained that the (B ->
K_0*(1430) l^+ l^- (l=e,mu)) decay is measurable at LHC. Measurement of these
branching ratios for the semileptonic rare (B -> K_0*(1430) l^+ l^-$ decay) can
give valuable information about the nature of scalar meson (K_0* (1430)).
