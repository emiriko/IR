Zipf's law states that if words of language are ranked in the order of
decreasing frequency in texts, the frequency of a word is inversely
proportional to its rank. It is very robust as an experimental observation, but
to date it escaped satisfactory theoretical explanation. We suggest that Zipf's
law may arise from the evolution of word semantics dominated by expansion of
meanings and competition of synonyms.
