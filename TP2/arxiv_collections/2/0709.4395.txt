The spatial string tension of a SU(N) gauge theory without quarks is
calculated using gauge/string duality for 1.2T_c<T<3T_c. The result is
remarkably consistent with the available lattice data for N=2,3. Some evidence
is found that to leading order the large distance physics of a string can be
described by a five-dimensional geometry without a need for an internal space.
