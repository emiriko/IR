A theory for boson-assisted tunneling via randomly distributed resonant
states in a layered metals is developed. As particular examples, we consider
the electron-phonon interaction and the interaction between localized and
conduction electrons. The theory is applied to explain a non-monotonic
variation of the out-plane resistivity with temperature observed in
quasi-two-dimensional metals.
