Based on trends seen at lower energies we "predict" the multiplicities and
pseudorapidity distributions of particle density and elliptic flow that will be
seen in PbPb and pp collisions at the LHC. We argue that, if these predictions
turn out to be correct, either these quantities are insensitive to the state of
matter created in high energy heavy ion collisions or the observed simplicity
and universality of the data must be telling us something profound about the
mechanism of particle production, which to this date is not well understood.
