Let $K$ be an abelian extension of the rationals. Let $S(K)$ be the Schur
group of $K$ and let $CC(K)$ be the subgroup of $S(K)$ generated by classes
containing cyclic cyclotomic algebras. We characterize when $CC(K)$ has finite
index in $S(K)$ in terms of the relative position of $K$ in the lattice of
cyclotomic extensions of the rationals.
