We analyze inelastic cotunneling through an interacting quantum dot subject
to an ambient magnetic field in the weak tunneling regime under a non-adiabatic
time-dependent bias-voltage. Our results clearly exhibit photon-assisted
satellites and an overall suppression of differential conductance with
increasing driving amplitude, which is consistent with experiments. We also
predict a zero-anomaly in differential conductance under an appropriate driving
frequency.
