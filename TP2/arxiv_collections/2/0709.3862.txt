Current-induced torques on ferromagnetic nanoparticles and on domain walls in
ferromagnetic nanowires are normally understood in terms of transfer of
conserved spin angular momentum between spin-polarized currents and the
magnetic condensate. In a series of recent articles we have discussed a
microscopic picture of current-induced torques in which they are viewed as
following from exchange fields produced by the misaligned spins of current
carrying quasiparticles. This picture has the advantage that it can be applied
to systems in which spin is not approximately conserved. More importantly, this
point of view makes it clear that current-induced torques can also act on the
order parameter of an antiferromagnetic metal, even though this quantity is not
related to total spin. In this informal and intentionally provocative review we
explain this picture and discuss its application to antiferromagnets.
