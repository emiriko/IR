We report a new STAR measurement of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry
A_LL for inclusive jet production at mid-rapidity in polarized p+p collisions
at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 200 GeV. The data, which cover jet
transverse momenta 5 < p_T < 30 GeV/c, are substantially more precise than
previous measurements. They provide significant new constraints on the gluon
spin contribution to the nucleon spin through the comparison to predictions
derived from one global fit of polarized deep-inelastic scattering
measurements.
