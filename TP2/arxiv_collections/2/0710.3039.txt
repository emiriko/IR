We prove here that Newtons universal gravitation and momentum conservation
laws together reproduce Weinbergs relation. It is shown that the Hubble
parameter H must be built in this relation, or equivalently the age of the
Universe t. Using a wave-to-particle interaction technique we then prove that
the speed of light c decreases with cosmological time, and that c is
proportional to the Hubble parameter H. We see the expansion of the Universe as
a local effect due to the LAB value of the speed of light co taken as constant.
We present a generalized red shift law and find a predicted acceleration for
photons that agrees well with the result from Pioneer 10/11 anomalous
acceleration. We finally present a cosmological model coherent with the above
results that we call the Mass-Boom. It has a linear increase of mass m with
time as a result of the speed of light c linear decrease with time, and the
conservation of momentum mc. We obtain the baryonic mass parameter equal to the
curvature parameter, omega m = omega k, so that the model is of the type of the
Einstein static, closed, finite, spherical, unlimited, with zero cosmological
constant. This model is the cosmological view as seen by photons, neutrinos,
tachyons etc. in contrast with the local view, the LAB reference. Neither dark
matter nor dark energy is required by this model. With an initial constant
speed of light during a short time we get inflation (an exponential expansion).
This converts, during the inflation time, the Plancks fluctuation length of
10-33 cm to the present size of the Universe (about 1028 cm, constant from then
on). Thereafter the Mass-Boom takes care to bring the initial values of the
Universe (about 1015 gr) to the value at the present time of about 1055 gr.
