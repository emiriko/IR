Schwarzschild's solution of Einstein's field equations in vacuum can be
written in many different forms. Unfortunately Schwarzschild's own original
form is less nice looking and simple than that latter derived by Droste and
Hilbert. We prove here that we can have both: a nice looking simple form and
the meaning that Schwarzschild wanted to give to his solution, i.e., that of
describing the gravitational field of a massive point particle.
