The profile functions of the SU(3) Skyrme soliton are investigated for the
octet, decuplet, and antidecuplet baryons by the mean field approach. In this
approach, the profile functions are affected by the spatial rotation, the
flavor rotation, and the flavor symmetry breaking. The solitons are stable only
in the restricted areas of the parameter space for each multiplet. When the
flavor symmetry breaking is large, the area for the antidecuplet is narrow
compared to those for the octet and decuplet. The parameters are determined by
the baryon mass spectrum, and the deformation of the soliton has sizable
effects on the masses.
