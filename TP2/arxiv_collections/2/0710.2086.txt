A method to solve various aspects of the strong coupling expansion of the
superconformal field theory duals of AdS_5 x X geometries from first principles
is proposed. The main idea is that at strong coupling the configurations that
dominate the low energy dynamics of the field theory compactified on a three
sphere are given by certain non-trivial semi-classical configurations in the
moduli space of vacua.
  We show that this approach is self-consistent and permits one to express most
of the dynamics in terms of an effective N=4 SYM dynamics. This has the
advantage that some degrees of freedom that move the configurations away from
moduli space can be treated perturbatively, unifying the essential low energy
dynamics of all of these theories. We show that with this formalism one can
compute the energies of strings in the BMN limit in the Klebanov-Witten theory
from field theory considerations, matching the functional form of results found
using AdS geometry. This paper also presents various other technical results
for the semiclassical treatment of superconformal field theories.
