A mean field spin system consisting two interacting groups each with
homogeneous interaction coefficients is introduced and studied. Existence of
the thermodynamic limit is shown by an asymptotic sub-addittivity method and
factorization of correlation functions is proved almost everywhere. The free
energy solution of the model is obtained by upper and lower bounds and by
showing that their difference vanishes for large volumes.
