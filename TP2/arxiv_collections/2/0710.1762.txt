The static gluon-quark-antiquark interaction is investigated using lattice
QCD techniques. A Wilson loop adequate to the static hybrid three-body system
is developed and, using a $24^3 \times 48$ periodic lattice with $\beta = 6.2$,
the potential energy of the system is measured for different geometries. For
the medium range behaviour, when the quarks are far apart, we find a string
tension which is compatible with two fundamental strings. On the other hand,
when the quark and antiquark are nearby, the string tension is larger than two
fundamental strings and is compatible with the Casimir scaling.
