In this paper we extend our earlier analysis of the novel Josephson effect in
triplet superconductor--ferromagnet--triplet superconductor (TFT) junctions [B.
Kastening \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{96}}, 047009 (2006)]. In our
more general formulation of the TFT junction we allow for potential scattering
at the barrier and an arbitrary orientation of the ferromagnetic moment.
Several new effects are found upon the inclusion of these extra terms: for
example, we find that a Josephson current can flow even when there is vanishing
phase difference between the superconducting condensates on either side of the
barrier. The critical current for a barrier with magnetization parallel to the
interface is calculated as a function of the junction parameters, and is found
to display strong non-analyticities. Furthermore, the Josephson current
switches first identified in our previous work are found to be robust features
of the junction, while the unconventional temperature-dependence of the current
is very sensitive to the extra terms in the barrier Hamiltonian.
