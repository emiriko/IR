We suggest that the large single spin asymmetries observed at high momentum
fractions x_F and transverse momenta k_T of the pion in p^\uparrow p ->
\pi(x_F,k_T)+X arise from the coherence of the soft interactions with the hard
parton scattering process. Such coherence can be maintained if x_F -> 1 as k_T
-> \infty, while k_T^2(1-x_F) ~ \Lambda_{QCD}^2 stays fixed. Analogous
coherence effects have been seen experimentally in the Drell-Yan process at
high x_F. We find that the p^\uparrow p -> \pi X production amplitudes have
large dynamic phases and that helicity flip contributions are unsuppressed in
this limit, giving rise to potentially large single spin asymmetries.
