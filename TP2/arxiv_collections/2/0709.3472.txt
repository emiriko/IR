We present a C++ computer package, ACTIVIA, that can calculate target-product
cross-sections and the production and decay yields of isotopes from cosmic ray
activation using data tables and semi-empirical formulae. We describe the
structure and user interface of the computer code as well as provide
comparisons between the calculations and experimental results. We also outline
suggestions on how the code can be improved and extended for other
applications.
