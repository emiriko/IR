We present precision calculations of the transverse-momentum spectrum and the
invariant-mass distribution for slepton pair production at hadron colliders. We
implement the transverse-momentum, threshold and joint resummation formalisms
at the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and consistently match the obtained
result with the pure perturbative result at the first order in the strong
coupling constant, i.e. at order alpha_s. We give numerical predictions for
selectron and stau pair production, and compare the various resummed cross
sections with the perturbative result.
