We propose a self-consistent approximate solution of the disordered
Kondo-lattice model (KLM) to get the interconnected electronic and magnetic
properties of 'local-moment' systems like diluted ferromagnetic semiconductors.
Aiming at $(A_{1-x}M_x)$ compounds, where magnetic (M) and non-magnetic (A)
atoms distributed randomly over a crystal lattice, we present a theory which
treats the subsystems of itinerant charge carriers and localized magnetic
moments in a homologous manner. The coupling between the localized moments due
to the itinerant electrons (holes) is treated by a modified RKKY-theory which
maps the KLM onto an effective Heisenberg model. The exchange integrals turn
out to be functionals of the electronic selfenergy guaranteeing selfconsistency
of our theory. The disordered electronic and magnetic moment systems are both
treated by CPA-type methods.
  We discuss in detail the dependencies of the key-terms such as the long range
and oscillating effectice exchange integrals, 'the local-moment' magnetization,
the electron spin polarization, the Curie temperature as well as the electronic
and magnonic quasiparticle densities of states on the concentration $x$ of
magnetic ions, the carrier concentration $n$, the exchange coupling $J$, and
the temperature. The shape and the effective range of the exchange integrals
turn out to be strongly $x$-dependent. The disorder causes anomalies in the
spin spectrum especially in the low-dilution regime, which are not observed in
the mean field approximation.
