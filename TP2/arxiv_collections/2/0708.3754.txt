The convergence of no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations using
renormalization group evolved low-momentum two-nucleon interactions is studied
for light nuclei up to Li-7. Because no additional transformation was used in
applying the NCSM framework, the energy calculations satisfy the variational
principle for a given Hamiltonian. Dramatic improvements in convergence are
found as the cutoffs are lowered. The renormalization group equations are
truncated at two-body interactions, so the evolution is only approximately
unitary and converged energies for A > 2 vary with the cutoff. This
approximation is systematic, however, and for useful cutoff ranges the energy
variation is comparable to natural-size truncation errors inherent from the
initial chiral effective field theory potential.
