Twelve years after the discovery of the Top quark, the CDF detector has
collected large samples of tt-bar events with integrated luminosities up to
1-1.7 fb^-1, where we are able to probe our knowledge of the Standard Model Top
quark. This article will focuss on those analysis results dedicated to find new
physics in the Top quark production: measurement of relative fractions of Top
pair production mechanisms, searches for a massive resonant state decaying to
tt-bar pairs as well as a heavy Top-like quark decaying as the Standard Model
Top quark. Besides its production, the Top quark decay is also an interesting
probe to find Physics Beyond the Standard Model by measuring possibly anomalous
values of the helicity fractions of the W boson in the decay t-->W(-->l+v_l)b
by searching for flavour changing neutral current decays t-->Zq or by testing
the Top quark charge to be +2/3 or -4/3.
