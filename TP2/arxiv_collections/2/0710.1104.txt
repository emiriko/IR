We establish conditions for a continuous map of nonzero degree between a
smooth closed manifold and a negatively curved manifold of dimension greater
than four to be homotopic to a smooth cover, and in particular a diffeomorphism
when the degree is one. The conditions hold when the volumes or entropy-volumes
of the two manifolds differ by less than a uniform constant after an
appropriate normalization of the metrics. The results are qualitatively sharp
in the sense that the dependencies are necessary. We give a number of
corollaries.
