A two-step quantum key distribution protocol using frequency and polarization
doubly entangled photons is proposed. In this protocol, information is encoded
by a unitary operation on each of the two doubly entangled photons and sent
from Alice to Bob in two steps. State measurement device is designed. The
security of the communication is analyzed.
