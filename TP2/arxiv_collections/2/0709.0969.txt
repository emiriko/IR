Chiral vibrations are studied with the RPA plus self-consistent tilted axis
cranking formalism in the A=135 region. In this method chiral vibrations appear
as a precursor to the static chiral regime. The properties of the RPA phonons
are discussed and compared to experimental data. We discuss the limits the
chiral region and the transition to the non harmonic regime.
