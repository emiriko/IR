A bimatrix game $(A,B)$ is called a game of rank $k$ if the rank of the
matrix $A+B$ is at most $k$. We consider the problem of enumerating the Nash
equilibria in (non-degenerate) games of rank 1. In particular, we show that
even for games of rank 1 not all equilibria can be reached by a Lemke-Howson
path and present a parametric simplex-type algorithm for enumerating all Nash
equilibria of a non-degenerate game of rank 1.
