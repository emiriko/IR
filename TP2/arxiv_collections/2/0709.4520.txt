The dependence of quantum correlation of twin beams on the pump finesse of an
optical parametric oscillator is studied with a semi-classical analysis. It is
found that the phase-sum correlation of the output signal and idler beams from
an optical parametric oscillator operating above threshold depends on the
finesse of the pump field when the spurious pump phase noise generated inside
the optical cavity and the excess noise of the input pump field are involved in
the Langevin equations. The theoretical calculations can explain the previously
experimental results, quantitatively.
