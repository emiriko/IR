In this paper we establish some general results on local behavior of
holomorphic functions along complex submanifolds of $\Co^{N}$. As a corollary,
we present multi-dimensional generalizations of an important result of Coman
and Poletsky on Bernstein type inequalities on transcendental curves in
$\Co^{2}$.
