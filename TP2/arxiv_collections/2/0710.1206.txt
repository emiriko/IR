The LHC experiments will perform sensitive tests of physics beyond the
Standard Model (BSM). The investigation of decays of beauty hadrons represents
an alternative approach in addition to direct BSM searches. The ATLAS and CMS
efforts concentrate on those B-decays that can be efficiently selected already
at the first and second level trigger. The most favorable trigger signature
will be for $B$-hadron decays with muons in the final state. Using this
trigger, ATLAS and CMS will be able to accommodate unprecedentedly high
statistics in the rare decay sector. These are purely dimuon decays, and
families of semimuonic exclusive channels. Already with data corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of \ensuremath{1 fb^{-1}}, the sensitivity in the
dimuon channels will be comparable to present measurements (world average). The
strategy is to carry on the dimuon channel program up to nominal LHC
luminosity. In particular the \ensuremath{B_s \to \mu\mu} signal with
\ensuremath{\sim}5 sigma significance can be measured combining low luminosity
\ensuremath{10^{33}cm^{-2} s^{-1}} samples with those of one year of LHC
operation at a luminosity of \ensuremath{10^{34}cm^{-2} s^{-1}
