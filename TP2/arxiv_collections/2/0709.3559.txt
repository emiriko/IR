We discuss results that have been obtained from the implementation of the
initial round of testbeds for numerical relativity which was proposed in the
first paper of the Apples with Apples Alliance. We present benchmark results
for various codes which provide templates for analyzing the testbeds and to
draw conclusions about various features of the codes. This allows us to sharpen
the initial test specifications, design a new test and add theoretical insight.
