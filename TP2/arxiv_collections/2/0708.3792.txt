We focus in this work to renew the interest in higher conformal spins
symmetries and their relations to quantum field theories and integrable models.
We consider the extension of the conformal Frappat et al. symmetries containing
the Virasoro and the Antoniadis et al. algebras as particular cases describing
geometrically special diffeomorphisms of the two dimensional torus $T^2$. We
show in a consistent way, and explicitly, how one can extract these generalized
symmetries from the Gelfand-Dickey algebra. The link with Liouville and Toda
conformal field theories is established and various important properties are
discussed.
