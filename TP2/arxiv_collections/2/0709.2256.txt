We study the effect of spatial confinement on the strength of propulsive
diffusiophoretic forces acting on a particle that generates density gradients
by exploiting the chemical free energy of its environment. Using a recently
proposed simple model of a self-propelling device driven by chemical reactions
taking place on some parts of its surface, we demonstrate that the force
significantly increases in the presence of confining walls. We also show that
such effects become even more pronounced in two-dimensional systems.
