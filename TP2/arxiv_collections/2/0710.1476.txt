We study the propagation of sound-like perturbations created by a jet moving
with supersonic velocity through the quark-gluon-plasma created in heavy-ion
reactions within the model MACE (MAch Cone Evolution). Predictions for
heavy-ion reactions at RHIC energies (Au+Au-collisions) and for Pb+Pb reactions
at the LHC ($\sqrt s=5.5A$ TeV) are presented and potential observations by the
STAR, PHENIX and ALICE experiments are discussed.
