The regional climate model prepared from Eta WS forecast model has been
integrated over South America with the horizontal resolution of 40 km for the
period of 1960-1990. The model was forced at its lateral boundaries by the
outputs of HadAM3P. The data of HadAM3P represent simulation of modern climate
with the resolution about 150 km. In order to prepare climate regional model
from the Eta forecast model multiple modifications and corrections were made in
the original model. The run of climate Eta model was made on the supercomputer
SX-6. The detailed analysis of the results of dynamical downscaling experiment
includes an investigation of a consistency between the regional and AGCM models
as well as of ability of the regional model to resolve important features of
climate fields on the finer scale than that resolved by AGCM. In this work the
results of the investigation of a consistency between the output fields of the
Eta model and HadAM3P are presented. The geopotential, temperature and wind
fields of both models were analysed. For the evaluation of the likeness of
these two models outputs,there were used Fourier analysis of time series,
consistency index, constituted from linear regression coefficients, time mean
and space mean models' arithmetic difference and root mean square difference,
dispersion analysis,and some others characteristics. This investigation
demonstrates that there are not significant differences in behaviour and
spatial arragement of large-scale structures of the two models. Also, the
regional model characteristics do not have considerable positive or negative
trend during integration time in relation to the global model characteristics.
  From the total analysis we can affirm that in the description of large-scale
climate structures these two models are in consistency.
