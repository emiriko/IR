Nucleation of vortices in a superconductor below the first critical field can
be assisted by transverse sound in the GHz frequency range. Vortices will enter
and exist the superconductor at the frequency of the sound. We compute the
threshold parameters of the sound and show that this effect is within
experimental reach.
