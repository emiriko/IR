We evaluate heavy-quark (HQ) transport properties in a Quark-Gluon Plasma
(QGP) employing interaction potentials extracted from thermal lattice QCD.
Within a Brueckner many-body scheme we calculate in-medium T-matrices for
charm- and bottom-quark scattering off light quarks in the QGP. The
interactions are dominated by attractive meson and diquark channels which
support bound and resonance states up to temperatures of ~1.5 T_c. We apply
pertinent drag and diffusion coefficients (supplemented by perturbative
scattering off gluons) in Langevin simulations in an expanding fireball to
compute HQ spectra and elliptic flow in \sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV Au-Au collisions.
We find good agreement with semileptonic electron-decay spectra which supports
our nonperturbative computation of the HQ diffusion coefficient, suggestive for
a strongly coupled QGP.
