The results of micro-Raman scattering measurements performed on three
different ``graphitic'' materials: micro-structured disks of highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite, graphene multi-layers thermally decomposed from carbon
terminated surface of 4H-SiC and an exfoliated graphene monolayer are
presented. Despite its multi-layer character, most parts of the surface of the
graphitized SiC substrates shows a single-component, Lorentzian shape, double
resonance Raman feature in striking similarity to the case of a single graphene
monolayer. Our observation suggests a very weak electronic coupling between
graphitic layers on the SiC surface, which therefore can be considered to be
graphene multi-layers with a simple (Dirac-like) band structure.
