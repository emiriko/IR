In this paper we address a general parameter estimation methodology for an
extended biokinetic degradation model [1] for poorly degradable
micropollutants. In particular we concentrate on parameter estimation of the
micropollutant degradation sub-model by specialised microorganisms. In this
case we focus on the case when only substrate degradation data are available
and prove the structural identifiability of the model. Further we consider the
problem of practical identifiability and propose experimental and related
numerical methods for unambiguous parameter estimation based on multiple
substrate degradation curves with different initial concentrations. Finally by
means of simulated pseudo-experiments we have found convincing indications that
the proposed algorithm is stable and yields appropriate parameter estimates
even in unfavourable regimes.
