We explore how to protect extra dimensional models from large flavor changing
neutral currents by using bulk and brane flavor symmetries. We show that a GIM
mechanism can be built in to warped space models such as Randall-Sundrum or
composite Higgs models if flavor mixing is introduced via UV brane kinetic
mixings for right handed quarks. We give a realistic implementation both for a
model with minimal flavor violation and one with next-to-minimal flavor
violation. The latter does not suffer from a CP problem. We consider some of
the existing experimental constraints on these models implied by precision
electroweak tests.
