We investigate Kerr-Newman black holes in which a rotating charged
ring-shaped singularity induces a region which contains closed timelike curves
(CTCs). Contrary to popular belief, it turns out that the time orientation of
the CTC is opposite to the direction in which the singularity or the ergosphere
rotates. In this sense, CTCs "counter-rotate" against the rotating black hole.
We have similar results for all spacetimes sufficiently familiar to us in which
rotation induces CTCs. This motivates our conjecture that perhaps this
counter-rotation is not an accidental oddity particular to Kerr-Newman
spacetimes, but instead there may be a general and intuitively comprehensible
reason for this.
