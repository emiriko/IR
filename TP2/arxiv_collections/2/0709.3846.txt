We discuss the effects of external stress on the thermal denaturation of
homogeneous DNA. Pulling double-stranded DNA at each end exerts a profound
effect on the thermal denaturation, or melting, of a long segment of this
molecule. We discuss the effects on this transition of a stretching force
applied to opposite ends of one of the DNA strands, including full
consideration of the consequences of excluded volume, the analysis of which is
greatly simplified in this case. We also discuss the interplay of thermal
denaturation and force-generated separation when the tension is generated by a
force at the end of the duplexed strands and an equal and opposite force is
applied to the other end of the second strand.
