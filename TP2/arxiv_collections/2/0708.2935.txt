We show that the use of real measuring rods in quantum mechanics places a
fundamental gravitational limit to the level of entanglement that one can
ultimately achieve in quantum systems. The result can be seen as a direct
consequence of the fundamental gravitational limitations in the measurements of
length and time in realistic physical systems. The effect may have implications
for long distance teleportation and the measurement problem in quantum
mechanics.
