The measurement of transverse spin effects in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic
scattering is an important part of the COMPASS physics program. From the
analysis of the 2002-2004 data, new results for the transverse target spin
asymmetry of z-ordered identified pion and kaon pairs are presented. In
addition, a first result for the transverse target spin asymmetry of
exclusively produced rho^0 mesons on the deuteron is shown.
