The linear dashpot model for the inelastic normal force between colliding
spheres leads to a constant coefficient of normal restitution,
$\epsilon_n=$const., which makes this model very popular for the investigation
of dilute and moderately dense granular systems. For two frequently used models
for the tangential interaction force we determine the coefficient of tangential
restitution $\epsilon_t$, both analytically and by numerical integration of
Newton's equation. Although $\epsilon_n=$const. for the linear-dashpot model,
we obtain pronounced and characteristic dependencies of the tangential
coefficient on the impact velocity $\epsilon_t=\epsilon_t(\vec{g})$. The
results may be used for event-driven simulations of granular systems of
frictional particles.
