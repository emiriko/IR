For any negative definite plumbed 3-manifold M we construct from its plumbed
graph a graded Z[U]-module. This, for rational homology spheres, conjecturally
equals the Heegaard-Floer homology of Ozsvath and Szabo, but it has even more
structure. If M is a complex singularity link then the normalized
Euler-characteristic can be compared with the analytic invariants. The
Seiberg--Witten Invariant Conjecture is discussed in the light of this new
object.
