We present a program for calculating the isospin symmetry breaking of the B
-> K* gamma decay in the MSSM with minimal flavor violation. This program
calculates the NLO supersymmetric contributions to the isospin asymmetry, using
the effective Hamiltonian approach and within the QCD factorization method. We
show that isospin symmetry breaking proves to be a very restrictive observable,
in particular in the mSUGRA parameter space. The program also calculates the
inclusive branching ratio associated to b -> s gamma transition, as a
comparison reference.
