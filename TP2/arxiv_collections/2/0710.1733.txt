This article contains a summary of the recent results in diffractive physics
at the Tevatron. Results from the CDF diffraction program include the single
diffractive to non-diffractive ratio in dijet events, observation of exclusive
$e^+e^-$ production via two-photon exchange, hints of exclusive $\gamma\gamma$
production via Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE), and the observation of exclusive
dijet production via DPE. A summary of the current plans for the D\O\
diffractive physics program is also presented.
