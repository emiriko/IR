The accurate prediction of electronic response properties of extended
molecular systems has been a challenge for conventional, explicit density
functionals. We demonstrate that a self-interaction correction implemented
rigorously within Kohn-Sham theory via the Optimized Effective Potential (OEP)
yields polarizabilities close to the ones from highly accurate
wavefunction-based calculations and exceeding the quality of
exact-exchange-OEP. The orbital structure obtained with the OEP-SIC functional
and approximations to it are discussed.
