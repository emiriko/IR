The solution to fine tuning is one of the principal motivations for
supersymmetry. However constraints on the parameter space of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) suggest it may also require fine tuning
(although to a much lesser extent). To compare this tuning with different
extensions of the Standard Model (including other supersymmetric models) it is
essential that we have a reliable, quantitative measure of tuning. We review
the measures of tuning used in the literature and propose an alternative
measure. We apply this measure to several toy models and the MSSM with some
intriguing results.
