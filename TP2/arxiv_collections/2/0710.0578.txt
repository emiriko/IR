We perform the non-perturbative (quenched) renormalization of the
chromo-magnetic operator in Heavy Quark Effective Theory and its three-loop
matching to QCD. At order 1/m of the expansion, the operator is responsible for
the mass splitting between the pseudoscalar and vector B-mesons. These new
computed factors are affected by an uncertainty negligible in comparison to the
known bare matrix element of the operator between B-states. Furthermore, they
push the quenched determination of the spin splitting for the Bs-meson much
closer to its experimental value than the previous perturbatively renormalized
computations. The renormalization factor for three commonly used heavy quark
actions and the Wilson gauge action and useful parametrizations of the matching
coefficient are provided.
