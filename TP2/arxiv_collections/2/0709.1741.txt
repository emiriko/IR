Results of a recent study of the transition between quantum and classical
behavior are applied to black holes. The study led to a criterion separating
quantum from classical behavior on the basis of mass or size, dependent on
local effects of cosmic expansion. Application of this criterion to black holes
indicates that the motion of smaller black holes will be characteristically
quantum mechanical, while the motion of larger black holes must be classical,
with a threshold distinguishing these behaviors at a Schwartzschild radius of
roughly the size of a nucleon.
