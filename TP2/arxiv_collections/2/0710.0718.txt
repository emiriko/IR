Implicit and explicit density functionals for the exchange energy in finite
two-dimensional systems are developed following the approach of Becke and
Roussel [Phys. Rev. A 39, 3761 (1989)]. Excellent agreement for the
exchange-hole potentials and exchange energies is found when compared with the
exact-exchange reference data for the two-dimensional uniform electron gas and
few-electron quantum dots, respectively. Thereby, this work significantly
improves the availability of approximate density functionals for dealing with
electrons in quasi-two-dimensional structures, which have various applications
in semiconductor nanotechnology.
