This article presents a squeezing transformation for quantum systems
associated to finite vector spaces. The physical idea of squeezing here is
taken from the action of the usual squeezing operator over wave functions
defined on a real line, that is, a transformation capable to diminish (or
enhance) the mean square deviation of a centered distribution. As it is
discussed, the definition of such an operator on finite dimensional vector
spaces is not a trivial matter, but, on the other hand, has obvious connections
with problems such as spin squeezing and (finite) quantum state reproduction.
