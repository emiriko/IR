We develop general formalism of how to relate scattering amplitudes for
exclusive processes to spatial image of target hadron. More precisely we show
how to determine the spatial distribution of outgoing particles in the space of
so-called nearest approach parameter. This parameter characterizes the position
in the coordinate space the place where the final particle is produced.
