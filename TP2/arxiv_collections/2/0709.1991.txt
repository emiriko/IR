We investigate a dephasing mechanism in a quantum dot capacitively coupled to
a quantum point contact. We use a model which was proposed to explain the 0.7
structure in point contacts, based on the presence of a quasi-bound state in a
point contact. The dephasing rate is examined in terms of charge fluctuations
of electrons in the bound state. We address a recent experiment by
Avinun-Kalish {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 156801 (2004)], where a
double peak structure appears in the suppressed conductance through the quantum
dot. We show that the two conducting channels induced by the bound state are
responsible for the peak structure.
