It is shown that unification of strong and Electroweak interactions at Tev
scale may lead to appearance of topologically stable monopoles with masses of
the order of 40 Tev. Those monopoles may play an important role in the early
Universe, at finite temperature. They may even be condensed at high enough
temperature. The lattice model for investigation of this phenomenon is
presented.
