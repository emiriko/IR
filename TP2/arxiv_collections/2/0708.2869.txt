Nonlinear dynamics of photoinduced cooperative phenomena is studied by
numerical calculations on a model of molecular crystals. We found that the
photoinduced nucleation process is triggered only when certain amount of
excitation energy is supplied in a narrow part of the system, i.e., there
exists a smallest cluster of excited molecules which makes the nucleation
possible. As a result, the portion of the cooperatively converted molecules is
nonlinearly dependent on the photoexcitation strength, which has been observed
in various materials.
