We address the issue of strong cosmic censorship for T^2-symmetric spacetimes
with positive cosmological constant. In the case of collisionless matter, we
complete the proof of the C^2 formulation of the conjecture for this class of
spacetimes. In the vacuum case, we prove that the conjecture holds for the
special cases where the area element of the group orbits does not vanish on the
past boundary of the maximal Cauchy development.
