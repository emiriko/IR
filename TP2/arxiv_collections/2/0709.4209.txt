Changes in a cell's external or internal conditions are usually reflected in
the concentrations of the relevant transcription factors. These proteins in
turn modulate the expression levels of the genes under their control and
sometimes need to perform non-trivial computations that integrate several
inputs and affect multiple genes. At the same time, the activities of the
regulated genes would fluctuate even if the inputs were held fixed, as a
consequence of the intrinsic noise in the system, and such noise must
fundamentally limit the reliability of any genetic computation. Here we use
information theory to formalize the notion of information transmission in
simple genetic regulatory elements in the presence of physically realistic
noise sources. The dependence of this "channel capacity" on noise parameters,
cooperativity and cost of making signaling molecules is explored
systematically. We find that, at least in principle, capacities higher than one
bit should be achievable and that consequently genetic regulation is not
limited the use of binary, or "on-off", components.
