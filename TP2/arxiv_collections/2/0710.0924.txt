We analyze the possibility of Experimental Research of Extra Dimensions
On-Board International Space Station (ISS) by using a Satellite carrying a
Laser device(optical Laser) on the other side of Earth Orbit targeted towards
ISS.The Sun will be between the Satellite and the ISS so the Laser will pass
the neighborhoods of the Sun at a distance $R$ in order to reach ISS. The Laser
beam will be Gravitationally Bent according to Classical General Relativity and
the Extra Terms predicted by Kar-Sinha in the Gravitational Bending Of Light
due to the presence of Extra Dimensions can perhaps be measured with precision
equipment.By computing the Gravitational Bending according to Einstein we know
the exact position where the Laser will reach the target on-board ISS.However
if the Laser arrives at ISS with a Bending different than the one predicted by
Einstein and if this difference is equal to the Extra Terms predicted by
Kar-Sinha then this experience would proof that we live in a Universe of more
than 4 Dimensions.We demonstrate in this work that ISS have the needed
precision to detect these Extra Terms(see eq 137 in this work).Such experience
would resemble the measures of the Gravitational Bending Of Light by Sir Arthur
Stanley Eddington in the Sun Eclipse of 1919 that helped to proof the
correctness of General Relativity although in ISS case would have more degres
of accuracy because we would be free from the interference of Earth Atmosphere.
