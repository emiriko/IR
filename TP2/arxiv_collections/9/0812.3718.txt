Shallow heteronuclear trimers are predicted for mixtures of two atomic
species strongly trapped in a quasi two-dimensional atomic wave guide. The
binding energies are functions of the 2D-scattering length and of the mass
ratio and can be thus tuned by various ways. These universal trimers are
composed of two identical non interacting particles and of a third particle of
the other species. Depending on the statistics of the two identical particles,
the trimers have an odd (fermions) or even (bosons) internal angular momentum.
These results permit to draw conclusions on the stability issue for the
quasi-2D gaseous phase of heteronuclear dimers.
