The multiquark confining potential is proportional to the total distance of
the fundamental strings linking the quarks and antiquarks. We address the
computation of the total string distance an of the Fermat points where the
different strings meet. For a meson (quark-antiquark system) the distance is
trivially the quark-antiquark distance. For a baryon (three quark system) the
problem was solved geometrically from the onset, by Fermat and by Torricelli.
The geometrical solution can be determined just with a rule and a compass, but
translation of the geometrical solution to an analytical expression is not as
trivial. For tetraquarks, pentaquarks, hexaquarks, etc, the geometrical
solution is much more complicated. Here we provide an iterative method,
converging fast to the correct Fermat points and the total distances, relevant
for the multiquark potentials. We also review briefly the geometrical methods
leading to the Fermat points and to the total distances.
