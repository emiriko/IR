The explicit coordinate transformations which show the equivalence between a
four-dimensional spatially flat cosmology and an appropriate submanifold in the
flat five-dimensional Minkowski space-time are presented. Analogous procedure
is made for the case of five-dimensional warped brane world models. Several
examples are presented.
