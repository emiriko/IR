Regarded as the integrable generalization of Camassa-Holm (CH) equation, the
CH equation with self-consistent sources (CHESCS) is derived. The Lax
representation of the CHESCS is presented. The conservation laws for CHESCS are
constructed. The peakon solution, N-soliton, N-cuspon, N-positon and N-negaton
solutions of CHESCS are obtained by using Darboux transformation and the method
of variation of constants.
