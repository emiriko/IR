The gravitational spectrometer GRANIT will be set up at the Institut Laue
Langevin. It will profit from the high ultracold neutron density produced by a
dedicated source. A monochromator made of crystals from graphite intercalated
with potassium will provide a neutron beam with 0.89 nm incident on the source.
The source employs superthermal conversion of cold neutrons in superfluid
helium, in a vessel made from BeO ceramics with Be windows. A special
extraction technique has been tested which feeds the spectrometer only with
neutrons with a vertical velocity component v < 20 cm/s, thus keeping the
density in the source high. This new source is expected to provide a density of
up to 800 1/cm3 for the spectrometer.
