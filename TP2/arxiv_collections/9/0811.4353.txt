A new modification of KOs2O6, the representative of a new structural type
(Pearson symbol aP18, a=5.5668(1)A, b=6.4519(2)A, c=7.2356(2)A, space group
P-1, no.2) was synthesized employing high pressure technique. Its structure was
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure can be described
as two OsO6 octahedral chains relating to each other through inversion and
forming big voids with K atoms inside. Quantum chemical calculations were
performed on the novel compound and structurally related cubic compound.
High-pressure X-ray study showed that cubic KOs2O6 phase was stable up to
32.5(2) GPa at room temperature.
