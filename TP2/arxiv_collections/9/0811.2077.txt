We report on measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration \lambda_{ab}
in the optimally doped cuprate superconductor (BiPb)_2(SrLa)_2CuO_6+\delta (OP
Bi2201) by means of muon-spin rotation (\muSR). We show that in unconventional
$d-$wave superconductors (like OP Bi2201), \muSR experiments conducted in
various magnetic fields allow to evaluate the zero-field magnetic penetration
depth \lambda_0, which relates to the zero-field superfluid density in terms of
\rho_s\propto\lambda_0^-2.
