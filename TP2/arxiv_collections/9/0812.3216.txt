Using the framework of a previous article joint with Axelsson and McIntosh,
we extend to systems two results of S. Hofmann for real symmetric equations and
their perturbations going back to a work of B. Dahlberg for Laplace's equation
on Lipschitz domains, The first one is a certain bilinear estimate for a class
of weak solutions and the second is a criterion which allows to identify the
domain of the generator of the semi-group yielding such solutions.
