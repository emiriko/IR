We investigate magnetic properties of a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet
with a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice and exchange interactions between the
nearest- and next-nearest neighbours, J1 and J2. In a collinear phase with the
wave vector Q = (pi,pi,pi) the equations of the self-consistent spin-wave
theory for the sublattice magnetization and the average short range order
parameter are obtained and numerically solved. The dependence of the Neel
temperature T_N on the ratio J2/J1 is obtained. It is shown, that at strong
enough frustration there is a wide temperature region above T_N with strong
short range magnetic order. Application of this result to description of
structural phase transition between alpha and gamma-phase of Fe is considered.
