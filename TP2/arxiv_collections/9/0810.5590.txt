The development of large-area homogeneous photo-detectors with sub-millimeter
path lengths for direct Cherenkov light and for secondary-electrons opens the
possibility of large time-of-flight systems for relativistic particles with
resolutions in the pico-second range. Modern ASIC techniques allow fast
multi-channel front-end electronics capable of sub-pico-second resolution
directly integrated with the photo-detectors. However, achieving resolution in
the pico-second range requires a precise knowledge of the signal generation
process in order to understand the pulse waveform, the signal dynamics, and the
noise induced by the detector itself, as well as the noise added by the
processing electronics. Using the parameters measured for fast photo-detectors
such as micro-channel plates photo-multipliers, we have simulated and compared
the time-resolutions for four signal processing techniques: leading edge
discriminators, constant fraction discriminators, multiple-threshold
discriminators and pulse waveform sampling.
