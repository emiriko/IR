We present an analysis of the power fluctuations in the statistical steady
state of a passively mode locked laser. We use statistical light-mode theory to
map this problem to that of fluctuations in a reference equilibrium statistical
physics problem, and in this way study the fluctuations non-perturbatively. The
power fluctuations, being non-critical, are Gaussian and proportional in
amplitude to the inverse square root of the number of degrees of freedom. We
calculate explicit analytic expressions for the covariance matrix of the
overall, pulse and cw power variables, providing complete information on the
single-time power distribution in the laser, and derive a set of
fluctuation-dissipation relations between them and the susceptibilities of the
steady-state quantities.
