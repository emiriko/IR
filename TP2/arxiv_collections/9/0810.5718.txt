We investigate a superconducting single-electron transistor capacitively
coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator and focus on the double Josephson
quasiparticle resonance. The existence of two coherent Cooper pair tunneling
events is shown to lead to pronounced backaction effects. Measuring the current
and the shot noise provides a direct way of gaining information on the state of
the oscillator. In addition to an analytical discussion of the linear-response
regime, we discuss and compare results of higher-order approximation schemes
and a fully numerical solution. We find that cooling of the mechanical
resonator is possible, and that there are driven and bistable oscillator states
at low couplings. Finally, we also discuss the frequency dependence of the
charge noise and the current noise of the superconducting single electron
transistor.
