We introduce and solve a model of hardcore particles on a one dimensional
periodic lattice which undergoes an active-absorbing state phase transition at
finite density. In this model an occupied site is defined to be active if its
left neighbour is occupied and the right neighbour is vacant. Particles from
such active sites hop stochastically to their right. We show that, both the
density of active sites and the survival probability vanish as the particle
density is decreased below half. The critical exponents and spatial
correlations of the model are calculated exactly using the matrix product
ansatz. Exact analytical study of several variations of the model reveals that
these non-equilibrium phase transitions belong to a new universality class
different from the generic active-absorbing-state phase transition, namely
directed percolation.
