There is often a bond between two great men of a society at the time when one
is at the peak of his life and the other at its beginning. The great Serbian
19th century poet, clergyman and educator father Vasa Zivkovic, interceding in
favour of his student Mihajlo Pupin, significantly influenced the conditions
necessary for Pupin`s development into the person he later became. Mihajlo
Pupin was certainly not the only student to benefit from father Vasa Zivkovic
advice and material support. However their relationship is a perfect example of
an acclaimed person successfully influencing a person yet to win acclaim.
