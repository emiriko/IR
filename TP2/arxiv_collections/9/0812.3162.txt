CLEO-c measurements of the timelike form factors F_pi, F_K at \sqrt{s}=3.671
GeV provide a direct probe of power corrections (PC's) at energies near m_B.
PC's in F_pi, F_K and B \to K pi, pi pi are separated into perturbative and
soft parts. In F_pi, F_K the latter are \ge O(10) larger. A PC fit to the B \to
K pi, pi pi data also yields a \ge O(10) soft-to-perturbative hierarchy for the
QCD penguin PC's. Hence, both can be attributed to dominance of the soft-ovelap
between energetic (approximately) back-to-back collinear partons, and
consistency of the B\to K pi, pi pi fit with the Standard Model appears to be
naturally realized. The CP asymmetries S_{K_s pi^0}, C_{K_s pi^0} are well
determined, providing a clean test for new physics.
