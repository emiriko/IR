New construction of 4D dynamical space-time (DST) has been proposed in the
framework of unification of relativity and quantum theory. Such unification is
based solely on the fundamental notion of generalized coherent state (GCS) of
N-level system and the geometry of unitary group SU(N) acting in state space
$C^N$. Neither contradictable notion of quantum particle, nor space-time
coordinates (that cannot be a priori attached to nothing) are used in this
construction. Morphogenesis of the "field shell"-lump of GCS and its dynamics
have been studied for N=2 in DST. The main technical problem is to find
non-Abelian gauge field arising from conservation law of the local Hailtonian
vector field. The last one may be expressed as parallel transport of local
Hamiltonian in projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$. Co-movable local "Lorentz
frame" being attached to GCS is used for qubit encoding result of comparison of
the parallel transported local Hamiltonian in infinitesimally close points.
This leads to quasi-linear relativistic field equations with soliton-like
solutions for "field shell" in emerged DST. The terms "comparison" and
"encoding" resemble human's procedure, but here they have objective content
realized in invariant quantum dynamics. The dynamical motion of the lump in DST
may be associated with "kinesis" time whereas the evolution parameter
describing morphogenesis of GCS evolving in $CP(N-1)$, may be naturally
identified with "metabole" time.
