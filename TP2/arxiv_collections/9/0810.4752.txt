Statistical learning theory provides the theoretical basis for many of
today's machine learning algorithms. In this article we attempt to give a
gentle, non-technical overview over the key ideas and insights of statistical
learning theory. We target at a broad audience, not necessarily machine
learning researchers. This paper can serve as a starting point for people who
want to get an overview on the field before diving into technical details.
