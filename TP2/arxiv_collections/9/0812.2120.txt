We show that hierarchically small vacuum expectation values of the
superpotential in supersymmetric theories can be a consequence of an
approximate R symmetry. We briefly discuss the role of such small constants in
moduli stabilization and understanding the huge hierarchy between the Planck
and electroweak scales.
