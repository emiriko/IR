Fine powders of micron- and submicron-sized particles of undoped Cu2O
semiconductor, with three different sizes and morphologies have been
synthesized by different chemical processes. These samples include nanospheres
200 nm in diameter, octahedra of size 1 micron, and polyhedra of size 800 nm.
They exhibit a wide spectrum of magnetic properties. At low temperature, T = 5
K, the octahedron sample is diamagnetic. The nanosphere is paramagnetic. The
other two polyhedron samples synthesized in different runs by the same process
are found to show different magnetic properties. One of them exhibits weak
ferromagnetism with T_C = 455 K and saturation magnetization, M_S = 0.19 emu/g
at T = 5 K, while the other is paramagnetic. The total magnetic moment
estimated from the detected impurity concentration of Fe, Co, and Ni, is too
small to account for the observed magnetism by one to two orders of magnitude.
Calculations by the density functional theory (DFT) reveal that cation
vacancies in the Cu2O lattice are one of the possible causes of induced
magnetic moments. The results further predict that the defect-induced magnetic
moments favour a ferromagnetically coupled ground state if the local
concentration of cation vacancies, n_C, exceeds 12.5%. This offers a possible
scenario to explain the observed magnetic properties. The limitations of the
investigations in the present work, in particular in the theoretical
calculations, are discussed and possible areas for further study are suggested.
