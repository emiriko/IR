It is proposed that to the usual probability theory, three definitions and a
new theorem are added, the resulting theory allows one to displace the central
role usually given to the notion of conditional probability. When a mapping
$\phi$ is defined between two measurable spaces, to each measure $\mu$
introduced on the first space, there corresponds an image $\phi[\mu]$ on the
second space, and, reciprocally, to each measure $\nu$ defined on the second
space the corresponds a reciprocal image $\phi^{-1}[\nu]$ on the first space.
As the intersection $\cap$ of two measures is easy to introduce, a relation
like $ \phi[ \mu \cap \phi^{-1} [\nu] ] = \phi[\mu] \cap \nu $ makes sense. It
is, indeed, a theorem of the theory. This theorem gives mathematical
consistency to inferences drawn from physical measurements.
