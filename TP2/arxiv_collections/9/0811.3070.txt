Elementary excitations in a paramagnetic semiconductor quantum well confined
to a cylindrical surface are theoretically studied on the basis of coupled
spin-charge drift-diffusion equations. The electric-field-mediated eigenmodes
are optically excited by an oscillating interference pattern, which induces a
current in the outer circuit. For a cylinder with a given radius, sharp
resonances are predicted to occur in the steady-state current response, which
are due to weakly damped spin remagnetization waves.
