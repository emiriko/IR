Three-tangle for the rank-three mixture composed of
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger, W and flipped W states is analytically calculated.
The optimal decompositions in the full range of parameter space are constructed
by making use of the convex-roof extension. We also provide an analytical
technique, which determines whether or not an arbitrary rank-3 state has
vanishing three-tangle. This technique is developed by making use of the Bloch
sphere S^8 of the qutrit system. The Coffman-Kundu-Wootters inequality is
discussed by computing one-tangle and concurrences. It is shown that the
one-tangle is always larger than the sum of squared concurrences and
three-tangle. The physical implication of three-tangle is briefly discussed.
