Analytical expressions for the magnetoelastic anisotropy constants of cubic
magnetic systems are derived for rectangular and oblique distortions
originating from epitaxial growth on substrates with lower crystal symmetry. In
particular, the temperature variation of the magnetic properties of magnetic
films grown on barium titanate (BaTiO3) substrates are explained in terms of
strain-induced magnetic anisotropies caused by the temperature dependent phase
transitions of BaTiO3. Our results quantify the experimental observations in
ferromagnet/\bto-based structures, which have been proposed as templates for
magnetoelectric composite heterostructures.
