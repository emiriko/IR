We use classes of Hilbert lattice equations for an alternative representation
of Hilbert lattices and Hilbert spaces of arbitrary quantum systems that might
enable a direct introduction of the states of the systems into quantum
computers. More specifically, we look for a way to feed a quantum computer with
algebraic equations of n-th order underlying an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space description of quantum systems. A number of new results on states defined
on Hilbert lattices are presented and discussed and a number of recently
obtained results in the field of Hilbert space equations are reviewed.
