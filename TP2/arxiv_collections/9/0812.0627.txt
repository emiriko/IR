Coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations were used to study the
morphological changes induced in a Nafion$^{\tiny
  \textregistered}$-like ionomer by the imposition of a strong electric field.
We observe the formation of novel structures aligned along the direction of the
applied field. The polar head groups of the ionomer side chains aggregate into
clusters, which then form rod-like formations which assemble into a hexatic
array aligned with the direction of the field. Occasionally these lines of
sulfonates and protons form a helical structure. Upon removal of the electric
field, the hexatic array of rod-like structures persists, and has a lower
calculated free energy than the original isotropic morphology.
