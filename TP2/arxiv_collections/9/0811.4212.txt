A chiral quark-model approach is extended to the study of the $\bar{K}N$
scattering at low energies. The process of $K^-p\to \Sigma^0\pi^0$ at
$P_K\lesssim 800$ MeV/c (i.e. the center mass energy $W\lesssim 1.7$ GeV) is
investigated. This approach is successful in describing the differential cross
sections and total cross section with the roles of the low-lying $\Lambda$
resonances in $n=1$ shells clarified. The $\Lambda(1405)S_{01}$ dominates the
reactions over the energy region considered here. Around $P_K\simeq 400$ MeV/c,
the $\Lambda(1520)D_{03}$ is responsible for a strong resonant peak in the
cross section. The $\Lambda(1670)S_{01}$ has obvious contributions around
$P_K=750$ MeV/c, while the contribution of $\Lambda(1690)D_{03}$ is less
important in this energy region. The non-resonant background contributions,
i.e. $u$-channel and $t$-channel, also play important roles in the explanation
of the angular distributions due to amplitude interferences.
