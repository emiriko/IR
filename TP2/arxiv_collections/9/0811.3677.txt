There is a profound analogy between inhomogeneous magnetoelectric effect in
multiferroics and flexoelectric effect in liquid crystals. This similarity
gives rise to the flexomagnetoelectric polarization induced by spin modulation.
The theoretical estimations of flexomagnetoelectric polarization agree with the
value of jumps of polarization in magnetoelectric dependences (~20muC/m^2)
observed at spin cycloid suppression at critical magnetic field 200kOe.
