An \textit{ab initio} electronic structure calculation based on the
generalized gradient approximation in the density functional theory is carried
out to study the basic electronic states of hollandite vanadate
K$_2$V$_8$O$_{16}$. We find that the states near the Fermi energy consist
predominantly of the three $t_{2g}$-orbital components and the hybridization
with oxygen $2p$ orbitals is small. The $d_{yz}$ and $d_{zx}$ orbitals are
exactly degenerate and are lifted from the $d_{xy}$ orbital. The calculated
band dispersion and Fermi surface indicate that the system is not purely
one-dimensional but the coupling between the VO double chains is important.
Comparison with available experimental data suggests the importance of electron
correlations in this system.
