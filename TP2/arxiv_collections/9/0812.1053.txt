We summarize our understanding of the dynamical mechanisms governing rapidity
gap survival in central exclusive diffraction, pp -> p + H + p (H = high-mass
system), and discuss the uncertainties in present estimates of the survival
probability. The main suppression of diffractive scattering is due to inelastic
soft spectator interactions at small pp impact parameters and can be described
in a mean-field approximation (independent hard and soft interactions).
Moderate extra suppression results from fluctuations of the partonic
configurations of the colliding protons. At LHC energies absorptive
interactions of hard spectator partons associated with the gg -> H process
reach the black-disk regime and cause substantial additional suppression,
pushing the survival probability below 0.01.
