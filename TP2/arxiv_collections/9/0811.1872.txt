Stochastic differential equations in Hilbert space as random nonlinear
modified Schroedinger equations have achieved great attention in recent years;
of particular interest is the long time behavior of their solutions. In this
note we discuss the long time behavior of the solutions of the stochastic
differential equation describing the time evolution of a free quantum particle
subject to spontaneous collapses in space. We explain why the problem is subtle
and report on a recent rigorous result, which asserts that any initial state
converges almost surely to a Gaussian state having a fixed spread both in
position and momentum.
