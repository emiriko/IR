We present an exact calculation of the effective geometry-induced quantum
potential for a particle confined on a helicoidal ribbon. This potential leads
to the appearance of localized states at the rim of the helicoid. In this
geometry the twist of the ribbon plays the role of an effective transverse
electric field on the surface and thus this is reminiscent of the quantum Hall
effect.
