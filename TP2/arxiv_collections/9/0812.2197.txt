We investigate the microscopic model for the frustrated layered
antiferromagnets Cs2CuCl4 and Cs2CuBr4 by performing ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations and with the help of the tight-binding
method. The combination of both methods provide the relevant interaction paths
in these materials, and we estimate the corresponding exchange constants. We
find for Cs2CuCl4 that the calculated ratio of the strongest in-plane exchange
constants J'/J between the spin-1/2 Cu ions agrees well with neutron scattering
experiments. The microscopic model based on the derived exchange constants is
tested by comparing the magnetic susceptibilities obtained from exact
diagonalization with experimental data. The electronic structure differences
between Cs2CuCl4 and Cs2CuBr4 are also analyzed.
