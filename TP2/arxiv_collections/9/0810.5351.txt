This paper offers several contributions for separation of duty (SoD)
administration in role-based access control (RBAC) systems. We first introduce
a new formal framework, based on business perspective, where SoD constraints
are analyzed introducing the activity concept. This notion helps organizations
define SoD constraints in terms of business requirements and reduces management
complexity in large-scale RBAC systems. The model enables the definition of a
wide taxonomy of conflict types. In particular, object-based SoD is introduced
using the SoD domain concept, namely the set of data in which transaction
conflicts may occur. Together with the formalization of the above properties,
in this paper we also show the effectiveness of our proposal: we have applied
the model to a large, existing organization; results highlight the benefits of
adopting the proposed model in terms of reduced administration cost.
