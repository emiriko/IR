We consider elastic scattering of electrons off a proton target. The parity
violating (PV) asymmetry arises at leading order in $\alpha$ due to
interference of $\gamma$ and $Z$ exchange. The radiative corrections to this
leading mechanism were calculated in the literature and included in
experimental analyses, except for $\gamma Z$ box and cross-box contributions.
We present here a dispersion calculation of these corrections in forward
kinematics. We demonstrate that at the GeV energies of current PV experiments,
such corrections are not suppressed by the small vector weak charge of the
electron, as occurs in the atomic PV. Our results suggest that the current
theoretical uncertainty in the analysis of the QWEAK experiment might be
substantially underestimated, and more accurate account of the dispersion
corrections are needed in order to interprete the PV data.
