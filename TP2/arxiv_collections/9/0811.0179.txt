In this talk we will describe the problems that one encounters when one tries
to connect string theory with particle phenomenology. Then, in order to have
chiral matter describing quarks and leptons, we introduce the magnetized D
branes. Finally, as an explicit example of a string extension of the Standard
Model, we will describe the one constructed by Ibanez, Marchesano and Rabadan.
