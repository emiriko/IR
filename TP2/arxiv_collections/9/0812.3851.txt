We propose finite element methods for compressible barotropic Stokes systems.
We state convergence results for these methods and outline their proofs. The
principal tools of the proofs are higher integrability estimates for the
discrete density, equations for the discrete effective viscous flux, and
renormalized formulations of the numerical method for the density equation.
