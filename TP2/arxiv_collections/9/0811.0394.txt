Twin Higgs models are economical extensions of the Standard Model that
stabilize the electroweak scale. In these theories the Higgs field is a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson that is protected against radiative corrections up to
scales of order 5 TeV by a discrete parity symmetry. We construct, for the
first time, a class of composite twin Higgs models based on confining QCD-like
dynamics. These theories naturally incoporate a custodial isospin symmetry and
predict a rich spectrum of particles with masses of order a TeV that will be
accessible at the LHC.
