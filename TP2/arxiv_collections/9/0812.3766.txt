We study the dynamics of the Jaynes-Cummings Model for an array of $N_q$ two
level systems (or qubits) interacting with a quantized single mode
electromagnetic cavity (or quantum bus). For an initial cavity coherent state
$| \alpha >$ and the qubit system in a specified `basin of attraction' in its
Hilbert space, we demonstrate the oscillation of a superposition of two
macroscopic quantum states between the qubit system and the field mode. From
the perspective of either the qubit or the field system, there is collapse and
revival of a `Schr\"odinger Cat' state.
