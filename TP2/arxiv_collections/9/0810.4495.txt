There is a set of first-order differential equations for the curvature tensor
in general relativity (the curvature equations or CEs for short) that are
strikingly similar to the Maxwell equations of electrodynamics. This paper
considers whether Mother Nature may have used the same basic pattern for her
laws of gravitation and electrodynamics, in which case the CEs might be viewed
as the field equations of gravitation in place of Einstein's equation. This is
not a new theory of gravitation (because the curvature equations are derivable
from Einstein's equation), but rather is a mild reinterpretation of general
relativity that solves the vacuum-energy problem and the dark-energy problem of
cosmology. The results of this paper allow one to understand how the effective
energy density of the observed cosmological constant can be so vastly smaller
than estimates of the vacuum energy of quantum fields and why the vacuum energy
of quantum fields does not contribute as a source of curvature.
