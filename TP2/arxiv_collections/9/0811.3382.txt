We investigate the structure of the Lambda(1405) resonance and Kbar N
phenomenology in the perspective of chiral SU(3) dynamics. Utilizing the chiral
coupled-channel approach which well describes the Kbar N scattering observable,
we perform three different analyses to clarify the structure of the
Lambda(1405) resonance. The results consistently indicate the meson-baryon
molecule picture of the Lambda(1405). We argue the consequence of the chiral
dynamics in Kbar N phenomenology and the antikaon bound state in nucleus,
emphasizing the important role of the strong pi Sigma interaction.
