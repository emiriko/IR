We present a detailed direct numerical simulation (DNS) designed to
investigate the combined effects of walls and Ekman friction on turbulence in
forced soap films. We concentrate on the forward-cascade regime and show how to
extract the isotropic parts of velocity and vorticity structure functions and
thence the ratios of multiscaling exponents. We find that velocity structure
functions display simple scaling whereas their vorticity counterparts show
multiscaling; and the probability distribution function of the Weiss parameter
$\Lambda$, which distinguishes between regions with centers and saddles, is in
quantitative agreement with experiments.
