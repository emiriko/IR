We propose a strange-attractor model of tumor growth and metastasis. It is a
4-dimensional spatio-temporal cancer model with strong nonlinear couplings.
Even the same type of tumor is different in every patient both in size and
appearance, as well as in temporal behavior. This is clearly a characteristic
of dynamical systems sensitive to initial conditions. The new chaotic model of
tumor growth and decay is biologically motivated. It has been developed as a
live Mathematica demonstration, see Wolfram Demonstrator site:
