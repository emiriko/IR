After a period of inflationary expansion, the Universe reheated and reached
full thermal equilibrium at the reheating temperature. In this talk, based on
the paper, arXiv:0710.3349, we point out that, in the context of effective
low-energy supersymmetric models, LHC measurements may allow one to determine
reheating temperature as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle
assumed to be either an axino or a gravitino. An upper bound on their mass and
on the reheating temperature may also be derived.
