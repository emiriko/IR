We use the Random Dispersion Approximation (RDA) to study the Mott-Hubbard
transition in the Hubbard model at half band filling. The RDA becomes exact for
the Hubbard model in infinite dimensions. We implement the RDA on finite chains
and employ the Lanczos exact diagonalization method in real space to calculate
the ground-state energy, the average double occupancy, the charge gap, the
momentum distribution, and the quasi-particle weight. We find a satisfactory
agreement with perturbative results in the weak- and strong-coupling limits. A
straightforward extrapolation of the RDA data for $L\leq 14$ lattice results in
a continuous Mott-Hubbard transition at $U_{\rm c}\approx W$. We discuss the
significance of a possible signature of a coexistence region between insulating
and metallic ground states in the RDA that would correspond to the scenario of
a discontinuous Mott-Hubbard transition as found in numerical investigations of
the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory for the Hubbard model.
