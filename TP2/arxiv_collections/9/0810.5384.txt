We extend topologically massive electrodynamics, both by adding a higher
derivative action to cast the entire three-term model in Chern-Simons (CS)
form, and by embedding it in an AdS background. It can then be written as the
sum of two CS terms, one of which vanishes at the "chiral" point, in analogy
with its gravitational topologically massive counterpart. Separately we treat
pure CS electrodynamics plus Einstein gravity interacting with point sources.
The gravity/vector field equations decouple; their solutions are the familiar
exterior "conical" metric and vector potentials.
