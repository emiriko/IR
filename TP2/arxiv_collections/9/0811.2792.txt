A phenomenological bond order model predicting doping curves [Tc vs doped
charge, c] of cuprates is found to have wider applicability. In this model Tc
is dependent on the density of electronic pair crystals [EC] in a covalently
bonding layer structure and on a layer Isolation factor, f [ECI model].
Characteristic doping curve events such as optima are correlated with a select
number of EC with pair repeats corresponding to multiples of lattice parameters
such as c=2/3x4=0.167, where 3x4 represent pair periodicity of 3a0 and 4b0. At
these EC all doped charge is converted into pairs according to c=2np. For Tc
prediction one writes Tc=2npfTe, where Te=600K and 300K as empirical constants
for hole and electron doping. Doping curves for YBa2Cu3Oy with their sharp
optima or kinks, separated by near linear ranges, or Tc plateaus on different
preparations, can express the stability of special EC. Examples are c=0.22=2/32
for the sharp optimum or the Tc=90K plateau, and c= 0.17 for the 60K plateau,
the latter depicting also the optimum for other systems such as La2-wSrwCuO4.
For oxypnictides R[O1-xFx]FeAs one writes Tc=300x and expects EC with optimal
dopings at x=0.11 and 0.17, as corroborated experimentally. Other examples
include HfN derivatives such as Li0.17HfNCl.
