For Anderson localization on the Cayley tree, we study the statistics of
various observables as a function of the disorder strength $W$ and the number
$N$ of generations. We first consider the Landauer transmission $T_N$. In the
localized phase, its logarithm follows the traveling wave form $\ln T_N \simeq
\bar{\ln T_N} + \ln t^*$ where (i) the disorder-averaged value moves linearly
$\bar{\ln (T_N)} \simeq - \frac{N}{\xi_{loc}}$ and the localization length
diverges as $\xi_{loc} \sim (W-W_c)^{-\nu_{loc}}$ with $\nu_{loc}=1$ (ii) the
variable $t^*$ is a fixed random variable with a power-law tail $P^*(t^*) \sim
1/(t^*)^{1+\beta(W)}$ for large $t^*$ with $0<\beta(W) \leq 1/2$, so that all
integer moments of $T_N$ are governed by rare events. In the delocalized phase,
the transmission $T_N$ remains a finite random variable as $N \to \infty$, and
we measure near criticality the essential singularity $\bar{\ln (T)} \sim - |
W_c-W |^{-\kappa_T}$ with $\kappa_T \sim 0.25$. We then consider the
statistical properties of normalized eigenstates, in particular the entropy and
the Inverse Participation Ratios (I.P.R.). In the localized phase, the typical
entropy diverges as $(W-W_c)^{- \nu_S}$ with $\nu_S \sim 1.5$, whereas it grows
linearly in $N$ in the delocalized phase. Finally for the I.P.R., we explain
how closely related variables propagate as traveling waves in the delocalized
phase. In conclusion, both the localized phase and the delocalized phase are
characterized by the traveling wave propagation of some probability
distributions, and the Anderson localization/delocalization transition then
corresponds to a traveling/non-traveling critical point. Moreover, our results
point towards the existence of several exponents $\nu$ at criticality.
