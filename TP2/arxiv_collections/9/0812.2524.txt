In this paper, based on the formulation of an O(3) non-linear sigma model, we
study the two-dimensional Pi-flux Hubbard model at half-filling. A quantum
non-magnetic insulator is explored near the metal-insulator transition that may
be a possible candidate of the spin liquid state. Such quantum non-magnetic
insulator on square lattice is not induced by frustrations. Instead, it
originates from quantum spin fluctuations with relatively small effective spin
moments. In the strong-coupling limit, our results of the spin velocity and
spin order parameter agree with results obtained from earlier calculations.
