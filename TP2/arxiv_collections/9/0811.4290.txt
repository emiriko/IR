The paper contains theorems on extending sections of line bundles from
divisors to the ambient space, inspired by various results of Siu, Kawamata,
and especially Hacon-McKernan and Takayama. Applications are given to
basepoint-freeness, to the invariance of analogues of plurigenera and of part
of the boundary of the pseudo-effective cone in families, and to a simplified
approach towards part of the results used for proving the existence of flips by
Hacon-McKernan.
