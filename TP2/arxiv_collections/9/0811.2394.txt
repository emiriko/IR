We evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma* -> rhoT taking into
account the twist 3 contributions. We show that a gauge invariant expression is
obtained with the help of QCD equations of motion. Our results are free of
end-point singularities. This opens the way to a consistent treatment of
factorization for exclusive processes with a transversally polarized vector
meson.
