The indistinguishability of independent single photons is presented by
decomposing the single photon pulse into the mixed state of different transform
limited pulses. The entanglement between single photons and outer environment
or other photons induces the distribution of the center frequencies of those
transform limited pulses and makes photons distinguishable. Only the single
photons with the same transform limited form are indistinguishable. In details,
the indistinguishability of single photons from the solid-state quantum emitter
and spontaneous parametric down conversion is examined with two-photon
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. Moreover, experimental methods to enhance the
indistinguishability are discussed, where the usage of spectral filter is
highlighted.
