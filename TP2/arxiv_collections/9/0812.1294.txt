We lay down the foundations of particle dynamics in mechanical theories that
satisfy the relativity principle and whose kinematics can be formulated
employing reference frames of the type usually adopted in special relativity.
Such mechanics allow for the presence of anisotropy, both conventional (due to
non-standard synchronisation protocols) and real (leading to detectable
chronogeometrical effects, independent of the choice of synchronisation). We
give a general method for finding the fundamental dynamical quantities
(Lagrangian, energy and momentum), and write their explicit expression in all
the kinematics compatible with the basic requirements. We also write the
corresponding dispersion relations and outline a formulation of these theories
in terms of a pseudo-Finslerian spacetime geometry. Although the treatment is
restricted to the case of one spatial dimension, an extension to three
dimensions is almost straightforward.
