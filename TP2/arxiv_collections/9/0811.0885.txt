Single-crystalline (Lu, Ca)Ba2Cu3O7-d (Lu(Ca)123) whiskers have been
successfully grown using the Te-doping method. X-ray diffraction patterns of
Lu(Ca)123 whiskers showed sharp (0 0 l) peaks corresponding to REBa2Cu3O7-d
phase (RE = rare earth elements). Transport measurements showed that the
superconducting transition occurred at 83 K in the obtained whiskers.
