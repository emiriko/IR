A canonical relativistic formulation is introduced to quantize
electromagnetic field in the presence of a polarizable and magnetizable moving
medium. The medium is modeled by a continuum of four vectors in a
phenomenological way. The covariant wave equation for the vector potential and
the covariant constitutive equation of the medium are obtained as the Euler-
Lagrange equations using the Lagrangian of the total system. A tensor of the
third rank which couples the electromagnetic field with the medium is
introduced and the susceptibility tensor of the medium is obtained in terms of
the coupling tensor. Also the noise polarization tensor is calculated in terms
of the coupling tensor and the creation and annihilation operators of the four
vectors modeling the medium.
