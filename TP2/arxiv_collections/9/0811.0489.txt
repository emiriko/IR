The average and median income dependence on work experience and time is
analyzed and modeled for the USA. The original data set providing the mean and
median income estimates in 10 year long intervals spans a long time period of
almost 35 years ? from 1967 to 2003. A microeconomic model linking personal
income, population age structure and GDP per capita is used to predict the mean
income values in various age groups and their relative evolution in time. Also
modeled is the value of work experience where the mean income growth ends and
it starts to drop exponentially with increasing age. This work experience
increases through time as the square root of the per capita GDP growth.
Prediction for the following 20 years is given for each age group considering
potential per capita growth rate of 1.6%. The USA mean income dependence on
work experience for 1987 coincides with that for 2002 in the UK ? the years
when per capita GDP were equal in the countries.
