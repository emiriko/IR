According to a widespread view, the Bell theorem establishes the untenability
of so-called 'local realism'. On the basis of this view, recent proposals by
Leggett, Zeilinger and others have been developed according to which it can be
proved that even some non-local realistic theories have to be ruled out. As a
consequence, within this view the Bell theorem allows one to establish that no
reasonable form of realism, be it local or non-local, can be made compatible
with the (experimentally tested) predictions of quantum mechanics. In the
present paper it is argued that the Bell theorem has demonstrably nothing to do
with the 'realism' as defined by these authors and that, as a consequence,
their conclusions about the foundational significance of the Bell theorem are
unjustified.
