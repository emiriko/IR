We apply path integrals to study nonequilibrium work theorems in the context
of Brownian dynamics, deriving in particular the equations of motion governing
the most typical and most dominant trajectories. For the analytically soluble
cases of a moving harmonic potential and a harmonic oscillator with
time-dependent natural frequency, we find such trajectories, evaluate the
work-weighted propagators, and validate Jarzynski's equality.
