Using the nonperturbative method, we study the exact entanglement dynamics of
two two-level dipole-dipole interacting atoms coupled to a common non-Markovian
reservoir with different coupling strengths. Besides analyzing the conditions
for the existence of steady state, we find, though the dipole-dipole
interaction could destroy the stationary entanglement, that relatively strong
dipole-dipole interaction does suppress the disentanglement in the initial
period of time. These results are helpful for the practical engineering of the
entanglement in the future.
