Using results from Schramm Loewner evolution (SLE), we give the expression of
the fluctuation-induced force exerted by a polymer on a small impenetrable
disk, in various 2-dimensional domain geometries. We generalize to two polymers
and examine whether the fluctuation force can trap the object into a stable
equilibrium. We compute the force exerted on objects at the domain boundary,
and the force mediated by the polymer between such objects. The results can
straightforwardly be extended to any SLE interface, including Ising,
percolation, and loop-erased random walks. Some are relevant for extremal value
statistics.
