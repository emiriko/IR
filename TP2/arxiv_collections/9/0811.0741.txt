With the multiplication of XML data sources, many XML data warehouse models
have been proposed to handle data heterogeneity and complexity in a way
relational data warehouses fail to achieve. However, XML-native database
systems currently suffer from limited performances, both in terms of manageable
data volume and response time. Fragmentation helps address both these issues.
Derived horizontal fragmentation is typically used in relational data
warehouses and can definitely be adapted to the XML context. However, the
number of fragments produced by classical algorithms is difficult to control.
In this paper, we propose the use of a k-means-based fragmentation approach
that allows to master the number of fragments through its $k$ parameter. We
experimentally compare its efficiency to classical derived horizontal
fragmentation algorithms adapted to XML data warehouses and show its
superiority.
