We present results on two-particle angular correlations in Cu+Cu and Au+Au
collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon pair of 200 GeV over a broad
range of pseudorapidity ($\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\phi$) as a function of
collision centrality. The PHOBOS detector at RHIC has a uniquely-large angular
coverage for inclusive charged particles, which allows for the study of
correlations on both long- and short-range scales. A complex two-dimensional
correlation structure in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$ emerges, which is
interpreted in the context of a cluster model. The effective cluster size and
decay width are extracted from the two-particle pseudorapidity correlation
functions. The effective cluster size found in semi-central Cu+Cu and Au+Au
collisions is comparable to that found in proton-proton collisions but a
non-trivial decrease of the size with increasing centrality is observed.
Moreover, a comparison between results from Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions shows an
interesting scaling of the effective cluster size with the measured fraction of
total cross section (which is related to the ratio of the impact parameter to
the nuclear radius, $b/2R$), suggesting a geometric origin. Further analysis
for pairs from restricted azimuthal regions shows that the effective cluster
size at $\Delta\phi \sim 180^{\circ}$ drops more rapidly toward central
collisions than the size at $\Delta\phi \sim 0^{\circ}$. The effect of limited
$\eta$ acceptance on the cluster parameters is also addressed, and a correction
is applied to present cluster parameters for full $\eta$ coverage, leading to
much larger effective cluster sizes and widths than previously noted in the
literature. These results should provide insight into the hot and dense medium
created in heavy ion collisions.
