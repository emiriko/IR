We report on measurements of forces acting between two conducting surfaces in
a spherical-plane configuration in the 35 nm-1 micrometer separation range. The
measurements are obtained by performing electrostatic calibrations followed by
a residual analysis after subtracting the electrostatic-dependent component. We
find in all runs optimal fitting of the calibrations for exponents smaller than
the one predicted by electrostatics for an ideal sphere-plane geometry. We also
find that the external bias potential necessary to minimize the electrostatic
contribution depends on the sphere-plane distance. In spite of these anomalies,
by implementing a parametrixation-dependent subtraction of the electrostatic
contribution we have found evidence for short-distance attractive forces of
magnitude comparable to the expected Casimir-Lifshitz force. We finally discuss
the relevance of our findings in the more general context of Casimir-Lifshitz
force measurements, with particular regard to the critical issues of the
electrical and geometrical characterization of the involved surfaces.
