We study the structures of a ribbon or ladder polymer immersed in poor
solvents. The anisotropic bending rigidity coupled with the surface tension
leads ribbon polymers to spontaneous formation of highly anisotropic
condensates in poor solvents. Unlike ordinary flexible polymers these
condensates undergo a number of distinct layering transitions as a function of
chain length or solvent quality, and the size of condensates becomes
non-monotonic function of chain length. We show that the fluctuations of the
condensates are in general small and these condensates are stable.
