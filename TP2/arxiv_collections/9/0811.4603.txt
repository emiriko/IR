Bibliometrics has the ambitious goal of measuring science. To this end, it
exploits the way science is disseminated trough scientific publications and the
resulting citation network of scientific papers. We survey the main historical
contributions to the field, the most interesting bibliometric indicators, and
the most popular bibliometric data sources. Moreover, we discuss distributions
commonly used to model bibliometric phenomena and give an overview of methods
to build bibliometric maps of science.
