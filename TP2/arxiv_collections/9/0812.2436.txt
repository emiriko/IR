The paper by Belyaev et al. [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 72}, 026406 (2005)] reported
the first experimental observation of alpha particles produced in the
thermonuclear reaction $^{11}$B($p,\alpha$)$^{8}$Be induced by
laser-irradiation on a $^{11}$B polyethylene (CH$_2$) composite target. The
laser used in the experiment is characterized by a picosecond pulse duration
and a peak of intensity of 2$\times10^{18}$ W/cm$^2$. We suggest that both the
background-reduction method adopted in their detection system and the choice of
the detection energy region of the reaction products are possibly inadequate.
Consequently the total yield reported underestimates the true yield. Based on
their observation, we give an estimation of the total yield to be higher than
their conclusion, i.e., of the order of 10$^5 \alpha$ per shot.
