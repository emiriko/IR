We report measurements on a silicon nanowire quantum dot with a clarity that
allows for a complete understanding of the spin states of the first four holes.
First, we show control of the hole number down to one. Detailed measurements at
perpendicular magnetic fields reveal the Zeeman splitting of a single hole in
silicon. We are able to determine the ground-state spin configuration for one
to four holes occupying the quantum dot and find a spin filling with
alternating spin-down and spin-up holes, which is confirmed by
magnetospectroscopy up to 9T. Additionally, a so far inexplicable feature in
single-charge quantum dots in many materials systems is analyzed in detail. We
observe excitations of the zero-hole ground-state energy of the quantum dot,
which cannot correspond to electronic or Zeeman states. We show that the most
likely explanation is acoustic phonon emission to a cavity between the two
contacts to the nanowire.
