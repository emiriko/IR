For more than 50 years the Delta N gamma form factors have been studied
experimentally, theoretically, and phenomenologically. Although there has been
substantial progress in understanding their behavior, there remains much work
to be done. A major tool used in many investigations is the Jones-Scadron Delta
rest frame parametrization of the three Delta N gamma form factors. We point
out that many studies utilizing this parametrization may not account for Wigner
rotations and the consequent helicity mixing that ensues when the Delta is not
at rest.
