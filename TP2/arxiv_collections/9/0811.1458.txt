We consider an exact mu-tau reflection symmetry in neutrino sectorrealized at
the GUT scale in the context of the seesaw model with and without
supersymmetry. Assuming the two lighter heavy Majorana neutrinos are degenerate
at the GUT scale, it is shown that the renormalization group (RG) evolution
from the GUT scale to the seesaw scale gives rise to breaking of the mu-tau
symmetry and a tiny splitting between two degenerate heavy Majorana neutrino
masses as well as small variations of the CP phases in Y_nu, which are
essential to achieve a successful leptogenesis. Such small RG effects lead to
tiny deviations of theta_{23} from the maximal value and the CP phase
delta_{CP} from pi/2 imposed at the GUT scale due to mu-tau reflection
symmetry. In our scenario, the required amount of the baryon asymmetry eta_B
can be generated via so-called resonant e-leptogenesis, in which the wash-out
factor concerned with electron flavor plays a crucial role in reproducing a
successful leptogenesis. We show that CP violation responsible for the
generation of baryon asymmetry of our universe can be directly linked with CP
violation measurable through neutrino oscillation as well as neutrino mixing
angles theta_{12} and theta_{13}. We expect that, in addition to the reactor
and long baseline neutrino experiments, the measurements for the supersymmetric
parameter tan{beta} at future collider experiments would serve as an indirect
test of our scenario of baryogenesis based on the mu-tau reflection symmetry.
