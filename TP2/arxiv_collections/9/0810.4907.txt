Kapranov Theorem is a well known generalization of Newton-Puiseux theorem for
the case of several variables.
  This theorem is stated mainly in the context of tropical geometry. We present
a new, constructive proof, that also characterizes the possible principal terms
of points in a hypersurface contained in the algebraic torus $(K^*)^n$.
