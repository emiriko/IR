We argue that surface magnetization of a metallic ferromagnet can be turned
on and off isothermally by an applied voltage. For this, the material's
electron subsystem must be close enough to the boundary between para- and
ferromagnetic regions on the electron density scale. For the 3d series, the
boundary is between Ni and Cu, which makes their alloy a primary candidate.
Using Ginzburg-Landau functional, which we build from Ni_(1-x)Cu_x empirical
properties, ab-initio parameters of Ni and Cu, and orbital-free LSDA, we show
that the proposed effect is experimentally observable.
