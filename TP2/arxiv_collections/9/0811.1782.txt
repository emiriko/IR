We address quantum invisibility in the context of electronics in nanoscale
quantum structures. We make use of the freedom of design that quantum corrals
provide and show that quantum mechanical objects can be hidden inside the
corral, with respect to inelastic electron scattering spectroscopy in
combination with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we propose a design
strategy. A simple illustration of the invisibility is given in terms of an
elliptic quantum corral containing a molecule, with a local vibrational mode,
at one of the foci. Our work has implications to quantum information technology
and presents new tools for nonlocal quantum detection and distinguishing
between different molecules.
