We present a numerical study of the self-similar solutions of the Localized
Induction Approximation of a vortex filament. These self-similar solutions,
which constitute a one-parameter family, develop a singularity at finite time.
We study a number of boundary conditions that allow us reproduce the mechanism
of singularity formation. Some related questions are also considered.
