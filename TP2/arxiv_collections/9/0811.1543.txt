We revisit a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with open
boundaries and a global constraint on the total number of particles [Adams, et.
al. 2008 J. Stat. Mech. P06009]. In this model, the entry rate of particles
into the lattice depends on the number available in the reservoir. Thus, the
total occupation on the lattice feeds back into its filling process. Although a
simple domain wall theory provided reasonably good predictions for Monte Carlo
simulation results for certain quantities, it did not account for the
fluctuations of this feedback. We generalize the previous study and find
dramatically improved predictions for, e.g., the density profile on the lattice
and provide a better understanding of the phenomenon of "shock localization."
