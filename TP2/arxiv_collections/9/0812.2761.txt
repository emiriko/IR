For SU(2) lattice gauge theory we study numerically the infrared behavior of
the Landau gauge ghost and gluon propagators with the special accent on the
Gribov copy dependence. Applying a very efficient gauge fixing procedure and
generating up to 80 gauge copies we find that the Gribov copy effect for both
propagators is essential in the infrared. In particular, our best copy dressing
function of the ghost propagator approaches a plateau in the infrared, while
for the random first copy it still grows. Our best copy zero-momentum gluon
propagator shows a tendency to decrease with growing lattice size which
excludes singular solutions. Our results look compatible with the so-called
decoupling solution with a non-singular gluon propagator. However, we do not
yet consider the Gribov copy problem to be finally resolved.
