In this paper, we prove a priori estimates in Lagrangian coordinates for the
equations of motion of an incompressible, inviscid, self-gravitating fluid with
free boundary. The estimates show that on a finite time interval we control
five derivatives of the fluid velocity and five and a half derivatives of the
coordinates of the moving domain.
