The purpose of this note is to discuss how various Sobolev spaces defined on
multiple cones behave with respect to density of smooth functions,
interpolation and extension/restriction to/from $\RR^n$. The analysis
interestingly combines use of Poincar\'e inequalities and of some Hardy type
inequalities.
