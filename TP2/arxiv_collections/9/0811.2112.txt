The canonical partition function approach was designed to avoid the overlap
problem that affects the lattice simulations of nuclear matter at high density.
The method employs the projections of the quark determinant on a fix quark
number sector. When the quark number is large, the evaluation of the projected
determinant becomes numerically unstable. In this paper a different evaluation
method based on expanding the determinant in terms of loops winding around the
lattice is studied. We show that this method is stable and significantly faster
than our original algorithm. This greatly expands the range of quark numbers
that we can simulate effectively.
