In this paper, we show recent results indicating that using electrical noise
as information carrier offers outstanding potentials reminding of quantum
informatics. One example is noise-based computing and logic that shows certain
similarities to quantum logic. However, due to the lack of the collapse of
wavefunction and due to the immediate accessibility of superposition
components, the use of noise-based and quantum computers will probably be
different. Another example is secure communications where, out of the
unconditional security at idealistic situations, a practical security beyond
known quantum solutions can be achieved and has been demonstrated. Here the
keys to security are the robustness of classical information, and the second
law of thermodynamics. These offer the avoidance of making error statistics and
single bit security. It has the potential to restrict the practical
applications of quantum communicators to the situations where no wire can be
used but optical communication via fiber or via space is possible.
