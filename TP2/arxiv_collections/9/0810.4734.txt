We present a cluster covering scheme to construct the two-dimensional
octagonal quasilattice. A quasi-unit cell is successfully found which is a
two-color cluster similar to the Gummelt's two-color decagon in five-fold
quasilattice. The quasi-unit cells overlap each other following certain
covering rules and thus lead to a perfect octagonal quasilattice.
