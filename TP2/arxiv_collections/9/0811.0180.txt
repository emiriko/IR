We compare Raman spectra from aqueous suspensions of length-separated
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) dispersed using either polymer
adsorption of single-stranded DNA or miscelle encapsulation with sodium
deoxycholate surfactant. The Raman spectral features, other than the D-band,
increase monotonically with nanotube length in both dispersion schemes. The
intensity ratio of the disorder-induced D to G' Raman bands decays as a
function of SWCNT length, proportional to 1/L, as expected for endcap defects.
While the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence also increase with length for both
dispersants, the fluorescence intensity is dramatically lower for DNA-wrapped
SWCNTs of equal length. The similarities in the length-dependent D/G' ratios
exclude defects as an explanation for the fluorescence decrease in DNA versus
deoxycholate dispersions.
