We formulate the coherent state path integral on a two dimensional
noncommutative plane using the fact that noncommuative quantum mechanics can be
viewed as a quantum system on the Hilbert space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators
acting on noncommutative configuration space. The propagation kernel for the
free particle shows ultra-violet cutoff which agrees with the earlier
investigations made in the literature but the approach differs substantially
from the earlier studies.
