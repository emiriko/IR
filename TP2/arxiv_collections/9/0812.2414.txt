In a topological quantum computer, braids of non-Abelian anyons in a
(2+1)-dimensional space-time form quantum gates, whose fault tolerance relies
on the topological, rather than geometric, properties of the braids. Here we
propose to create and exploit redundant geometric degrees of freedom to improve
the theoretical accuracy of topological single- and two-qubit quantum gates. We
demonstrate the power of the idea using explicit constructions in the Fibonacci
model. We compare its efficiency with that of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm and
explain its connection to the leakage errors reduction in an earlier
construction [Phys. Rev. A 78, 042325 (2008)].
