A certain dilogarithmic integral I_7 turns up in a number of contexts
including Feynman diagram calculations, volumes of tetrahedra in hyperbolic
geometry, knot theory, and conjectured relations in analytic number theory. We
provide an alternative explicit evaluation of a parameterized family of
integrals containing this particular case. By invoking the Bloch-Wigner form of
the dilogarithm function, we produce an equivalent result, giving a third
evaluation of I_7. We also alternatively formulate some conjectures which we
pose in terms of values of the specific Clausen function Cl_2.
