In 2008 Petersen posed a list of questions on the application of
trans-quasiconformal Siegel surgery developed by Zakeri and himself. In this
paper we extend Petersen-Zakeri's idea so that the surgery can be applied to
all the premodels which have no "free critical points". We explain how the idea
is used in solving three of the questions posed by Petersen. To present the
details of the idea, we focus on the solution of one of them: we prove that for
typical rotation numbers $0< \theta < 1$, the boundary of the Siegel disk of
$f_{\theta}(z) = e^{2 \pi i \theta} \sin (z)$ is a Jordan curve which passes
through exactly two critical points $\pi/2$ and $-\pi/2$.
