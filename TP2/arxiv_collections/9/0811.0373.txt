This is the second of a series of papers devoted to develop a microscopical
approach to the dipole emission process and its relation to coherent transport
in random media. In this Letter, we deduce a relation between the transverse
decay rate of an emitter in a virtual cavity and the complex refraction index
of the host medium. We argue on the possibility of a criterion for
inhibition/enhancement of spontaneous emission in function of the transition
frequency and the correlation length of the host scatterers. In addition, we
study the radiative/non-radiative nature of the net power emission through a
microscopical analysis of the scattering events involved. This study reveals
essential discrepancies with previous interpretations.
