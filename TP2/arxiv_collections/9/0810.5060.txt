We reconsider both the global and local stability of solutions of
continuously evolving dynamical systems from a geometric perspective. We
clarify that an unambiguous definition of stability generally requires the
choice of additional geometric structure that is not intrinsic to the dynamical
system itself. While global Lyapunov stability is based on the choice of
seminorms on the vector bundle of perturbations, we propose a definition of
local stability based on the choice of a linear connection. We show how this
definition reproduces known stability criteria for second order dynamical
systems. In contrast to the general case, the special geometry of Lagrangian
systems provides completely intrinsic notions of global and local stability. We
demonstrate that these do not suffer from the limitations occurring in the
analysis of the Maupertuis-Jacobi geodesics associated to natural Lagrangian
systems.
