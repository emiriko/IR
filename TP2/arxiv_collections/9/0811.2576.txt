The usefulness of the genuinely entangled six qubit state that was recently
introduced by Borras et al. is investigated for the quantum teleportation of an
arbitrary three qubit state and for quantum state sharing (QSTS) of an
arbitrary two qubit state. For QSTS, we explicitly devise two protocols and
construct sixteen orthogonal measurement basis which can lock an arbitrary two
qubit information between two parties.
