The dispersion of index-guiding microstructured polymer optical fibers is
calculated for second-harmonic generation. The quadratic nonlinearity is
assumed to come from poling of the polymer, which in this study is chosen to be
the cyclic olefin copolymer Topas. We found a very large phase mismatch between
the pump and the second-harmonic waves. Therefore the potential for cascaded
quadratic second-harmonic generation is investigated in particular for soliton
compression of fs pulses. We found that excitation of temporal solitons from
cascaded quadratic nonlinearities requires an effective quadratic nonlinearity
of 5 pm/V or more. This might be reduced if a polymer with a low Kerr nonlinear
refractive index is used. We also found that the group-velocity mismatch could
be minimized if the design parameters of the microstructured fiber are chosen
so the relative hole size is large and the hole pitch is on the order of the
pump wavelength. Almost all design-parameter combinations resulted in cascaded
effects in the stationary regime, where efficient and clean soliton compression
can be found. We therefore did not see any benefit from choosing a fiber design
where the group-velocity mismatch was minimized. Instead numerical simulations
showed excellent compression of $\lambda=800$ nm 120 fs pulses with nJ pulse
energy to few-cycle duration using a standard endlessly single-mode design with
a relative hole size of 0.4.
