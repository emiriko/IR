In some cases it may be useful to know parton distributions in a photon gas.
This may be relevant, e.g., for the analysis of interactions of high energy
cosmic ray particles with the cosmic microwave background radiation. The latter
can be considered as a gas of photons with an almost perfect blackbody
spectrum. An approach to finding such parton distributions is described. The
survival probability of ultra-high energy neutrinos traveling through this
radiation is calculated.
