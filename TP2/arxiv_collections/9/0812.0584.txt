Using the local control theory we derive analytical expressions for magnetic
field pulses that steer the magnetization of a monodomain magnetic nanoparticle
to a predefined state. Finite-temperature full numerical simulations confirm
the analytical results and show that a magnetization switching or freezing is
achievable within few precessional periods and that the scheme is exploitable
for fast thermal switching.
