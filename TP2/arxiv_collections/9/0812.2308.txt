We study the one-dimensional ballistic aggregation process in the continuum
limit for one-sided Brownian initial velocity (i.e. particles merge when they
collide and move freely between collisions, and in the continuum limit the
initial velocity on the right side is a Brownian motion that starts from the
origin $x=0$). We consider the cases where the left side is either at rest or
empty at $t=0$. We derive explicit expressions for the velocity distribution
and the mean density and current profiles built by this out-of-equilibrium
system. We find that on the right side the mean density remains constant
whereas the mean current is uniform and grows linearly with time. All
quantities show an exponential decay on the far left. We also obtain the
properties of the leftmost cluster that travels towards the left. We find that
in both cases relevant lengths and masses scale as $t^2$ and the evolution is
self-similar.
