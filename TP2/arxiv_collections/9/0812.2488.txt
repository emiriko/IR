Compactifications of heterotic string theory on Generalized Calabi-Yau
manifolds have been expected to give the same type of flexibility that type IIB
compactifications on Calabi-Yau orientifolds have. In this note we generalize
the work done on half-flat manifolds by other authors, to show how flux
quantization occurs in the general case, by starting with a basis of harmonic
forms and then extending it. However it turns out that only the axions
associated with the non-harmonic directions in the space of Kaehler moduli, can
be stabilized by the geometric (torsion) terms. Also we argue that there are no
supersymmetric extrema of the potential when the second (and fourth) cohomology
groups on the manifold are non-trivial. We suggest that threshold corrections
to the classical gauge coupling function could solve these problems.
