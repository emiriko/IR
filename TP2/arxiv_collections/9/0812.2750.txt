We define a modification of the Erdos-Renyi random graph process which can be
regarded as the mean field frozen percolation process. We describe the behavior
of the process using differential equations and investigate their solutions in
order to show the self-organized critical and extremum properties of the
critical frozen percolation model. We prove two limit theorems about the
distribution of the size of the component of a typical frozen vertex.
