We study in the BFKL approach the total hadronic cross section for the
collision of two virtual photons for energies in the range of LEP2 and of
future linear colliders. The BFKL resummation is done at the next-to-leading
order in the BFKL Green's function; photon impact factors are taken instead at
the leading order, but with the inclusion of the subleading terms required by
invariance under changes of the renormalization scale and of the BFKL scale
$s_0$. We compare our results with previous estimations based on a similar kind
of approximation.
