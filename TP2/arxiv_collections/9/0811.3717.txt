Fluctuation theorems (FTs), which describe some universal properties of
nonequilibrium fluctuations, are examined from a quantum perspective and
derived by introducing a two-point measurement on the system. FTs for closed
and open systems driven out of equilibrium by an external time-dependent force,
and for open systems maintained in a nonequilibrium steady-state by
nonequilibrium boundary conditions, are derived from a unified approach.
Applications to fermion and boson transport in quantum junctions are discussed.
Quantum master equations and Green's functions techniques for computing the
energy and particle statistics are presented.
