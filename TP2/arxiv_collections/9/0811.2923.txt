We investigate the chiral phase transition at finite temperatures and zero
chemical potential with Dyson-Schwinger equations. Our truncation for the
quark-gluon interaction includes mesonic degrees of freedom, which allows us to
study the impact of the pions on the nature of the phase transition. Within the
present scheme we find a five percent change of the critical temperature due to
the pion backreaction whereas the mean field character of the transition is not
changed.
