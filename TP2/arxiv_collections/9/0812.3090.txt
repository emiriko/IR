We analyse the newest diffractive deep inelastic scattering data from the
DESY collider HERA with the help of dipole models. We find good agreement with
the data on the diffractive structure functions provided the diffractive open
charm contribution is taken into account. However, the region of large
diffractive mass (small values of a parameter beta) needs some refinement with
the help of an additional gluon radiation.
