A system of two discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the
Ablowitz-Ladik type with a saturable nonlinearity is shown to admit a doubly
periodic wave, whose long wave limit is also derived. As a by-product, several
new solutions of the elliptic type are provided for NLS-type discrete and
continuous systems.
