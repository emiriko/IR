We have performed numerical simulations of SU(3) gauge theory coupled to Nf=2
flavors of symmetric representation fermions. The fermions are discretized with
the tadpole-improved clover action. Our simulations are done on lattices of
length L=6, 8, and 12. In all simulation volumes we observe a crossover from a
strongly coupled confined phase to a weak coupling deconfined phase.
Degeneracies in screening masses, plus the behavior of the pseudoscalar decay
constant, indicate that the deconfined phase is also a phase in which chiral
symmetry is restored. The movement of the confinement transition as the volume
is changed is consistent with avoidance of the basin of attraction of an
infrared fixed point of the massless theory.
