Models of warped extra dimensions with custodial symmetry usually predict the
existence of a light Kaluza-Klein fermion arising as a partner of the
right-handed top quark, sometimes called light custodians which we will denote
$\tilde{b}_R$. The production of these particles at the LHC can give rise to
multi-W events which could be observed in same-sign dilepton channels, but its
mass reconstruction is challenging. In this letter we study the possibility of
finding a signal for the pair production of this new particle at the LHC
focusing on a rarer, but cleaner decay mode of a light custodian into a $Z$
boson and a $b$-quark. In this mode it would be possible to reconstruct the
light custodian mass.
  In addition to the dominant standard model QCD production processes, we
include the contribution of a Kaluza-Klein gluon first mode. We find that the
$\tilde{b}_R$ stands out from the background as a peak in the $b Z$ invariant
mass. However, when taking into account only the electronic and muonic decay
modes of the $Z$ boson and $b-$tagging efficiencies, the LHC will have access
only to the very light range of masses, $m_{\tilde{b}} = {\cal O} (500)$ GeV.
