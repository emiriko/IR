The paper offers a unified approach to the study of three locally adaptive
estimation methods in the context of univariate time series from both
theoretical and empirical points of view. A general procedure for the
computation of critical values is given. The underlying model encompasses all
distributions from the exponential family providing for great flexibility. The
procedures are applied to simulated and real financial data distributed
according to the Gaussian, volatility, Poisson, exponential and Bernoulli
models. Numerical results exhibit a very reasonable performance of the methods.
