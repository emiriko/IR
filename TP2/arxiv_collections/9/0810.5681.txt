Concepts and techniques from the theory of G-structures of higher order are
applied to the study of certain structures (volume forms, conformal structures,
linear connections and projective structures) defined on a pseudo-Riemanniann
manifold. Several relationships between the structures involved have been
investigated. The operations allowed on G-structures, such as intersection,
inclusion, reduction, extension and prolongation, were used for it.
