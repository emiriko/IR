Recently, Jouve et al(A&A, 2008) published the paper that presents the
numerical benchmark for the solar dynamo models. Here, I would like to show a
way how to get it with help of computer algebra system Maxima. This way was
used in our paper (Pipin & Seehafer, A&A 2008, in print) to test some new ideas
in the large-scale stellar dynamos. In the present paper I complement the
dynamo benchmark with the standard test that address the problem of the
free-decay modes in the sphere which is submerged in vacuum.
