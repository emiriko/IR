We developed a genetic algorithm (GA) in the Heisenberg model that combines a
triadic crossover and a parameter-free genetic algorithm. Using the algorithm,
we examined the ground-state stiffness of the $\pm J$ Heisenberg model in three
dimensions up to a moderate size range. Results showed the stiffness constant
of $\theta = 0$ in the periodic-antiperiodic boundary condition method and that
of $\theta \sim 0.62$ in the open-boundary-twist method. We considered the
origin of the difference in $\theta$ between the two methods and suggested that
both results show the same thing: the ground state of the open system is stable
against a weak perturbation.
