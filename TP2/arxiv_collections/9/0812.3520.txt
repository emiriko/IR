We present results from MARS Monte Carlo simulations of the accepted pion and
muon yields when a 10 GeV parabolic proton beam interacts with a solid or
powdered (50% density) tungsten target for a Neutrino Factory. We compare these
yields with the mercury jet target configuration and find that they all give
similar rates of pion production. Also provided are estimates of the amount of
pion re-absorption inside the target.
