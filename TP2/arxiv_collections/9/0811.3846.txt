In the paper it is demonstrated that a point-like dust in a Lienard-Wiechert
potential under the constraint of axial gauging must change its velocity
'beyond' a mere change in direction when a fraction of charge is lost at a
point in space-time. The existence of a postulated hidden entity that
introduces a Lorentz contraction avoids a concealed contradiction in repeated
experimentation with charge loss in point-like dust.
