In this article we present a statistical version of the Candes-Tao restricted
isometry property (SRIP for short) which holds in general for any incoherent
dictionary which is a disjoint union of orthonormal bases. In addition, we show
that, under appropriate normalization, the eigenvalues of the associated Gram
matrix fluctuate around 1 according to the Wigner semicircle distribution. The
result is then applied to various dictionaries that arise naturally in the
setting of finite harmonic analysis, giving, in particular, a better
understanding on a remark of Applebaum-Howard-Searle-Calderbank concerning RIP
for the Heisenberg dictionary of chirp like functions.
