We study quantum communication through an anisotropic Heisenberg XY chain in
a transverse magnetic field. We find that for some time $t$ and anisotropy
parameter $\gamma$, one can transfer a state with a relatively high fidelity.
In the strong-field regime, the anisotropy does not significantly affect the
fidelity while in the weak-field regime the affect is quite pronounced. The
most interesting case is the the intermediate regime where the oscillation of
the fidelity with time is low and the high-fidelity peaks are relatively broad.
This would, in principle, allow for quantum communication in realistic
circumstances. Moreover, we calculate the purity, or tangle, as a measure of
the entanglement between one spin and all the other spins in the chain and find
that the stronger the anisotropy and exchange interaction, the more
entanglement will be generated for a given time.
