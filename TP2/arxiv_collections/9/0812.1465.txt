Pion energy reconstruction is studied using the data collected during the
2004 ATLAS combined test beam. The strategy to extract corrections for the
non-compensating nature of the ATLAS calorimeters for dead material losses and
for leakage effects is discussed and assessed. The default ATLAS strategy based
on a weighting technique of the energy deposits in calorimeter cells is
presented and compared to a novel technique exploiting correlations among
energy deposited in calorimeter layers.
