The notes which play the most important and second most important roles in
expressing a raga are called Vadi and Samvadi swars respectively in (North)
Indian Classical music. Like Bageshree, Bhairavi, Shankara, Hamir and Kalingra,
Rageshree is another controversial raga so far as the choice of Vadi-Samvadi
selection is concerned where there are two different opinions. In the present
work, a two minute vocal recording of raga Rageshree is subjected to a careful
statistical analysis. Our analysis is broken into three phases: first half,
middle half and last half. Under a multinomial model set up holding appreciably
in the first two phases, only one opinion is found acceptable. In the last
phase the distribution seems to be quasi multinomial, characterized by an
unstable nature of relative occurrence of pitch of all the notes and although
the note whose relative occurrence of pitch suddenly shoots is the Vadi swar
selected from our analysis of the first two phases, we take it as an outlier
demanding a separate treatment like any other in statistics. Selection of
Vadi-Samvadi notes in a quasi-multinomial set up is still an open research
problem. An interesting musical cocktail is proposed, however, embedding
several ideas like melodic property of notes, note combinations and pitch
movements between notes, using some weighted combination of psychological and
statistical stability of notes along with watching carefully the sudden shoot
of one or more notes whenever there is enough evidence that multinomial model
has broken down.
