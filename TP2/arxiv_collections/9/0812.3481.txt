We consider coherent single-electron dynamics in the one-dimensional
nanostructure under resonant electromagnetic pulse. The structure is composed
of two deep quantum wells positioned at the edges of structure and separated by
a sequence of shallow internal wells. We show that complete electron transfer
between the states localized in the edge wells through one of excited
delocalized states can take place at discrete set of times provided that the
pulse frequency matches one of resonant transition frequencies. The transfer
time varies from several tens to several hundreds of picoseconds and depends on
the structure and pulse parameters. The results obtained in this paper can be
applied to the developments of the quantum networks used in quantum
communications and/or quantum information processing.
