A covariant quark model, based both on the spectator formalism and on vector
meson dominance, and previously calibrated by the physical data, is here
extended to the unphysical region of the lattice data by means of one single
extra adjustable parameter - the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit. We
calculated the Nucleon (N) and the gamma N -> Delta form factors in the
universe of values for that parameter described by quenched lattice QCD. A
qualitative description of the Nucleon and gamma N -> Delta form factors
lattice data is achieved for light pions.
