The spin injection and accumulation in metallic lateral spin valves with
transparent interfaces is studied using d.c. injection current. Unlike
a.c.-based techniques, this allows investigating the effects of the direction
and magnitude of the injected current. We find that the spin accumulation is
reversed by changing the direction of the injected current, whereas its
magnitude does not change. The injection mechanism for both current directions
is thus perfectly symmetric, leading to the same spin injection efficiency for
both spin types. This result is accounted for by a spin-dependent diffusion
model. Joule heating increases considerably the local temperature in the spin
valves when high current densities are injected ($\sim$80--105 K for
1--2$\times10^{7}$A cm$^{-2}$), strongly affecting the spin accumulation.
