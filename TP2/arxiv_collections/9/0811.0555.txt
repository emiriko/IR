We investigate the effect of the anisotropy between the s-wave scattering
lengths of a three-component atomic Fermi gas loaded into a one-dimensional
optical lattice. We find four different phases which support trionic
instabilities made of bound states of three fermions. These phases distinguish
themselves by the relative phases between the 2$k_F$ atomic density waves
fluctuations of the three species. At small enough densities or strong
anisotropies we give further evidences for a decoupling and the stabilization
of more conventional BCS phases. Finally our results are discussed in light of
a recent experiment on $^{6}$Li atoms.
