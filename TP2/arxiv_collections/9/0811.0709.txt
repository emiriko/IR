In this paper we argue that Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), also
known as Large Games are an interesting research tool for policy
experimentation. One of the major problems with lawmaking is that testing the
laws is a difficult enterprise. Here we show that the concept of an MMOG can be
used to experiment with environmental laws on a large scale, provided that the
MMOG is a real game, i.e., it is fun, addictive, presents challenges that last,
etc.. We present a detailed game concept as an initial step.
