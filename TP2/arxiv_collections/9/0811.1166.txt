We prove the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for the ground state energy of the 3D
Bose gas with repulsive interactions described by the exponential function, in
a simultaneous limit of weak coupling and high density. In particular, we show
that the Bogoliubov approximation is exact in an appropriate parameter regime,
as far as the ground state energy is concerned.
