This article investigates nonparametric estimation of variance functions for
functional data when the mean function is unknown. We obtain asymptotic results
for the kernel estimator based on squared residuals. Similar to the finite
dimensional case, our asymptotic result shows the smoothness of the unknown
mean function has an effect on the rate of convergence. Our simulaton studies
demonstrate that estimator based on residuals performs much better than that
based on conditional second moment of the responses.
