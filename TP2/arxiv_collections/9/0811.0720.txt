Understanding the spin dynamics in semiconductor heterostructures is highly
important for future semiconductor spintronic devices. In high-mobility
two-dimensional electron systems (2DES), the spin lifetime strongly depends on
the initial degree of spin polarization due to the electron-electron
interaction. The Hartree-Fock (HF) term of the Coulomb interaction acts like an
effective out-of-plane magnetic field and thus reduces the spin-flip rate. By
time-resolved Faraday rotation (TRFR) techniques, we demonstrate that the spin
lifetime is increased by an order of magnitude as the initial spin polarization
degree is raised from the low-polarization limit to several percent. We perform
control experiments to decouple the excitation density in the sample from the
spin polarization degree and investigate the interplay of the internal HF field
and an external perpendicular magnetic field. The lifetime of spins oriented in
the plane of a [001]-grown 2DES is strongly anisotropic if the Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit fields are of the same order of magnitude. This
anisotropy, which stems from the interference of the Rashba and the Dresselhaus
spin-orbit fields, is highly density-dependent: as the electron density is
increased, the kubic Dresselhaus term becomes dominant and reduces the
anisotropy.
