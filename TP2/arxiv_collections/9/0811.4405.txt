The quark's behaviour while influenced by a strong stochastic gluon field is
analyzed. An approximate procedure for calculating the effective Hamiltonian is
developed and the corresponding ground state within the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov
approach is found. The comparative analysis of various Hamiltonian models is
given and transition to the chiral limit in the Keldysh model is discussed in
detail.
