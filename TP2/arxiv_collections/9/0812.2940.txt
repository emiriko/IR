An optical shutter based on charged particles is presented. The output light
intensity of the proposed device has an intrinsic dependence on the
interparticle spacing between charged particles, which can be controlled by
varying voltages applied to the control electrodes. The interparticle spacing
between charged particles can be varied continuously and this opens up the
possibility of particle based displays with continuous grayscale.
