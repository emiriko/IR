Transversal gates play an important role in the theory of fault-tolerant
quantum computation due to their simplicity and robustness to noise. By
definition, transversal operators do not couple physical subsystems within the
same code block. Consequently, such operators do not spread errors within code
blocks and are, therefore, fault tolerant. Nonetheless, other methods of
ensuring fault tolerance are required, as it is invariably the case that some
encoded gates cannot be implemented transversally. This observation has led to
a long-standing conjecture that transversal encoded gate sets cannot be
universal. Here we show that the ability of a quantum code to detect an
arbitrary error on any single physical subsystem is incompatible with the
existence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set for the code.
