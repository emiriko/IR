The construction of the Bayesian credible (confidence) interval for a Poisson
observable including both the signal and background with and without systematic
uncertainties is presented. Introducing the conditional probability satisfying
the requirement of the background not larger than the observed events to
construct the Bayesian credible interval is also discussed. A Fortran routine,
BPOCI, has been developed to implement the calculation.
