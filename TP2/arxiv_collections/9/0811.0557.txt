We provide an explicit formula for the Tornheim double series T(a,0,c) in
terms of an integral involving the Hurwitz zeta function. For integer values of
the parameters, a=m, c=n, we show that in the most interesting case of even
weight N:=m+n the Tornheim sum T(m,0,n) can be expressed in terms of zeta
values and the family of integrals

  \int_0^1 loggamma(q) B_{k}(q) Cl_{j+1} (2 \pi q) dq,
  % with k+j = N, where B_{k}(q) is a Bernoulli polynomial and \Cl_{j+1}(x) is
a Clausen function.
