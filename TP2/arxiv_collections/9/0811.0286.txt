In this paper the existence of the Higgs field is taken as an undeniable
starting point. However, the origin of the field is challenged. Rather than
ascribing the origin of it to a yet undiscovered phantom particle, the origin
is ascribed directly to electromagnetic energy, in particular as magnetic
charge next to electric charge of elementary pointlike particles. To this end
two instruments are used. The first one is the transform of the Higgs field
from a functional description into a spatial description, without changing the
basic properties. The other instrument is the concept of the magnetic monopole,
as introduced by Dirac. The two instruments appear to fit well together. The
results of all of this is that electromagnetic energy on its own is the source
of all mass. It implies that the search after the Higgs particle will remain
fruitless. No other equations, apart from Maxwell's Equations and Dirac's
Equation are required to express the fundamentals of quantum waves and quantum
fields, which makes the disputed Klein Gordon Equation obsolete. The theory
reveals an algorithm to explain the ratios between the lepton masses. In that
sense the theory shows a predictive element, while grosso modo, as shown, no
derogation is done to the results and instruments of canonic theory.
