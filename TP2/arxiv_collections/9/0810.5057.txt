This paper presents a first attempt at performing a precise and automatic
identification of the linking behaviour in a scientific domain through the
analysis of the communication of the related academic institutions on the web.
The proposed approach is based on the paradigm of multiple viewpoint data
analysis (MVDA) than can be fruitfully exploited to highlight relationships
between data, like websites, carrying several kinds of description. It uses the
MultiSOM clustering and mapping method. The domain that has been chosen for
this study is the domain of Computer Science in Germany. The analysis is
conduced on a set of 438 websites of this domain using all together, thematic,
geographic and linking information. It highlights interesting results
concerning both global and local linking behaviour.
