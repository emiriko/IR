A comprehensive analysis of multiparticle emissions following photon induced
reactions at intermediate energies is provided. Photon induced reaction is
described in the energy range of $\sim 30-140$ MeV with an approach based on
the quasideuteron nuclear photoabsorption model followed by the process of
competition between light particle evaporation and fission for the excited
nucleus. The evaporation-fission process of the compound nucleus is simulated
in a Monte-Carlo framework. The study shows almost no fission events for the
medium mass nuclei and reproduces satisfactorily well the available
experimental data of photonuclear reaction cross sections at energies $\sim
30-140$ MeV.
