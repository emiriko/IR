The additional long range order parameter that competes with the high Tc
superconductivity long range order is identified as an electronic crystal of
pseudo Jahn-Teller polarons beyond the critical value of the electron lattice
interaction. We show that the region of quantum critical fluctuations in the
two variables phase diagram of cuprates: the doping (delta) and the chemical
pressure (i.e., the tolerance factor, or the average ionic radius of A-site
cations) can be measured via the microstrain (eta) of the Cu-O length in the
CuO2 lattice. The fluctuating order in the proximity of the microstrain quantum
critical point that competes with the superconducting long range order is the
polaron electronic crystalline phase called a Wigner polaron crystal and the
variation of the spin gap energy as a function of microstrain provides a strong
experimental support for this proposal.
