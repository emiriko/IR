The distribution of entangled states between distant parties in an optical
network is crucial for the successful implementation of various quantum
communication protocols such as quantum cryptography, teleportation and dense
coding [1-3]. However, owing to the unavoidable loss in any real optical
channel, the distribution of loss-intolerant entangled states is inevitably
inflicted by decoherence, which causes a degradation of the transmitted
entanglement. To combat the decoherence, entanglement distillation, which is
the process of extracting a small set of highly entangled states from a large
set of less entangled states, can be used [4-14]. Here we report on the
mesoscopic distillation of deterministically prepared entangled light pulses
that have undergone non-Gaussian noise. The entangled light pulses [15-17] are
sent through a lossy channel, where the transmission is varying in time
similarly to light propagation in the atmosphere. By employing linear optical
components and global classical communication, the entanglement is
probabilistically increased.
