Diabetes mellitus is a complex group of syndromes that have in common a
disturbance in the body's use of glucose, resulting in an elevated blood sugar.
Once detected, sugar diabetes can be controlled by an appropriate regimen that
should include diet therapy, a weight reduction program for those persons who
are overweight, a program of exercise and insulin injections or oral drugs to
lower blood glucose. Blood glucose monitoring by the patient and the physician
is an important aspect in the control of the devastating complications (heart
disease, blindness, kidney failure or amputations) due to the disease.
Intensive therapy and frequent glucose testing has numerous benefits. With ever
improving advances in diagnostic technology, the race for the next generation
of bloodless, painless, accurate glucose instruments has begun. In this paper,
we reviewed various methods, techniques and approaches successfully
demonstrated for measuring or monitoring blood glucose. Invasive, minimally
invasive and noninvasive techniques available in literature are summarised.
