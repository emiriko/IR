We present a computation of the inclusive Drell-Yan production cross-section
in perturbative QCD to all orders in the limit of high partonic centre-of-mass
energy. We compare our results to the fixed order NLO and NNLO results in MSbar
scheme, and provide predictions at NNNLO and beyond. Our expressions may be
used to obtain fully resummed results for the inclusive cross-section.
