We study a free field realization of the elliptic quantum algebra
$U_{q,p}(sl_3^)$ for arbitrary level $k$. We give the free field realization of
elliptic analogue of Drinfeld current associated with $U_{q,p}(sl_3^)$ for
arbitrary level $k$. In the limit $p \to 0, q \to 1$ our realization reproduce
Wakimoto realization for the affine Lie algebra $sl_3^$.
