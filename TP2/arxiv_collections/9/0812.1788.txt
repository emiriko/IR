I briefly review the basic challenges and virtues of models breaking the
electroweak symmetry dynamically. I will then introduce the (ultra) minimal
walking technicolor models whose construction has been made possible thanks to
recent progress in the understanding of the phase diagram for strongly coupled
theories as function of number of flavors, colors and matter representation. I
will mention possible relevant collider signatures. Interestingly, asymmetric
Dark Matter is a natural possibility in our models providing interesting
candidates for decaying Dark Matter models which have been explored to account
for the PAMELA and ATIC excesses in electron/positron cosmic rays.
