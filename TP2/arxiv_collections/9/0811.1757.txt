Low-temperature measurements of asymmetric carbon nanotube (CNT) quantum dots
are reported. The CNTs are end-contacted with one ferromagnetic and one
normal-metal electrode. The measurements show a spin-dependent rectification of
the current caused by the asymmetry of the device. This rectification occurs
for gate voltages for which the normal-metal lead is resonant with a level of
the quantum dot. At the gate voltages at which the current is at the maximum
current, a significant decrease in the current shot noise is observed.
