The recent results on a number of searches performed at Tevatron for new
phenomena beyond Standard Model are presented. The topics include the
experimental tests of SUSY with mSUGRA and GMSB breaking scenarios. The latest
analyses on large extra dimensions, new massive bosons are covered as well. The
results are based on experimental data samples collected at the Tevatron with
CDF and D0 detectors and comprising a total integrated luminosity up to ~2.7
fb^-1 .
