We show that qubits traveling along closed timelike curves are a resource
that a party can exploit to distinguish perfectly any set of quantum states. As
a result, an adversary with access to closed timelike curves can break any
prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution protocol. Our result also implies
that a party with access to closed timelike curves can violate the Holevo
bound.
