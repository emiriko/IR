We investigate the yield of $\Lambda(1520)$ resonance in heavy ion collisions
within the framework of a kinetic master equation without the assumption of
chemical equilibrium. We show that reactions such as $\Lambda(1520)+\pi
\leftrightarrow \Sigma^*$ can favor $\Sigma^*$ production, thereby decreasing
the $\Lambda(1520)$ yield. Within the same approach we thus find a yield
enhancement for $\Sigma(1385)$ and a yield suppression for $\Lambda(1520)$.
