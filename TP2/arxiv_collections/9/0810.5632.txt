We consider the non-overlapping irreversible random sequential adsorption
(RSA) process on one-dimensional finite line, which is known also as the car
parking process. The probability of each coverage in saturating states is
analytically and exactly obtained. In the derivation, a new representation of
states in RSA process is introduced, which effectively works to make the
calculation clear and simple.
