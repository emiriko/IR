We investigate finite size scaling aspects of disorder reaction-diffusion
processes in one dimension utilizing both numerical and analytical approaches.
The former averages the spectrum gap of the associated evolution operators by
doubling their degrees of freedom, while the latter uses various techniques to
map the equations of motion to a first passage time process. Both approaches
are consistent with nonuniversal dynamic exponents, and with stretched
exponential scaling forms for particular disorder realizations.
