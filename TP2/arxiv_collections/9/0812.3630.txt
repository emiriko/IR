We demonstrate a novel optical trapping scheme for ultracold atoms. Using a
combination of evanescent wave, standing wave, and magnetic potentials we
create a deeply 2D Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at a few microns from a glass
surface. Using techniques such as broadband "white" light to create evanescent
and standing waves, we realize a smooth potential with a trap frequency aspect
ratio of 300:1:1 and long lifetimes. This makes the setup suitable for
many-body quantum simulations and applications such as high precision
measurements close to surfaces.
