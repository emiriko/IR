We investigate the behavior of a mesoscopic one-dimensional ring in an
external magnetic field by simulating the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau
equations with periodic boundary conditions. We analyze the stability and the
different possible evolutions for the phase slip phenomena starting from a
metastable state. We find a stability condition relating the winding number of
the initial solution and the number of flux quanta penetrating the ring. The
analysis of multiple phase slips solutions is based on analytical results and
simulations. The role of the ratio of two characteristic times u is studied for
the case of a multiple phase slips transition. We found out that if u>>1,
consecutive multiple phase slips will be more favorable than simultaneous ones.
If u<<1 the opposite is true and we confirm that u>>1 is often a necessary
condition to reach the ground state. The influence of the Langevin noise on the
kinetics of the phase transition is discussed.
