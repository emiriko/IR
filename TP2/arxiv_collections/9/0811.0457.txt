The generalization of the hard thermal loop effective theory to anisotropic
plasmas is described with a detailed discussion of anisotropic dispersion laws
and plasma instabilities. The numerical results obtained in real-time lattice
simulations of the hard loop effective theory are reviewed, both for the
stationary anisotropic case and for a quark-gluon plasma undergoing
boost-invariant expansion.
