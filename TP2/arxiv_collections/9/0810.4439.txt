We show that in (anomalous) U(1) gauge theories with the Fayet-Iliopoulos
(FI) term and with generic interactions there are meta-stable vacua in which
supersymmetry (SUSY) is spontaneously broken even without U(1)_R symmetry and
various hierarchical structures, for example, Yukawa hierarchy, can be
explained by the smallness of the FI parameter. When we introduce generic
interactions, i.e., all interactions including higher dimensional interactions
which are allowed by the symmetry of the theory with O(1) coefficients, various
scales can be determined by the symmetry (U(1) charges of the introduced
fields). We examine how to determine the various scales, the vacuum expectation
values (VEVs), and the scales of F-term and of D-term. Moreover, we propose a
new scenario for the stabilization of the moduli in the SUSY breaking models.
