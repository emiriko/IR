One possible way to produce ultracold, high-phase-space-density quantum gases
of molecules in the rovibronic ground state is given by molecule association
from quantum-degenerate atomic gases on a Feshbach resonance and subsequent
coherent optical multi-photon transfer into the rovibronic ground state. In
ultracold samples of Cs_2 molecules, we observe two-photon dark resonances that
connect the intermediate rovibrational level |v=73,J=2> with the rovibrational
ground state |v=0,J=0> of the singlet $X^1\Sigma_g^+$ ground state potential.
For precise dark resonance spectroscopy we exploit the fact that it is possible
to efficiently populate the level |v=73,J=2> by two-photon transfer from the
dissociation threshold with the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
technique. We find that at least one of the two-photon resonances is
sufficiently strong to allow future implementation of coherent STIRAP transfer
of a molecular quantum gas to the rovibrational ground state |v=0,J=0>.
