We propose a scheme to produce continuous variable entanglement between
phase-quadrature amplitudes of two light modes in an optomechanical system. For
proper driving power and detuning, the entanglement is insensitive with bath
temperature and $Q$ of mechanical oscillator. Under realistic experimental
conditions, we find that the entanglement could be very large even at room
temperature.
