The evolution pattern of exceptional points is studied in a non-integrable
limit of the complex-extended 3-level Richardson-Gaudin model. The appearance
of a pseudo-diabolic point from the fusion of two exceptional points is
demonstrated in the anti-hermitian limit of the model and studied in some
details.
