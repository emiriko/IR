We compute holographically the dispersion relation for a hydrodynamic mode of
fluctuation (the phonino) of the density of supersymmetry current in N = 4 SYM
at strong coupling. The mode appears as a pole at low frequency and momentum in
the correlator of supercurrents. It has a wave-like propagation, and we find
its speed and coefficient of attenuation.
