This talk is an attempt to underscore in detail the physics reach of an
experimental set-up where neutrinos produced in a beta-beam facility at CERN
would be observed in the proposed large magnetized iron calorimeter detector
(ICAL) at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). The "magical" CERN-INO
beta-beam set-up offers an excellent avenue to use the "Golden" channel ($\nu_e
\to \nu_{\mu}$) oscillation probability for a simultaneous determination of the
neutrino mass ordering and $\theta_{13}$ avoiding the impact of the CP phase
$\delta_{CP}$ on these measurements. With Lorentz boost $\gamma=650$ and
irrespective of the true value of $\delta_{CP}$, the neutrino mass hierarchy
could be determined at $3\sigma$ C.L. if $\sin^22\theta_{13}{\rm {(true)}} >
5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ and we can expect an unambiguous signal for $\theta_{13}$
at $3\sigma$ C.L. if $\sin^22\theta_{13}{\rm {(true)}} > 5.1 \times 10^{-4}$
independent of the true neutrino mass hierarchy.
