In this paper we consider a nondeterministic computation by deterministic
multi-head 2-way automata having a read-only access to an auxiliary memory. The
memory contains additional data (a guess) and computation is successful iff it
is successful for some memory content. Also we consider the case of restricted
guesses in which a guess should satisfy some constraint. We show that the
standard complexity classes such as L, NL, P, NP, PSPACE can be characterized
in terms of these models of nondeterministic computation. These
characterizations differ from the well-known ones by absence of alternation.
