We measure the temperature dependence of the anisotropic magnetoresistance
(AMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in c-axis oriented epitaxial thin films
of La(0.8)Sr(0.2)MnO(3), for different current directions relative to the
crystal axes, and show that both AMR and PHE depend strongly on current
orientation. We determine a magnetoresistance tensor, extracted to 4th order,
which reflects the crystal symmetry and provides a comprehensive description of
the data. We extend the applicability of the extracted tensor by determining
the bi-axial magnetocrystalline anisotropy in our samples.
