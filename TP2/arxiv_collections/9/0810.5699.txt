This paper is a generalization of the models considered in [J. Stat. Phys.
128,1365 (2007)]. Using an analogy with free fermions, we compute exactly the
large deviation function (ldf) of the energy injected up to time $t$ in a
one-dimensional dissipative system of classical spins, where a drift is
allowed. The dynamics are T=0 asymmetric Glauber dynamics driven out of rest by
an injection mechanism, namely a Poissonian flipping of one spin. The drift
induces anisotropy in the system, making the model more comparable to
experimental systems with dissipative structures. We discuss the physical
content of the results, specifically the influence of the rate of the Poisson
injection process and the magnitude of the drift on the properties of the ldf.
We also compare the results of this spin model to simple phenomenological
models of energy injection (Poisson or Bernoulli processes of domain wall
injection). We show that many qualitative results of the spin model can be
understood within this simplified framework.
