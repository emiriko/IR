In the conventional seesaw models of neutrino masses, leptogenesis occurs at
a very high scale. Three approaches have been discussed in the literature to
lower the scale of leptogenesis: mass degeneracy, hierarchy of couplings and
three-body decays. We advocate yet another approach to a testable leptogenesis,
whereby the decaying particles could go out of equilibrium at an accessible
scale due to kinematics, although their couplings to the decay products are
larger for generating a desired CP asymmetry. We demonstrate this new
possibility for the testable leptogenesis in a two Higgs doublet model where
the neutrino masses originate from a one-loop diagram.
