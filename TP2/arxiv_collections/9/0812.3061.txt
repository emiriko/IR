Recently there has been progress in the understanding of the confinement
mechanism in Landau gauge QCD. The emerging dynamical description in terms of
the underlying gauge dependent degrees of freedom goes beyond the static
confinement in the quenched limit and has the potential to describe the
scale-dependent phenomenon seen in nature, where new hadrons are produced when
the system is sufficiently excited. I point out that the confinement mechanism
for quarks is rather different from the corresponding one for gluons and that
both are embedded in a consistent framework that can describe important
qualitative properties of strong interaction physics, like chiral symmetry
breaking, spontaneous and anomalous mass generation and a linear rising heavy
quark potential with an almost quark-mass independent string tension.
