Starting from the requirement of distinguishability of two atoms by their
positions, it is shown that photon recoil has a strong influence on finite-time
disentanglement and in some cases prevents its appearance. At near-field inter
atomic distances well localized atoms, with maximally one atom being initially
excited, may suffer disentanglement at a single finite time or even at a series
of equidistant finite times, depending on their mean inter atomic distance and
their initial electronic preparation.
