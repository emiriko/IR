We use accurate quantum mechanical calculations to analyze the effects of
parallel electric and magnetic fields on collision dynamics of OH(2Pi)
molecules. It is demonstrated that spin relaxation in 3He-OH collisions at
temperatures below 0.01 K can be effectively suppressed by moderate electric
fields of order 10 kV/cm. We show that electric fields can be used to
manipulate Feshbach resonances in collisions of cold molecules. Our results can
be verified in experiments with OH molecules in Stark decelerated molecular
beams and electromagnetic traps.
