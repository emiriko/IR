We give by simple arguments sufficient conditions, so called Lyapunov
conditions, for Talagrand's transportation information inequality and for the
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Those sufficient conditions work even in the
case where the Bakry-Emery curvature is not lower bounded. Several new examples
are provided.
