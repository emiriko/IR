The dynamics of single electron and nuclear spins in a diamond lattice with
different 13C nuclear spin concentration is investigated. It is shown that
coherent control of up to three individual nuclei in a dense nuclear spin
cluster is feasible. The free induction decays of nuclear spin Bell states and
single nuclear coherences among 13C nuclear spins are compared and analyzed.
Reduction of a free induction decay time T2* and a coherence time T2 upon
increase of nuclear spin concentration has been found. For diamond material
with depleted concentration of nuclear spin, T2* as long as 30 microseconds and
T2 of up to 1.8 ms for the electron spin has been observed. The 13C
concentration dependence of T2* is explained by Fermi contact and dipolar
interactions with nuclei in the lattice. It has been found that T2 decreases
approximately as 1/n, where n is 13C concentration, as expected for an electron
spin interacting with a nuclear spin bath.
