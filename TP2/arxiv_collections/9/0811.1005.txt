Most of the theoretical models describing the translocation of a polymer
chain through a nanopore use the hypothesis that the polymer is always relaxed
during the complete process. In other words, models generally assume that the
characteristic relaxation time of the chain is small enough compared to the
translocation time that non-equilibrium molecular conformations can be ignored.
In this paper, we use Molecular Dynamics simulations to directly test this
hypothesis by looking at the escape time of unbiased polymer chains starting
with different initial conditions. We find that the translocation process is
not quite in equilibrium for the systems studied, even though the translocation
time tau is about 10 times larger than the relaxation time tau_r. Our most
striking result is the observation that the last half of the chain escapes in
less than ~12% of the total escape time, which implies that there is a large
acceleration of the chain at the end of its escape from the channel.
