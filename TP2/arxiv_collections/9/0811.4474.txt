The Maxwell-Bloch system describes a quantum two-level medium interacting
with a classical electromagnetic field by mediation of the the population
density. This population density variation is a purely quantum effect which is
actually at the very origin of nonlinearity. The resulting nonlinear coupling
possesses particularly interesting consequences at the resonance (when the
frequency of the excitation is close to the transition frequency of the
two-level medium) as e.g. slow-light gap solitons that result from the
nonlinear instability of the evanescent wave at the boundary. As nonlinearity
couples the different polarizations of the electromagnetic field, the
slow-light gap soliton is shown to experience effective scattering whith
charges in the medium, allowing it for instance to be trapped or reflected.
This scattering process is understood qualitatively as being governed by a
nonlinear Schroedinger model in an external potential related to the charges
(the electrostatic permanent background component of the field).
