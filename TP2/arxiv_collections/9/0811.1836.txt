We report the time dependent response of electrical resistivity in the
non-magnetic perovskite oxide NdNiO$_3$ in its phase separated state and
provide a physical explanation of the observations. We also model the system
and do an accurate Monte Carlo simulation of the observed behavior. While
cooling a phase separation takes place in this system below its metal-insulator
transition temperature and in this state the material exhibits various
dynamical phenomena such as relaxation of resistivity, dependence of
resistivity on cooling rate and rejuvenation of the material after ageing.
These phenomena signal that the phase separated state of NdNiO$_3$ is not in
thermodynamic equilibrium and we conjecture that it consists of supercooled
paramagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic insulating phases. The supercooled
phases are metastable and they switch over to the insulating equilibrium state
stochastically and this can account for the slow dynamics observed in our
system. We also verify the predictive power of our model by simulating the
result of a new experiment and confirming it by actual measurements.
