In this work, it is suggested that the extremum complexity distribution of a
high dimensional dynamical system can be interpreted as a piecewise uniform
distribution in the phase space of its accessible states. When these
distributions are expressed as one--particle distribution functions, this leads
to piecewise exponential functions. It seems plausible to use these
distributions in some systems out of equilibrium, thus greatly simplifying
their description. In particular, here we study an isolated ideal
monodimensional gas far from equilibrium that presents an energy distribution
formed by two non--overlapping Gaussian distribution functions. This is
demonstrated by numerical simulations. Also, some previous laboratory
experiments with granular systems seem to display this kind of distributions.
