Needs of multimedia systems evolved due to the evolution of their
architecture which is now distributed into heterogeneous contexts. A critical
issue lies in the fact that they handle, process, and transmit multimedia data.
This data integrates several properties which should be considered since it
holds a considerable part of its semantics, for instance the lips
synchronization in a video. In this paper, we focus on the definition of a
model as a basic abstraction for describing and modeling media in multimedia
systems by taking into account their properties. This model will be used in
software architecture in order to handle data in efficient way. The provided
model is an interesting solution for the integration of media into
applications; we propose to consider and to handle them in a uniform way. This
model is proposed with synchronization policies to ensure synchronous transport
of media. Therefore, we use it in a component model that we develop for the
design and deployment of distributed multimedia systems.
