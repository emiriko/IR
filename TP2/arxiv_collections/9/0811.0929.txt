The time reversal of a completely-positive, nonequilibrium discrete-time
quantum Markov evolution is derived via a suitable adjointness relation.
Space-time harmonic processes are introduced for the forward and reverse-time
transition mechanisms, and their role for relative entropy dynamics is
discussed.
