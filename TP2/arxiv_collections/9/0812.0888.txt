The transverse beam pattern, usually observed in experiment, is a result of
averaging the optical-frequency oscillations of the electromagnetic field
distributed over the beam cross section. An analytical criterion is derived
that these oscillations are coupled with a sort of rotation around the beam
axis. This criterion appears to be in direct relation with the usual definition
of the beam orbital angular momentum.
