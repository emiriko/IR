We use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to study the electrophoretic
behaviour of flexible polyelectrolyte chains. We first characterize the static
properties of the model with respect to the chain length, the polyelectrolyte
concentration, additional salt and the influence of an applied external field.
Next we investigate the dynamic behaviour in the oligomer range and compare to
data obtained by two different experimental methods, namely capillary
electrophoresis and PFG-NMR. We find excellent agreement of experiments and
simulations when hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for in the
simulations. We then present novel estimators for the dynamical effective
charge during free solution electrophoresis and compare them to static
estimators. We find complete agreement between the static and the dynamic
estimators. We further evaluate the scaling behaviour of the effective friction
of the polyelectrolyte-counterion complex with the surrounding fluid. We
identify a hydrodynamic screening length beyond which the friction during
electrophoresis is linear depending on the chain length resulting in a constant
mobility for long polyelectrolyte chains. Our results show a convincing
agreement with experimental data and demonstrate that it is possible to model
dynamic behaviour of polyelectrolytes using coarse grained models, provided
they include the effects of hydrodynamical interactions.
