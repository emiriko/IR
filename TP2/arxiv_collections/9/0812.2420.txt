Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) by providing images of the effects of
individual zinc-impurities in cuprate superconductors with unprecedented
atomic-resolution offers a stringent test to models of correlated fermions for
high-temperature superconductors. Using a t-J model supplemented by Variational
Monte Carlo many-body techniques, the spatial dependence of the hole density
and of the valence bond and superconducting pairing amplitudes around the
impurity are computed. A cross-shaped four-fold symmetric structure very
similar to the observed STM observation is found, giving strong credit to the
model.
