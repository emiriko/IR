Low-lying energy levels of two interacting electrons confined in a
two-dimensional parabolic quantum dot in the presence of an external magnetic
field have been revised within the frame of a novel model. The present
formalism, which gives closed algebraic solutions for the specific values of
magnetic field and spatial confinement length, enables us to see explicitly
individual effects of the electron correlation.
