In this paper we explore the non-monotonic nature of entanglement of
formation with respect to concurrence for pure bipartite states. For pure
bipartite system, one of the basic physical reason of this non-monotonicity
character is due to the existence of incomparable states, i.e., the pure
bipartite states which are not convertible to each other by LOCC with
certainty.
