We elucidate how the color neutrality is harmed in the Polyakov Nambu-Jona
Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite density within the adopted mean field
approximation. Also we point out how usual assumption about the diagonal form
of the Wilson loop may fail in the presence of the diquark condensate on
several grounds.
