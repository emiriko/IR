We reinvestigate a doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator based on the
slave-fermion approach of the t-J model, where antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations and doped holes are described by bosonic spinons and fermionic
holons, respectively. Earlier studies have shown that an effective field theory
for the doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is given by a non-relativistic
fermion (holon) U(1) gauge theory for charge dynamics and a relativistic boson
(spinon) U(1) gauge theory for spin dynamics, thus allowing an anomalous
metallic phase where bosonic spinons are gapped away from an antiferromagnetic
state, analogous to the U(1) spin liquid phase in the slave-boson approach of
the t-J model. We argue that the emergent U(1) gauge structure in this approach
is based on a simplified picture for antiferromagnetic correlations.
Considering that dynamics of doped holes frustrates a collinear
antiferromagnetic spin configuration, we show that doped holes enhance
ferromagnetic spin correlations and result in a complex magnetic structure. The
presence of such a complex spin texture reduces the U(1) gauge structure down
to Z$_{2}$, thus a different effective field theory results for the spin-gapped
non-Fermi liquid metal at low temperatures because there are no gapless U(1)
gauge fluctuations.
