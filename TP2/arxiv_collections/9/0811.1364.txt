We present the first calculation of the two-loop electroweak fermionic
correction to the flavour-dependent effective weak-mixing angle for bottom
quarks, sin^2 theta_{eff}^{b anti-b}. For the evaluation of the missing
two-loop vertex diagrams, two methods are employed, one based on a
semi-numerical Bernstein-Tkachov algorithm and the second on asymptotic
expansions in the large top-quark mass. A third method based on dispersion
relations is used for checking the basic loop integrals. We find that for small
Higgs-boson mass values, M_H ~ 100 GeV, the correction is sizable, of order
O(10^{-4}).
