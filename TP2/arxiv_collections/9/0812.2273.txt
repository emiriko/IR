In this paper we prove the existence and local uniqueness of stationary
states for the nonlinear Dirac equation \[ i \sum_{j=0}^{3} \ga^j \pd_j \psi -
m\psi + F(\bar{\psi}\psi)\psi =0 \] where $ m >0$ and $ F(s) = |s|^{\theta}$
for $ 1\leq \theta < 2.$ More precisely we show that there exists $\e_0 > 0$
such that for $\omega \in(m - \e_0, m), $ there exists a solution $ \psi(t,x) =
e^{-i\omega t}\phi_{\omega}(x), x_0 = t, x = (x_1, x_2, x_3),$ and the mapping
from $ \omega $ to $ \phi_{\omega} $ is continuous. We prove this result by
relating the stationary solutions to the ground states of nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger equations.
