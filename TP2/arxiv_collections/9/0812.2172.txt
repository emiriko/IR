In this brief note we analyse a toy model which can be derived from heterotic
string compactifications on half-flat manifolds with SU(3) structure at first
order in \alpha' (ie including matter fields). We show that for this model,
finding solutions with viable gauge group poses the same problems as finding
solutions in the absence of matter fields.
