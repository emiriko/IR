The strong-property-fluctuation theory (SPFT) provides a general framework
for estimating the constitutive parameters of a homogenized composite material
(HCM). We developed the elastodynamic SPFT for orthotropic HCMs, in order to
undertake numerical studies. A specific choice of two-point covariance function
- which characterizes the distributional statistics of the generally
ellipsoidal particles that constitute the component materials - was
implemented. Representative numerical examples revealed that the lowest-order
SPFT estimate of the HCM stiffness tensor is qualitatively similar to the
estimate provided by the Mori-Tanaka mean-field formalism, but the differences
between the two estimates vary as the orthotropic nature of the HCM is
accentuated. The second-order SPFT provides a correction to the lowest-order
estimate of the HCM stiffness tensor and density. The correction, indicating
effective dissipation due to scattering loss, increases as the HCM becomes less
orthotropic but decreases as the correlation length becomes smaller.
