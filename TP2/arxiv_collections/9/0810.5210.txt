We introduce a stochastic equation for the microscopic motion of a tagged
particle in the single file model. This equation provides a compact
representation of several of the system's properties such as
Fluctuation-Dissipation and Linear Response relations, achieved by means of a
diffusion noise approach. Most important, the proposed Langevin Equation
reproduces quantitatively the \emph{three} temporal regimes and the
corresponding time scales: ballistic, diffusive and subdiffusive.
