We compute the scattering lengths of charmed mesons and charmonia scattering
with light hadrons in full QCD. We use Fermilab formulation for the charm quark
and domain-wall fermions for the light quarks and staggered sea quarks. Four
different light-quark masses are used to extrapolate to the physical point. The
charmed baryon spectrum is also presented.
