We construct convex PBW-type Lyndon bases for two-parameter quantum groups
U_{r,s}({so}_{2n+1}) with detailed commutation relations. It turns out that
under a certain condition, the restricted two-parameter quantum group
u_{r,s}({so}_{2n+1}) (r, s are roots of unity) is of Drinfeld double. All of
Hopf isomorphisms of u_{r,s}({so}_{2n+1}), as well as u_{r,s}({sl}_n) are
determined. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for
u_{r,s}({so}_{2n+1}) to be a ribbon Hopf algebra are singled out by describing
the left and right integrals.
