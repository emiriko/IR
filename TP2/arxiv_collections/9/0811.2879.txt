The random percolation model can be viewed as the dual of a well defined
confining gauge theory; since this theory, having no Monte Carlo dynamics at
all, is simple to simulate, it is possible to study the properties of the flux
tube with very high precision; we show it can be described by the effective
string picture. Our results are lattice regularisation independent, therefore
they are well defined also in the continuum limit, and, for the first time in a
gauge theory, it has been possible to determine the next-to-leading quantum
corrections throughout the computation of the T^6 coefficient of the Taylor
expansion of sigma(T). Furthermore, this coefficient results to be related to
the universal ratio T_c/\sqrt{sigma_0}.
