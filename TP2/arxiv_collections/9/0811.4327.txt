Spin currents resulting in the zero-bias spin separation have been observed
in unbiased diluted magnetic semiconductor structures (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te. The
pure spin current generated due to the electron gas heating by terahertz
radiation is converted into a net electric current by application of an
external magnetic field. We demonstrate that polarization of the magnetic ion
system enhances drastically the conversion due to the spin-dependent scattering
by localized Mn(2+) ions and the giant Zeeman splitting.
