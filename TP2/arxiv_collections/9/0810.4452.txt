In a recent experiment, Salart et al. addressed the important issues of the
speed of hypothetical communication and of reference frames in Bell-type
experiments. The authors report that they "performed a Bell experiment using
entangled photons" and conclude from their experimental results that "to
maintain an explanation based on spooky action at a distance we would have to
assume that the spooky action propagates at speeds even greater than the bounds
obtained in our experiment", exceeding the speed of light by orders of
magnitude. Here we show that, analyzing the experimental procedure,
explanations with subluminal or even no communication at all exist for the
experiment.
