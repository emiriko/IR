The progress in our understanding of several aspects of turbulent
Rayleigh-Benard convection is reviewed. The focus is on the question of how the
Nusselt number and the Reynolds number depend on the Rayleigh number Ra and the
Prandtl number Pr, and on how the thicknesses of the thermal and the kinetic
boundary layers scale with Ra and Pr. Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects and the
dynamics of the large-scale convection-roll are addressed as well. The review
ends with a list of challenges for future research on the turbulent
Rayleigh-Benard system.
