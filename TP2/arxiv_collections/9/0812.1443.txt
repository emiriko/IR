A Bianchi type-I cosmological model in the presence of a magnetic flux along
a cosmological string is investigated. The objective of this study is to
generate solutions to the Einstein equations using a few tractable assumptions
usually accepted in the literature. The analytical solutions are supplemented
with numerical and qualitative analysis. In the frame of the present model the
evolution of the Universe and other physical aspects are discussed.
