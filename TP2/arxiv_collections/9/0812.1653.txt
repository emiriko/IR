This study deals with vibroacoustics under heavy fluid loading conditions.
Considerable attention has been and remains focused on this subject not only
because industry is very concerned but also because of mathematical
difficulties that make the numerical resolution of the problem very difficult.
It was recently observed in a numerical study on a high order perturbation
method under heavy fluid loading that a loaded vibrating plate results in a
frequency shift of the in vacuo single resonance (in both the real part because
of the fluid added mass and the imaginary part because of energy lost by
radiation into the fluid) as well as increase in the number of the resonance
frequencies : as a result of the loading, each single in vacuo resonance
frequency of the structure is transformed into a multiple resonance frequency.
Here we show that this phenomenon is said to be an extension to the heavy
loading condition of the Sanchez's classical result that have established that
in the case of a light loading conditions "the scattering frequencies of a
fluid loaded elastic structure (ie the resonance frequencies) are nearly the
real eigenfrequencies of the elastic body alone and the complex scattering
frequencies of the fluid with a rigid solid". Using classical results in the
framework of the theory of entire functions, it is established that a single
resonance of a simply supported fluid loaded rectangular plate is transformed
into an infinite number of resonances.
