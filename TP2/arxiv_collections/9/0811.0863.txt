In this talk we give a brief description of a QCD motivated model for both
hard and soft interactions at high energies. In this model the long distance
behaviour of the scattering amplitude is determined by the dipole scattering
amplitude in the saturation domain. All phenomenological parameters for
dipole-proton interaction were fitted from the deep inelastic scattering data
and the soft processes are described with only one new parameter, related to
the wave function of hadron. It turns out that we do not need to introduce the
so called soft Pomeron that has been used in high energy phenomenology for four
decades.
