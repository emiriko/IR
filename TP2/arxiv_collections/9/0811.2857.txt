We study the dynamics of ultracold atoms trapped in optical double-well
potentials in presence of noise generated by an external environment. When
prepared in a Fock number state, the system shows phase coherence in the
averaged density profile obtained using standard absorption image techniques,
that disappears in absence of noise. This effect indicates that also in
many-body systems an external environment may enhance quantum coherence,
instead of destroying it.
