Exclusive photoproduction of dileptons, gamma N->e+e-N, is and will be
measured in ultraperipheral collisions at hadron colliders, such as the
Tevatron, RHIC and the LHC . We demonstrate that the timelike deeply virtual
Compton scattering (TCS) mechanism gamma q -> e+e- q where the lepton pair
comes from the subprocess gamma q -> gamma* q dominates in some accessible
kinematical regions, thus opening a new way to study generalized parton
distributions (GPD) in the nucleon. High energy kinematics enables to probe
parton distributions at small skewedness. This subprocess interferes at the
amplitude level with the pure QED subprocess gamma gamma* -> e+e- where the
virtual photon is radiated from the nucleon.
