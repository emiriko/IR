In this work, by means of molecular dynamics simulations, we consider mass
transport of a water cluster inside a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) with
the diameter of about 1.4 nm. The influence of the non-equilibrium thermal
environment on the confined water cluster has been investigated by imposing a
longitudinal temperature gradient to the SWNT. It is demonstrated that the
water cluster is transported with the average acceleration proportional to the
temperature gradient. Additional equilibrium simulations suggest that the
temperature dependence of the potential energy of the confined water is
sufficient to realize the transport. Particularly for the system with
hydrophobic interface, the water-water intrinsic potential energy appears to
play a dominant role. The transport simulations were also performed for a
system with a junction between two different SWNTs. The results suggest that an
angstrom difference in diameter may result in large barrier for water
transported through a small diameter SWNT.
