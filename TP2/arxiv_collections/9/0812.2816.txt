An observer at rest in a uniformly accelerated reference frame experiences a
parallel gravitational field, where the rays of light are formed as circular
arcs instead of being straight lines. We deduce how a sphere at rest in the
Rindler frame, and a freely falling sphere, will appear to an observer at rest
in the frame.
