We consider a primary model of ac-driven Brownian motors, i.e., a classical
particle placed in a spatial-time periodic potential and coupled to a heat
bath. The effects of fluctuations and dissipations are studied by a
time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. The approach allows us to map the
original stochastic problem onto a system of ordinary linear algebraic
equations. The solution of the system provides complete information about
ratchet transport, avoiding such disadvantages of direct stochastic
calculations as long transients and large statistical fluctuations. The
Fokker-Planck approach to dynamical ratchets is instructive and opens the space
for further generalizations.
