We present in detail the recently derived ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
formalism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 096403 (2008)], which due to its numerical
properties, is ideal for simulating the dynamics of systems containing
thousands of atoms. A major drawback of traditional AIMD methods is the
necessity to enforce the orthogonalization of the wave-functions, which can
become the bottleneck for very large systems. Alternatively, one can handle the
electron-ion dynamics within the Ehrenfest scheme where no explicit
orthogonalization is necessary, however the time step is too small for
practical applications. Here we preserve the desirable properties of Ehrenfest
in a new scheme that allows for a considerable increase of the time step while
keeping the system close to the Born-Oppenheimer surface. We show that the
automatically enforced orthogonalization is of fundamental importance for large
systems because not only it improves the scaling of the approach with the
system size but it also allows for an additional very efficient parallelization
level. In this work we provide the formal details of the new method, describe
its implementation and present some applications to some test systems.
Comparisons with the widely used Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics method are
made, showing that the new approach is advantageous above a certain number of
atoms in the system. The method is not tied to a particular wave-function
representation, making it suitable for inclusion in any AIMD software package.
