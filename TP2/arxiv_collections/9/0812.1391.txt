This work is devoted to the study of displacement fluctuations of
micron-sized particles in an aging colloidal glass. We address the issue of the
validity of the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) and the time evolution of
viscoelastic properties during aging of aqueous suspensions of a clay (Laponite
RG) in a colloidal glass phase. Given the conflicting results reported in the
literature for different experimental techniques, our goal is to check and
reconcile them using \emph{simultaneously} passive and active microrheology
techniques. For this purpose we measure the thermal fluctuations of micro-sized
brownian particles immersed in the colloidal glass and trapped by optical
tweezers. We find that both microrheology techniques lead to compatible results
even at low frequencies and no violation of FDT is observed. Several
interesting features concerning the statistical properties and the long time
correlations of the particles are observed during the transition.
