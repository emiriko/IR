A recent Comment [arXiv:0811.2790] on the Letter 'Quantum Bounce and Cosmic
Recall' by the authors is shown to arise from an incorrect understanding of the
issues at hand and of our analysis. The conclusions of Bojowald's Comment are
shown to add little to our work, to be irrelevant at best, and are further
shown to be in contradiction with his own claims in the literature.
