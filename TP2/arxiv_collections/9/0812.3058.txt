It is explained on a physical basis how contextuality allows Bell
inequalities to be violated, without bringing an implication on locality or
realism. The point is that the initial values of the hidden variables of the
detectors are mutually exclusive for different detector settings. Therefore
they have no reason to possess a common probability distribution and hence no
reason to satisfy Bell inequalities. To motivate this, we connect first to the
local realistic theory Stochastic Electrodynamics, and then put the argument
more broadly. Thus even if Bell Inequality Violation is demonstrated beyond
reasonable doubt, it will have no say on local realism.
