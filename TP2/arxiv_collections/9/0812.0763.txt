Since Fermions are based on anti-commutation relations, their entanglement
can not be studied in the usual way, such that the available theory has to be
modified appropriately. Recent publications consider in particular the
structure of separable and of maximally entangled states. In this talk we want
to discuss local operations and entanglement distillation from bipartite,
Fermionic systems. To this end we apply an algebraic point of view where
algebras of local observables, rather than tensor product Hilbert spaces play
the central role. We apply our scheme in particular to Fermionic Gaussian
states where the whole discussion can be reduced to properties of the
covariance matrix. Finally the results are demonstrated with free Fermions on
an infinite, one-dimensional lattice.
