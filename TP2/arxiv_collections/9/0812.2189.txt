The medium dependent finite width is introduced into an exactly solvable
model with the general mass-volume spectrum of the QGP bags. The model allows
us to estimate the minimal value of the QGP bags' width from the lattice QCD
data. The large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in
the number of hadronic resonances comparing to the Hagedorn mass spectrum, but
also clarifies the reason why the heavy QGP bags cannot be directly observed as
metastable states in a hadronic phase.
