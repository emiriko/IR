We analyse the extraction of the bound-state form factor from
vacuum-to-hadron correlator, which is the basic object for the calculation of
hadron form factors in the method of light-cone sum rules in QCD. We study this
correlator in quantum mechanics, calculate it exactly, and derive the
corresponding OPE. We then apply the standard procedures of QCD sum rules to
isolate the ground-state form factor from this correlator. We demonstrate that
fixing the effective continuum threshold, one of the key ingredients of the
sum-rule calculation of bound-state parameters, poses a serious problem for sum
rules based on vacuum-to-hadron correlators.
