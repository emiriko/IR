Superpositions of paraxial laser beam modes to generate atom-optical lenses
based on the optical dipole force are investigated theoretically. Thin, wide,
parabolic, cylindrical and circular atom lenses with numerical apertures much
greater than those reported in the literature to date can be synthesized. This
superposition approach promises to make high quality atom beam imaging and
nano-deposition feasible.
