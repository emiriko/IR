Toda proved in 1989 that the (discrete) polynomial time hierarchy,
$\mathbf{PH}$, is contained in the class $\mathbf{P}^{#\mathbf{P}}$, namely the
class of languages that can be decided by a Turing machine in polynomial time
given access to an oracle with the power to compute a function in the counting
complexity class $#\mathbf{P}$. This result which illustrates the power of
counting is considered to be a seminal result in computational complexity
theory. An analogous result in the complexity theory over the reals (in the
sense of Blum-Shub-Smale real machines) has been missing so far. In this paper
we formulate and prove a real analogue of Toda's theorem. Unlike Toda's proof
in the discrete case, which relied on sophisticated combinatorial arguments,
our proof is topological in nature. As a consequence of our techniques we are
also able to relate the computational hardness of two extremely well-studied
problems in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry -- namely the problem of
deciding sentences in the first order theory of the reals with a constant
number of quantifier alternations, and that of computing Betti numbers of
semi-algebraic sets. We obtain a polynomial time reduction of the compact
version of the first problem to the second. This latter result might be of
independent interest to researchers in algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry.
