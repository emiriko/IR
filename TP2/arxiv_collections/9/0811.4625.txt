This study presents the effect of local electronic correlations on the
Heusler compounds Co$_2$Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si as a function of the concentration
$x$. The analysis has been performed by means of first-principles
band-structure calculations based on the local approximation to spin-density
functional theory (LSDA). Correlation effects are treated in terms of the
Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) and the LSDA+U approach. The formalism is
implemented within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function method.
  In good agreement with the available experimental data the magnetic and
spectroscopic properties of the compound are explained in terms of strong
electronic correlations. In addition the correlation effects have been analysed
separately with respect to their static or dynamical origin. To achieve a
quantitative description of the electronic structure of
Co$_2$Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si both static and dynamic correlations must be treated
on equal footing.
