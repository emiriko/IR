A non-perturbative theory is presented which allows to calculate the
solvation free energy of polarizable ions near a water-vapor and water-oil
interfaces. The theory predicts that larger halogen anions are adsorbed at the
interface, while the alkali metal cations are repelled from it. The density
profiles calculated theoretically are similar to those obtained using the
molecular dynamics simulations with polarizable force fields.
