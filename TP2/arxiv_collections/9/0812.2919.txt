Two forms of relativistic density functional are derived from Dirac equation.
Based on their structure analysis model of split electron is proposed. In this
model electric charge and mass of electron behave like two point-like
particles. It is shown that two electrons obeying this model cannot occupy the
same quantum state. Empirical verification of the model is discussed.
