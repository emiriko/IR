In this paper we have improved the semiclassical analysis of loop quantum
black hole (LQBH) in the conservative approach of constant polymeric parameter.
In particular we have focused our attention on the space-time structure. We
have introduced a very simple modification of the spherically symmetric
Hamiltonian constraint in its holonomic version. The new quantum constraint
reduces to the classical constraint when the polymeric parameter goes to
zero.Using this modification we have obtained a large class of semiclassical
solutions parametrized by a generic function of the polymeric parameter. We
have found that only a particular choice of this function reproduces the black
hole solution with the correct asymptotic flat limit. In r=0 the semiclassical
metric is regular and the Kretschmann invariant has a maximum peaked in
L-Planck. The radial position of the pick does not depend on the black hole
mass and the polymeric parameter. The semiclassical solution is very similar to
the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. We have constructed the Carter-Penrose diagrams
explicitly, giving a causal description of the space-time and its maximal
extension. The LQBH metric interpolates between two asymptotically flat
regions, the r to infinity region and the r to 0 region. We have studied the
thermodynamics of the semiclassical solution. The temperature, entropy and the
evaporation process are regular and could be defined independently from the
polymeric parameter. We have studied the particular metric when the polymeric
parameter goes towards to zero. This metric is regular in r=0 and has only one
event horizon in r = 2m. The Kretschmann invariant maximum depends only on
L-Planck. The polymeric parameter does not play any role in the black hole
singularity resolution. The thermodynamics is the same.
