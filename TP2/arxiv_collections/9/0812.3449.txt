We consider large N gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice in the presence
of a baryonic chemical potential. We work with one copy of naive fermion and
argue that reduction holds even in the presence of a chemical potential.
Analytical arguments supported by numerical studies show that there is no phase
transition as a function of the baryonic chemical potential.
