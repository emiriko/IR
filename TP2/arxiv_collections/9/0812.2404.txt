We propose to use ferromagnetic systems for entanglement generation and
distribution together with perfect state transfer between distant parties in a
qubit chain. The scheme relies on an effective 2-qubit dynamics, realized by
leaving two empty sites in a uniformly filled chain. This allows long-range
interacting qubit chains to serve as quantum channels for both tasks with
optimal performances. Remarkably, the entanglement between sender and receiver
sites is independent of both the transmission distance and of system size. This
property opens new perspectives for short and mid-range quantum communication
with qubit chains.
