For $\alpha >1$ we consider the initial value problem for the dispersive
equation $i\partial_t u +(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2} u= 0$. We prove an endpoint $L^p$
inequality for the maximal function $\sup_{t\in[0,1]}|u(\cdot,t)|$ with initial
values in $L^p$-Sobolev spaces, for $p\in(2+4/(d+1),\infty)$. This strengthens
the fixed time estimates due to Fefferman and Stein, and Miyachi. As an
essential tool we establish sharp $L^p$ space-time estimates (local in time)
for the same range of $p$.
