In the era of the information society, the impact of the information systems
on the economy of material and immaterial is certainly perceptible. With
regards to the information resources of an organization, the annotation
involved to enrich informational content, to track the intellectual activities
on a document and to set the added value on information for the benefit of
solving a decision-making problem in the context of economic intelligence. Our
contribution is distinguished by the representation of an annotation process
and its inherent concepts to lead the decisionmaker to an anticipated decision:
the provision of relevant and annotated information. Such information in the
system is made easy by taking into account the diversity of resources and those
that are well annotated so formally and informally by the EI actors. A capital
research framework consist of integrating in the decision-making process the
annotator activity, the software agent (or the reasoning mechanisms) and the
information resources enhancement.
