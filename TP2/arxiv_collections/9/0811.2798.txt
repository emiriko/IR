We study interacting bosons in optical lattices in the weak-tunneling regime
in systems that exhibit the coexistence of Mott-insulating and condensed
phases. We discuss the nature of the condensed ground state in this regime and
the validity of the mean-field treatment thereof. We suggest two experimental
signatures of condensate order in the system. (1) We analyze the hyperfine
configuration of the system and propose a set of experimental parameters for
observing radio-frequency spectra that would demonstrate the existence of the
condensed phase between Mott-insulating phases. We derive the structure of the
signal from the condensate in a typical trapped system, taking into account
Goldstone excitations, and discuss its evolution as a function of temperature.
(2) We study matter-wave interference patterns displayed by the system upon
release from all confining potentials. We show that as the density profiles
evolve very differently for the Mott-insulating phase and the condensed phase,
they can be distinguished from one another when the two phases coexist.
