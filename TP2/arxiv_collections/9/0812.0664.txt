We propose that the height-angle ray vector in matrix optics should be
complex, based on a geometric algebra analysis. We also propose that the ray's
2x2 matrix operators should be right-acting, so that the matrix product
succession would go with light's left-to-right propagation. We express the
propagation and refraction operators as a sum of a unit matrix and an imaginary
matrix proportional to the Fermion creation or annihilation matrix. In this
way, we reduce the products of matrix operators into sums of
creation-annihilation product combinations. We classify ABCD optical systems
into four: telescopic, inverse Fourier transforming, Fourier transforming, and
imaging. We show that each of these systems have a corresponding Lagrange
theorem expressed in partial derivatives, and that only the telescopic and
imaging systems have Lagrange invariants.
