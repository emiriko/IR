We study energy propagation in locally time-periodically driven disordered
nonlinear chains. For frequencies inside the band of linear Anderson modes,
three different regimes are observed with increasing driver amplitude: 1) Below
threshold, localized quasiperiodic oscillations and no spreading; 2) Three
different regimes in time close to threshold, with almost regular oscillations
initially, weak chaos and slow spreading for intermediate times, and finally
strong diffusion; 3) Immediate spreading for strong driving. The thresholds are
due to simple bifurcations, obtained analytically for a single oscillator, and
numerically as turning-points of the nonlinear response manifold for a full
chain. Generically, the threshold is nonzero also for infinite chains.
