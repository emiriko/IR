We point out that a special case of an ideal gas exhibits concentration of
the volume of its phase space, which is a sphere, around its equator in the
thermodynamic limit. The rate of approach to the thermodynamic limit is
determined. Our argument relies on the spherical isoperimetric inequality of
L\'{e}vy and Gromov.
