Let $sigma$ be a complete simplicial fan in finite dimensional real Euclidean
space $V$, and let $G$ be a cyclic subgroup of $GL(V)$ which acts properly on
$\sigma$. We show that the representation of $G$ carried by the cohomology of
$X_{sigma}$, the toric variety associated to $sigma$, is a permutation
representation.
