We use bulk magnetic susceptibility, electronic specific heat, and neutron
scattering to study structural and magnetic phase transitions in Fe$_{1+y}$Se%
$_x$Te$_{1-x}$. Fe$_{1.068}$Te exhibits a first order phase transition near 67
K with a tetragonal to monoclinic structural transition and simultaneously
develops a collinear antiferromagnetic (AF) order responsible for the entropy
change across the transition. Systematic studies of FeSe$%_{1-x}$Te$_x$ system
reveal that the AF structure and lattice distortion in these materials are
different from those of FeAs-based pnictides. These results call into question
the conclusions of present density functional calculations, where
FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and FeAs-based pnictides are expected to have similar Fermi
surfaces and therefore the same spin-density-wave AF order.
