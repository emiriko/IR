We identify the phase-space structures that regulate atomic double ionization
in strong ultrashort laser pulses. The emerging dynamical picture complements
the recollision scenario by clarifying the distinct roles played by the
recolliding and core electrons, and leads to verifiable predictions on the
characteristic features of the "knee", a hallmark of the nonsequential process.
