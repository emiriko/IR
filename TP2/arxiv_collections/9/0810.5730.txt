We present a phenomenological conjecture of new physics that is suggested by
the topology and kinematic properties of the multi-muon events recently
reported by the CDF collaboration. We show that the salient features of the
data can be accounted for by postulating the pair production of three new
states h1, h2, and h3 with masses in the range of 15, 7.3 and 3.6 GeV/c^2,
respectively. The heavier states cascade-decay into the lighter ones, whereas
the lightest state decays into a tau pair with a lifetime of the order of 20
ps.
