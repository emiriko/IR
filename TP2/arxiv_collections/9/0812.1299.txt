In $1/N_c$ expansion, analyticity and crossing lead to crossing even and odd
($C=\pm 1$) vacuum exchanges at high-energy, the {\em Pomeron} and the {\em
Odderon}. We discuss how, using {\em String/Gauge duality}, these can be
identified with a reggeized {\em Graviton} and the anti-symmetric {\em
Kalb-Ramond fields} in $AdS$ background. With confinement, these Regge
singularities interpolate with glueball states. We also discuss unitarization
based on eikonal sum in $AdS$.
