We have studied the ground state of the one dimensional Hubbard superlattice
structures with different unit cell sizes in the presence of electric field.
Self consistent Hartree-Fock approximation calculation is done in the weak to
intermediate interaction regime. Studying the charge gap at the Fermi level and
the charge density structure factor, we get an idea how the charge modulation
on the superlattice is governed by the competition between the electronic
correlation and the external electric field.
