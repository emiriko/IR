We study the structural effects produced by the quantization of vibrational
degrees of freedom in periodic crystals at zero temperature. To this end we
introduce a methodology based on mapping a suitable subspace of the vibrational
manifold and solving the Schroedinger equation in it. A number of increasingly
accurate approximations ranging from the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to
the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) method and the exact solution are
described. A thorough analysis of the approximations is presented for model
monoatomic and hydrogen-bonded chains, and results are presented for a linear
HF chain where the potential energy surface is obtained via first-principles
electronic structure calculations. We focus on quantum nuclear effects on the
lattice constant, and show that the VSCF is an excellent approximation, meaning
that correlation between modes is not extremely important. The QHA is excellent
for covalently-bonded, mildly anharmonic systems, but it fails for
hydrogen-bonded ones. In the latter, the zero-point energy exhibits a
non-analytic behavior at the lattice constant where the H-atoms center, which
leads to a spurious secondary minimum in the quantum-corrected energy curve. An
inexpensive anharmonic appoximation of non-interacting modes appears to produce
rather good results for hydrogen-bonded chains, for small system sizes.
However, it converges to the incorrect QHA results for increasing size. Isotope
effects are studied for the first-principles HF chain. We show how the lattice
constant and the HF distance increase with decreasing mass, and how the QHA
proves to be insufficient to reproduce this behavior.
