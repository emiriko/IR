Quantum gravity is an important and to great extent unsolved problem. There
are many different approaches to the quantization of the metric field, both
perturbative and non-perturbative. The current situation in the perturbative
quantum gravity is characterized by a number of different models, some of them
well elaborated but no one perfect nor mathematically neither
phenomenologically, mainly because there are no theoretically derived
observables which can be experimentally measured. A very interesting one is an
effective approach which separates the low-energy quantum effects from the UV
sector. In this way one can calculate quantities which are potentially relevant
for establishing certain universal features of quantum gravity. In this
presentation we give a polemic consideration of the effective approach to the
infrared quantum gravity. We question the validity of the recent results in
this area and also discuss how one can check the alleged universality of the
effective approach.
