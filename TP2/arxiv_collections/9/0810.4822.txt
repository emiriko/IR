The peculiarities of coherent spin radiation by magnetic nanomolecules is
investigated by means of numerical simulation. The consideration is based on a
microscopic Hamiltonian taking into account realistic dipole interactions.
Superradiance can be realized only when the molecular sample is coupled to a
resonant electric circuit. The feedback mechanism allows for the achievement of
a fast spin reversal time and large radiation intensity. The influence on the
level of radiation, caused by sample shape and orientation, is analysed. The
most powerful coherent radiation is found to occur for an elongated sample
directed along the resonator magnetic field.
