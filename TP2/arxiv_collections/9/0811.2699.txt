We discuss several phenomenological aspects of the fully constrained version
of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (cNMSSM).
Assuming universal boundary conditions at a high energy scale for the soft
supersymmetry-breaking gaugino, sfermion and Higgs masses as well as for the
trilinear interactions, we find that the model can satisfy all present
constraints from colliders and cosmological data on dark matter, B- and
muon-physics. The phenomenologically viable region of the parameter space of
the cNMSSM can be described by essentially one single parameter as the
universal gaugino mass parameter M_{1/2}, and corresponds to small values for
the universal scalar mass m_0. The lightest supersymmetric particle is always a
singlino-like neutralino that is almost degenerate with the lightest tau
slepton. We study the particle spectrum of the model and its signatures at the
LHC, such as possibly long-lived tau sleptons at the end of decay chains, that
would distinguish the cNMSSM from the constrained MSSM.
