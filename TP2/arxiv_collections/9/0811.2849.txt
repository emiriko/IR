The development of accurate and fast algorithms for the Boltzmann collision
integral and their analysis represent a challenging problem in scientific
computing and numerical analysis. Recently, several works were devoted to the
derivation of spectrally accurate schemes for the Boltzmann equation, but very
few of them were concerned with the stability analysis of the method. In
particular there was no result of stability except when the method is modified
in order to enforce the posivity preservation, which destroys the spectral
accuracy. In this paper we propose a new method to study the stability of
homogeneous Boltzmann equations perturbed by smoothed balanced operators which
do not preserve positivity of the distribution. This method takes advantage of
the "spreading" property of the collision, together with estimates on
regularity and entropy production. As an application we prove stability and
convergence of spectral methods for the Boltzmann equation, when the
discretization parameter is large enough (with explicit bound).
