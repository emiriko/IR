We extend the Siu--Beauville theorem to a certain class of compact
Kaehler--Weyl manifolds, proving that they fiber holomorphically over
hyperbolic Riemannian surfaces whenever they satisfy the necessary topological
hypotheses. As applications we obtain restrictions on the fundamental groups of
such Kaehler--Weyl manifolds, and show that in certain cases they are in fact
Kaehler.
