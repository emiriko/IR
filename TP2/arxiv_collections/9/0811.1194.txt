The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation has been firmly established: neutrinos
change their flavor in their path from their source to observers. This paper is
dedicated to the description of experimental results in the oscillation field,
of their present understanding and of possible future developments in
experimental neutrino oscillation physics.
