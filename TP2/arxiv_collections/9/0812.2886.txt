The Kirschner-Lipatov result for the DLLA of high-energy $qq'$ backward
scattering is re-derived without the use of integral equations. It is shown
that part of the inequalities between the variables in the
logarithmically-divergent integrals is inconsequential. The light-cone
wave-function interpretation under the conditions of backward scattering is
discussed. It is argued that for hadron-hadron scattering in the valence-quark
model the reggeization should manifest itself at full strength starting from
$s_{hh}=50 GeV^2$.
