The influence of random surface inhomogeneities on spectral properties of
open microresonators is studied both theoretically and experimentally. To solve
the equations governing the dynamics of electromagnetic fields the method of
eigen-mode separation is applied previously developed with reference to
inhomogeneous systems subject to arbitrary external static potential. We prove
theoretically that it is the gradient mechanism of wave-surface scattering
which is the highly responsible for non-dissipative loss in the resonator. The
influence of side-boundary inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum is shown
to be described in terms of effective renormalization of mode wave numbers
jointly with azimuth indices in the characteristic equation. To study
experimentally the effect of inhomogeneities on the resonator spectrum, the
method of modeling in the millimeter wave range is applied. As a model object
we use dielectric disc resonator (DDR) fitted with external inhomogeneities
randomly arranged at its side boundary. Experimental results show good
agreement with theoretical predictions as regards the predominance of the
gradient scattering mechanism. It is shown theoretically and confirmed in the
experiment that TM oscillations in the DDR are less affected by surface
inhomogeneities than TE oscillations with the same azimuth indices. The DDR
model chosen for our study as well as characteristic equations obtained
thereupon enable one to calculate both the eigen-frequencies and the Q-factors
of resonance spectral lines to fairly good accuracy. The results of
calculations agree well with obtained experimental data.
