Bell's theorem shows that local realistic theories place strong restrictions
on observable correlations between different systems, giving rise to Bell's
inequality which can be violated in experiments using entangled quantum states.
Bell's theorem is based on the assumptions of realism, locality, and the
freedom to choose between measurement settings. In experimental tests,
"loopholes" arise which allow observed violations to still be explained by
local realistic theories. Violating Bell's inequality while simultaneously
closing all such loopholes is one of the most significant still open challenges
in fundamental physics today. In this paper, we present an experiment that
violates Bell's inequality while simultaneously closing the locality loophole
and addressing the freedom-of-choice loophole, also closing the latter within a
reasonable set of assumptions. We also explain that the locality and
freedom-of-choice loopholes can be closed only within non-determinism, i.e. in
the context of stochastic local realism.
