We report on a search for inclusive production of squarks and gluinos in
ppbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, in events with large missing transverse
energy and multiple jets of hadrons in the final state. The study uses a CDF
Run II data sample corresponding to 2 fb-1 of integrated luminosity. The data
are in good agreement with the standard model predictions, giving no evidence
for any squark or gluino component. In an R-parity conserving minimal
supergravity scenario with A_0 = 0, mu < 0 and tanbeta = 5, 95% C.L. upper
limits on the production cross sections in the range between 0.1 pb and 1 pb
are obtained, depending on the squark and gluino masses considered. For gluino
masses below 280 GeV/c2, arbitrarily large squark masses are excluded at the
95%C.L., while for mass degenerate gluinos and squarks, masses below 392 GeV/c2
are excluded at the 95% C.L.
