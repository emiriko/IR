Understanding the influence of vibrational motion of the atoms on electronic
transitions in molecules constitutes a cornerstone of quantum physics, as
epitomized by the Franck-Condon principle of spectroscopy. Recent advances in
building molecular-electronics devices and nanoelectromechanical systems open a
new arena for studying the interaction between mechanical and electronic
degrees of freedom in transport at the single-molecule level. The tunneling of
electrons through molecules or suspended quantum dots has been shown to excite
vibrational modes, or vibrons. Beyond this effect, theory predicts that strong
electron-vibron coupling dramatically suppresses the current flow at low
biases, a collective behaviour known as Franck-Condon blockade. Here we show
measurements on quantum dots formed in suspended single-wall carbon nanotubes
revealing a remarkably large electron-vibron coupling and, due to the high
quality and unprecedented tunability of our samples, admit a quantitative
analysis of vibron-mediated electronic transport in the regime of strong
electron-vibron coupling. This allows us to unambiguously demonstrate the
Franck-Condon blockade in a suspended nanostructure. The large observed
electron-vibron coupling could ultimately be a key ingredient for the detection
of quantized mechanical motion. It also emphasizes the unique potential for
nanoelectromechanical device applications based on suspended graphene sheets
and carbon nanotubes.
