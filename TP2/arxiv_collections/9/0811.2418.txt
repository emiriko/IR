The energy evolution of average multiplicities and multiplicity fluctuations
in jets produced in heavy-ion collisions is investigated from a toy
QCD-inspired model. In this model, we use modified splitting functions
accounting for medium-enhanced radiation of gluons by a fast parton which
propagates through the quark gluon plasma. The leading contribution of the
standard production of soft hadrons is enhanced by a factor $\sqrt{N_s}$ while
next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections are suppressed by $1/\sqrt{N_s}$, where
the parameter $N_s>1$ accounts for the induced-soft gluons in the medium. Our
results for such global observables are cross-checked and compared with their
limits in the vacuum.
