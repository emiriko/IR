We suggest a hybrid seesaw model where relatively ``light''right-handed
neutrinos give no contribution to the neutrino mass matrix due to a special
symmetry. This allows their Yukawa couplings to the standard model particles to
be relatively strong, so that the standard model Higgs boson can decay
dominantly to a left and a right-handed neutrino, leaving another stable
right-handed neutrino as cold dark matter. In our model neutrino masses arise
via the type-II seesaw mechanism, the Higgs triplet scalars being also
responsible for the generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry via the
leptogenesis mechanism.
