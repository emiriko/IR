The stability properties of models of spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking in
chemistry are characterized algebraically. The models considered here all
derive either from the Frank model or from autocatalysis with limited
enantioselectivity. Emphasis is given to identifying the critical parameter
controlling the chiral symmetry breaking transition from racemic to chiral
steady-state solutions. This parameter is identified in each case, and the
constraints on the chemical rate constants determined from dynamic stability
are derived.
