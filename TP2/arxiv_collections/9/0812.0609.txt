In this work, we introduce the point parameter ring B, a generalized twisted
homogeneous coordinate ring associated to a degenerate version of the
three-dimensional Sklyanin algebra. The surprising geometry of these algebras
yields an analogue to a result of Artin-Tate-van den Bergh, namely that B is
generated in degree one and thus is a factor of the corresponding degenerate
Sklyanin algebra.
