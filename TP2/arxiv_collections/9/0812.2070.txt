Absorption of hydrogen molecules on Nickel and Rhodium doped hexagonal boron
nitride(BN) sheet is investigated by using the first principle method. The most
stable site for the Ni atom was the on top side of nitrogen atom, while Rh
atoms deservers a hollow site over the hexagonal BN sheet. The first hydrogen
molecule was absorbed dissociatively over Rh atom, and molecularly on Ni doped
BN sheet. Both Ni and Rh atoms are capable to absorb up to three hydrogen
molecules chemically and the metal atom to BN sheet distance increases with the
increase in the number of hydrogen molecules. Finally, our calculations offer
explanation for the nature of bonding between the metal atom and the hydrogen
molecules, which is due to the hybridization of metal d orbital with the
hydrogen s orbital. These calculation results can be useful to understand the
nature of interaction between the doped metal and the BN sheet, and their
interaction with the hydrogen molecules.
