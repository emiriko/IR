By using the solution describing a black hole embedded in the FLRW universe,
we obtain the evolving equation of the black hole mass expressed in terms of
the cosmological parameters. The evolving equation indicates that in the
phantom dark energy universe the black hole mass becomes zero before the Big
Rip is reached.
