Within the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge the
ghost and gluon propagators are determined from a variational solution of the
Yang-Mills Schroedinger equation showing both gluon and heavy quark
confinement. The continuum results are in good agreement with lattice data. The
ghost form factor is identified as the dielectric function of the Yang--Mills
vacuum and the Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario is shown to imply the dual
Meissner effect. The topological susceptibility is calculated.
