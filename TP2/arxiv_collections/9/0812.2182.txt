In the study on nonlinear wave-wave processes in an ionosphere and a
magnetosphere usually the main attention is paid to investigation of plasma
turbulence at well developed stage, when the wide spectrum of plasma wave is
present. On the other side, it is well known that even if the number of
cooperating waves remains small due to a competition of processes of their
instability and attenuation, the turbulence appears in the result of their
stochastic behavior. The regimes of nonlinear dynamics of low frequency waves
excited due to Farley-Buneman instability in weakly ionized and inhomogeneous
ionospheric plasma in the presence of electric current perpendicular to ambient
magnetic field are considered. The problem is essentially three dimensional and
difficult for full numerical simulation, but the strong collisional damping of
waves allow to assume that in this case a perturbed state of plasma can be
described as finite set of interacting waves, some of which are unstable and
other strongly damping. The proposed nonlinear model allow to make full study
of nonlinear stabilization, conditions of stochasticity and to consider the
different regimes and properties of few mode plasma turbulence.
