Assume that $f$ is Dunkl polyharmonic in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e. $(\Delta_h)^p
f=0$ for some integer $p$, where $\Delta_h$ is the Dunkl Laplacian associated
to a root system $R$ and to a multiplicity function $\kappa$, defined on $R$
and invariant with respect to the finite Coxeter group). Necessary and
successful condition that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $\le s$ for $s\ge 2p-2$
is proved. As a direct corollary, a Dunkl harmonic function bounded above or
below is constant.
