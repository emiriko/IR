The Davey-Stewartson equations are used to describe the long time evolution
of a three-dimensional packets of surface waves. Assuming that the argument
functions are quadratic in spacial variables, we find in this paper various
exact solutions modulo the most known symmetry transformations for the
Davey-Stewartson equations.
