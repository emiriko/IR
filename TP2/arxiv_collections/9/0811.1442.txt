We propose a modified pairing functional for nuclear structure calculations
which avoids the abrupt phase transition between pairing and non-pairing
states. The intended application is the description of nuclear collective
motion where the smoothing of the transition is compulsory to remove
singularities. The stabilized pairing functional allows a thoroughly
variational formulation, unlike the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) scheme which is often
used for the purpose of smoothing. First applications to nuclear ground states
and collective excitations prove the reliability and efficiency of the proposed
stabilized pairing.
