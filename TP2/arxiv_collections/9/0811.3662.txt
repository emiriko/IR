We study the transverse momentum distribution of low-mass lepton pairs
produced in hadronic scattering, using the perturbative QCD factorization
approach. We argue that the distribution at large transverse momentum, $Q_T \gg
Q$, with the pair's invariant mass $Q$ as low as $Q \sim
\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$, can be systematically factorized into universal
parton-to-lepton pair fragmentation functions, parton distributions, and
perturbatively calculable partonic hard parts evaluated at a short distance
scale $\sim {\cal O}(1/Q_T)$. We introduce a model for the input lepton pair
fragmentation functions at a scale $\mu_0\sim 1$ GeV, which are then evolved
perturbatively to scales relevant at RHIC. Using the evolved fragmentation
functions, we calculate the transverse momentum distributions in hadron-hadron,
hadron-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC. We also discuss the
sensitivity of the transverse momentum distribution of low-mass lepton pairs to
the gluon distribution.
