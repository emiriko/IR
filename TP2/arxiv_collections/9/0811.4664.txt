We update Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional SU(3) + adjoint
Higgs theory, by extrapolating carefully to the infinite volume and continuum
limits, in order to estimate the contribution of the infrared modes to the
pressure of hot QCD. The sum of infrared contributions beyond the known 4-loop
order turns out to be a smooth function, of a reasonable magnitude and specific
sign. Unfortunately, adding this function to the known 4-loop terms does not
improve the match to four-dimensional lattice data, in spite of the fact that
other quantities, such as correlation lengths, spatial string tension, or quark
number susceptibilities, work well within the same setup. We outline possible
ways to reduce the mismatch.
