We suggest a scheme to probe critical phenomena at a quantum phase transition
(QPT) using the quantum correlation of two photonic modes simultaneously
coupled to a critical system. As an experimentally accessible physical
implementation, a circuit QED system is formed by a capacitively coupled
Josephson junction qubit array interacting with one superconducting
transmission line resonator (TLR). It realizes an Ising chain in the transverse
field (ICTF) which interacts with the two magnetic modes propagating in the
TLR. We demonstrate that in the vicinity of criticality the originally
independent fields tend to display photon bunching effects due to their
interaction with the ICTF. Thus, the occurrence of the QPT is reflected by the
quantum characteristics of the photonic fields.
