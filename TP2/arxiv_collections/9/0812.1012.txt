In several applications such as databases, planning, and sensor networks,
parameters such as selectivity, load, or sensed values are known only with some
associated uncertainty. The performance of such a system (as captured by some
objective function over the parameters) is significantly improved if some of
these parameters can be probed or observed. In a resource constrained
situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system
performance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem.
This general problem is the focus of this paper.
  One of the most important considerations in this framework is whether
adaptivity is required for the observations. Adaptive observations introduce
blocking or sequential operations in the system whereas non-adaptive
observations can be performed in parallel. One of the important questions in
this regard is to characterize the benefit of adaptivity for probes and
observation.
  We present general techniques for designing constant factor approximations to
the optimal observation schemes for several widely used scheduling and metric
objective functions. We show a unifying technique that relates this
optimization problem to the outlier version of the corresponding deterministic
optimization. By making this connection, our technique shows constant factor
upper bounds for the benefit of adaptivity of the observation schemes. We show
that while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function,
being adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors.
