We present results of transport and magnetic properties and heat capacity
measurements on polycrystalline CeFeAsO, PrFeAsO, and NdFeAsO. These materials
undergo structural phase transitions, spin density wave-like magnetic ordering
of small moments on iron, and antiferromagnetic ordering of rare earth moments.
The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient,
thermal conductivity, Hall coefficient, and magnetoresistance are reported. The
magnetic behavior of the materials have been investigated using Mossbauer
spectroscopy and magnetization measurements. Transport and magnetic properties
are affected strongly by the structural and magnetic transitions, suggesting
significant changes in the band structure and/or carrier mobilities occur, and
phonon-phonon scattering is reduced upon transformation to the low temperature
structure. Results are compared to recent reports for LaFeAsO, and systematic
variations in properties as the identity of Ln is changed are observed and
discussed. As Ln progresses across the rare-earth series from La to Nd, an
increase in the hole contributions to Seebeck coefficient, and increases in
magnetoresistance and the Hall coefficient are observed in the low temperature
phase. Analysis of hyperfine fields at the iron nuclei determined from
Mossbauer spectra indicates that the moment on Fe in the orthorhombic phase is
nearly independent of the identity of Ln, in apparent contrast to reports of
powder neutron diffraction refinements.
