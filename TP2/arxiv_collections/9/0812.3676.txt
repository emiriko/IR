We report the development of the frequency-modulation (FM) method for
measuring electron spin resonance (ESR) absorption in the 210-420 GHz frequency
range. We demonstrate that using a high-frequency ESR spectrometer without
resonating microwave components enables us to overcome technical difficulties
associated with the FM method due to nonlinear microwave-elements, without
sacrificing spectrometer performance. FM was achieved by modulating the
reference oscillator of a 13 GHz Phase Locked Dielectric Resonator Oscillator,
and amplifying and frequency-multiplying the resulting millimeter-wave
radiation up to 210, 315 and 420 GHz. ESR spectra were obtained in reflection
mode by a lock-in detection at the fundamental modulation frequency, and also
at the second and third harmonic. Sensitivity of the setup was verified by
conduction electron spin resonance measurement in KC$_{60}$.
