A two-mode boson model, widely used for the physics of fast rotating nuclei
and Bose-Einstein condensates, is studied in the context of entanglement
control. We derive an analytical expression for the entanglement between the
fields in this model as a function of time. We found that depending on the
interaction strengths between boson modes and the nature of the initial boson
states the dynamical evolution of the entanglement and the squeezing can occur
independently.
