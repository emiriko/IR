Based on experimental data it is shown, for some chosen alloys and compounds
of iron, that there is no one unique relationship between the 57Fe-site
magnetic hyperfine field, Bhf, and the magnetic moment per Fe atom, m. Instead,
the Bhf-m plot consists of several branches, each of them being characteristic
of a given alloy or compound. Consequently, the effective proportionality
constant (hyperfine coupling constant) depends on the alloy system or compound,
and for a given alloy system or compound it depends on the composition or even
on the lattice site. Consequently, the scaling of Bhf into the underlying m
cannot be done a priopri.
