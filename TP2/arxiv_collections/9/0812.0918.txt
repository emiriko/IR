Numerical studies of dislocation pair correlations have played a central role
in deriving a continuum theory from the equations of motion of 2D dislocation
systems in a mathematically rigorous way. As part of an effort to extend this
theory into the full 3D dislocation problem, 3D dislocation pair correlations
were studied with discrete dislocation dynamics simulation. As a first
approximation, dislocations were modeled as uncharged curves in space (their
Burgers vectors were disregarded). An inverse square decay with distance was
found to describe the numerically obtained pair correlations of the studied
curve system.
