Directly observing a zero energy Majorana state in the vortex core of a
chiral superconductor by tunneling spectroscopy requires energy resolution
better than the spacing between core states $\Delta^2/eF$. We show that
nevertheless, its existence can be decisively tested by comparing the
temperature broadened tunneling conductance of a vortex with that of an
antivortex even at temperatures $T >> \Delta^2/eF$.
