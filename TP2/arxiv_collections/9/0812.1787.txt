We investigate charged and neutral current neutrino induced incoherent pion
production off nuclei at MiniBooNE and K2K energies within the GiBUU model. We
assume impulse approximation and treat the nucleus as a local Fermi gas of
nucleons bound in a mean-field potential. In-medium spectral functions are also
taken into account. The outcome of the initial neutrino nucleon reaction
undergoes complex hadronic final state interactions. We present results for
neutral current pi^0 and charged current pi^+ production and compare to
MiniBooNE and K2K data.
