The polarized Raman scattering spectra of nonsuperconducting $\alpha$-FeTe
and of the newly discovered, As-free superconductor
Fe$_{1.03}$Se$_{0.3}$Te$_{0.7}$ are measured at room temperature on single
crystals. The phonon modes are assigned by combining symmetry analysis with
first-principles calculations. In the parent compound $\alpha$-FeTe, the
A$_{1g}$ mode of the Te atom and the B$_{1g}$ mode of the Fe atom are observed
clearly, while in superconducting Fe$_{1.03}$Se$_{0.3}$Te$_{0.7}$, only a
softened Fe B$_{1g}$ mode can be seen. No electron-phonon coupling feature can
be distinguished in the spectra of the two samples. By contrast, the spectra of
the superconducting system show a slight enhancement below 300$cm^{-1}$, which
may be of electronic origin.
