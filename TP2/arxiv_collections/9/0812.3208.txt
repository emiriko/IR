In this article we review existing literature on dynamic copulas and then
propose an n-copula which varies in time and space. Our approach makes use of
stochastic differential equations, and gives rise to a dynamic copula which is
able to capture the dependence between multiple Markov diffusion processes.
This model is suitable for pricing basket derivatives in finance and may also
be applicable to other areas such as bioinformatics and environmental science.
