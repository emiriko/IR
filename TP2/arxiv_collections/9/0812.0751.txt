This article is an introduction for the nonpractitioner to the ideas and
issues of LISA data analysis, as reflected in the explorations and experiments
of the participants in the Mock LISA Data Challenges. In particular, I discuss
the methods and codes that have been developed for the detection and parameter
estimation of supermassive black-hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals,
and Galactic binaries.
