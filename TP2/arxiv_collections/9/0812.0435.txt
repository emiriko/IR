We introduce a Littlewood-Richardson rule based on an algorithmic deformation
of skew Young diagrams and present a bijection with the classical rule. The
result is a direct combinatorial interpretation and proof of the geometric rule
presented by Coskun. We also present a corollary regarding the Specht modules
of the intermediate diagrams.
