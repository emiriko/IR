Multi-model ensembles provide a pragmatic approach to the representation of
model uncertainty in climate prediction. However, such representations are
inherently ad hoc, and, as shown, probability distributions of climate
variables based on current-generation multi-model ensembles, are not accurate.
Results from seasonal re-forecast studies suggest that climate model ensembles
based on stochastic-dynamic parametrisation are beginning to outperform
multi-model ensembles, and have the potential to become significantly more
skilful than multi-model ensembles.
  The case is made for stochastic representations of model uncertainty in
future-generation climate prediction models. Firstly, a guiding characteristic
of the scientific method is an ability to characterise and predict uncertainty;
individual climate models are not currently able to do this. Secondly, through
the effects of noise-induced rectification, stochastic-dynamic parametrisation
may provide a (poor man's) surrogate to high resolution. Thirdly,
stochastic-dynamic parametrisations may be able to take advantage of the
inherent stochasticity of electron flow through certain types of low-energy
computer chips, currently under development.
  These arguments have particular resonance for next-generation Earth-System
models, which purport to be comprehensive numerical representations of climate,
and where integrations at high resolution may be unaffordable.
