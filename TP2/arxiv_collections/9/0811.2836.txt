The interplay of different scattering mechanisms can lead to novel effects in
transport. We show theoretically that the interplay of weak impurity and
Umklapp scattering in spin-1/2 chains leads to a pronounced dip in the magnetic
field dependence of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ at a magnetic field $B
\sim T$. In sufficiently clean samples, the reduction of the magnetic
contribution to heat transport can easily become larger than 50% and the effect
is predicted to exist even in samples with a large exchange coupling, J >> B,
where the field-induced magnetization is small. Qualitatively, our theory might
explain dips at $B \sim T$ observed in recent heat transport measurements on
copper pyrazine dinitrate, but a fully quantitative description is not possible
within our model.
