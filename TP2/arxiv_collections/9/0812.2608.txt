Within the framework of Gaussian equivalent representation method a new
procedure of obtaining equations of state for simple liquids is discussed in
some technical details. The developed approach permits one to compute partition
and distribution functions for simple liquids with arbitrary form of the
central two-body potential of inter-molecular interaction. The proposed
approach might become of great use for computing thermodynamic and structural
quantities of simple particle and polymer systems. We believe that this
technique can also provide an interesting possibility to reduce the sign
problem of other methods of computer simulation based on a functional integral
approach.
