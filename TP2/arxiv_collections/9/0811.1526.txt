We report on the formation of surface instabilities in a layer of
thermoreversible ferrogel when exposed to a vertical magnetic field. Both
static and time dependent magnetic fields are employed. Under variations of
temperature, the viscoelastic properties of our soft magnetic matter can be
tuned. Stress relaxation experiments unveil a stretched exponential scaling of
the shear modulus, with an exponent of beta=1/3. The resulting magnetic
threshold for the formation of Rosensweig-cusps is measured for different
temperatures, and compared with theoretical predictions by Bohlius et. al. in
J. Phys.: Condens. Matter., 2006, 18, 2671-2684.
