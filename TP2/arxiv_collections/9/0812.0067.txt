This paper describes and analyzes a method for computing border bases of a
zero-dimensional ideal $I$. The criterion used in the computation involves
specific commutation polynomials and leads to an algorithm and an
implementation extending the one provided in [MT'05]. This general border basis
algorithm weakens the monomial ordering requirement for \grob bases
computations. It is up to date the most general setting for representing
quotient algebras, embedding into a single formalism Gr\"obner bases, Macaulay
bases and new representation that do not fit into the previous categories. With
this formalism we show how the syzygies of the border basis are generated by
commutation relations. We also show that our construction of normal form is
stable under small perturbations of the ideal, if the number of solutions
remains constant. This new feature for a symbolic algorithm has a huge impact
on the practical efficiency as it is illustrated by the experiments on
classical benchmark polynomial systems, at the end of the paper.
