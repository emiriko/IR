A new approach to the perturbative analysis of dynamical systems, which can
be described approximately by soliton solutions of integrable nonlinear wave
equations, is employed in the case of small-amplitude solutions of the ion
acoustic wave equations of Plasma Physics. Instead of the traditional
derivation of a perturbed KdV equation, the ion velocity is written as a sum of
two components: elastic and inelastic. In the single-soliton case, the elastic
component is the full solution. In the multiple-soliton case, it is
complemented by the inelastic component. The original system is transformed
into two evolution equations: An asymptotically integrable Normal Form for
ordinary KdV solitons, and an equation for the inelastic component. The
zero-order term of the elastic component is a single- or
multiple-soliton-solution of the Normal Form. The inelastic component
asymptotes into a linear combination of single-soliton solutions of the Normal
Form, with amplitudes determined by soliton interactions, plus a second-order
decaying dispersive wave. Satisfaction of a conservation law by the inelastic
component and of mass conservation by the disturbance to the ion density is
determined solely by the initial data and/or boundary conditions imposed on the
inelastic component. The electrostatic potential is a first-order quantity. It
is affected by the inelastic component only in second-order. The charge density
displays a triple-layer structure. The analysis is carried out through third
order.
