The existing data appears to provide hints of an underlying high scale
theory. These arise from the gauge coupling unification, from the smallness of
the neutrino masses, and via a non-vanishing muon anomaly. An overview of high
scale models is given with a view to possible tests at the Large Hadron
Collider. Specifically we discuss here some generic approaches to deciphering
their signatures. We also consider an out of the box possibility of a four
generation model where the fourth generation is a mirror generation rather than
a sequential generation. Such a scenario can lead to some remarkably distinct
signatures at the LHC.
