Slow time-dependent fluctuations, or noise, in the electrical resistance of
dc magnetron sputtered thin films of Nickel Titanium shape memory alloys have
been measured. Even in equilibrium, the noise was several orders of magnitude
larger than that of simple diffusive metallic films, and was found to be
non-monotonic around the martensitic transformation regime. The results are
discussed in terms of dynamics of structural defects, which also lay foundation
to a new noise-based characterization scheme of martensite transformation.
