We discuss a generalization of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model in the form of three additional singlet superfields, which would
explain the essential features of the CDF multi-muon events presented recently:
a large production cross section of ~ 100 pb originates from the production of
a CP-odd scalar A with a mass in the 70 - 80 GeV range and a large value of
tan(beta) ~ 40. The CP-odd scalar A decays dominantly into CP-odd and CP-even
scalars a_1 and h_1, which generate decay cascades h_1 -> 2 h_2 -> 4 a_2 -> 8
tau-leptons, and a_1 -> h_1 a_2 with h_1 decaying as above. The decay a_2 ->
tau+ tau- is slow, leading to a lifetime of O(20) ps. The phenomenology of the
model differs from similar scenarios presented before in that one of the two
cascades leads to 10 instead of 8 tau-leptons, and additional production
processes like associate A production with b b-bar pairs are relevant.
