We propose a new method for the production of ultracold molecular ions. This
method utilizes sympathetic cooling due to the strong collisions between
appropriately chosen molecular ions and laser-cooled neutral atoms to realize
ultracold, internal ground-state molecular ions. In contrast to other
experiments producing cold molecular ions, our proposed method efficiently
cools both the internal and external molecular ion degrees of freedom. The
availability of an ultracold, absolute ground-state sample of molecular ions
would have broad impact to fields as diverse as quantum chemistry,
astrophysics, and fundamental physics; and may lead to the development of a
robust, scalable quantum computer.
