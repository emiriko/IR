Magnetic properties of quark matter at finite temperature are discussed by
evaluating the magnetic susceptibility. Combining the microscopic calculation
of the self-energy for quarks as well as the screening effects for gluons with
Fermi-liquid theory in a consistent way, we study the temperature dependence of
the magnetic susceptibility. The longitudinal gluons have the static screening
given by the Debye mass, and have a standard temperature dependence of
$O(T^2)$. An anomalous $T^2\ln T$ term arises in the magnetic susceptibility as
a novel non-Fermi-liquid effect due to the anomalous self-energy for quarks
given by the dynamic screening for transverse gluons. We then extract the
critical(Curie) temperature and present the magnetic phase diagram on the
density-temperature plane.
