Consider the macroscale modelling of microscale spatiotemporal dynamics. Here
we develop a new approach to ensure coarse scale discrete models preserve
important self-adjoint properties of the fine scale dynamics. The first part
explores the discretisation of microscale continuum dynamics. The second
addresses how dynamics on a fine lattice are mapped to lattice a factor of two
coarser (as in multigrids). Such mapping of discrete lattice dynamics may be
iterated to empower us in future research to explore scale dependent emergent
phenomena. The support of dynamical systems, centre manifold, theory ensures
that the coarse scale modelling applies with a finite spectral gap, in a finite
domain, and for all time. The accuracy of the models is limited by the
asymptotic resolution of subgrid coarse scale processes, and is controlled by
the level of truncation. As given examples demonstrate, the novel feature of
the approach developed here is that it ensures the preservation of important
conservation properties of the microscale dynamics.
