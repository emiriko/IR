We investigate the interplay between the quantum coherence and statistics in
electrically driven nano-structures. We obtain expression for the admittance
and the current noise for a driven nano-capacitor in terms of the Floquet
scattering matrix and derive a non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation
relation. As an interplay between the quantum phase coherence and the many-body
correlation, the admittance has peak values whenever the noise power shows a
step as a function of near-by gate voltage.
  Our theory is demonstrated by calculating the admittance and noise of driven
double quantum dots.
