Successful incorporation of the spin degree of freedom in semiconductor
technology requires the development of a new paradigm allowing for a scalable,
non-destructive electrical detection of the spin-polarization of injected
charge carriers as they propagate along the semiconducting channel. In this
paper we report the observation of a spin-injection Hall effect (SIHE) which
exploits the quantum-relativistic nature of spin-charge transport and which
meets all these key requirements on the spin detection. The two-dimensional
electron-hole gas photo-voltaic cell we designed to observe the SIHE allows us
to develop a quantitative microscopic theory of the phenomenon and to
demonstrate its direct application in optoelectronics. We report an
experimental realization of a non-magnetic spin-photovoltaic effect via the
SIHE, rendering our device an electrical polarimeter which directly converts
the degree of circular polarization of light to a voltage signal.
