We present a dynamical model of DNA mechanical unzipping under the action of
a force. The model includes the motion of the fork in the sequence-dependent
landscape, the trap(s) acting on the bead(s), and the polymeric components of
the molecular construction (unzipped single strands of DNA, and linkers).
Different setups are considered to test the model, and the outcome of the
simulations is compared to simpler dynamical models existing in the literature
where polymers are assumed to be at equilibrium.
