Evidence for mixing in the neutral D meson system has recently been reported.
Assuming negligible CP violation, non-vanishing width and mass differences
between the two neutral D mass eigenstates has been found. Theoretical
predictions of these are rather difficult, obscuring detection of New Physics
contributions. However, the observation of CP violation in the D system would
be a good signal of New Physics. We briefly describe the formalism that
describes the neutral D decay and mixing, and present a method to determine all
the mixing parameters accurately allowing for arbitrary CP violation.
