The neutral sensor ELENA (Emitted Low-Energy Neutral Atoms) for the ESA
cornerstone BepiColombo mission to Mercury (in the SERENA instrument package)
is a new kind of low energetic neutral atoms instrument, mostly devoted to
sputtering emission from planetary surfaces, from E ~20 eV up to E~5 keV,
within 1-D (2x76 deg). ELENA is a Time-of-Flight (TOF) system, based on
oscillating shutter (operated at frequencies up to a 100 kHz) and mechanical
gratings: the incoming neutral particles directly impinge upon the entrance
with a definite timing (START) and arrive to a STOP detector after a flight
path. After a brief dissertation on the achievable scientific objectives, this
paper describes the instrument, with the new design techniques approached for
the neutral particles identification and the nano-techniques used for designing
and manufacturing the nano-structure shuttering core of the ELENA sensor. The
expected count-rates, based on the Hermean environment features, are shortly
presented and discussed. Such design technologies could be fruitfully exported
to different applications for planetary exploration.
