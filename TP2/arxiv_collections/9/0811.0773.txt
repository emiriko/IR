By application of the general twist-induced star-deformation procedure we
translate second quantization of a system of bosons/fermions on a symmetric
spacetime in a non-commutative language. The procedure deforms in a coordinated
way the spacetime algebra and its symmetries, the wave-mechanical description
of a system of n bosons/fermions, the algebra of creation and annihilation
operators and also the commutation relations of the latter with functions of
spacetime; our key requirement is the mode-decomposition independence of the
quantum field. In a conservative view, the use of noncommutative coordinates
can be seen just as a way to better express non-local interactions of a special
kind. In a non-conservative one, we obtain a covariant framework for QFT on the
corresponding noncommutative spacetime consistent with quantum mechanical
axioms and Bose-Fermi statistics. One distinguishing feature is that the field
commutation relations remain of the type "field (anti)commutator=a
distribution". We illustrate the results by choosing as examples interacting
non-relativistic and free relativistic QFT on Moyal space(time)s.
