We analyze in detail the predictions of "trimaximal" neutrino mixing, which
is defined by a mixing matrix with identical second column elements. This
column is therefore identical to the second column in the case of tri-bimaximal
mixing. We also generalize trimaximal mixing by assuming that the other rows
and columns of the mixing matrix individually have the same forms as for
tri-bimaximal mixing. The phenomenology of these new mixing scenarios is
studied. We emphasize how trimaximal mixings can be distinguished
experimentally from broken tri-bimaximal mixing.
