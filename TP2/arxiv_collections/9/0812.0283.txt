We present dichotomy theorems regarding the computational complexity of
counting fixed points in boolean (discrete) dynamical systems, i.e., finite
discrete dynamical systems over the domain {0,1}. For a class F of boolean
functions and a class G of graphs, an (F,G)-system is a boolean dynamical
system with local transitions functions lying in F and graphs in G. We show
that, if local transition functions are given by lookup tables, then the
following complexity classification holds: Let F be a class of boolean
functions closed under superposition and let G be a graph class closed under
taking minors. If F contains all min-functions, all max-functions, or all
self-dual and monotone functions, and G contains all planar graphs, then it is
#P-complete to compute the number of fixed points in an (F,G)-system; otherwise
it is computable in polynomial time. We also prove a dichotomy theorem for the
case that local transition functions are given by formulas (over logical
bases). This theorem has a significantly more complicated structure than the
theorem for lookup tables. A corresponding theorem for boolean circuits
coincides with the theorem for formulas.
