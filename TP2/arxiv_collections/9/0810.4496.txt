We give a version of geometric motivic integration that specializes to p-adic
integration via point counting. This has been done before for stable sets; we
extend this to more general sets. The main problem in doing this is that it
requires to take limits, hence the measure will have to take values in a
completion of the (localized) Grothendieck ring of varieties. The standard
choice is to complete with respect to the dimension filtration; however, since
the point counting homomorphism is not continuous with respect to this topology
we have to use a stronger one. The first part of the paper is devoted to
defining this topology; in the second part we will then see that many of the
standard constructions of geometric motivic integration work also in this
setting.
