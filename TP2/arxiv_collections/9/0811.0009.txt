The global fit of the Standard Model to electroweak precision data, routinely
performed by the LEP electroweak working group and others, demonstrated
impressively the predictive power of electroweak unification and quantum loop
corrections. We have revisited this fit in view of (i) the development of the
new generic fitting package Gfitter, (ii) the insertion of constraints from
direct Higgs searches at LEP and the Tevatron, and (iii) a more thorough
statistical interpretation of the results. Gfitter is a modular fitting
toolkit, which features predictive theoretical models as independent plugins,
and a statistical analysis of the fit results using toy Monte Carlo techniques.
The state-of-the-art electroweak Standard Model is fully implemented, as well
as generic extensions to it. This paper introduces the Gfitter project, and
presents state-of-the-art results for the global electroweak fit in the
Standard Model, and for a model with an extended Higgs sector (2HDM). Numerical
and graphical results for fits with and without including the constraints from
the direct Higgs searches at LEP and Tevatron are given. Perspectives for
future colliders are analysed and discussed. Including the direct Higgs
searches, we find M_H=(116.4 +18.3 -1.3) GeV, and the 2sigma and 3sigma allowed
regions [114,145] GeV and [[113,168] and [180,225]] GeV, respectively. For the
strong coupling strength at fourth perturbative order we obtain
alpha_S(M_Z)=0.1193 +0.0028 -0.0027(exp) +- 0.0001(theo). Finally, for the mass
of the top quark, excluding the direct measurements, we find m_t=(178.2 +9.8
-4.2) GeV. In the 2HDM we exclude a charged-Higgs mass below 240 GeV at 95%
confidence level. This limit increases towards larger tan(beta), where e.g.,
M_H+-<780 GeV is excluded for tan(beta)=70.
