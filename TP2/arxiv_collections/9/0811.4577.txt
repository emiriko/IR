Pixel Detectors, as the current technology of choice for the innermost vertex
detection, have reached a stage at which large detectors have been built for
the LHC experiments and a new era of developments, both for hybrid and for
monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel detectors is in full swing. This is largely
driven by the requirements of the upgrade programme for the superLHC and by
other collider experiments which plan to use monolithic pixel detectors for the
first time. A review on current pixel detector developments for particle
tracking and vertexing is given, comprising hybrid pixel detectors for superLHC
with its own challenges in radiation and rate, as well as on monolithic,
so-called active pixel detectors, including MAPS and DEPFET pixels for RHIC and
superBelle.
