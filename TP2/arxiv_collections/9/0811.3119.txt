Various recent experimental data and especially the large Fe-isotope effect
point against unconventional pairings, since the large intra-band impurity
scattering is strongly pair-breaking for them. The strength of the inter-band
impurity scattering in some single crystals may be strong and probably beyond
the Born scattering limit. In that case the proposed s(+-) pairing (hole(h)-
and electron(el)-gaps are of opposite signs) is suppressed but possibly not
completely destroyed. The data imply that the intra-band pairing in the h- and
in the el-band, which are inevitably due to some nonmagnetic el-boson
interaction (EBI), must be taken into account. EBI is either due to phonons
(EPI) or possibly due to excitons (EEI), or both are simultaneously operative.
We discuss their interplay briefly. The large Fe-isotope effect favors the EPI
and the s(+) pairing (the h- and el-gaps are in-phase).
