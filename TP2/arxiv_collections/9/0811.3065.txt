We propose a dynamical model for non-specific DNA-protein interaction, which
is based on the 'bead-spring' model previously developed by other groups, and
investigate its properties using Brownian Dynamics simulations. We show that
the model successfully reproduces some of the observed properties of real
systems and predictions of kinetic models. For example, sampling of the DNA
sequence by the protein proceeds via a succession of 3d motion in the solvent,
1d sliding along the sequence, short hops between neighboring sites, and
intersegmental transfers. Moreover, facilitated diffusion takes place in a
certain range of values of the protein effective charge, that is, the
combination of 1d sliding and 3d motion leads to faster DNA sampling than pure
3d motion. At last, the number of base pairs visited during a sliding event is
comparable to the values deduced from single-molecule experiments. We also
point out and discuss some discrepancies between the predictions of this model
and some recent experimental results as well as some hypotheses and predictions
of kinetic models.
