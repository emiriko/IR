The effect of a randomly fluctuating gap, created by a random staggered
potential, is studied in a monolayer and a bilayer of graphene. The density of
states, the one-particle scattering rate and transport properties (diffusion
coefficient and conductivity) are calculated at the neutrality point. All these
quantities vanish at a critical value of the average staggered potential,
signaling a continuous transition to an insulating behavior. The calculations
are based on the self-consistent Born approximation for the one-particle
scattering rate and a massless mode of the two-particle Green's function which
is created by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Transport quantities are directly
linked to the one-particle scattering rate. Moreover, the effect of disorder is
very weak in the case of a monolayer but much stronger in bilayer graphene.
