We investigate orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string, addressing
in detail their construction, classification and phenomenological potential. We
present a strategy to search for models resembling the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the standard model (MSSM) in Z_6-II orbifold compactifications. We
find several MSSM candidates with the gauge group and the exact spectrum of the
MSSM, and supersymmetric vacua below the compactification scale. They also
exhibit the following realistic features: R-parity, seesaw suppressed neutrino
masses, and intermediate scale of supersymmetry breakdown. In addition, we find
that similar models also exist in other Z_N orbifolds and in the SO(32)
heterotic theory.
