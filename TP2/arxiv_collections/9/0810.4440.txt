We present a scheme to convert self-stabilizing algorithms that use
randomization during and following convergence to self-stabilizing algorithms
that use randomization only during convergence. We thus reduce the number of
random bits from an infinite number to a bounded number. The scheme is
applicable to the cases in which there exits a local predicate for each node,
such that global consistency is implied by the union of the local predicates.
We demonstrate our scheme over the token circulation algorithm of Herman and
the recent constant time Byzantine self-stabilizing clock synchronization
algorithm by Ben-Or, Dolev and Hoch. The application of our scheme results in
the first constant time Byzantine self-stabilizing clock synchronization
algorithm that uses a bounded number of random bits.
