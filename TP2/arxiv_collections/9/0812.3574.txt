The classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice with the
single-ion anisotropy of the easy-axis type is theoretically investigated. The
mean-field phase diagram in an external magnetic field is constructed. Three
finite-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions are found by the
Monte Carlo simulations in zero field. The two upper transitions are related to
the breaking of the discrete ${\mathbb Z}_{6}$ symmetry group, while the lowest
transition is associated with a quasi-long-range ordering of transverse
components. The intermediate collinear phase between first and second
transitions is the sliding phase predicted by J. V. Jos\'e {\it et al}. [Phys.
