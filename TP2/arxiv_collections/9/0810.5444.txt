It is known that including vector mesons stabilizes the size of a Skyrmion
without the need for a Skyrme term. This paper provides the first results for
static multi-Skyrmions in such a theory. The rational map ansatz is used to
investigate multi-Skyrmions in a theory which includes the omega vector meson
and has no Skyrme term. Bound states with baryon numbers two, three and four
are found, which have axial, tetrahedral and cubic symmetries, respectively.
The results reveal a qualitative similarity with the standard Skyrme model with
a Skyrme term and no vector mesons, suggesting that some features are universal
and do not depend on the details of the theory. Setting the pion decay constant
and meson masses to their experimental values leaves only a single free
parameter in the model. Fixing this parameter, by equating the energy of the
baryon number four Skyrmion to the Helium-4 mass, yields reasonable results for
other baryon numbers.
