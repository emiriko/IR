Proving the existence of a solution to a system of real equations is a
central issue in numerical analysis. In many situations, the system of
equations depend on parameters which are not exactly known. It is then natural
to aim proving the existence of a solution for all values of these parameters
in some given domains. This is the aim of the parametrization of existence
tests. A new parametric existence test based on the Hansen-Sengupta operator is
presented and compared to a similar one based on the Krawczyk operator. It is
used as a basis of a fixed point iteration dedicated to rigorous sensibility
analysis of parametric systems of equations.
