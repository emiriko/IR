Using a model calculation of dihadron fragmentation functions, we fit the
spin asymmetry recently extracted by HERMES for the semi-inclusive pion pair
production in deep-inelastic scattering on a transversely polarized proton
target. By evolving the obtained dihadron fragmentation functions, we make
predictions for the correlation of the angular distributions of two pion pairs
produced in electron-positron annihilations at BELLE kinematics. Our study
shows that the combination of two-hadron inclusive deep-inelastic scattering
and electron-positron annihilation measurements can provide a valid alternative
to Collins effect for the extraction of the quark transversity distribution in
the nucleon.
