We report measurements of coherence times of an rf SQUID qubit using pulsed
microwaves and rapid flux pulses. The modified rf SQUID, described by an
double-well potential, has independent, in situ, controls for the tilt and
barrier height of the potential. The decay of coherent oscillations is
dominated by the lifetime of the excited state and low frequency flux noise and
is consistent with independent measurement of these quantities obtained by
microwave spectroscopy, resonant tunneling between fluxoid wells and decay of
the excited state. The oscillation's waveform is compared to analytical results
obtained for finite decay rates and detuning and averaged over low frequency
flux noise.
