An antiphased magnetoplasma (MP) mode in a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) has been studied by means of inelastic light scattering (ILS)
spectroscopy. Unlike the cophased MP mode it is purely quantum excitation which
has no classic plasma analogue. It is found that zero momentum degeneracy for
the antiphased and cophased modes predicted by the first-order perturbation
approach in terms of the {\it e-e} interaction is lifted. The zero momentum
energy gap is determined by a negative correlation shift of the antiphased
mode. This shift, observed experimentally and calculated theoretically within
the second-order perturbation approach, is proportional to the effective
Rydberg constant in a semiconductor material.
