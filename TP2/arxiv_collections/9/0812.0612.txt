In CDF we have observed several exclusive processes: 2-photon --> e+e- and
--> mu+mu-, photon+pomeron --> J/psi and psi(2S), and pomeron+pomeron -->
chi_c. The cross sections agree with QED, HERA photoproduction data, and
theoretical estimates of gg --> chi_c with another gluon exchanged to screen
the color. This observation of exclusive chi_c, together with earlier
observations of exclusive dijets and exclusive 2-photon candidates, support
some theoretical predictions for p+p --> p+H+p at the LHC. Exclusive dileptons
offer the best means of precisely calibrating forward proton spectrometers.
