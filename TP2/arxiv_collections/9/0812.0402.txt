We study the magnetization for the classical antiferromagnetic Ising model on
the Shastry-Sutherland lattice using the tensor renormalization group approach.
With this method, one can probe large spin systems with little finite-size
effect. For a range of temperature and coupling constant, a single
magnetization plateau at one third of the saturation value is found. We
investigate the dependence of the plateau width on temperature and on the
strength of magnetic frustration. Furthermore, the spin configuration of the
plateau state at zero temperature is determined.
