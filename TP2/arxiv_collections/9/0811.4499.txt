We present the corrections to the fermion propagator, to second order in the
lattice spacing, O(a^2), in 1-loop perturbation theory. The fermions are
described by the clover action and for the gluons we use a 3-parameter family
of Symanzik improved actions. Our calculation has been carried out in a general
covariant gauge. The results are provided as a polynomial of the clover
parameter, and are tabulated for 10 popular sets of the Symanzik coefficients
(Plaquette, Tree-level Symanzik, Iwasaki, TILW and DBW2 action).
  We also study the O(a^2) corrections to matrix elements of fermion bilinear
operators that have the form $\bar\Psi\Gamma\Psi$, where $\Gamma$ denotes all
possible distinct products of Dirac matrices. These correction terms are
essential ingredients for improving, to O(a^2), the matrix elements of the
fermion operators.
  Our results are applicable also to the case of twisted mass fermions.
  A longer write-up of this work, including non-perturbative results, is in
preparation together with V. Gimenez, V. Lubicz and D. Palao.
