Nonlinear systems with model uncertainty are often described by stochastic
differential equations. Some techniques from random dynamical systems are
discussed. They are relevant to better understanding of solution processes of
stochastic differential equations and thus may shed lights on predictability in
nonlinear systems with model uncertainty.
