Atomic repulsion $U_d$ on the Cu site in high T$_c$ cuprates is large but,
surprisingly, some important properties are consistent with moderate couplings.
The time dependent perturbation theory with slave particles is therefore
formulated in the $U_d\to\infty$ limit for the metallic phase in the physically
relevant regime of the three-band Emery model. The basic theory possesses the
local gauge invariance asymptotically but its convergence is fast when the
average occupation of the Cu-site is small. The leading orders exhibit the band
narrowing and the dynamic Cu/O$_2$ charge transfer disorder. The effective
local repulsion between particles on oxygen sites is shown to be moderate in
the physical regime under consideration. It enhances the coherent
incommensurate SDW correlations. The latter compete with the Cu/O$_2$ charge
transfer disorder, in agreement with basic observations in high T$_c$ cuprates.
