Hardy's thought-experiment is the strongest argument against the idea of
continuous trajectories of particles from the source to the detector. This idea
seems to result as an unavoidable conclusion from some simple experiments. In
its original form, Hardy's thought-experiment was proposed for two independent
particles, a positron and an electron. The two either meet and annihilate, or
don't meet but become entangled. An important feature of entanglements with
particles that never meet is the difficulty they raise in front of the
assumption of "hidden communication" between the particles. Indeed, if the
particles don't meet, they can't have information of one another and it is
difficult to explain how can they communicate. In order to implement Hardy's
paradox with particles that never meet, the present article proposes to use
photons from three different lasers, one laser emitting UV rays, and the other
two emitting at the wavelength of the signal photon, respectively the idler
photon obtained from the down-conversion of the UV rays. The role of the
annihilation in Hardy's experiment will be played by the destructive
interference between a down-conversion pair and two photons from the low-energy
lasers.
