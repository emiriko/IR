According to the recent experiment by the Fert group, the velocity of domain
wall motion in the spin valve ferromagnetic nanowires was almost doubly
enhanced compared to the old value. In this work, we propose an additional
torque model, arising from the interlayer exchange interaction, which can
enhance or suppress the domain wall velocity depending on the sign of the
exchange constant or the wall motion direction relative to the magnetization
orientation of the fixed layer.
