We provide a bound for the trace distance between two quantum states. The
lower bound is based on the superfidelity, which provides the upper bound on
quantum fidelity. One of the advantages of the presented bound is that it can
be estimated using a simple measurement procedure. We also compare this bound
with the one provided in terms of fidelity.
