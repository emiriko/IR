We present properties of Lotka-Volterra equations describing ecological
competition among a large number of competing species. First we extend to the
case of a non-homogeneous niche space stability conditions for solutions
representing species coexistence. Second, we discuss mechanisms leading to
species clustering and obtain an analytical solution for a lumped state in a
specific instance of the system. We also discuss how realistic ecological
interactions may result in different types of competition coefficients.
