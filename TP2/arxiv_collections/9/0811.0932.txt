We prove that, given a stress-free, axially symmetric elastic body, there
exists, for sufficiently small values of the gravitational constant and of the
angular frequency, a unique stationary axisymmetric solution to the Einstein
equations coupled to the equations of relativistic elasticity with the body
performing rigid rotations around the symmetry axis at the given angular
frequency.
