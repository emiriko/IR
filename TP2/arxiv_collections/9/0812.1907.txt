The GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA, will search for neutrinoless double beta
decay in 76Ge at the National Gran Sasso Laboratory of the INFN. Bare
high-purity germanium detectors enriched in 76Ge will be submerged in liquid
argon serving simultaneously as a shield against external radioactivity and as
a cooling medium. In GERDA Phase-I, reprocessed enriched-Ge detectors, which
were previously operated by the Heidelberg-Moscow and IGEX collaborations, will
be redeployed. Before operating the enriched detectors, tests are performed
with non-enriched bare HPGe detectors in the GERDA underground Detector
Laboratory to test the Phase-I detector assembly, the detector handling
protocols, the refurbishment technology and to study the long-term stability in
liquid argon. The leakage currents in liquid argon and liquid nitrogen have
been extensively studied under varying gamma irradiation conditions. In total
three non-enriched high-purity p-type prototype germanium detectors have been
operated successfully. The detector performance is stable over the long-term
measurements. For the first time, performance of bare high-purity germanium
detectors in liquid argon is reported.
