We show that there exist a class of nonequilibrium systems for which a
non-equilibrium analog of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional can be
constructed and propose the procedure for its derivation. As an example, we
consider a small superconductor island of the size less than the coherence
length in a stationary nonequlibrium state. We find the GL expansion of the
free energy functional of such a system and analyze the dependence of the
coefficients of the expansion upon the external drive and the non-equilibrium
distribution functions.
