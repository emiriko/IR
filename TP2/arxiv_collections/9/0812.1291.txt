We point out a subtle error in the proof of Chrobak's theorem that every
unary NFA can be represented as a union of arithmetic progressions that is at
most quadratically large. We propose a correction for this and show how
Martinez's polynomial time algorithm, which realizes Chrobak's theorem, can be
made correct accordingly. We also show that Martinez's algorithm cannot be
improved to have logarithmic space, unless L = NL.
