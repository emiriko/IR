The powder alignment method is used to investigate the anisotropic physical
properties of the weak-ferromagnetic superconductor system RuSr2RCu2O8 (R = Pr,
Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Gd0.5Dy0.5). The RuSr2GdCu2O8 cuprate is a weak-ferromagnetic
superconductor with a magnetic ordering of Ru moments at TN(Ru) = 131 K, a
superconducting transition in the CuO2 layers at Tc = 56 K, and a low
temperature Gd antiferromagnetic ordering at TN(Gd) = 2.5 K. Due to weak
magnetic anisotropy of this tetragonal system, highly c-axis aligned
microcrystalline powder (diameter ~ 1-10 $\mu$m) in epoxy can be obtained only
for R = Eu and Gd through the field-rotation powder alignment method where
c-axis is perpendicular to the aligned magnetic field Ba = 0.9 T and parallel
to the rotation axis. For smaller rare earth compound R = Gd0.5Dy0.5, powder
alignment can be achieved using the simple field powder alignment method where
c-axis is partially aligned along the aligned magnetic field. The anisotropic
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for the c-axis aligned
powders exhibit weak anisotropy with $\chi_{c} > \chi_{ab}$ at room temperature
due to anisotropic rare earth, Eu and Gd, contribution and crossover to
$\chi_{c} < \chi_{ab}$ below 190 K where strong Ru anisotropic short-range
exchange interaction overtakes the rare earth contribution. Anisotropic
diamagnetic superconducting intragrain shielding signal of aligned
microcrystalline RuSr2GdCu2O8 powder-in-epoxy below vortex lattice melting
temperature at 39 K in 1-G field is much weaker than the intergrain
polycrystalline bulk sample signal due to the small grain size (d ~ 1-10
$\mu$m), long penetration depth ($\lambda_{ab}$ ~ 0.55 $\mu$m, $\lambda_{c}$ ~
0.66 $\mu$m) and the two-dimensional (2D) character of CuO2 layers.
