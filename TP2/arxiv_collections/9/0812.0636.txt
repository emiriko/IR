In this contribution we group the operator basis for d^2 dimensional Hilbert
space in a way that enables us to relate bases of entangled states with single
particle mutually unbiased state bases (MUB), each in dimensionality d. We
utilize these sets of operators to show that an arbitrary density matrix for
this d^2 dimensional Hilbert space system is analyzed by via d^2+d+1
measurements, d^2-d of which involve those entangled states that we associate
with MUB of the d-dimensional single particle constituents. The number
$d^2+d+1$ lies in the middle of the number of measurements needed for bipartite
state reconstruction with two-particle MUB (d^2+1) and those needed by
single-particle MUB [(d^2+1)^2].
