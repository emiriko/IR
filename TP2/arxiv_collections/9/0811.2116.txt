We discuss the properties of 1D stationary pulses of light in atomic ensemble
with electromagnetically induced transparency in the limit of tight spatial
confinement. When the size of the wavepacket becomes comparable or smaller than
the absorption length of the medium, it must be described by a two-component
vector which obeys the one-dimensional two-component Dirac equation with an
effective mass $m^*$ and effective speed of light $c^*$. Then a fundamental
lower limit to the spatial width in an external potential arises from Klein
tunneling and is given by the effective Compton length $\lambda_C = \hbar/(m^*
c^*)$. Since $c^*$ and $m^*$ can be externally controlled and can be made small
it is possible to observe effects of the relativistic dispersion for rather low
energies or correspondingly on macroscopic length scales.
