In a very conservative approach, supposing that total heat flow of the Earth
is exclusively due to resonant capture inside the Earth of axions, emitted by
57-Fe nuclei on Sun, we obtain limit on mass of hadronic axion: m_a<1.8 keV.
Taking into account release of heat from decays of 40-K, 232-Th, 238-U inside
the Earth, this estimation could be improved to the value: m_a<1.6 keV. Both
the values are less restrictive than limits set in devoted experiments to
search for 57-Fe axions (m_a<216-745 eV), but are much better than limits
obtained in experiments with 83-Kr (m_a<5.5 keV) and 7-Li (m_a<13.9-32 keV).
