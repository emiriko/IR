We study the localized magnetic states of impurity in biased bilayer and
trilayer graphene. It is found that the magnetic boundary for bilayer and
trilayer graphene presents the mixing features of Dirac and conventional
fermion. For zero gate bias, as the impurity energy approaches the Dirac point,
the impurity magnetization region diminishes for bilayer and trilayer graphene.
When a gate bias is applied, the dependence of impurity magnetic states on the
impurity energy exhibits a different behavior for bilayer and trilayer graphene
due to the opening of a gap between the valence and the conduction band in the
bilayer graphene with the gate bias applied. The magnetic moment and the
corresponding magnetic transition of the impurity in bilayer graphene are also
investigated.
