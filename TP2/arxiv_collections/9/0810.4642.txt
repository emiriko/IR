This Letter shows that for particularly shaped background particle
distributions momentum exchange between phase space holes and the distribution
causes acceleration of the holes along the magnetic field. In the particular
case of a non-symmetric ring distribution (ring with loss cone) this
acceleration is nonuniform in phase space being weaker at larger perpendicular
velocities thus causing deformation of the hole in phase space.
