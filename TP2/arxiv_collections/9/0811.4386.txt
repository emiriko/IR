Lie systems in Quantum Mechanics are studied from a geometric point of view.
In particular, we develop methods to obtain time evolution operators of
time-dependent Schrodinger equations of Lie type and we show how these methods
explain certain ad hoc methods used in previous papers in order to obtain exact
solutions. Finally, several instances of time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian
are solved.
