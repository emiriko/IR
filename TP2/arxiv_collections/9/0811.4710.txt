Cerium-doped manganite thin films were grown epitaxially by pulsed laser
deposition at $720 ^\circ$C and oxygen pressure $p_{O_2}=1-25 $Pa and were
subjected to different annealing steps. According to x-ray diffraction (XRD)
data, the formation of CeO$_2$ as a secondary phase could be avoided for
$p_{O_2}\ge 8 $Pa. However, transmission electron microscopy shows the presence
of CeO$_2$ nanoclusters, even in those films which appear to be single phase in
XRD. With O$_2$ annealing, the metal-to-insulator transition temperature
increases, while the saturation magnetization decreases and stays well below
the theoretical value for electron-doped La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ with mixed
Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{2+}$ valences. The same trend is observed with decreasing film
thickness from 100 to 20 nm, indicating a higher oxygen content for thinner
films. Hall measurements on a film which shows a metal-to-insulator transition
clearly reveal holes as dominating charge carriers. Combining data from x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy, for determination of the oxygen content, and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS), for determination of the hole concentration and
cation valences, we find that with increasing oxygen content the hole
concentration increases and Mn valences are shifted from 2+ to 4+. The
dominating Mn valences in the films are Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$, and only a
small amount of Mn$^{2+}$ ions can be observed by XAS. Mn$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$
XAS signals obtained in surface-sensitive total electron yield mode are
strongly reduced in the bulk-sensitive fluorescence mode, which indicates
hole-doping in the bulk for those films which do show a metal-to-insulator
transition.
