We study spin wave relaxation in quantum Hall ferromagnet regimes. Spin-orbit
coupling is considered as a factor determining spin nonconservation, and
external random potential as a cause of energy dissipation making spin-flip
processes irreversible. We compare this relaxation mechanism with other
relaxation channels existing in a quantum Hall ferromagnet.
