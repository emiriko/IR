During the life cycle of an XML application, both schemas and queries may
change from one version to another. Schema evolutions may affect query results
and potentially the validity of produced data. Nowadays, a challenge is to
assess and accommodate the impact of theses changes in rapidly evolving XML
applications.
  This article proposes a logical framework and tool for verifying
forward/backward compatibility issues involving schemas and queries. First, it
allows analyzing relations between schemas. Second, it allows XML designers to
identify queries that must be reformulated in order to produce the expected
results across successive schema versions. Third, it allows examining more
precisely the impact of schema changes over queries, therefore facilitating
their reformulation.
