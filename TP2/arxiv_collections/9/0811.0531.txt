The extended semantic realism (ESR) model recently worked out by one of the
authors embodies the mathematical formalism of standard (Hilbert space) quantum
mechanics in a noncontextual framework, reinterpreting quantum probabilities as
conditional instead of absolute. We provide here a Hilbert space representation
of the generalized observables introduced by the ESR model that satisfy a
simple physical condition, propose a generalization of the projection
postulate, and suggest a possible mathematical description of the measurement
process in terms of evolution of the compound system made up of the measured
system and the measuring apparatus.
