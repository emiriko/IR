High resolution spin waves measurements have been carried out in
ferromagnetic (F) La(1-x)(Sr,Ca)xMnO3 with x(Sr)=0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.3 and
x(Ca)=0.3. In all q-directions, close to the zone boundary, the spin wave
spectra consist of several energy levels, with the same values in the metallic
and the x\approx 1/8 ranges. Mainly the intensity varies, jumping from the
lower energy levels determined in the x\approx 1/8 range to the higher energy
ones observed in the metallic state. On the basis of a quantitative agreement
found for x(Sr)=0.15 in a model of ordered 2D clusters, the spin wave anomalies
of the metallic state can be interpreted in terms of quantized spin waves
within the same 2D clusters, embedded in a 3D matrix.
