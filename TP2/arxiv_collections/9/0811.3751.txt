Recent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements [Y. Koksaka et al.,
Nature 454, 1072 (2008)] have shown that dispersing quasiparticle interference
peaks in Fourier transformed conductance maps disappear as the bias voltage
exceeds a certain threshold corresponding to the coincidence of the contour of
constant quasiparticle energy with the antiferromagnetic zone boundary. Here we
argue that this is caused by quasistatic short-range coexisting order present
in the d-wave superconducting phase, and that the most likely origin of this
order is disorder-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetism. We show explicitly
how the peaks are extinguished in the related situation with coexisting
long-range antiferromagnetic order, and discuss the connection with the
realistic disordered case. Since it is the localized quasiparticle interference
peaks rather than the underlying antinodal states themselves which are
destroyed at a critical bias, our proposal resolves a conflict between scanning
tunneling spectroscopy and photoemission regarding the nature of these states.
