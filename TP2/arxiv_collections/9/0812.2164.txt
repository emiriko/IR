This paper presents a scheduling framework that is configured for, and used
in physic systems. Our work addresses the problem of scheduling various
computationally intensive and data intensive applications that are required for
extracting information from satellite images. The proposed solution allows
mapping of image processing applications onto available resources. The
scheduling is done at the level of groups of concurrent applications. It
demonstrates a very good behavior for scheduling and executing groups of
applications, while also achieving a near-optimal utilization of the resources.
