We discuss the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol
in the light of quantum algorithmic information. While Shannon's information
theory needs a probability to define a notion of information, algorithmic
information theory does not need it and can assign a notion of information to
an individual object. The program length necessary to describe an object,
Kolmogorov complexity, plays the most fundamental role in the theory. In the
context of algorithmic information theory, we formulate a security criterion
for the quantum key distribution by using the quantum Kolmogorov complexity
that was recently defined by Vit\'anyi. We show that a simple BB84 protocol
indeed distribute a binary sequence between Alice and Bob that looks almost
random for Eve with a probability exponentially close to 1.
