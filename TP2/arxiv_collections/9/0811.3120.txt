Recent theoretical studies of statistical mechanical properties of systems
with long range interactions are briefly reviewed. In these systems the
interaction potential decays with a rate slower than 1/r^d at large distances r
in d dimensions. As a result, these systems are non-additive and they display
unusual thermodynamic and dynamical properties which are not present in systems
with short range interactions. In particular, the various statistical
mechanical ensembles are not equivalent and the microcanonical specific heat
may be negative. Long range interactions may also result in breaking of
ergodicity, making the maximal entropy state inaccessible from some regions of
phase space. In addition, in many cases long range interactions result in slow
relaxation processes, with time scales which diverge in the thermodynamic
limit. Various models which have been found to exhibit these features are
discussed.
