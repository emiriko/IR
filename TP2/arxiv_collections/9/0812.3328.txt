Experiments for vacuum birefringence and vacuum dichroism have been set up
with high-finesse high magnetic experimental apparatuses, which seem to be
ideal for small gaseous Cotton-Mouton effect (CME) measurements. PVLAS
Collaboration has measured CMEs in krypton, xenon and neon at the wavelength of
1064 nm. In this Letter, we report on our measurement of CMEs in nitrogen,
oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, and krypton at the same wavelength in a magnetic
field B = 2.3 T at pressure P = 0.5-300 Torr and temperature T = 295-298 K. Our
results agree with the PVLAS results in the common cases.
