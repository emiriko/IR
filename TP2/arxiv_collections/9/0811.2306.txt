Effect of multipath amplification is found in ultrawideband wireless
communication systems with chaotic carrier, whereas information is transmitted
with chaotic radio pulses. This effect is observed in multipath environment
(residence, office, industrial or other indoor space). It exhibits itself
through an increase of signal power at the receiver input with respect to the
case of free space. Multipath amplification effect gives 5-15 dB energy gain
(depending on the environment), which allows to have 2-6 times longer distance
range for the same transmitter power.
