We argue that relationships between Web pages are functions of the user's
intent. We identify a class of Web tasks - information-gathering - that can be
facilitated by a search engine that provides links to pages which are related
to the page the user is currently viewing. We define three kinds of intentional
relationships that correspond to whether the user is a) seeking sources of
information, b) reading pages which provide information, or c) surfing through
pages as part of an extended information-gathering process. We show that these
three relationships can be productively mined using a combination of textual
and link information and provide three scoring mechanisms that correspond to
them: {\em SeekRel}, {\em FactRel} and {\em SurfRel}. These scoring mechanisms
incorporate both textual and link information. We build a set of capacitated
subnetworks - each corresponding to a particular keyword - that mirror the
interconnection structure of the World Wide Web. The scores are computed by
computing flows on these subnetworks. The capacities of the links are derived
from the {\em hub} and {\em authority} values of the nodes they connect,
following the work of Kleinberg (1998) on assigning authority to pages in
hyperlinked environments. We evaluated our scoring mechanism by running
experiments on four data sets taken from the Web. We present user evaluations
of the relevance of the top results returned by our scoring mechanisms and
compare those to the top results returned by Google's Similar Pages feature,
and the {\em Companion} algorithm proposed by Dean and Henzinger (1999).
