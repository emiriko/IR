Ionization and excitation cross sections as well as electron-energy spectra
and stopping powers of the alkali metal atoms Li, Na, K, and Rb colliding with
antiprotons were calculated using a time-dependent channel-coupling approach.
An impact-energy range from 0.25 keV to 4000 keV was considered. The target
atoms are treated as effective one-electron systems using a model potential.
The results are compared with calculated cross sections for antiproton-hydrogen
atom collisions.
