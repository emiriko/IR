The Haldane conjecture, when applied to the Heisenberg O(3) model with a
\theta term in two dimensions, states that the correlation length \xi diverges
when \theta approaches \pi. To verify this conjecture we have numerically
simulated the model at imaginary \theta and then analytically continued the
results to real \theta. We have obtained that the value where the model should
become critical is \theta=3.10(5) in agreement with the expectation.
