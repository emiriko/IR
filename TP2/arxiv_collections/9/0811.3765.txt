Using the self-consistent Born approximation we calculate Reiter's
wavefunction for a single hole introduced into the undoped and orbitally
ordered ground state of the t-J model with $t_{2g}$ orbital degrees of freedom.
While the number of excitations is similar to the spin t-J model for a given
J/t, a distinct structure of the calculated wavefunction and its momentum
dependence is identified suggesting the formation of a novel type of mobile
polarons.
