We show that double-charge discrete optical vortices may be completely stable
in hexagonal photonic lattices where single-charge vortices always exhibit
dynamical instabilities. Even when unstable the double-charge vortices
typically have a much weaker instability than the single-charge vortices, and
thus their breakup occurs at longer propagation distances.
