Let $Q$ be a finite quiver without oriented cycles and $\mathcal A(Q)$ be the
coefficient-free cluster algebra with initial seed $(Q,\textbf u)$. Using the
Caldero-Chapoton map, we introduce and investigate a family of generic
variables in $\Z[\textbf u^{\pm 1}]$ containing the cluster monomials of
$\mathcal A(Q)$. The aim of these generic variables is to give an explicit new
method for constructing $\Z$-bases in the cluster algebra $\mathcal A(Q)$.
  If $Q$ is an affine quiver with minimal imaginary root $\delta$, we
investigate differences between cluster characters associated to indecomposable
representations of dimension vector $\delta$. We define the notion of
\emph{difference property} which gives an explicit description of these
differences. We prove in particular that this property holds for quivers of
affine type $\tilde A$. When $Q$ satisfies the difference property, we prove
that generic variables span the cluster algebra $\mathcal A(Q)$. If $\mathcal
A(Q)$ satisfies some gradability condition, we prove that generic variables are
linearly independent over $\mathbb Z$ in $\mathcal A(Q)$. In particular, this
implies that generic variables form a $\Z$-basis in a cluster algebra
associated to an affine quiver of type $\tilde A$.
