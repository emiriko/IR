An alternative process is proposed for the diffractive Higgs boson production
in peripheral $pp$ collisions, exploring it through the photon-proton
interaction by Double Pomeron Exchange. It is estimated the event rate of the
diffractive Higgs production in central rapidity for Tevatron and LHC energies,
being of the order of 1 fb, in agreement to the predictions from other
diffractive processes. The results are confronted with those obtained from a
similar approach of the Durham group.
