We are demonstrating that the Luttinger model with short range interaction
can be treated as a type of Fermi liquid. In line with the main dogma of
Landau's theory one can define a fermion excitation renormalized by interaction
and show that in terms of these fermions any excited state of the system is
described by free particles. The fermions are a mixture of renormalized right
and left electrons. The electric charge and chirality of the Landau
quasi-particle is discussed.
