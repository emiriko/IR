The main features of coupled-channel Kbar-N dynamics near threshold and its
repercussions in few-body Kbar-nuclear systems are briefly reviewed
highlighting the I=1/2 Kbar-N-N system. For heavier nuclei, the extension of
mean-field calculations to multi-Kbar nuclear quasibound states is discussed
focusing on kaon condensation.
