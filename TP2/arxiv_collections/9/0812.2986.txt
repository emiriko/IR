The new Delta-Sigma experimental data on the ratio $R_{dp}$ allowed
separating the Flip and Non-Flip parts of the differential cross section of
$np\to pn$ charge exchange process at the zero angle by the Dean formula. The
PSA solutions for the $np\to np$ elastic scattering are transformed to the
$np\to pn$ charge exchange representation using unitary transition, and good
agreement is obtain.
