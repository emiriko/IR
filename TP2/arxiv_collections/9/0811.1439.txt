Motivated by recent experiments on electronic transport through a carbon
nanotube, we investigate the role of the intra- and inter-orbital Coulomb
interactions on the temperature evolution of the conductance. It is shown that
small amount (~10%) of asymmetry between these Coulomb repulsions substantially
deforms the conductance profile at finite temperature, particularly around
half-filling. The nature of such thermal symmetry crossover is elucidated.
