While slowly turning the ends of a single molecule of DNA at constant applied
force, a discontinuity was recently observed at the supercoiling transition,
when a small plectoneme is suddenly formed. This can be understood as an abrupt
transition into a state in which stretched and plectonemic DNA coexist. We
argue that there should be discontinuities in both the extension and the torque
at the transition, and provide experimental evidence for both. To predict the
sizes of these discontinuities and how they change with the overall length of
DNA, we organize a theory for the coexisting plectonemic state in terms of four
length-independent parameters. We also test plectoneme theories, including our
own elastic rod simulation, finding discrepancies with experiment that can be
understood in terms of the four coexisting state parameters.
