We analyze elastic deformations of graphene sheets which lead to effective
gauge fields acting on the charge carriers. Corrugations in the substrate
induce stresses, which, in turn, can give rise to mechanical instabilities and
the formation of wrinkles. Similar effects may take place in suspended graphene
samples under tension.
