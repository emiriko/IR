We report on the first experimental visualization of domain structure in
films of weakly ferromagnetic Cu$_{0,47}$Ni$_{0,53}$ alloy with different
thickness at liquid helium temperatures. Improved high-resolution Bitter
decoration technique was used to map the magnetic contrast on the top of the
films well below the Curie temperature T$_{Curie}$ ($\sim$ 60 K). In contrast
to magnetic force microscopy, this technique allowed visualization of the
domain structure without its disturbance while the larger areas of the sample
were probed. Maze-like domain patterns, typical for perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, were observed. The average domain width was found to be about 100
nm.
