In the neutrino DIS diffraction the charged current non-conservation gives
rise to sizable corrections to the longitudinal structure function, $F_L$.
These corrections is a higher twist effect enhanced at small-$x$ by the rapidly
growing gluon density. The phenomenon manifests itself in abundant production
of charm and strangeness by longitudinally polarized W bosons of moderate
virtualities $Q^2\lsim m_c^2$.
