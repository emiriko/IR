Current source models for the Earth's main geomagnetic field are calculated
employing conventional discrete inverse theory methods. Source structures are
spherical surfaces placed at the surface of the Earth's core, and at the
surface of the Earth. The data set consists of measurements taken by the MAGSAT
satellite in 1979. The resulting current distributions are discussed in
relation to dipole and current loop models.
