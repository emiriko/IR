We theoretically study the dipole oscillations of an ideal Fermi gas in a
disordered trap. We show that even weak disorder induces strong damping of the
oscillations and we identify a metal-insulator crossover. For very weak
disorder, we show that damping results from a dephasing effect related to weak
random perturbations of the energy spectrum. For increasing disorder, we show
that the Fermi gas crosses over to an insulating regime characterized by
strong-damping due to the proliferation of localized states.
