This work considers an Ising model on the Apollonian network, where the
exchange constant $J_{i,j}\sim1/(k_ik_j)^\mu$ between two neighboring spins
$(i,j)$ is a function of the degree $k$ of both spins. Using the exact
geometrical construction rule for the network, the thermodynamical and magnetic
properties are evaluated by iterating a system of discrete maps that allows for
very precise results in the thermodynamic limit. The results can be compared to
the predictions of a general framework for spins models on scale-free networks,
where the node distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$, with node dependent
interacting constants. We observe that, by increasing $\mu$, the critical
behavior of the model changes, from a phase transition at $T=\infty$ for a
uniform system $(\mu=0)$, to a T=0 phase transition when $\mu=1$: in the
thermodynamic limit, the system shows no exactly critical behavior at a finite
temperature. The magnetization and magnetic susceptibility are found to present
non-critical scaling properties.
