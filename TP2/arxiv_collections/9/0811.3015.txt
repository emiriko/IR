Quantum games are usually considered as games with strategies defined not by
the standard Kolmogorovian probabilistic measure but by the probability
amplitude used in quantum physics. The reason for the use of the probability
amplitude or "quantum probabilistic measure", is the nondistributive lattice
occurring in physical situations with quantum microparticles. In our paper we
give examples of getting nondistributive orthomodular lattices in some special
macroscopic situations without use of quantum microparticles.
