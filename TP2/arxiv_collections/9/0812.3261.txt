Lattice studies of the infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators are a
key probe of confinement scenarios in Yang-Mills theories. However,
finite-volume effects become an important issue as the infrared limit is
approached. By considering general quantities -- namely an associated
susceptibility in the gluon case and properties of the lowest-lying eigenmode
of the Faddeev-Popov matrix in the ghost case -- one can derive rigorous upper
and lower bounds for the propagators. The bounds allow a better control over
the extrapolation of lattice results to the infinite-volume limit. In the case
of the gluon propagator, an intuitive statistical argument suggests a precise
volume dependence for the bounds. This dependence is nicely confirmed by the
lattice data, leading to a finite gluon propagator at zero momentum. At the
same time, an enhancement of the ghost propagator in the infrared limit seems
unlikely. Our analysis is applied to the case of Landau gauge and SU(2) gauge
group, using the largest lattice sizes to date.
