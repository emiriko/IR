Kwai Man Fan proved that if the intersection lattice of a line arrangement
does not contain a cycle, then the fundamental group of its complement is a
direct sum of infinite and cyclic free groups. He also conjectured that the
converse is true as well. The main purpose of this paper is to prove this
conjecture
