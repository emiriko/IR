We present a new expression for the Weyl scalar Psi_4 that can be used in
numerical relativity to extract the gravitational wave content of a spacetime.
The formula relies upon the identification of transverse tetrads, namely the
ones in which Psi_1=Psi_3=0. It is well known that tetrads with this property
always exist in a general Petrov type I spacetime. A sub-class of these tetrads
naturally converges to the Kinnersley tetrad in the limit of Petrov type D
spacetime. However, the transverse condition fixes only four of the six
parameters coming from the Lorentz group of transformations applied to tetrads.
Here we fix the tetrad completely, in particular by giving the expression for
the spin-boost transformation that was still unclear. The value of Psi_4 in
this optimal tetrad is given as a function of the two curvature invariants I
and J.
