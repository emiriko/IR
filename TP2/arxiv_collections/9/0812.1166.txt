We present a theoretical model for the evolution of mixture concentrations in
a micro-pervaporation device, similar to those recently presented
experimentally. The described device makes use of the pervaporation of water
through a thin PDMS membrane to build up a solute concentration profile inside
a long microfluidic channel. We simplify the evolution of this profile in
binary mixtures to a one-dimensional model which comprises two
concentration-dependent coefficients. The model then provides a link between
directly accessible experimental observations, such as the widths of dense
phases or their growth velocity, and the underlying chemical potentials and
phenomenological coefficients. It shall thus be useful for quantifying the
thermodynamic and dynamic properties of dilute and dense binary mixtures.
