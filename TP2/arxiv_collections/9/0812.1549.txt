A novel method for computing torus amplitudes in orbifold compactifications
is suggested. It applies universally for every Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$
orbifold without requiring the unfolding technique. This method follows from
the possibility of obtaining integrals over fundamental domains of every Hecke
congruence subgroup $\Gamma_{0}[N]$ by computing contour integrals over
one-dimensional curves uniformly distributed in these domains.
