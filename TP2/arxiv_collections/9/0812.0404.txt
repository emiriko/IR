We investigate the thermodynamics of a pion gas within the O(N) model in the
1/N expansion. Using the auxiliary field technique, we compute the effective
potential up to the next-to-leading order (NLO) and show that it can be
renormalized in a temperature-independent manner. The crucial step for the
consistency of the calculation turns out to be the elimination of the auxiliary
field prior to renormalization. Subsequently, we solve the NLO gap equation for
the chiral condensate as a function of temperature both in the chiral limit and
with explicit symmetry breaking. We propose a simple semi-analytic estimate of
the NLO correction to the condensate and compare it to the exact numerical
solution. Finally, we show that in the chiral limit the chiral symmetry is
restored at finite temperature by a second-order phase transition, and
determine the critical scaling of the order parameter. We study the dependence
of the critical temperature on the renormalized coupling and find that in
contrast to the weak-coupling limit, at strong coupling the critical
temperature increases at NLO.
