The quantum Hall effect is one of the most important developments in
condensed matter physics of the 20th century. The standard explanations of the
famous integer quantized Hall plateaus in the transverse resistivity are
qualitative, and involve assumptions about disorder, localized states, extended
states, edge states, Fermi levels pinned by Landau levels, etc. These standard
narratives give plausible reasons for the existence of the plateaus, but
provide little in the way of even a qualitative understanding of the shape and
width of the Hall plateaus, much less a first principles calculation. The
injection model presented in this paper changes that situation. Rather than
focusing on the middle of the Hall device, we follow the electrons to their
source: one corner of the Hall bar and its steep electric field gradients. We
find the entire resistivity curve including the Hall plateaus is calculable as
a function of magnetic field, temperature, and current. The new higher current
experiments reported here show remarkable half integer features for the first
time; these are faithfully reproduced by the injection theory. The Hall
plateaus and half integer inflections are shown to result from the local
density of states appropriate to the magnetic field and the strong electric
field gradient at the injection corner.
