In this paper we explore two constructions of the same family of metric
measure spaces. The first construction was introduced by Laakso in 2000 where
he used it as an example that Poincar\'e inequalities can hold on spaces of
arbitrary Hausdorff dimension. This was proved using minimal generalized upper
gradients. Following Cheeger's work these upper gradients can be used to define
a Sobolev space. We show that this leads to a Dirichlet form. The second
construction was introduced by Barlow and Evans in 2004 as a way of producing
exotic spaces along with Markov processes from simpler spaces and processes. We
show that for the correct base process in the Barlow Evans construction that
this Markov process corresponds to the Dirichlet form derived from the minimal
generalized upper gradients.
