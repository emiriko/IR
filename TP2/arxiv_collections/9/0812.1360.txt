The dynamic coercivity cannot be measured rigorously by the conventional
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect technique because the irreversible
deviation of the transient magnetization is accumulated. In order to remove the
accumulation effect, the alternating magnetic field is employed and
synchronized with the femtosecond laser pulse. Since the sample is reset before
each single laser pulse, the accumulation effect of the irreversible deviation
of the transient magnetization is removed. For perpendicularly magnetized
$L1_{\mathrm{0}}$ FePt films, the dynamic magnetization reversal process is
accomplished by the nucleation of reversed domains and the pinned domain wall
motion.
