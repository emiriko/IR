We calculate the energy of a single fermion interacting resonantly with a
Fermi sea of different-species fermions in asymmetric traps, and show that
finite particle numbers and the trap geometry impact the phase structure and
the critical polarization. Our findings contribute to understanding some
experimental discrepancies in spin-polarized Fermi gases as finite-size and
confinement effects.
