The classical asymptotic equipartition property is the statement that, in the
limit of a large number of identical repetitions of a random experiment, the
output sequence is virtually certain to come from the typical set, each member
of which is almost equally likely. In this paper, we prove a fully quantum
generalization of this property, where both the output of the experiment and
side information are quantum. We give an explicit bound on the convergence,
which is independent of the dimensionality of the side information. This
naturally leads to a family of Renyi-like quantum conditional entropies, for
which the von Neumann entropy emerges as a special case.
