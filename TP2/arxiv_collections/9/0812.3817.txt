The Riemann-Hilbert problems for multiple orthogonal polynomials of types I
and II are used to derive string equations associated to pairs of Lax-Orlov
operators. A method for determining the quasiclassical limit of string
equations in the phase space of the Whitham hierarchy of dispersionless
integrable systems is provided. Applications to the analysis of the large-n
limit of multiple orthogonal polynomials and their associated random matrix
ensembles and models of non-intersecting Brownian motions are given.
