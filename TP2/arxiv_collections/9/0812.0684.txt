In a recent experiment [PRL 100, 040404 (2008)] an analog of photon-assisted
tunneling has been observed for a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical
lattice subject to a constant force plus a sinusoidal shaking. Contrary to
previous theoretical predictions, the width of the condensate was measured to
be proportional to the square of the effective tunneling matrix element, rather
than a linear dependence. For a simple model of two interacting bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, both analytical and numerical calculations
indicate that such a transition from a linear to a quadratic dependence can be
interpreted through the ballistic transport and the corresponding exact
dispersion relation of bound boson pairs.
