Cell polarization plays a central role in the development of complex
organisms. It has been recently shown that cell polarization may follow from
the proximity to a phase separation instability in a bistable network of
chemical reactions. An example which has been thoroughly studied is the
formation of signaling domains during eukaryotic chemotaxis. In this case, the
process of domain growth may be described by the use of a constrained
time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg equation, admitting scale-invariant solutions
{\textit{\`a la}} Lifshitz and Slyozov. The constraint results here from a
mechanism of fast cycling of molecules between a cytosolic, inactive state and
a membrane-bound, active state, which dynamically tunes the chemical potential
for membrane binding to a value corresponding to the coexistence of different
phases on the cell membrane. We provide here a universal description of this
process both in the presence and absence of a gradient in the external
activation field. Universal power laws are derived for the time needed for the
cell to polarize in a chemotactic gradient, and for the value of the smallest
detectable gradient. We also describe a concrete realization of our scheme
based on the analysis of available biochemical and biophysical data.
