Koide's mass formula is an empirical relation among the charged lepton masses
which holds with a striking precision. We propose a mechanism for cancelling
the QED correction to Koide's formula. This is discussed in an effective theory
with U(3) family gauge symmetry and a scenario in which this symmetry is
unified with SU(2)_L symmetry at 10^2-10^3 TeV scale.
