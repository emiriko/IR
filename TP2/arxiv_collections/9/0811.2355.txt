We discuss an action in which the fermion matrix has single level stout
smearing for the hopping terms together with unsmeared links for the clover
term. With the (tree level) Symanzik improved gluon action this constitutes the
Stout Link Non-perturbative Clover or SLiNC action. To cancel O(a) terms the
clover coefficient, csw, has to be tuned. We present here preliminary results
of a non-perturbative determination of csw using the Schrodinger functional and
as a by-product also a determination of the critical hopping parameter. A
determination of the renormalisation constant for the local vector current is
also given. Comparisons of the results are made with lowest order perturbation
theory results.
