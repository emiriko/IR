Inspired by Axelrod's model of culture dissemination, we introduce and
analyze a model for a population of coupled oscillators where different levels
of synchronization can be assimilated to different degrees of cultural
organization. The state of each oscillator is represented by a set of phases,
and the interaction --which occurs between homologous phases-- is weighted by a
decreasing function of the distance between individual states. Both ordered
arrays and random networks are considered. We find that the transition between
synchronization and incoherent behaviour is mediated by a clustering regime
with rich organizational structure, where some of the phases of a given
oscillator can be synchronized to a certain cluster, while its other phases are
synchronized to different clusters.
