The unknown neutrino parameters may leave detectable signatures in the
supernova (SN) neutrino flux. However, even the contribution from the MSW
flavor transition alone could cause ambiguity in the interpretation to the
neutrino signals because of the uncertain local density profile of the SN
matter and the model-dependent SN neutrino spectral parameters. A specific
parametrization to the unknown local density profile is proposed in this work,
and the contribution from the standard MSW effect is investigated through a
multi-detector analysis of the SN neutrinos. In establishing the
model-independent scheme, results based on the existing spectral models are
included. The limitation of the analysis is also discussed.
