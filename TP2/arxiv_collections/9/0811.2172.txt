In this work we study the electronic structure and magnetism of a TiO2 film
grown on another non-magnetic oxide such as a LaAlO3 (001) substrate,
concentrating on the role played by structural relaxation and oxygen vacancies.
Using Density Functional Theory ab-initio methods, we study the free-standing
anatase film as well as the interfaces with either the LaO or AlO2 planes of
LaAlO3, focusing on the possibility of magnetic solutions. Our results show
that the interface LaO/TiO2 is favored against the AlO2/TiO2 one if no oxygen
vacancies are present in the interface whereas the contrary happens when there
are oxygen vacancies. In both cases, the cohesive energy is of the same order
of magnitude but only the AlO2/TiO2 interface presents an stable magnetic
solution.
