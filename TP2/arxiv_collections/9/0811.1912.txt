The mass distributions for giant dipole resonances in 32S and 132Sn decaying
through particle emission and for deep-inelastic collisions between 16O nuclei
have been investigated by implementing the Balian-Veneroni variational
technique based upon a three-dimensional time-dependent Hartree-Fock code with
realistic Skyrme interactions. The mass distributions obtained have been shown
to be significantly larger than the standard TDHF results.
