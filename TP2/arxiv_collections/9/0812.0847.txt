A hybrid system which consists of a superconducting (SC) Pb film (100 nm
thickness) containing $\sim$1 vol% single domain ferromagnetic (FM) Co
particles of mean-size $\sim$4.5 nm reveal unusual magnetic properties: (i) a
controlled switching between the usual diamagnetic and the unusual paramagnetic
Meissner effect in field cooling as well as in zero-field cooling experiments
(ii) amplification of the positive magnetization when the sample enters the SC
state below T$_c$. These experimental findings can be explained by the
formation of spontaneous vortices and the possible alignment of these vortices
due to the foregoing alignment of the Co particle FM moments by an external
magnetic field.
