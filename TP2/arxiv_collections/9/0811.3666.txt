As a counterpart for the prime 2 to Glauberman's $ZJ$-theorem, Stellmacher
proves that any nontrivial 2-group $S$ has a nontrivial characteristic subgroup
$W(S)$ with the following property. For any finite $\Sigma_4$-free group $G$,
with $S$ a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$ and with $O_2(G)$ self-centralizing, the
subgroup $W(S)$ is normal in $G$. We generalize Stellmacher's result to fusion
systems. A similar construction of $W(S)$ can be done for odd primes and gives
rise to a Glauberman functor.
