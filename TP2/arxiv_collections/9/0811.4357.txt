We present some recently obtained results on transverse-momentum dependent
parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs), the latter being important
ingredients for the description of semi-inclusive hadronic processes. Special
attention is payed to the renormalization group (RG) properties of these
objects. In particular, their leading-order anomalous dimension is calculated
in the light-cone gauge. It is shown that the RG properties can be used to
reveal, in the most economic way, the general structure of the gauge links
entering the operator definition of TMD PDFs.
