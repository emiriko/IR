Within an effective non-linear chiral model, we evaluate nuclear matter
parameters exploiting the uncertainties in the nuclear saturation properties.
The model is sternly constrained with minimal free parameters, which display
the interlink between nuclear incompressibility ($K$), the nucleon effective
mass ($m^{\star}$), the pion decay constant ($f_{\pi}$) and the $\sigma-$meson
mass ($m_{\sigma}$). The best fit among the various parameter set is then
extracted and employed to study the resulting Equation of state (EOS). Further,
we also discuss the consequences of imposing constraints on nuclear EOS from
Heavy-Ion collision and other phenomenological model predictions.
