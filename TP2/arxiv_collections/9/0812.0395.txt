The local coupling of two photons to the fundamental quark currents of a
hadron gives an energy-independent contribution to the Compton amplitude
proportional to the charge squared of the struck quark, a contribution which
has no analog in hadron scattering reactions. We show that this local
contribution has a real phase and is universal, giving the same contribution
for real or virtual Compton scattering for any photon virtuality and skewness
at fixed momentum transfer squared t. The t-dependence of this J=0 fixed Regge
pole is parameterized by a yet unmeasured even charge-conjugation form factor
of the target nucleon. The t=0 limit gives an important constraint on the
dependence of the nucleon mass on the quark mass through the Weisberger
relation. We discuss how this 1/x form factor can be extracted from high energy
deeply virtual Compton scattering and examine predictions given by models of
the H generalized parton distribution.
