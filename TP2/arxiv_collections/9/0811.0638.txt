We study both the electrical and thermal transport near the heavy-fermion
quantum critical point (QCP), identified with the breakdown of the Kondo effect
as an orbital selective Mott transition. We show that the contribution to the
electrical conductivity comes mainly from conduction electrons while the
thermal conductivity is given by both conduction electrons and localized
fermions (spinons), scattered with dynamical exponent $z = 3$. This scattering
mechanism gives rise to a quasi-linear temperature dependence of the electrical
and thermal resistivity. The characteristic feature of the Kondo breakdown
scenario turns out to be emergence of additional entropy carriers, that is,
spinon excitations. As a result, we find that the Wiedemann-Franz ratio should
be larger than the standard value, a fact which enables to differentiate the
Kondo breakdown scenario from the Hertz-Moriya-Millis framework.
