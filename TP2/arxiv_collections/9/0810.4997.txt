We examine theoretically production of the neutron-rich $^{10}_{\Lambda}$Li
hypernucleus by a double-charge exchange ($\pi^-$, $K^+$) reaction on a
$^{10}$B target with distorted-wave impulse approximation calculations. The
result shows that the magnitude and shape of the calculated spectrum at 1.20
GeV/c by a one-step mechanism $\pi^-p \to K^+ \Sigma^-$ via $\Sigma^-$ doorways
caused by a $\Sigma^-p \leftrightarrow \Lambda n$ coupling can explain the
recent experimental data, and the $\Sigma^-$ admixture probability in
$^{10}_{\Lambda}$Li is found to be the order of 10$^{-1}$ %. The ($\pi^-$,
$K^+$) reaction provides a capability of extracting properties of wave
functions with $\Lambda$-$\Sigma$ coupling effects in neutron-rich nuclei,
together with the reaction mechanism.
