n this paper we study ad-nilpotent ideals of a complex simple Lie algebra
$\ccg$ and their connections with affine Weyl groups and nilpotent orbits. We
define a left equivalence relation for ad-nilpotent ideals based on their
normalizer and generators, and prove that the equivalence relation is
compatible with the left cell structure of affine Weyl group of $\ccg$ and
Lusztig's star operator for type $\tilde A_{n-1}$.
