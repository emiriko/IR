The activation-polymerization-epimerization-depolymerization (APED) model of
Plasson et al. has recently been proposed as a mechanism for the evolution of
homochirality on prebiotic Earth. The dynamics of the APED model in
two-dimensional spatially-extended systems is investigated for various
realistic reaction parameters. It is found that the APED system allows for the
formation of isolated homochiral proto-domains surrounded by a racemate. A
diffusive slowdown of the APED network such as induced through tidal motion or
evaporating pools and lagoons leads to the stabilization of homochiral bounded
structures as expected in the first self-assembled protocells.
