Quantum optical photodetection has occupied a central role in understanding
radiation-matter interactions. It has also contributed to the development of
atomic physics and quantum optics, including applications to metrology,
spectroscopy, and quantum information processing. The quantum microwave regime,
originally explored using cavities and atoms, is seeing a novel boost with the
generation of nonclassical propagating fields in circuit quantum
electrodynamics (QED). This promising field, involving potential developments
in quantum information with microwave photons, suffers from the absence of
photodetectors. Here, we design a metamaterial composed of discrete
superconducting elements that implements a high-efficiency microwave photon
detector. Our design consists of a microwave guide coupled to an array of
metastable quantum circuits, whose internal states are irreversibly changed due
to the absorption of photons. This proposal can be widely applied to different
physical systems and can be generalized to implement a microwave photon
counter.
