We review the analysis of the 5 sigma discovery contours for the charged MSSM
Higgs boson at the CMS experiment with 30 fb^-1 for the two cases M_H+ < m_t
and M_H+ > m_t. Latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on
full simulation studies are combined with state-of-the-art theoretical
predictions of MSSM Higgs-boson production and decay properties. Special focus
is put on the SUSY parameter dependence of the 5 sigma contours. The variation
of mu can shift the prospective discovery reach in tan_beta by up to Delta
tan_beta = 40. We furthermore discuss various theory uncertainties on the
signal cross section and branching ratio calculations. In order to arrive at a
reliable interpretation of a signal of the charged MSSM Higgs boson at the LHC
a strong reduction in the relevant theory uncertainties will be necessary.
