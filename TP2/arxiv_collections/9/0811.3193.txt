The purpose of this erratum is to correct the proof of Theorem A.0.1 in the
appendix to our article ``Hadamard spaces with isolated flats''
math.GR/0411232, which was jointly authored by Mohamad Hindawi, Hruska and
Kleiner. In that appendix, many of the results of math.GR/0411232 about CAT(0)
spaces with isolated flats are extended to a more general setting in which the
isolated subspaces are not necessarily flats. However, one step of that
extension does not follow from the argument we used the isolated flats setting.
We provide a new proof that fills this gap.
  In addition, we give a more detailed account of several other parts of
Theorem A.0.1, which were sketched in math.GR/0411232.
