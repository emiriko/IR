Self-organizing networks such as Neural Gas, Growing Neural Gas and many
others have been adopted in actual applications for both dimensionality
reduction and manifold learning. Typically, in these applications, the
structure of the adapted network yields a good estimate of the topology of the
unknown subspace from where the input data points are sampled. The approach
presented here takes a different perspective, namely by assuming that the input
space is a manifold of known dimension. In return, the new type of growing
self-organizing network presented gains the ability to adapt itself in way that
may guarantee the effective and stable recovery of the exact topological
structure of the input manifold.
