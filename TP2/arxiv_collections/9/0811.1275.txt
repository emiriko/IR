The review on the 2m propane bubble chamber experiment data analysis aimed to
searches for an exotic baryon states for $K^0_s$-meson subsystems. The
observation of $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^{*+}$(1385) and $K^{*\pm}$(892) well known
resonances from PDG are a good tests of this method. There are found a resonant
structures for $K^0_s\pi^{\pm}$, $K^0_s$p and $K^0_s\Lambda$ invariant mass
spectra which were interpreted as $\kappa$(720)-meson, $\Theta^+(1540)$-baryon
and $N^0(1750)$ or $\Xi^0$-baryon states, respectively.
