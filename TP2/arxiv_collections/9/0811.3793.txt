Finite temperature phase boundary between superfluid phase and normal state
is analytically derived by studying the stability of normal state in rotating
bosonic optical lattice. We also prove that the oscillation behavior of
critical hopping matrix directly follows the upper boundary of Hofstadter
butterfly as the function of effective magnetic field.
