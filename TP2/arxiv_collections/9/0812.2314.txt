Based on the assumption of two-quark structure of the scalar meson
$f_0(980)$, we calculate the branching ratios and CP-violating asymmetries for
the four $B \to f_0(980)\pi$ and $B \to f_0(980)\etapp$ decays by employing the
perturbative QCD (pQCD) factorization approach. The leading order pQCD
predictions for branching ratios are, $Br(B^-\to f_0(980) \pi^-)\sim 2.5 \times
10^{-6}$, $Br(\bar{B}^0\to f_0(980) \pi^0)\sim 2 6 \times 10^{-7}$,
$Br(\bar{B}^0\to f_0(980) \eta)\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$ and $Br(\bar{B}^0\to
f_0(980) \eta^\prime)\sim 6.7 \times 10^{-7}$, which are consistent with both
the QCD factorization predictions and the experimental upper limits.
