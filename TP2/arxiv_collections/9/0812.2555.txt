Fermilab operates the world's most intense source of antiprotons. Recently
various experiments have been proposed that can use those antiprotons either
parasitically during Tevatron Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider
finishes in about 2010. We discuss the physics goals and prospects of the
proposed experiments.
