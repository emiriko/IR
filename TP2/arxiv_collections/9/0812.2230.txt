We investigate the geometric properties of loops on two-dimensional lattice
graphs, where edge weights are drawn from a distribution that allows for
positive and negative weights. We are interested in the appearance of spanning
loops of total negative weight. The resulting percolation problem is
fundamentally different from conventional percolation, as we have seen in a
previous study of this model for the undiluted case.
  Here, we investigate how the percolation transition is affected by additional
dilution. We consider two types of dilution: either a certain fraction of edges
exhibit zero weight, or a fraction of edges is even absent. We study these
systems numerically using exact combinatorial optimization techniques based on
suitable transformations of the graphs and applying matching algorithms. We
perform a finite-size scaling analysis to obtain the phase diagram and
determine the critical properties of the phase boundary.
  We find that the first type of dilution does not change the universality
class compared to the undiluted case whereas the second type of dilution leads
to a change of the universality class.
