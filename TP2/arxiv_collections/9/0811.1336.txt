Using actions of free monoids and free associative algebras, we establish
some Schreier-type formulas involving the ranks of actions and the ranks of
subactions in free actions or Grassmann-type relations for the ranks of
intersections of subactions of free actions. The coset action of the free group
is used to establish the generalization of the Schreier formula to the case of
subgroups of infinite index. We also study and apply large modules over free
associative algebras in the spirit of the paper Olshanskii, A. Yu.; Osin, D.V.,
Large groups and their periodic quotients, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 136 (2008),
753 - 759.
