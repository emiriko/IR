We show that if H is a hereditary finite dimensional algebra, M is a finitely
generated H-module and B is a semisimple subalgebra of the endomorphism algebra
of M, then the representation dimension of the corresponding triangular matrix
algebra is less or equal to 3 whenever one of the following conditions hold: i)
H is of finite representation type; ii) H is tame and M is a direct sum of
regular and preprojective modules; iii) M has no self-extensions
