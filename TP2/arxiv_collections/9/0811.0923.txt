The structure of supersymmetry is analyzed systematically in ${\cal PT}$
symmetric quantum mechanical theories. We give a detailed description of
supersymmetric systems associated with one dimensional ${\cal PT}$ symmetric
quantum mechanical theories. We show that there is a richer structure present
in these theories compared to the conventional theories associated with
Hermitian Hamiltonians. We bring out various properties associated with these
supersymmetric systems and generalize such quantum mechanical theories to
higher dimensions as well as to the case of one dimensional shape invariant
potentials.
