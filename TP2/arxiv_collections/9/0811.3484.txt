We review recent developments related to jet clustering algorithms and jet
finding. These include fast implementations of sequential recombination
algorithms, new IRC safe algorithms, quantitative determination of jet areas
and quality measures for jet finding, among many others. We also briefly
discuss the status of jet finding in heavy ion collisions, where full QCD jets
have been measured for the first time at RHIC.
