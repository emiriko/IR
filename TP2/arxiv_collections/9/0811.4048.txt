The search for the resonating valence bond (RVB) state continues to underpin
many areas of condensed matter research. The RVB is made from the dimerisation
of spins on different sites into fluctuating singlets, and was proposed by
Anderson to be the reference state from which the transition to BCS
superconductivity occurs. Little is known about the state experimentally, due
to the scarcity of model materials. Theoretical work has put forward the S =
1/2 kagome antiferromagnet (KAFM) as a good candidate for the realization of
the RVB state. In this paper we introduce a new model system, the S = 1/2 KAFM
Kapellasite, Cu3Zn(OH)6Cl2. We show that its crystal structure is a good
approximation to a 2-dimensional kagome antiferromagnet and that susceptibility
data indicate a collapse of the magnetic moment below T = 25 K that is
compatible with the spins condensing into the non-magnetic RVB state.
