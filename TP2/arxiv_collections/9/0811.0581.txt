This paper is the instructions for the proceeding of the International
Symposium on Crop. Sugar beet crop models have rarely taken into account the
morphogenetic process generating plant architecture despite the fact that plant
architectural plasticity plays a key role during growth, especially under
stress conditions. The objective of this paper is to develop this approach by
applying the GreenLab model of plant growth to sugar beet and to study the
potential advantages for applicative purposes. Experiments were conducted with
husbandry practices in 2006. The study of sugar beet development, mostly
phytomer appearance, organ expansion and leaf senescence, allowed us to define
a morphogenetic model of sugar beet growth based on GreenLab. It simulates
organogenesis, biomass production and biomass partitioning. The functional
parameters controlling source-sink relationships during plant growth were
estimated from organ and compartment dry masses, measured at seven different
times, for samples of plants. The fitting results are good, which shows that
the introduced framework is adapted to analyse source-sink dynamics and
shoot-root allocation throughout the season. However, this approach still needs
to be fully validated, particularly among seasons.
