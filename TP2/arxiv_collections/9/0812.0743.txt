Enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last
decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum game with the problem of data
clustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in
which data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions
and implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a
quantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a
link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust
the strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff.
Further, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two
payoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results
have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and
efficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence.
Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
