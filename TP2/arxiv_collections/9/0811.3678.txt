A detailed phenomenological analysis of neutral kaon mixing in "little
Randall-Sundrum" models is presented. It is shown that the constraints arising
from the CP-violating quantity epsilon_K can, depending on the value of the
ultra-violet cutoff, be even stronger than in the original Randall-Sundrum
scenario addressing the hierarchy problem up to the Planck scale. The origin of
the enhancement is explained, and a bound Lambda_{UV}>several 10^3 TeV is
derived, below which vast corrections to epsilon_K are generically unavoidable.
Implications for non-standard Z->bb couplings are briefly discussed.
