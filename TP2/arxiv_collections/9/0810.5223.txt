In our previous work we suggested a very simple, approximate formalism for
description of some basic (especially thermodynamical) characteristics of a
non-charged, rotating, very thin black ring. Here, in our new work,
generalizing our previous results, we suggest a very simple, approximate
description of some basic (especially thermodynamical) characteristics of a
weakly charged, rotating, very thin black ring. (Our formalism is not
theoretically dubious, since, at it is not hard to see, it can represent an
extreme simplification of a more accurate, e.g. Copeland-Lahiri, string
formalism for the black hole description.) Even if suggested formalism is,
generally speaking, phenomenological and rough, obtained final results,
unexpectedly, are non-trivial. Concretely, given formalism reproduces exactly
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon
area and Hawking temperature of a weakly charged, rotating, very thin black
ring originally obtained earlier using more accurate analysis by Emparan,
Aestefanesei, Radu etc. (Conceptually it is similar to situation in Bohr's
atomic model where energy levels are determined practically exactly even if
electron motion is described roughly.) Our formalism is physically based on the
assumption that circumference of the horizon tube holds the natural (integer)
number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is conceptually
similar to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model interpreted by
de Broglie relation.) Also, we use, mathematically, practically only simple
algebraic equations.
