An initial unknown quantum state can be determined with a single measurement
apparatus by letting it interact with an auxiliary, "Ancilla", system as
proposed by Allahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 120402
(2004)]. In the case of two qubits, this procedure allows to reconstruct the
initial state of the qubit of interest S by measuring three commuting
observables and therefore by means of a single apparatus, for the total system
S + A at a later time. The determinant of the matrix of the linear
transformation connecting the measurements of three commuting observables at
time t > 0 to the components of the polarization vector of S at time t = 0 is
used as an indicator of the reconstructability of the initial state of the
system S. We show that a connection between the entanglement entropy of the
total system S + A and such a determinant exists, and that for a pure state a
vanishing entanglement individuates, without a need for any measurement, those
intervals of time for which the reconstruction procedure is least efficient.
This property remains valid for a generic dimension of S. In the case of a
mixed state this connection is lost.
