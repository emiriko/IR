We study Brownian motion driven with both conservative and nonconservative
external forces. By using the thermodynamic approach of the theory of Brownian
motion we obtain the Fokker-Planck equation and derive expressions for the
Fluctuation Theorem in local equilibrium and in quasi-equilibrium. In local
equilibrium the expressions we obtain coincide with previous results.
