Two Body Dirac Equations (TBDE) of Dirac's relativistic constraint dynamics
have been successfully applied to obtain a covariant nonperturbative
description of QED and QCD bound states. Coulomb-type potentials in these
applications lead naively in other approaches to singular relativistic
corrections at short distances that require the introduction of either
perturbative treatments or smoothing parameters. We examine the corresponding
singular structures in the effective potentials of the relativistic
Schroedinger equation obtained from the Pauli reduction of the TBDE. We find
that the relativistic Schroedinger equation lead in fact to well-behaved wave
function solutions when the full potential and couplings of the system are
taken into account. The most unusual case is the coupled triplet system with
S=1 and L={(J-1),(J+1)}. Without the inclusion of the tensor coupling, the
effective S-state potential would become attractively singular. We show how
including the tensor coupling is essential in order that the wave functions be
well-behaved at short distances. For example, the S-state wave function becomes
simply proportional to the D-state wave function and dips sharply to zero at
the origin, unlike the usual S-state wave functions. Furthermore, this behavior
is similar in both QED and QCD, independent of the asymptotic freedom behavior
of the assumed QCD vector potential. Light- and heavy-quark meson states can be
described well by using a simplified linear-plus-Coulomb-type QCD potential
apportioned appropriately between world scalar and vector potentials. We use
this potential to exhibit explicitly the origin of the large pi-rho splitting
and effective chiral symmetry breaking. The TBDE formalism developed here may
be used to study quarkonia in quark-gluon plasma environments.
