In this contribution we extend the Taylor expansion method proposed
previously by one of us and establish equivalent partial differential equations
of DDH lattice Boltzmann scheme at an arbitrary order of accuracy. We derive
formally the associated dynamical equations for classical thermal and linear
fluid models in one to three space dimensions. We use this approach to adjust
relaxation parameters in order to enforce fourth order accuracy for thermal
model and diffusive relaxation modes of the Stokes problem. We apply the
resulting scheme for numerical computation of associated eigenmodes and compare
our results with analytical references.
