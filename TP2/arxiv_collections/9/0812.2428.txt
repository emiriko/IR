The complete analytical solutions of the geodesic equation of massive test
particles in higher dimensional Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-(anti)de Sitter,
Reissner-Nordstroem and Reissner-Nordstroem-(anti)de Sitter space--times are
presented. Using the Jacobi inversion problem restricted to the theta divisor
the explicit solution is given in terms of Kleinian sigma functions. The
derived orbits depend on the structure of the roots of the characteristic
polynomials which depend on the particle's energy and angular momentum, on the
mass and the charge of the gravitational source, and the cosmological constant.
We discuss the general structure of the orbits and show that due to the
specific dimension-independent form of the angular momentum and the
cosmological force a rich variety of orbits can emerge only in four and five
dimensions. We present explicit analytical solutions for orbits up to 11
dimensions. A particular feature of Reissner--Nordstroem space-times is that
bound and escape orbits traverse through different universes.
