We examine the electromagnetic properties of the Delta(1232) resonance within
the self-consistent chiral quark-soliton model. In particular we present the
Delta form factors of the vector-current GE0, GE2 and GM1 for a
momentum-transfer range of $Q^{2} \leq 1GeV^{2}$. We apply the
symmetry-conserving quantization of the soliton and take 1/N_c rotational
corrections into account. Values for the magnetic moments of all decuplet
baryons as well as for the N-Delta transition are given. Special interest is
also given to the electric quadrupole moment of the Delta.
