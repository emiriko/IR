We report the synthesis of infinite-layer LaNiO2 thin films by metal organic
decomposition. Our work is aimed to synthesize perovskite-like oxides with 3d9
electronic configuration, which is common to high-Tc copper oxides. The 3d9
configuration is very rare in oxides other than cuprates. Ni1+ oxides, even
though Ni1+ is an unusual oxidation state, may be one of very few candidates.
One example of the Ni1+ phases is infinite-layer LaNiO2. The bulk synthesis of
LaNiO2 is difficult, but we demonstrate in this article that the thin-film
synthesis of LaNiO2 by metal organic decomposition is rather easy. This is due
to the advantage of thin films with a large-surface-to-volume ratio, which
makes oxygen diffusion prompt. Resistivity measurements indicate that LaNiO2 is
essentially a metal but unfortunately with no trace of superconductivity yet.
