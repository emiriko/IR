In this paper, we prove that it is impossible to construct a convariant
quantum feedback control instruments which aim to correct the channel noise
imposed on an unknown qubit. The proof is based on the searching for the
optimal quantum control protocol and it turns out there exist no better
%\textit{Complete Positive Trace %Preserving}(CPTP) maps complete positive and
covariant quantum operations which provide a higher fidelity than the trivial
Identity operators. The generalization of the investigation to bipartite
entangled pure state is also included.
