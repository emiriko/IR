Upcoming high-intensity laser systems will be able to probe the
quantum-induced nonlinear regime of electrodynamics. So far unobserved QED
phenomena such as the discovery of a nonlinear response of the quantum vacuum
to macroscopic electromagnetic fields can become accessible. In addition, such
laser systems provide for a flexible tool for investigating fundamental
physics. Primary goals consist in verifying so far unobserved QED phenomena.
Moreover, strong-field experiments can search for new light but weakly
interacting degrees of freedom and are thus complementary to accelerator-driven
experiments. I review recent developments in this field, focusing on photon
experiments in strong electromagnetic fields. The interaction of
particle-physics candidates with photons and external fields can be
parameterized by low-energy effective actions and typically predict
characteristic optical signatures. I perform first estimates of the accessible
new-physics parameter space of high-intensity laser facilities such as POLARIS
and ELI.
