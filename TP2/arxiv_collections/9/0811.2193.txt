We develop a theory of axisymmetric surfaces minimizing a combination of
surface tension and nematic elastic energies which may be suitable for
describing simple film and bubble shapes. As a function of the elastic constant
and the applied tension on the bubbles, we find the analogues of the unduloid,
sphere, and nodoid in addition to other new surfaces.
