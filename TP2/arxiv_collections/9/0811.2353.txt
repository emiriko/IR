A method based on Rayleigh-Schroedinger perturbation theory is developed that
allows to obtain high-order series expansions for ground-state properties of
quantum lattice models. The approach is capable of treating both lattice
geometries of large spatial dimensionalities d and on-site degrees of freedom
with large state space dimensionalities. It has recently been used to
accurately compute the zero-temperature phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model
on a hypercubic lattice, up to arbitrary large filling and for d=2, 3 and
greater [Teichmann et al., Phys. Rev. B 79, 100503(R) (2009)].
