The quantum critical point (QCP) in $YbRh_{2}Si_{2}$ is an enigma for the
itinerant view of QCP. In an alternative view, this QCP is intimately linked to
the selective Mott localization of the heavy $f$ electrons. Following a perusal
of this unusual QCP, I study an Extended Periodic Anderson Model (EPAM) within
DMFT. A quantum phase transition (FQPT), accompanied by a rapid change in the
Fermi volume, is found near the quantum-critical end-point of the selective
Mott transition in the $f$-electron sector. The theory accounts for a wide
range of unusual, singular non-Fermi liquid features exhibited at this QCP in
$YbRh_{2}Si_{2}$ in a natural way.
