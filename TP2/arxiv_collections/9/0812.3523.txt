Quantitative scaling relationships among body mass, temperature and metabolic
rate of organisms are still controversial, while resolution may be further
complicated through the use of different and possibly inappropriate approaches
to statistical analysis. We propose the application of a modelling strategy
based on Akaike's information criteria and non-linear model fitting (nlm).
Accordingly, we collated and modelled available data at intraspecific level on
the individual standard metabolic rate of Antarctic microarthropods as a
function of body mass (M), temperature (T), species identity (S) and high rank
taxa to which species belong (G) and tested predictions from Metabolic Scaling
Theory. We also performed allometric analysis based on logarithmic
transformations (lm). Conclusions from lm and nlm approaches were different.
Best-supported models from lm incorporated T, M and S. The estimates of the
allometric scaling exponent b linking body mass and metabolic rate indicated no
interspecific difference and resulted in a value of 0.696 +/- 0.105 (mean +/-
95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both
the scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high
rank taxa to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6
to 0.8. We therefore reached two conclusions: 1) published analyses of
arthropod metabolism based on logarithmic data may be biased by data
transformation; 2) non-linear models applied to Antarctic microarthropod
metabolic rate suggest that intraspecific scaling of standard metabolic rate in
Antarctic microarthropods is highly variable and can be characterised by
scaling exponents that greatly vary within taxa, which may have biased previous
interspecific comparisons that neglected intraspecific variability.
