Scalar MSSM Higgs boson production via gluon fusion gg -> h,H is mediated by
heavy quark and squark loops. The higher order QCD corrections to these
processes turn out to be large. The full supersymmetric QCD corrections have
been calculated recently. In the limit of large SUSY masses a conceptual
problem appears, i.e. the proper treatment of the large gluino mass limit. In
this work we will describe the consistent decoupling of heavy gluino effects
and derive the effective Lagrangian for decoupled gluinos.
