The purpose of this paper is twofold. One is to give a survey of our study on
the reductions of harmonic bundles, and the other is to explain a simple
application in the study of TERP structure. In particular, we investigate the
asymptotic behaviour of the "new supersymmetric index" for variation of pure
polarized TERP structures.
