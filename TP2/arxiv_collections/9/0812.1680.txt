We outline a strategy to compute the second-loop contribution to the Csw
coefficient of the Sheikoleslami-Wohlert-Wilson fermion action by means of
NSPT. We also present preliminary results for higher-order integrators for the
Langevin evolution within NSPT. At fixed numerical accuracy, these integrators
considerably reduce the required computer-time.
