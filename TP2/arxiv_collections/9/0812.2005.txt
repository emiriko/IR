We consider the action on instanton moduli spaces of the non-local symmetries
of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations on $\mathbb{R}^4$ discovered by Chau and
coauthors. Beginning with the ADHM construction, we show that a sub-algebra of
the symmetry algebra generates the tangent space to the instanton moduli space
at each point. We explicitly find the subgroup of the symmetry group that
preserves the one-instanton moduli space. This action simply corresponds to a
scaling of the moduli space.
