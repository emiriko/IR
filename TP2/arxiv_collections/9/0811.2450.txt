The variation with respect to temperature T of transport properties of 58
fragile structural glass forming liquids (68 data sets in total) are analyzed
and shown to exhibit a remarkable degree of universality. In particular,
super-Arrhenius behaviors of all super-cooled liquids appear to collapse to one
parabola for which there is no singular behavior at any finite temperature.
This behavior is bounded by an onset temperature To above which liquid
transport has a much weaker temperature dependence. A similar collapse is also
demonstrated, over the smaller available range, for existing numerical
simulation data.
