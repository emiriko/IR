We report synthesis and single crystal measurements of magnetic, transport
and thermal properties of single crystalline BaCo$_2$As$_2$ as well as first
principles calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic behavior.
These results show that BaCo$_2$As$_2$ is a highly renormalized paramagnet in
proximity to a quantum critical point, presumably of ferromagnetic character
and that BaFeNiAs$_2$ behaves similarly. These results are discussed in
relation to the properties of Ba(Fe,Co)$_2$As$_2$ and Ba(Fe,Ni)$_2$As$_2$,
which are superconducting for low Co and Ni concentrations.
