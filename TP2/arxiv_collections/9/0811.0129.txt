In this article, we study the multi-parameter quantum groups defined by
generators and relations associated with symmetrizable generalized Cartan
matrices, together with their representations in the category $\mathcal O$.
This presentation will be convenient for our later discussions. We present two
explicit descriptions here: as a Hopf 2-cocycle deformation, and as the
multi-parameter quantum shuffle realization of the positive part.
