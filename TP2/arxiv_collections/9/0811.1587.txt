We study the asymptotic behavior of the appropriately scaled and possibly
perturbed spectral measure $\mu$ of large random real symmetric matrices with
heavy tailed entries. Specifically, consider the N by N symmetric matrix
$Y_N^\sigma$ whose (i,j) entry is $\sigma(i/N,j/N)X_{ij}$ where $(X_{ij},
0<i<j+1<\infty)$ is an infinite array of i.i.d real variables with common
distribution in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law,
$0<\alpha<2$, and $\sigma$ is a deterministic function. For a random diagonal
$D_N$ independent of $Y_N^\sigma$ and with appropriate rescaling $a_N$, we
prove that the distribution $\mu$ of $a_N^{-1}Y_N^\sigma + D_N$ converges in
mean towards a limiting probability measure which we characterize. As a special
case, we derive and analyze the almost sure limiting spectral density for
empirical covariance matrices with heavy tailed entries.
