Two-photon photopolymerization of UV curing resins is an attractive method
for the fabrication of microscopic transparent objects with size in the tens of
micrometers range. We have been using this method to produce three-dimensional
structures for optical micromanipulation, in an optical system based on a
femtosecond laser. By carefully adjusting the laser power and the exposure time
we were able to create micro-objects with well-defined 3D features and with
resolution below the diffraction limit of light. We discuss the performance and
capabilities of a microfabrication system, with some examples of its products.
