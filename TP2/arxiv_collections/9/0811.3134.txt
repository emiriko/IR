We study a toy model for "partially open" wave-mechanical system, like for
instance a dielectric micro-cavity, in the semiclassical limit where ray
dynamics is applicable. Our model is a quantized map on the 2-dimensional
torus, with an additional damping at each time step, resulting in a subunitary
propagator, or "damped quantum map". We obtain analogues of Weyl's laws for
such maps in the semiclassical limit, and draw some more precise estimates when
the classical dynamic is chaotic.
