Based on a new approach (the so-called Yukawaon model) to the mass spectra
and mixings, a neutrino mass matrix which is described in terms of the up-quark
masses and CKM matrix parameters is proposed. The mass matrix successfully
leads to a nearly tribimaximal mixing without assuming any discrete symmetry.
