We demonstrate theoretically a parallelized C-NOT gate which allows to
entangle a mesoscopic ensemble of atoms with a single control atom in a single
step, with high fidelity and on a microsecond timescale. Our scheme relies on
the strong and long-ranged interaction between Rydberg atoms triggering
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). By this we can robustly
implement a conditional transfer of all ensemble atoms among two logical
states, depending on the state of the control atom. We outline a many body
interferometer which allows a comparison of two many-body quantum states by
performing a measurement of the control atom.
