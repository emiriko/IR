We report the effect of adipic acid (C6H10O4) doping on lattice parameters,
microstructure, critical temperature (Tc), current density (Jc), and
irreversibility field (Hirr) for MgB2 superconductor. Actual carbon (C)
substitution level for boron (B) is estimated to be from 0.40 percent to 2.95
percent for different doping levels. A reduction in Tc from 38.43 to 34.93 K
and in lattice parameter a from 3.084(3) A to 3.075(6) Ais observed for the10
wt percent C6H10O4 doped sample in comparison to pristine MgB2. This is an
indication of C substitution at boron sites, with the C coming from the
decomposition of C6H10O4 at the time of reaction. Interestingly the doped
samples have resulted in significant enhancement of Jc and Hirr. All the doped
samples exhibit the Jc value of the order of 10^4 A/cm2 at 5 K and 8 T, which
is higher by an order of magnitude as compared to undoped sample. This result
indicates that C6H10O4 is a promising material for MgB2 for obtaining the
excellent Jc values under higher magnetic fields.
