We shall study backward stochastic differential equations and we will present
a new approach for the existence of the solution. This type of equation appears
very often in the valuation of financial derivatives in complete markets.
Therefore, the identification of the solution as the unique element in a
certain Banach space where a suitably chosen functional attains its minimum
becomes interesting for numerical computations.
