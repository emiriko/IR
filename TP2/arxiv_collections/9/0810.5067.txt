We provide combinatorial models for all Kirillov--Reshetikhin crystals of
nonexceptional type, which were recently shown to exist. For types D_n^(1),
B_n^(1), A_{2n-1}^(2) we rely on a previous construction using the Dynkin
diagram automorphism which interchanges nodes 0 and 1. For type C_n^(1) we use
a Dynkin diagram folding and for types A_{2n}^(2), D_{n+1}^(2) a similarity
construction. We also show that for types C_n^(1) and D_{n+1}^(2) the analog of
the Dynkin diagram automorphism exists on the level of crystals.
