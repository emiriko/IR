In previous mathematical studies of the BCS gap equation of
superconductivity, the gap function was regarded as an element of a space
consisting of functions of the wave vector only. But we regard it as an element
of a Banach space consisting of functions both of the temperature and of the
wave vector. On the basis of the implicit function theorem we first show that
there is a unique solution of class $C^2$ with respect to the temperature, to
the simplified gap equation obtained from the BCS gap equation. We then regard
the BCS gap equation as a nonlinear integral equation on the Banach space
above, and show that there is a unique solution to the BCS gap equation on the
basis of the Schauder fixed-point theorem. We find that the solution to the BCS
gap equation is continuous with respect to both the temperature and the wave
vector, and that the solution is approximated by a function of class $C^2$ with
respect to both the temperature and the wave vector. Moreover, the solution to
the BCS gap equation is shown to reduce to the solution to the simplified gap
equation under a certain condition.
