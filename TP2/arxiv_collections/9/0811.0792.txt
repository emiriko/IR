We have performed high-pressure, electrical resistivity, and specific heat
measurements on CeTe3 single crystals. Two magnetic phases with nonparallel
magnetic easy axes were detected in electrical resistivity and specific heat at
low temperatures. We also observed the emergence of an additional phase at high
pressures and low temperatures and a possible structural phase transition
detected at room temperature and at 45 kbar, which can possibly be related with
the lowering of the charge-density wave transition temperature known for this
compound.
