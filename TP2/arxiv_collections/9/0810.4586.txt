Spin-spin correlations are calculated in frustrated hierarchical Ising models
that exhibit chaotic renormalization-group behavior. The spin-spin
correlations, as a function of distance, behave chaotically. The far
correlations, but not the near correlations, are sensitive to small changes in
temperature or frustration, with temperature changes having a larger effect. On
the other hand, the calculated free energy, internal energy, and entropy are
smooth functions of temperature. The recursion-matrix calculation of
thermodynamic densities in a chaotic band is demonstrated. The leading Lyapunov
exponents are calculated as a function of frustration.
