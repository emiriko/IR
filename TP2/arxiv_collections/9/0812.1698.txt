In the minimal supersymmetric model the R-parity violating top quark
interactions, which are so far weakly constrained, can induce various
flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) productions for the top quark at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work we assume the presence of the
B-violating couplings and examine their contributions to the FCNC productions
proceeding through the parton processes cg -> t, gg -> t c_bar, cg -> t\gamma,
cg -> t Z and cg -> t h. We find that all these processes can be greatly
enhanced relative to the R-parity preserving predictions. In the parameter
space allowed by current experiments, all the production channels except cg ->t
h can reach the 3-sigma sensitivity, in contrast to the R-parity preserving
case in which only cg -> t can reach the 3-sigma sensitivity.
