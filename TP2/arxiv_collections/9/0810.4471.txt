Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments were performed to investigate
the spin dynamics in magnetoelectric effect (ME) LiCoPO$_4$ single crystals.
Weak dispersion was detected in the magnetic excitation spectra along the three
principal crystallographic axes measured around the (0 1 0) magnetic
reflection. Analysis of the data using linear spin-wave theory indicate that
single-ion anisotropy in LiCoPO$_4$ is as important as the strongest
nearest-neighbor exchange coupling. Our results suggest that Co$^{2+}$
single-ion anisotropy plays an important role in the spin dynamics of
LiCoPO$_4$ and must be taken into account in understanding its physical
properties. High resolution INS measurements reveal an anomalous low energy
excitation that we hypothesize may be related to the magnetoelectric effect of
LiCoPO$_4$.
