In this paper, we investigate the effects of the fourth generation of quarks
on the double-lepton polarization asymmetries in the $B_s \rar \phi \ell^+
\ell^-$ decay. It is shown that these asymmetries in $B_s \rar \phi \ell^+
\ell^-$ decay compared with those of $B \rar K \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay are more
sensitive to the fourth-generation parameters. We conclude that an efficient
way to establish the existence of the fourth generation of quarks could be the
study of these asymmetries in the $B_s \rar \phi \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay.
