We theoretically analyzed transport properties of a molecular network
constructed of gold nanoparticles linked with oligophenylenevinulene (OPV)
molecules. We showed that the conductance of such system was strongly reduced
when trinitrotoluene (TNT) became attached to the OPV linkers in the network.
The reported results are based on the ab inicio electronic structure
calculations. These results corroborate and elucidate experiments which
revealed significant drops in the conductance the network while the latter was
exposed to TNT vapors. The results suggest that the detected sensitivity of
transport characteristics of the considered nanoparticle network to TNT may be
used to design a sensing nanodevice.
