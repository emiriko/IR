We give a pedagogical review of recent progress towards understanding the
response of a strongly coupled plasma at finite temperature to a hard probe.
The plasma is that of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the hard
probe is a virtual photon, or, more precisely, an R-current. Via the
gauge/gravity duality, the problem of the current interacting with the plasma
is mapped onto the gravitational interaction between a Maxwell field and a
black hole embedded in the AdS_5 x S^5 geometry. The physical interpretation of
the AdS/CFT results can be then reconstructed with the help of the
ultraviolet/infrared correspondence. We thus deduce that, for sufficiently high
energy, the photon (or any other hard probe: a quark, a gluon, or a meson)
disappears into the plasma via a universal mechanism, which is quasi-democratic
parton branching: the current develops a parton cascade such that, at any step
in the branching process, the energy is almost equally divided among the
daughter partons. The branching rate is controlled by the plasma which acts on
the colored partons with a constant force ~ T^2. When reinterpreted in the
plasma infinite momentum frame, the same AdS/CFT results suggest a parton
picture for the plasma structure functions, in which all the partons have
fallen at very small values of Bjorken's x. For a time-like current in the
vacuum, quasi-democratic branching implies that there should be no jets in
electron-positron annihilation at strong coupling, but only a spatially
isotropic distribution of hadronic matter.
