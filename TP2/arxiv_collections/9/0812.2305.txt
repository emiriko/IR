Generalizing the well-known Shafarevich hyperbolicity conjecture, it has been
conjectured by Viehweg that a quasi-projective manifold that admits a
generically finite morphism to the moduli stack of canonically polarized
varieties is necessarily of log general type. Given a quasi-projective
threefold Y that admits a non-constant map to the moduli stack, we employ
extension properties of logarithmic pluri-forms to establish a strong
relationship between the moduli map and the minimal model program of Y: in all
relevant cases the minimal model program leads to a fiber space whose fibration
factors the moduli map. A much refined affirmative answer to Viehweg's
conjecture for families over threefolds follows as a corollary. For families
over surfaces, the moduli map can be often be described quite explicitly.
  Slightly weaker results are obtained for families of varieties with trivial,
or more generally semi-ample canonical bundle.
