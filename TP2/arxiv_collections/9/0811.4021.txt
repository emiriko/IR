In this study, we attempted to determine how eigenvalues change, according to
random matrix theory (RMT), in stock market data as the number of stocks
comprising the correlation matrix changes. Specifically, we tested for changes
in the eigenvalue properties as a function of the number and type of stocks in
the correlation matrix. We determined that the value of the eigenvalue
increases in proportion with the number of stocks. Furthermore, we noted that
the largest eigenvalue maintains its identical properties, regardless of the
number and type, whereas other eigenvalues evidence different features.
