In order to investigate the capability of the preseismic electric field
"strange attractor like" precursor as a time predictor of a large EQ within a
short time window (short-term prediction), the specific methodology was applied
on the Earth's electric field recorded during a rather long seismically active
period (December 1st, 2007 - April 30th, 2008) of Greece. During this period of
time a number (8) of large (Ms > 5.5R) earthquakes took place. The particular
analysis is presented in detail for the following EQs: the Monemvasia EQ
(January 6th 2008, Ms = 6.6R), the Methoni EQs (February 14th 2008 Ms = 6.7R,
February 19th 2008 Ms = 5.6R, February 20th 2008 Ms = 6.5R, February 26th 2008
Ms = 5.7R), the Skyros EQ (March 19th 2008 Ms = 5.5R) and the Mid Southern
Creta EQ (March 28th 2008 Ms = 5.6R). The obtained results from the analysis of
the afore mentioned EQs, in conjunction to the ones obtained from an earlier
presentation of the particular methodology (Thanassoulas et al. 2008a),
suggest: an average time of initiation of the preseismic precursor of the order
of (9) days before the EQ occurrence, a precursor average duration of the order
of (7) days, while the elapsed time between the end of the precursor till the
EQ occurrence time is, at average, only (2) days. These results suggest an
objective and easy to apply method for the short-term EQ prediction, based on
the registration of the Earth's electric field on ground surface.
