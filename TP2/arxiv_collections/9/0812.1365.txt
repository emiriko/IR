We derive general analytic formulae for the matrix elements of the SU(6)
generators for mixed symmetric $[N_c-1,1]$ spin-flavor states with an arbitrary
number $N_c$ of quarks. They are relevant for baryon spectroscopy in the
$1/N_c$ expansion method applied to light baryons and can be used to study
excited states. In this way previous work on non-strange baryons can be
extended to both non-strange and strange baryons.
