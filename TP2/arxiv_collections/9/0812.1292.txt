Harmonic analysis on Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type is a natural
framework for introducing multivariate Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials. Their
main properties are established in this setting: generating and determinantal
formulae, difference equations. As an application we consider the problem of
evaluating moments related to a multivariate Barnes type integral involving the
Harish-Chandra $c$-function of a symmetric cone.
