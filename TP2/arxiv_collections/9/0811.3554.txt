The subjects of the paper are the likelihood method (LM) and the expected
Fisher information (FI) considered from the point od view of the construction
of the physical models which originate in the statistical description of
phenomena. The master equation case and structural information principle are
derived. Then, the phenomenological description of the information transfer is
presented. The extreme physical information (EPI) method is reviewed. As if
marginal, the statistical interpretation of the amplitude of the system is
given. The formalism developed in this paper would be also applied in quantum
information processing and quantum game theory.
