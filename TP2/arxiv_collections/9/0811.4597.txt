We study the evolution of low-temperature magnetoresistance in double quantum
wells in the region below 1 Tesla as the applied current density increases. A
flip of the magneto-intersubband oscillation peaks, which occurs as a result of
the current-induced inversion of the quantum component of resistivity, is
observed. We also see splitting of these peaks as another manifestation of
nonlinear behavior, specific for the two-subband electron systems. The
experimental results are quantitatively explained by the theory based on the
kinetic equation for the isotropic non-equilibrium part of electron
distribution function. The inelastic scattering time is determined from the
dependence of the inversion magnetic field on the current.
