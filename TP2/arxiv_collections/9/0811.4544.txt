In this letter we report electrical transport measurements on nickel
nanowires of diameters down to 20 nm in the region close to its
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition temperature T_C (reduced temperature|t|
less than or equal to 0.001). The data analysis done in the frame work of
critical behavior of resistance near TC shows that the critical behavior
persists even down to the lowest diameter wire of 20 nm. However, there is a
suppression of the critical behavior of the resistivity as measured by the
critical exponents and the parameters quantifying the anomaly. The spin system
shows approach to a quasi one-dimensional spin system.
