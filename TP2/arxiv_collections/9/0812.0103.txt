Extensions of a previously presented Landau-de Gennes type liquid crystalline
phase transition model for the direct isotropic/smectic-A (lamellar) a phase
transition to the direct isotropic/smectic-C (tilted lamellar) transition are
studied. Two different proposed extensions to the model are studied both in the
context of ideal ordering (point volume) and full three-dimensional uniaxial
scalar/vector decomposition. Recommendations based upon the inclusion of
essential physics and computational feasibility are made, distinguishing each
of the two proposed extensions based upon these criteria. Additionally, it is
found that the approach used for the isotropic/smectic-A model to
deterministically compute phase diagram data is not possible for either of the
two proposed isotropic/smectic-C models.
