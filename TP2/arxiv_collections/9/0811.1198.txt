The non-abelian generalization of the Holdom model --{\it i.e.} a theory with
two gauge fields coupled to the kinetic mixing term $g {tr}(F_{\mu \nu} (A)
F_{\mu \nu} (B))$-- is considered. Contrarily to the abelian case, the group
structure $G\times G$ is explicitly broken to $G$. For SU(2) this fact implies
that the residual gauge symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry is
spontaneusly broken. We show that this mechanism provides of masses for the
involved particles. Also, the model presents instanton solutions with a
redefined coupling constant.
