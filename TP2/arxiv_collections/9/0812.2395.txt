We introduce an exactly solvable model for trapped three-color atom gases.
Applications to a cigar-shaped trapped cold fermions reveal a complex structure
of breached pairing phases. We find two competing superfluid phases at weak and
intermediate couplings, each one with two color pair condensates, that can be
distinguished from density profile measurements.
