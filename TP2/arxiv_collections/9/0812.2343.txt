In a normally magnetized thin-film ferrite disk with magnetic-dipolar modes,
one can observe magnetoelectric oscillations. Such magnetoelectric properties
of an electrically small sample can be considered as very attractive phenomena
in microwaves. In this paper we discuss the question on novel microwave device
applications based on ferrite magnetoelectric particles.
