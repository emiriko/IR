The numerical results for the computed moduli of the irreducible three-loop
contributions to the thermodynamical pressure of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in
the effective theory for the deconfinning phase are explained in detail.
Irreducible three-loop integrations are compared with two-loop integrations and
the different nature of their integrations is scrutinized and illustrated
numerically. The numerical results show a rapid convergence in the loop
expansion of Yang-Mills thermodynamics. The statistical method used for
irreducible three-loop integrations is explained and checked for two-loop
integrations. The statistical results for two-loop integrations are compatible
with the former computed analytical results showing the reliability of the
statistical method.This is a companion paper to [1].
