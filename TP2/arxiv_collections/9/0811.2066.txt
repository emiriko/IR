In order to account for all possible contractions allowed by the presence of
the solder form, a generalized Hodge dual is defined for the case of soldered
bundles. Although for curvature the generalized dual coincides with the usual
one, for torsion it gives a completely new dual definition. Starting from the
standard form of a gauge lagrangian for the translation group, the generalized
Hodge dual yields precisely the lagrangian of the teleparallel equivalent of
general relativity, and consequently also the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian of
general relativity.
