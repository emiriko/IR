We implemented a joint weak measurement of the trajectories of two photons in
a photonic version of Hardy's experiment. The joint weak measurement has been
performed via an entangled meter state in polarization degrees of freedom of
the two photons. Unlike Hardy's original argument in which the contradiction is
inferred by retrodiction, our experiment reveals its paradoxical nature as
preposterous values actually read out from the meter. Such a direct observation
of a paradox will give us a new insight into the spooky action of quantum
mechanics.
