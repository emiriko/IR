The generic unparticle propagator may be modified in two ways. Breaking the
conformal symmetry effectively adds a mass term to the propagator, while
considering vacuum polarization corrections adds a width-like term. Both of
these modifications result naturally from the coupling of the unparticle to
standard model (SM) fields. We explore how these modifications to the
propagator affect the calculation of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment using
an integral approximation of the propagator that is accurate for
$d\lesssim1.5$, where $d$ is the unparticle dimension. We find that for this
range of $d$ and various values of the conformal breaking scale $\mu$, the
value of $g-2$ calculated when allowing various SM fermions to run in the
unparticle self-energy loops does not significantly deviate from the value of
$g-2$ when the width term is ignored. We also investigate the limits on a
characteristic mass scale for the unparticle sector as a function of $\mu$ and
$d$.
