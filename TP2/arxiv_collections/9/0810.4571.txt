This paper shows some criteria for a scheme of finite type over an
algebraically closed field to be non-singular in terms of jet schemes.
  For the base field of characteristic zero, the scheme is non-singular if and
only if one of the truncation morphisms of its jet schemes is flat. For the
positive characteristic case, we obtain a similar characterization under the
reducedness condition on the scheme. We also obtain by a simple discussion that
the scheme is non-singular if and only if one of its jet schemes is
non-singular.
