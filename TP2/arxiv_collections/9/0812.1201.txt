We study the dynamics of the Cooper pairing across the T=0 phase diagram of
the two-dimensional Hubbard Model, relevant for high-temperature
superconductors, using a cluster extension of dynamical mean field theory. We
find that the superconducting pairing function evolves from an unconventional
form in the over-doped region into a more conventional boson-mediated retarded
form in the under-doped region of the phase diagram. The boson, however,
promotes the rise of a pseudo-gap in the electron density of states rather than
a superconducting gap as in the standard theory of superconductivity. We
discuss our results in terms of Mott-related phenomena, and we show that they
can be observed in tunneling experiments.
