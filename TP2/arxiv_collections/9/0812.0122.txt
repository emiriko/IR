We have identified the effect of the Wigner-Seitz cell geometry in the strong
segregation limit of diblock copolymer melts with strong composition asymmetry.
A variational problem is proposed describing the distortions of the chain paths
due to the geometric constraints imposed by the cell shape. We computed the
geometric excess energies for cylindrical phases arranged into hexagonal,
square, and triangular lattices and explicitly demonstrated that the hexagonal
lattice has the lowest energy for a fixed cell area.
