Single channel measurements play a minor role in today physics, but they are
sometimes unavoidable. Comparing to multichannel measurements, there is
distribution of measurement time to be chosen in an experiment design. A method
to optimize distribution of measurement time is given, where optimal
distribution minimizes standard deviation of a selected fit parameter. As an
example, the method is applied to electron spectroscopy experiments.
