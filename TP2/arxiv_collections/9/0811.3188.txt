Colloidal crystals are of extreme importance for applied research, such as
photonic crystals technology, and for fundamental studies in statistical
mechanics. Long range attractive interactions, such as capillary forces, can
drive the spontaneous assembly of such mesoscopic ordered structures. However
long range attractive forces are very rare in the colloidal realm. Here we
report a novel strong and long ranged attraction induced by a thermal gradient
in the presence of a wall. Switching on and off the thermal gradient we can
rapidly and reversibly form stable hexagonal 2D crystals. We show that the
observed attraction is hydrodynamic in nature and arises from thermal induced
slip flow on particle surfaces. We used optical tweezers to directly measure
the force law and compare it to an analytic prediction based on Stokes flow
driven by Marangoni forces.
