In a recent paper published in the Philosophical Magazine [Z.-D. Zhang, Phil.
Mag. 87, 5309-5419 (2007), arXiv:0705.1045], the author advances a conjectured
solution for various properties of the three-dimensional Ising model. Here we
disprove the conjecture and point out the flaws in the arguments leading to the
conjectured expressions.
