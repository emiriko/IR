We consider triplet Higgs model with $A_4$ symmetry to generate the neutrino
mass matrix. The tribimaximal form of the neutrino mixing matrix can be
naturally obtained. Imposing the neutrino oscillation data, we show that 1)
both normal and inverted mass hierarchy are allowed, 2) there is a lower bound
on the lightest neutrino mass and the effective mass for neutrinoless double
beta decay, 3) the non-vanishing $\th_{13}$ can be accommodated by considering
small perturbation, 4) $\th_{\rm atm}$ should be very close to $\pi/4$ even
after perturbation. }
