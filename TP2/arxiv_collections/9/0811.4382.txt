This paper concerns the combinatorics of the orbit Hecke algebra associated
with the orbit of a two sided Weyl group action on the Renner monoid of a
finite monoid of Lie type, $M$. It is shown by Putcha in \cite{Putcha97} that
the Kazhdan-Lusztig involution (\cite{KL79}) can be extended to the orbit Hecke
algebra which enables one to define the $R$-polynomials of the intervals
contained in a given orbit. Using the $R$-polynomials, we calculate the
M\"obius function of the Bruhat-Chevalley ordering on the orbits. Furthermore,
we provide a necessary condition for an interval contained in a given orbit to
be isomorphic to an interval in some Weyl group.
