We introduce and obtain multimode paraboson coherent states. In appropriate
subspaces these coherent states provide a decomposition of unity where the
measure, when expressed using the cat-type states, is positive definite.
Bicoherent states where the mutually commuting lowering operators are
diagonalized are also obtained. Matrix elements in the coherent state basis are
calculated.
