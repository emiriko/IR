We show that the ground state of zigzag bilayer graphene nanoribbons is
non-magnetic. It also possesses a finite gap, which has a non-monotonic
dependence with the width as a consequence of the competition between bulk and
strongly attractive edge interactions. All results were obtained using {ab
initio} total energy density functional theory calculations with the inclusion
of parametrized van der Waals interactions.
