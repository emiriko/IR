Denote by $H(t)=(H_1(t),...,H_N(t))$ a function in $t\in{\mathbb{R}}_+^N$
with values in $(0,1)^N$. Let
$\{B^{H(t)}(t)\}=\{B^{H(t)}(t),t\in{\mathbb{R}}^N_+\}$ be an
$(N,d)$-multifractional Brownian sheet (mfBs) with Hurst functional $H(t)$.
Under some regularity conditions on the function $H(t)$, we prove the
existence, joint continuity and the H\"{o}lder regularity of the local times of
$\{B^{H(t)}(t)\}$. We also determine the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets
of $\{B^{H(t)}(t)\}$. Our results extend the corresponding results for
fractional Brownian sheets and multifractional Brownian motion to
multifractional Brownian sheets.
