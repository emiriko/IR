We consider the tensor product of modules over the polynomial algebra
corresponding to the usual tensor product of linear operators. We present a
general description of the representation ring in case the ground field k is
perfect. It is made explicit in the special cases when k is real closed
respectively algebraically closed. Furthermore, we discuss the generalisation
of this problem to representations of quivers. In particular the representation
ring of quivers of extended Dynkin type A is provided.
