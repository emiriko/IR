Labor productivity was studied at the microscopic level in terms of
distributions based on individual firm financial data from Japan and the US. A
power-law distribution in terms of firms and sector productivity was found in
both countries' data. The labor productivities were not equal for nation and
sectors, in contrast to the prevailing view in the field of economics. It was
found that the low productivity of the Japanese non-manufacturing sector
reported in macro-economic studies was due to the low productivity of small
firms.
