We obtain character formulas of minimal affinizations of representations of
quantum groups when the underlying simple Lie algebra is orthogonal and the
support of the highest weight is contained in the first three nodes of the
Dynkin diagram. We also give a framework for extending our techniques to a more
general situation. In particular, for the orthogonal algebras and a highest
weight supported in at most one spin node, we realize the restricted classical
limit of the corresponding minimal affinizations as a quotient of a module
given by generators and relations and, furthermore, show that it projects onto
the submodule generated by the top weight space of the tensor product of
appropriate restricted Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules. We also prove a conjecture
of Chari and Pressley regarding the equivalence of certain minimal
affinizations in type D4.
