In the 1980's, the work of Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman, along with that of
Borcherds, culminated in the notion of vertex operator algebra, and an example
whose full symmetry group is the largest sporadic simple group: the Monster.
Thus it was shown that the vertex operators of mathematical physics play a role
in finite group theory. In this article we describe an extension of this
phenomenon by introducing the notion of enhanced vertex operator algebra, and
constructing examples that realize other sporadic simple groups, including one
that is not involved in the Monster.
