Using the self-consistent model, we present nonlocal spin-transfer effects
caused by the feedback between inhomogeneous magnetization and spin-transfer
torque on the current-induced magnetization dynamics in nanomagnets. The
nonlocal effects can substantially improve the coherence time of precession in
nanomagnets and thus reduce the linewidth of power spectrum. This narrow
linewidth results from the nonlinear damping of spin-waves due to the nonlocal
spin torque which is inherent and thus should be considered in future
experiments.
