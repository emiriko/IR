Progress in extracting the spectrum of excited hadron resonances is reviewed
and the key issues and challenges in such computations are outlined. The
importance of multi-hadron states as simulations are done with lighter pion
masses is discussed, and the need for all-to-all quark propagators is
emphasized.
