Odd-frequency pairing mechanism of superconductivity has been investigated
for several decades. Nevertheless, its properties, including the thermodynamic
stability, have remained unclear. In particular, it has been argued that the
odd-frequency state is thermodynamically unstable, has an unphysical (anti-)
Meissner effect, and thus can not exist as a homogeneous equilibrium phase. We
argue that this conclusion is incorrect because it implicitly relies on the
inappropriate assumption that the odd-frequency superconductor can be described
by an effective Hamiltonian that breaks the particle conservation symmetry. We
demonstrate that the odd-frequency state can be properly described within the
functional integral approach using non-local-in-time effective action. Within
the saddle point approximation, we find that this phase is thermodynamically
stable, exhibits ordinary Meissner effect, and therefore can be realized as an
equilibrium homogenous state of matter.
