In this article it is shown that in an equilibrium classical canonical
ensemble of molecules with two-body interaction and external field full Gibbs
distribution can be uniquely expressed in terms of a reduced two-particle
distribution function. This means that while a number of particles $N$ and a
volume $V$ are fixed the reduced two-particle distribution function contains as
much information about the equilibrium system as the whole canonical
distribution. The latter is represented as an absolutely convergent power
series relative to the reduced two-particle distribution function. As an
example a linear term of this expansion is calculated. It is also shown that
Gibbs distribution function can de expressed in terms of reduced distribution
function of the first order and pair correlation function.That is the later two
functions contain the whole information about system under consideration.
