Oxygen nonstoichiometry, electrical conductivity and thermal expansion of La2
xSrxNiO4-\delta phases with high levels of strontium substitution (1 =< x =<
1.4) have been investigated in air and oxygen atmosphere in the temperature
range 20-1050 degrees C. These phases retain the K2NiF4-type structure of
La2NiO4 (tetragonal, space group I4/mmm). The oxygen vacancy fraction was
determined independently from thermogravimetric and neutron diffraction
experiments, and is found to increase considerably on heating. The electrical
resistivity, thermal expansion and cell parameters with temperature show
peculiar variations with temperature, and differ notably from
La2NiO4$\pm$\delta in this respect. These variations are tentatively correlated
with the evolution of nickel oxidation state, which crosses from a Ni3+/Ni4+ to
a Ni2+/Ni3+ equilibrium on heating.
