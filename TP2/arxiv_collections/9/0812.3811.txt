We propose a scaling hypothesis for pattern-forming systems in which
modulation of the order parameter results from the competition between a
short-ranged interaction and a long-ranged interaction decaying with some power
$\alpha$ of the inverse distance. With L being a spatial length characterizing
the modulated phase, all thermodynamic quantities are predicted to scale like
some power of L. The scaling dimensions with respect to L only depend on the
dimensionality of the system d and the exponent \alpha. Scaling predictions are
in agreement with experiments on ultra-thin ferromagnetic films and
computational results. Finally, our scaling hypothesis implies that, for some
range of values \alpha>d, Inverse-Symmetry-Breaking transitions may appear
systematically in the considered class of frustrated systems.
