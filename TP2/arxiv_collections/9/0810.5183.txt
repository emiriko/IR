Based on the concept of sub-wavelength imaging through compensated bilayer of
anisotropic metamaterials (AMMs), which is an expansion of the perfect lens
configuration, we propose two dimensional prism pair structures of compensated
AMMs that are capable of manipulating two dimensional sub-wavelength images. We
demonstrate that through properly designed symmetric and asymmetric compensated
prism pair structures planar image rotation with arbitrary angle, lateral image
shift, as well as image magnification could be achieved with sub-wavelength
resolution. Both theoretical analysis and full wave electromagnetic simulations
have been employed to verify the properties of the proposed prism structures.
Utilizing the proposed AMM prisms, flat optical image of objects with
sub-wavelength features can be projected and magnified to wavelength scale
allowing for further optical processing of the image by conventional optics.
