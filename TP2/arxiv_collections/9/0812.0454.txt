We present a prototype for the first tracking detector consisting of 250
micron thin scintillating fibers and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays. The
detector has a modular design, each module consists of a mechanical support
structure of 10mm Rohacell foam between two 100 micron thin carbon fiber skins.
Five layers of scintillating fibers are glued to both top and bottom of the
support structure. SiPM arrays with a channel pitch of 250 micron are placed in
front of the fibers. We show the results of the first module prototype using
multiclad fibers of types Bicron BCF-20 and Kuraray SCSF-81M that were read out
by novel 32-channel SiPM arrays from FBK-irst/INFN Perugia as well as
32-channel SiPM arrays produced by Hamamatsu. A spatial resolution of 88 micron
+/- 6 micron at an average yield of 10 detected photons per minimal ionizig
particle has been achieved.
