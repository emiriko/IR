An overview of the CLAS12 detector is presented and the initial physics
program after the energy-doubling of the Jefferson Lab electron accelerator.
Construction of the 12 GeV upgrade project has started October 2008. A broad
program has been developed to map the nucleon's 3-dimensional spin and flavor
content through the measurement of deeply exclusive and semi-inclusive
processes. Other programs include forward distribution function to large $x_{B}
\le 0.85$ and of the quark and gluon polarized distribution functions, as well
as nucleon ground state and transition form factors at high $Q^2$. The 12 GeV
electron beam and the large acceptance of CLAS12 are also well suited to
explore hadronization properties using the nucleus as a laboratory
