The third paper of the series (see previous ones in Refs.[1-2]) discusses
basic physicalprocesses in the (quasi-) steady hurricane boundary layer (HBL),
develops an approximate airflow model, establishes the HBL structure, and
presents integral balance relations for dynamic and thermodynamic variables in
HBL. Models of evaporation and condensation are developed, where the
condensation is treated similarly to the slow combustion theory. A turbulent
approximation for the lower sub-layer of HBL is applied to the sea-air
interaction to establish the observed increase in angular momentum in the outer
region of HBL.A closed set of balance relations has been obtained. Simple
analytical solution of the set yields expressions for the basic dynamic
variables - maximal tangential and radial velocities in hurricane, maximal
vertical speed in eye wall, the affinity speed of hurricane travel, and the
maximal temperature increase after condensation. Estimated values of the
variables seem to be realistic. An attempt is also made to describe the radial
distributions of wind velocity and surface pressure observed in the hurricane
Frederic (1979).
