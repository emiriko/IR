The distinctive features of the electronic structure of vortex states in
superconducting graphene are studied within the Bogolubov-de Gennes theory
applied to excitations near the Dirac point. We suggest a scenario describing
the subgap spectrum transformation which occurs with a change in the doping
level. For an arbitrary vorticity and doping level we investigate the problem
of existence of zero energy modes. The crossover to a Caroli - de Gennes -
Matricon type of spectrum is studied.
