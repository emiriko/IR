There are several indications (from different approaches) that Spacetime at
the Plank Scale could be discrete. One approach to Quantum Gravity that takes
this most seriously is the Causal Sets Approach. In this approach spacetime is
fundamentally a discrete, random, partially ordered set (where the partial
order is the causal relation). In this contribution, we examine how timelike
and spacelike distances arise from a causal set (in the case that the causal
set is approximated by Minkowski spacetime), and how one can use this to obtain
geometrical information (such as lengths of curves) for the general case, where
the causal set could be approximated by some curved spacetime.
