Muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies of the "1111" and "122" FeAs systems
have detected static magnetism with variably sized ordered moments in their
parent compounds. The phase diagrams of FeAs, CuO, organic BEDT,
A$_{3}$C$_{60}$ and heavy-fermion systems indicate competition between static
magnetism and superconductivity, associated with first-order phase transitions
at quantum phase boundaries. In both FeAs and CuO systems, the superfluid
density $n_{s}/m^{*}$ at $T \to 0$ exhibits a nearly linear scaling with
$T_{c}$. Analogous to the roton-minimum energy scaling with the lambda
transition temperature in superfluid $^{4}$He, clear scaling with $T_{c}$ was
also found for the energy of the magnetic resonance mode in cuprates,
(Ba,K)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, CeCoIn$_{5}$ and CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, as well as the
energy of the superconducting coherence peak observed by angle resolved photo
emission (ARPES) in the cuprates near ($\pi$,0). Both the superfluid density
and the energy of these pair-non-breaking soft-mode excitations determine the
superconducting $T_{c}$ via phase fluctuations of condensed bosons. Combining
these observations and common dispersion relations of spin and charge
collective excitations in the cuprates, we propose a resonant spin charge
motion/coupling, "traffic-light resonance," expected when the charge energy
scale $\epsilon_{F}$ becomes comparable to the spin fluctuation energy scale
$\hbar\omega_{SF}\sim J$, as the process which leads to pair formation in these
correlated electron superconductors.
