A unitary Fermi gas has a surprisingly rich spectrum of large amplitude modes
of the pairing field alone, which defies a description within a formalism
involving only a reduced set of degrees of freedom, such as quantum
hydrodynamics or a Landau-Ginzburg-like description. These modes are very slow,
with oscillation frequencies well below the pairing gap, which makes their
damping through quasiparticle excitations quite ineffective. In atomic traps
these modes couple naturally with the density oscillations, and the
corresponding oscillations of the atomic cloud are an example of a new type of
collective mode in superfluid Fermi systems. They have lower frequencies than
the compressional collective hydrodynamic oscillations, have a non-spherical
momentum distribution, and could be excited by a quick time variation of the
scattering length.
