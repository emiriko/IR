We derive a basis for the vector space of bounded operators acting on a
$d$-dimensional system Hilbert space $C^d$. In the context of quantum
computation the basis elements are identified as the generalised Pauli matrices
- the error generators. As an application, we show how such matrices are used
in the teleportation a single qudit.
