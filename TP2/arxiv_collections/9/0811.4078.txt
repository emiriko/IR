Using irradiation of a 1-meter Hydrogen Bubble Chamber (LHE JINR) by a
quasimonochromatic neutron beam with impulse Pn=(5.20 +/- 0.12)GeV/c produced
after acceleration of deuterons in the synchrophasotron (LHE JINR) 2560 events
of reaction np-->npPi+Pi- were selected. After supplementary sorting out the
events where a secondary proton flies forward in the general c.m.s. of reaction
in the effective mass spectrum of Pi+Pi- - combinations, there were nine
peculiarities found out at masses 350, 408, 489, 579, 676, 762, 878, 1036, 1170
MeV/c^2 with experimental widths not more than several tens of MeV/c^2. The
resonance effects grow too much after using an additional criterion - balance
of the sum of the longitudinal impulse of Pi+ and Pi--mesons in the general
c.m.s. of the reaction. Under these conditions the values of a standard
derivation from the background are (5 - 7.5). The direct measurement of the
spin of resonances was carried out. Also other quantum numbers were obtained.
All of these peculiarities have a similar set of quantum numbers
I^G(J^(PC))=0+(0++). This way the sequence of scalar-izoscalar resonances
f0(SIGMA0) with masses in the range of M<M1200 MeV/c^2 are to be seen. There is
no information about these resonances in the literature. The phenomenological
dependence for the resonance mass from its number was found. This dependence
covered not only resonances shown in this paper but also all those which are
present in PDG tables with quantum numbers f0(SIGMA0) - mesons.
