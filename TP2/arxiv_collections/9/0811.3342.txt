This paper introduces a simple and computationally efficient algorithm for
conversion formulae between moments and cumulants. The algorithm provides just
one formula for classical, boolean and free cumulants. This is realized by
using a suitable polynomial representation of Abel polynomials. The algorithm
relies on the classical umbral calculus, a symbolic language introduced by Rota
and Taylor in 1994, that is particularly suited to be implemented by using
software for symbolic computations. Here we give a MAPLE procedure. Comparisons
with existing procedures, especially for conversions between moments and free
cumulants, as well as examples of applications to some well-known distributions
(classical and free) end the paper.
