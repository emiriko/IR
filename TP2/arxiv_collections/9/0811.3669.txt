We have studied the lower critical fields H_{c1} of superconducting iron
oxipnictide PrFeAsO_{1-y} single crystals for H parallel and perpendicular to
the ab-planes. Measurements of the local magnetic induction at positions
straddling the sample edge by using a miniature Hall-sensor array clearly
resolve the first flux penetration from the Meissner state. The temperature
dependence of H_{c1} for H || c is well scaled by the in-plane penetration
depth without showing any unusual behavior, in contrast to previous reports.
The anisotropy of penetration lengths at low temperatures is estimated to be ~
2.5, which is much smaller than the anisotropy of the coherence lengths. This
is indicative of multiband superconductivity in this system, in which the
active band for superconductivity is more anisotropic. We also point out that
the local induction measured at a position near the center of the crystal,
which has been used in a number of reports for the determination of H_{c1},
might seriously overestimate the obtained H_{c1}-value.
