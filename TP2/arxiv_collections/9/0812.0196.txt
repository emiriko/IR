A new class of two-level non-regular fractional factorial designs is defined.
We call this class an {\it affinely full-dimensional factorial design}, meaning
that design points in the design of this class are not contained in any affine
hyperplane in the vector space over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The property of the
indicator function for this class is also clarified. A fractional factorial
design in this class has a desirable property that parameters of the main
effect model are simultaneously identifiable. We investigate the property of
this class from the viewpoint of $D$-optimality. In particular, for the
saturated designs, the $D$-optimal design is chosen from this class for the run
sizes $r \equiv 5,6,7$ (mod 8).
