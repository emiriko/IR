An explicit and simple solution representing the wormhole formation is
presented. The spacetime is constructed by gluing the Minkowski and Roberts
spacetimes at null hypersurfaces in a regular manner. The parameters in the
Roberts solution are required to give the negative kinetic term for the
massless scalar field. Although a curvature singularity appears at the moment
of the wormhole formation, it disappears instantaneously. This instantaneous
singularity is weak in the senses of both Tipler and Kr\'{o}lak along radial
causal geodesics.
