We report on a series of experiments on the dynamics of spontaneous emission
controlled nanolasers. The laser cavity is a photonic crystal slab cavity,
embedding self-assembled quantum dots as gain material. The implementation of
cavity electrodynamics effects increases significantly the large signal
modulation bandwidth, with measured modulation speeds of the order of 10 GHz
while keeping an extinction ratio of 19 dB. A linear transient wavelength shift
is reported, corresponding to a chirp of less than 100 pm for a 35-ps laser
pulse. We observe that the chirp characteristics are independent of the
repetition rate of the laser up to 10 GHz.
