We report on our recent study of the gluon and ghost propagators of pure
SU(2) minimal lattice Landau gauge in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit,
we find evidence of the conformal infrared behaviour of these propagators as
predicted by functional continuum methods. However, in the strong-coupling
limit this happens for lattice momenta with a^2q^2>1, in units of the lattice
spacing a. Deviations from conformal scaling for a^2q^2<1 are well
parameterised by a transverse gluon mass. A comparison of various lattice
definitions of gauge potentials, all equivalent in the continuum limit, shows
that (a) both the critical exponent and coupling can be extracted unambiguously
from the high-momentum data in the strong-coupling limit, in good agreement
with the continuum predictions; but that on the other hand (b) the massive
branch depends on the definition of lattice gluon fields and is thus not
unambiguously defined. We demonstrate that this ambiguity is also present in
the low-momentum region for commonly used values of the lattice coupling in
SU(2).
