We study the temperature dependence of the adjoint Polyakov loop and its
implication for the momentum spectrum of gluons in the mean-field
approximation. This allows us to calculate the contribution of the thermal
(transverse) gluons to the thermodynamic pressure. As an application, we
evaluate the rates for the strange quark pair-production processes $q\bar{q}
\to s\bar{s}$ and $gg \to s\bar{s}$ as functions of temperature including
thermal effects on quark deconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking.
