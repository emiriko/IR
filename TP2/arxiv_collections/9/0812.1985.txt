We consider the ideal situation in which a space rotation is transferred from
a quantum spin j to a quantum spin l different from j. Quantum-information
theoretical considerations lead to the conclusion that such operation is
possible only for lj. For l>j the optimal stretching transformation is derived.
We show that for qubits the present no-stretching theorem is equivalent to the
usual no-cloning theorem.
