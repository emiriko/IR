We study weak decays of the charm- and bottom-strange mesons Ds0*(2317),
Ds1(2460), Bs0*(5725) and Bs1(5778) with f0(980) in the final state by assuming
a hadronic molecule interpretation for their structures. Since in the proposed
framework the initial and final states are occupied by hadronic molecules, the
predictions for observables can provide a sensitive tool to further test the
hadronic molecule structure in future experiments.
