We describe a simple model of Dark Matter, which explains the PAMELA/ATIC
excesses while being consistent with all present constraints. The DAMA annual
modulation signal can also be explained for some values of the parameters. The
model consists of a Dark Sector containing a weakly coupled broken U(1) gauge
symmetry, under which only the Dark Matter state and the leptons are charged.
