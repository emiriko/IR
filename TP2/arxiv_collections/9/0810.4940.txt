We propose an extra-dimensional approach to the unparticle Higgs (Unhiggs).
The non-local 4D Unhiggs action is derived as the boundary effective action of
a local 5D theory. We review the mechanism to generate unparticle spectra in
the context of warped soft-wall models. Gauge invariance can be simply
implemented and unitarity of the longitudinal WW scattering amplitude is
particularly transparent. Furthermore, the 5D approach uncovers a broader
spectrum of phenomenological possibilities. The Unhiggs is accompanied by
another continuum formed by Kaluza-Klein excitations of the Standard Model
gauge fields which, in some cases, may take over the leading role in
unitarizing WW scattering.
