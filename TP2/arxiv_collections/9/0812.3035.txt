This report is devoted to the building of the theory and analyzing the
phenomenon which take place in such strong correlated Fermi systems as High
temperature superconductors, metals with heavy fermions and quasi two
dimensional Fermi-systems. The described theory of strong correlated Fermi
systems bases on conceptions of Fermi condensate quantum phase transition
(FCQPT) and Fermi condensate. It develops the well known Landau paradigm based
on quasi particles formalism and order parameter. The description of the FCQPT
theory is followed by its verification on the different exactly solvable
models, by numerical calculations and by comparing with wide collection of
experimental data.
