Mass Varying neutrino mechanisms were proposed to link the neutrino mass
scale with dark energy, addressing the coincidence problem. In some scenarios
this mass can present a dependence on the baryonic density felt by neutrinos,
creating an effective neutrino mass that depends both on the neutrino and
baryonic densities. In this article we investigate the possibility that a
neutrino effective mass is the only flavour conversion mechanism acting in
neutrino oscillation experiments. We present a parameterization on the
environmental effects on neutrino mass that produces the right flavour
conversion probabilities for solar and terrestrial neutrinos experiments.
