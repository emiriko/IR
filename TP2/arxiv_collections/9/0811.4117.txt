The emission spectral pattern of a charged exciton in a semiconductor quantum
dot is composed of a quadruplet of linearly polarized lines in the presence of
a magnetic field oriented perpendicularly to the direction of the photon
momentum. By measuring the Zeeman splittings, we obtain the effective g factors
of the carriers and find that the hole g factor is very sensitive to the QD
shape asymmetry. By comparing the effective g factors obtained for the neutral
and the charged excitons in the same quantum dot, we uncover the role of
Coulomb correlations in these excitonic states.
