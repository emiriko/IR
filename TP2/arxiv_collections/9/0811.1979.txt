We search for charmless decays of charged B mesons to the three-body final
state K_S^0 K_S^0 pi+. Using a data sample of 423.7 fb^-1 collected at the
Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector, corresponding to (465.1 +-
5.1)X10^6 BB-bar pairs, we find no significant signal and determine a 90%
confidence level upper limit on the branching fraction of 5.1X10^-7.
