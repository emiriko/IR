This paper is focused on soil subsidence of small extend and amplitude caused
by tunnel boring or the collapse of underground cavities, whether natural or
man-made. The impact of the movements of the ground on existing structures is
generally dramatic. It is therefore necessary to accurately predict these
movements (settlements and horizontal extension or compression displacements).
Even though it is obvious that the overall stiffness and weight of the
structure influences the size and shape of the soil movement, the main features
of this soil-structure interaction phenomenon are not well established. Caudron
et al. (2006) developed an original small-scale physical model to take the
soil-structure interaction into account. It is based on the use of the
frictional Schneebeli material (assembly of small diameter rods) and a modified
version including cohesion in order to reproduce a cohesive layer above a
cavity. The displacements of the soil are obtained from digital images
processing by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Interesting results were
obtained, probing that the soil-structure interactions could be analysed by
this experimental model. This article is focused in a first part on the
influence of the position of the structure with respect to the cavity position.
Consequences on the areas mainly concerned by horizontal compression or
extension of the structure are determined. It appears that the stresses induced
in the building are a superposition of several elementary loading (sum of the
effects of the slope, the horizontal deformations and the curvature). The
second part concerns the effect of the relative soil/structure stiffness on the
ground movement during a cavity collapse by considering a second model of
structure with similar dimensions but more flexible.
