In this work, we begin by showing that a holomorphic foliation with
singularities is reduced if and only if its normal sheaf is torsion free. In
addition, when the codimension of the singular locus is at least two, it is
shown that being reduced is equivalent to the reflexivity of the tangent sheaf.
Our main results state on one hand, that the tangent sheaf of a codimension one
foliation in P^3 is locally free if and only the singular scheme is a curve,
and that it splits if and only if that curve is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay.
On the other hand, we discuss when a split foliation in P^3 is determined by
its singular scheme.
