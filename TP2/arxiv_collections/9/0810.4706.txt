Graphene - a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagonal
lattice - has one of the strongest possible atomic bonds and can be viewed as a
robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached
without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that
can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene
oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups.
Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and
difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms
or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic
manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and,
essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this
is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each
carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic
hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an
insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains
the hexagonal lattice but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of
graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The
reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic
state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall
effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of
graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with
designed electronic and other properties.
