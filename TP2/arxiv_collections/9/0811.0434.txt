We study the no reflection condition for a planar boundary between vacuum and
an isotropic chiral medium. In general chiral media, elliptically polarized
waves incident at a particular angle satisfy the no reflection condition. When
the wave impedance and wavenumber of the chiral medium are equal to the
corresponding parameters of vacuum, one of the circularly polarized waves is
transmitted to the medium without reflection or refraction for all angles of
incidence. We propose a circular polarizing beam splitter as a simple
application of the no reflection effect.
