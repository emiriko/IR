We use the relative trace formula to obtain exact formulas for central values
of certain twisted quadratic base change L-functions averaged over Hilbert
modular forms of a fixed weight and level. We apply these formulas to the
subconvexity problem for these L-functions. We also establish an
equidistribution result for the Hecke eigenvalues weighted by these L-values.
