The one dimensional spin system consisted of triangular $S=1/2$ $XXZ$
Heisenberg clusters alternating with single Ising spins is considered.
Partition function of the system is calculated exactly within the
transfer--matrix formalism. T=0 ground state phase diagrams, corresponding to
different regions of the values of system parameters are obtained.
