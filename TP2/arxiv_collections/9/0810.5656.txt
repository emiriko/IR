Thirty years ago Bourrely-Soffer-Wu (BSW) investigated an impact picture
description of $p-p$ and $\bar p -p$ elastic scattering with success. For this
anniversary, a short review of the main features of this picture will be
presented with its evolution over the years. The future experiments at the LHC
collider will provide decisive tests for the impact picture at high energy.
