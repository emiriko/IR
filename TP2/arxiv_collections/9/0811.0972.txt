The purpose of this study is to explore three numerical approaches to the
elastic homogenization of disordered masonry structures with moderate
meso/macro-lengthscale ratio. The methods investigated include a representative
of perturbation methods, the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion technique coupled
with Monte-Carlo simulations and a solver based on the Hashin-Shtrikman
variational principles. In all cases, parameters of the underlying random field
of material properties are directly derived from image analysis of a real-world
structure. Added value as well as limitations of individual schemes are
illustrated by a case study of an irregular masonry panel.
