We analyze bipartite quantum states that admit a symmetric extension. Any
such state can be decomposed into a convex combination of states that allow a
_pure_ symmetric extension. A necessary condition for a state to admit a pure
symmetric extension is that the spectra of the local and global density
matrices are equal. This condition is also sufficient for two qubits, but not
for any larger systems. Using this condition we present a conjectured necessary
and sufficient condition for a two qubit state to admit symmetric extension,
which we prove in some special cases. The results from symmetric extension
carry over to degradable and anti-degradable channels and we use this to prove
that all degradable channels with qubit output have a qubit environment.
