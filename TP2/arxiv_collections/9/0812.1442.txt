Various properties of fluids consisting of platelike particles differ from
the corresponding ones of fluids consisting of spherical particles because
interactions between platelets depend on their mutual orientations. One of the
main issues in this topic is to understand how structural properties of such
fluids depend on factors such as the shape of the platelets, the size
polydispersity, the orientational order, and the platelet number density. A
statistical mechanics approach to the problem is natural and in the last few
years there has been a lot of work on the study of properties of platelet
fluids. In this contribution some recent theoretical developments in the field
are discussed and experimental investigations are described.
