Transition metal boride Ru$_7$B$_3$ was found to be a noncentrosymmetric
superconductor with $T_{C}$ equal to 3.3 K. Superconducting and normal state
properties of Ru$_7$B$_3$ were determined by a self-consistent analysis through
resistivity($\rho_{xx}$ and $\rho_{xy}$), specific heat, lower critical field
measurement and electronic band structure calculation. It is found that
Ru$_7$B$_3$ belongs to an s-wave dominated single band superconductor with
energy gap 0.5 meV and could be categorized into type II superconductor with
weak electron-phonon coupling. Unusual 'kink' feature is clearly observed in
field-broadening resistivity curves, suggesting the possible mixture of spin
triplet induced by the lattice without inversion symmetry.
