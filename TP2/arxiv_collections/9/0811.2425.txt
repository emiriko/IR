In this paper we investigate the time evolution of the energy density for a
real massless scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime, inside a non-static
cavity, taking as basis the exact numerical approach purposed by Cole and
Schieve. Considering Neunmann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, we investigate
the following initial states of the field: vacuum, thermal state, the coherent
state and the Schrodinger cat state.
