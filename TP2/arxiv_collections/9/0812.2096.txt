In a previous paper we have classified the smooth projective symmetric
G-varieties with Picard number one (and G semisimple). In this work we give a
geometrical description of such varieties. In particular, we determine their
group of automorphisms. When this group, Aut(X), acts non-transitively on X, we
describe a G-equivariant embedding of the variety X in a homogeneous variety
(with respect to a larger group).
