Studies of interlayer transport in layered metals have generally made use of
zero temperature conductivity expressions to analyze angle-dependent
magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO). However, recent high temperature AMRO
experiments have been performed in a regime where the inclusion of finite
temperature effects may be required for a quantitative description of the
resistivity. We calculate the interlayer conductivity in a layered metal with
anisotropic Fermi surface properties allowing for finite temperature effects.
We find that resistance maxima are modified by thermal effects much more
strongly than resistance minima. We also use our expressions to calculate the
interlayer resistivity appropriate to recent AMRO experiments in an overdoped
cuprate which led to the conclusion that there is an anisotropic, linear in
temperature contribution to the scattering rate and find that this conclusion
is robust.
