The interface between a superconductor and a topological insulator has been
proposed to harbor novel quasiparticles that realize physical schemes for
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we present high resolution
angle-resolved photoemission experimental results, which along with first
principles calculations, suggest that the surface-edge states of Bi2Se3 form a
topological 2D metal. When magnetic atoms are deposited, the surface tends to
lose Kramers' degeneracy and a k-space connection thread between the bulk
valence and conduction bands is lost. Our observed states carry a \pi Berry's
phase suggesting that although the real materials are often electron doped
fully undoped Bi2Se3 would be a Z2 topological insulator at room temperature.
