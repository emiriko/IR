Valiant-Vazirani showed in 1985 [VV85] that solving NP with the promise that
"yes" instances have only one witness is powerful enough to solve the entire NP
class (under randomized reductions).
  We are interested in extending this result to the quantum setting. We prove
extensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur MA and Quantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur
QCMA. Our results have implications for the complexity of approximating the
ground state energy of a quantum local Hamiltonian with a unique ground state
and an inverse polynomial spectral gap. We show that the estimation (to within
polynomial accuracy) of the ground state energy of poly-gapped 1-D local
Hamiltonians is QCMA-hard [AN02], under randomized reductions. This is in stark
contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D Hamiltonians, which is in NP
[Has07]. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be reduced to NP by randomized
reductions, there is no classical description of the ground state of every
poly-gapped local Hamiltonian that allows efficient calculation of expectation
values.
  Finally, we discuss a few of the obstacles to the establishment of an
analogous result to the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA). In particular, we
show that random projections fail to provide a polynomial gap between two
witnesses.
