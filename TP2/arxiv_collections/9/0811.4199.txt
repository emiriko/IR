Critical behavior of the contact process is studied in annealed scale-free
networks by mapping it on the random walk problem. We obtain the analytic
results for the critical scaling, using the event-driven dynamics approach.
These results are confirmed by numerical simulations. The disorder fluctuation
induced by the sampling disorder in annealed networks is also explored.
Finally, we discuss over the discrepancy of the finite-size-scaling theory in
annealed and quenched networks in spirit of the droplet size scale and the
linking disorder fluctuation.
