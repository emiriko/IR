We present a rigorous determination of the critical value of the ground-state
quantum Ising model in a transverse field, on a class of planar graphs which we
call star-like. These include the star graph, which is a junction of several
copies of Z at a single point. Our approach is to use the graphical, or FK-,
representation of the model, and the probabilistic and geometric tools
associated with it.
