Motivated by the fact that empirical time series of earthquakes exhibit
long-range correlations in space and time and the Gutenberg-Richter
distribution of magnitudes, we propose a simple fault model that can account
for these types of scale-invariance. It is an avalanching process that displays
power-laws in the event sizes, in the epicenter distances as well as in the
waiting-time distributions, and also aftershock rates obeying a generalized
Omori law. We thus confirm that there is a relation between temporal and
spatial clustering of the activity in this kind of models. The fluctuating
boundaries of possible slipping areas show that the size of the largest
possible earthquake is not always maximal, and the average correlation length
is a fraction of the system size. This suggests that there is a concrete
alternative to the extreme interpretation of self-organized criticality as a
process in which every small event can cascade to an arbitrary large one: the
new picture includes fluctuating domains of coherent stress field as part of
the global self-organization. Moreover, this picture can be more easily
compared with other scenarios discussing fluctuating correlations lengths in
seismicity.
