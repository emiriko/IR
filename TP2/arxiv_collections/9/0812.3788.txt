The SPARQL query language is a recent W3C standard for processing RDF data, a
format that has been developed to encode information in a machine-readable way.
We investigate the foundations of SPARQL query optimization and (a) provide
novel complexity results for the SPARQL evaluation problem, showing that the
main source of complexity is operator OPTIONAL alone; (b) propose a
comprehensive set of algebraic query rewriting rules; (c) present a framework
for constraint-based SPARQL optimization based upon the well-known chase
procedure for Conjunctive Query minimization. In this line, we develop two
novel termination conditions for the chase. They subsume the strongest
conditions known so far and do not increase the complexity of the recognition
problem, thus making a larger class of both Conjunctive and SPARQL queries
amenable to constraint-based optimization. Our results are of immediate
practical interest and might empower any SPARQL query optimizer.
