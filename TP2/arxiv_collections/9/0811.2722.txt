We study the behaviour of the monopole at finite temperature in the
(2+1)-dimensional lattice gauge theory dual to the percolation model; by
exploiting the correspondences to statistical systems, we possess powerful
tools to evaluate the monopole mass both above and below the critical
temperature with high-precision Monte Carlo simulations.
