By combining results of Mizumachi on the stability of solitons for the Toda
lattice with a simple rescaling and a careful control of the KdV limit we give
a simple proof that small amplitude, long-wavelength solitary waves in the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model are linearly stable and hence by the results of
Friesecke and Pego that they are also nonlinearly, asymptotically stable.
