We evaluate the predictions of the left-right symmetry model based on
$SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ gauge group with one bidoublet and one doublet Higgs fields
on the parity violation, charged leptons and neutrinos masses. Parity violation
in the weak interaction is due to the very large $M_{W_{R}}$ mass compare to
the $M_{W_{L}}$ mass. The charged leptons acquire a Dirac mass via ordinary
Higgs mechanism, meanwhile the neutrinos acquire a very small Dirac masses via
seesaw-like mechanism with values $m_{1}=0.000043$ eV, $m_{2}=0.008888$ eV,
$m_{3}=0.014948$ eV when $\rho=8.4\times 10^{-11}$, or m_{1}=0.000014$ eV,
$m_{2}=0.003032$ eV, $m_{3}=0.050990$ eV when $\rho=2.9\times 10^{-11}$.
