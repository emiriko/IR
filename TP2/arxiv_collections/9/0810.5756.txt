In a previous paper, one of us pointed out that the anomalous dimension
matrices for all physical processes that have been calculated to date are
complex symmetric, if stated in an orthonormal basis. In this paper we prove
this fact and show that it is only true in a subset of all possible orthonormal
bases, but that this subset is the natural one to use for physical
calculations.
