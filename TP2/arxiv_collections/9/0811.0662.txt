In this paper we derive the tail asymptotics of a Kotz Type III elliptical
random vector. As an application of our asymptotic expansion we derive an
approximation for the conditional excess distribution. Furthermore, we discuss
the asymptotic dependence of Kotz Type III triangular arrays and provide some
details on the estimation of conditional excess distribution and survivor
function.
