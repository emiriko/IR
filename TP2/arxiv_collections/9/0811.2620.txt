The category of perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of a complex
reductive group $G$ gives a canonical geometric construction of the split form
of the Langlands dual group $\check G_\bZ$ over the integers. Given a field
$k$, we give a Tannakian construction of the quasi-split forms of $\check G_k$,
as well as a construction of the gerbe associated to an inner form of $\check
G_k$.
