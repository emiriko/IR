We propose a new class of nanoscale electro-optical traps for neutral atoms.
A prototype is the toroidal trap created by a suspended, charged carbon
nanotube decorated with a silver nanosphere dimer. An illuminating laser field,
blue detuned from an atomic resonance frequency, is strongly focused by
plasmons induced in the dimer and generates both a repulsive potential barrier
near the nanostructure surface and a large viscous damping force that
facilitates trap loading. Atoms with velocities of several meters per second
may be loaded directly into the trap via spontaneous emission of just two
photons.
