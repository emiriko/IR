We present a constructive argument to demonstrate the universality of the
sudden death of entanglement in the case of two non-interacting qubits, each of
which generically coupled to independent Markovian environments at zero
temperature. Conditions for the occurrence of the abrupt disappearance of
entanglement are determined and, most importantly, rigorously shown to be
almost always satisfied: Dynamical models for which the sudden death of
entanglement does not occur are seen to form a highly idealized zero-measure
subset within the set of all possible quantum dynamics.
