We study the time dependent Hartree equation in the continuum, the
semidiscrete, and the fully discrete setting. We prove existence-uniqueness,
regularity, and approximation properties for the respective schemes, and set
the stage for a controlled numerical computation of delicate nonlinear and
nonlocal features of the Hartree dynamics in various physical applications.
