We compute dilepton invariant mass spectra from the decays of rho mesons
produced by photon reactions off nuclei. Our calculations employ a realistic
model for the rho photoproduction amplitude on the nucleon which provides fair
agreement with measured cross sections. Medium effects are implemented via an
earlier constructed rho propagator based on hadronic many-body theory. At
incoming photon energies of 1.5 -3 GeV as used by the CLAS experiment at JLAB,
the average density probed for iron targets is estimated at about half
saturation density. At the pertinent rho-meson 3-momenta the predicted medium
effects on the rho propagator are rather moderate. The resulting dilepton
spectra approximately agree with recent CLAS data.
