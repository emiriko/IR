Lattice N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory formulated using Ginsparg-Wilson fermions
provides a rigorous non-perturbative definition of the continuum theory that
requires no fine-tuning as the lattice spacing is reduced to zero. Domain wall
fermions are one explicit scheme for achieving this and using them we have
performed large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the theory for gauge group
SU(2). We have measured the gaugino condensate, static potential, Creutz ratios
and residual mass for several values of the domain wall separation L_s,
four-dimensional lattice volume, and two values of the gauge coupling. With
this data we are able to extrapolate the gaugino condensate to the chiral
limit, to express it in physical units, and to establish important benchmarks
for future studies of super-Yang-Mills on the lattice.
