We show that in the severe slowing down temperature regime the relaxation of
antiferromagnetic rings and similar magnetic nanoclusters is governed by the
quasi-continuum portion of their quadrupolar fluctuation spectrum and not by
the lowest excitation lines. This is at the heart of the intriguing
near-universal power-law temperature dependence of the electronic correlation
frequency $\omega_c$ with an exponent close to 4. The onset of this behavior is
defined by an energy scale which is fixed by the lowest spin gap $\Delta_0$.
This explains why experimental curves of $\omega_c$ for different cluster sizes
and spins nearly coincide when $T$ is rescaled by $\Delta_0$.
