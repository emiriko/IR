Given a random word of size $n$ whose letters are drawn independently from an
ordered alphabet of size $m$, the fluctuations of the shape of the random RSK
Young tableaux are investigated, when $n$ and $m$ converge together to
infinity. If $m$ does not grow too fast and if the draws are uniform, then the
limiting shape is the same as the limiting spectrum of the GUE. In the
non-uniform case, a control of both highest probabilities will ensure the
convergence of the first row of the tableau toward the Tracy--Widom
distribution.
