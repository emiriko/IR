This second paper of the series (see the first one in [1]) models the
dynamics and structure of upper hurricane layer in adiabatic approximation.
Formulation of simplified aerodynamic model allows analytically express the
radial istributions of pressure and wind speed components. The vertical
evolution of these distributions and hurricane structure in the layer are
described by a coupled set of equations for the vertical mass flux and vertical
momentum balance, averaged over the eye wall cross section. Several realistic
predictions of the model are demonstrated, including the change of directions
for the component of radial wind speed and angular velocity of hurricane with
altitude.
