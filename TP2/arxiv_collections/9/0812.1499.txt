We investigate the effect of including hadronic resonance contributions in
the description of light quarks and mesons. To this end we take into account
the back-coupling of the pion onto the quark propagator within the
non-perturbative continuum framework of Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) and
Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE), in essence describing the so-called
\emph{pion-cloud}. As a result of our study we find that an unquenching of this
form provides for considerable effects in the spectrum of light mesons.
