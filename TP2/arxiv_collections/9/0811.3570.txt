We consider the possibility of experimental verification of vacuum e^+e^-
pair creation at the focus of two counter-propagating optical laser beams with
intensities 10^{20}-10^{22} W/cm^2, achievable with present-day petawatt
lasers, and approaching the Schwinger limit: 10^{29} W/cm^2 to be reached at
ELI. Our approach is based on the collisionless kinetic equation for the
evolution of the e^+ and e^- distribution functions governed by a non-Markovian
source term for pair production. As possible experimental signals of vacuum
pair production we consider e^+e^- annihilation into gamma-pairs and the
refraction of a high-frequency probe laser beam by the produced e^+e^- plasma.
We discuss the dependence of the dynamical pair production process on laser
wavelength, with special emphasis on applications in the X-ray domain (X-FEL),
as well as the prospects for \mu^+\mu^- and \pi^+\pi^- pair creation at
high-intensity lasers. We investigate perspectives for using high-intensity
lasers as ``boosters'' of ion beams in the few-GeV per nucleon range, which is
relevant, e.g., to the exploration of the QCD phase transition in laboratory
experiments.
