The dynamics of inertial particles in $2-d$ incompressible flows can be
modeled by $4-d$ bailout embedding maps. The density of the inertial particles,
relative to the density of the fluid, is a crucial parameter which controls the
dynamical behaviour of the particles. We study here the dynamical behaviour of
aerosols, i.e. particles heavier than the flow. An attractor widening and
merging crisis is seen the phase space in the aerosol case. Crisis induced
intermittency is seen in the time series and the laminar length distribution of
times before bursts gives rise to a power law with the exponent $\beta=-1/3$.
The maximum Lyapunov exponent near the crisis fluctuates around zero indicating
unstable dimension variability (UDV) in the system. The presence of unstable
dimension variability is confirmed by the behaviour of the probability
distributions of the finite time Lyapunov exponents.
