We study optimal dense coding with thermal entangled states of a two-qubit
anisotropic \emph{XXZ} model and a Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya
(DM) interactions. The DM interaction is another kind of anisotropic
antisymmetric exchange interaction. The effects of these two kinds of
anisotropies on dense coding are studied in detail for both the
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases. For the two models, we give the
conditions that the parameters of the models have to satisfy for a valid dense
coding. We also found that even though there is entanglement, it is unavailable
for our optimal dense coding, which is the same as entanglement teleportation.
