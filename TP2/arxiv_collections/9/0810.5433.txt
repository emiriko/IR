Major sterilization mechanisms are related to atoms and radicals, charged
parti-cles, excited molecules, ozone, and UV radiation. The ROS (Reactive
Oxygen Species) are well known as evildoers. These species are easily created
in ambient air and water and they live long enough to reach the cell and attack
the organic matter. Test molecules conversion in dry and wet air is studied
using Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) and Gliding Arc Reactors (GAR). The
effects of tem-perature and energy deposition into the media on the active
species production and then on the organic compounds degradation are presented
for two non thermal plasma reactors: DBD and GAR. Main production species
investigated are OH, O3, NOx, CO and CxHyOz by-products. It is shown from
experiment analysis that the reactive species production is quite different
from one reactor to another. GAR and pulsed DBD are two chemical processing
ways in which the temperature of heavy species in ionized gas is determinant.
By reviewing the species production obtained from both reactors, a discussion
is open about plasma decontamination.
