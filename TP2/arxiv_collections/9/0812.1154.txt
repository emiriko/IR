We review the current status of the field of sympathetically cooled molecular
ions, i.e. the method used for cooling the translational degrees of freedom,
the techniques applied for detection and analysis of the cold trapped ion
ensembles produced as well as first applications. We summarize a few salient
results and point out various possibilities for future developments.
