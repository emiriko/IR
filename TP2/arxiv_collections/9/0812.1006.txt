In this contribution to PSAS08 we report on the research activities developed
in our Toulouse group, in the framework of the BMV project, concerning the
search for photon oscillations into massive particles, such as axion-like
particles in the presence of a strong transverse magnetic field. We recall our
main result obtained in collaboration with LULI at \'Ecole Polytechnique
(Palaiseau, France). We also present the very preliminary results obtained with
the BMV experiment which is set up at LNCMP (Toulouse, France).
