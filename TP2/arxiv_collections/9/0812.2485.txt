Quantum state tomography is an important tool in quantum information science
for complete characterization of multi-qubit states and their correlations.
Here we report a method to perform a joint simultaneous read-out of two
superconducting qubits dispersively coupled to the same mode of a microwave
transmission line resonator. The non-linear dependence of the resonator
transmission on the qubit state dependent cavity frequency allows us to extract
the full two-qubit correlations without the need for single shot read-out of
individual qubits. We employ standard tomographic techniques to reconstruct the
density matrix of two-qubit quantum states.
