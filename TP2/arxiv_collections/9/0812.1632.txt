We describe the dynamics of a bound state of an attractive $\delta$-well
under displacement of the potential. Exact analytical results are presented for
the suddenly moved potential. Since this is a quantum system, only a fraction
of the initially confined wavefunction remains confined to the moving
potential. However, it is shown that besides the probability to remain confined
to the moving barrier and the probability to remain in the initial position,
there is also a certain probability for the particle to move at double speed. A
quasi-classical interpretation for this effect is suggested. The temporal and
spectral dynamics of each one of the scenarios is investigated.
