We show the following: a randomly chosen pure state as a resource for
measurement-based quantum computation, is - with overwhelming probability - of
no greater help to a polynomially bounded classical control computer, than a
string of random bits. Thus, unlike the familiar "cluster states", the
computing power of a classical control device is not increased from P to BQP,
but only to BPP. The same holds if the task is to sample from a distribution
rather than to perform a bounded-error computation. Furthermore, we show that
our results can be extended to states with significantly less entanglement than
random states.
