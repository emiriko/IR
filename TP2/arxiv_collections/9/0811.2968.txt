We theoretically demonstrate negative refraction and sub-wavelength
resolution below the diffraction limit in the UV and extreme UV ranges using
semiconductors. The metal-like re-sponse of typical semiconductors such as GaAs
or GaP makes it possible to achieve negative refraction and super-guiding in
resonant semiconductor/dielectric multilayer stacks, similar to what has been
demonstrated in metallo-dielectric photonic band gap structures. The
exploita-tion of this basic property in semiconductors raises the possibility
of new, yet-untapped ap-plications in the UV and soft x-ray ranges.
