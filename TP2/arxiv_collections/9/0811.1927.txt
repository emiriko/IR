We develop a practical quantum tomography protocol and implement measurements
of pure states of ququarts realized with polarization states of photon pairs
(biphotons). The method is based on an optimal choice of the measuring scheme's
parameters that provides better quality of reconstruction for the fixed set of
statistical data. A high accuracy of the state reconstruction (above 0.99)
indicates that developed methodology is adequate.
