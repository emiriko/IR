A two-component fermion model with conventional two-body interactions was
recently shown to have anyonic excitations. We here propose a scheme to
physically implement this model by transforming each chain of two two-component
fermions to the two capacitively coupled chains of superconducting devices. In
particular, we elaborate how to achieve the wanted operations to create and
manipulate the topological quantum states, providing an experimentally feasible
scenario to access the topological memory and to build the anyonic
interferometry.
