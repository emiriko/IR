The dynamical onset of lane formation is studied in experiments with binary
complex plasmas under microgravity conditions. Small microparticles are driven
and penetrate into a cloud of big particles, revealing a strong tendency
towards lane formation. The observed time-resolved lane formation process is in
good agreement with computer simulations of a binary Yukawa model with Langevin
dynamics. The laning is quantified in terms of the anisotropic scaling index,
leading to a universal order parameter for driven systems.
