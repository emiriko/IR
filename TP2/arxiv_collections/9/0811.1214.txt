The rare decay B -> K* (-> K pi) mu+ mu- is regarded as one of the crucial
channels for B physics as the polarization of the K* allows a precise angular
reconstruction resulting in many observables that offer new important tests of
the Standard Model and its extensions. These angular observables can be
expressed in terms of CP-conserving and CP-violating quantities which we study
in terms of the full form factors calculated from QCD sum rules on the
light-cone, including QCD factorization corrections. We investigate all
observables in the context of the Standard Model and various New Physics
models, in particular the Littlest Higgs model with T-parity and various MSSM
scenarios, identifying those observables with small to moderate dependence on
hadronic quantities and large impact of New Physics. One important result of
our studies is that new CP-violating phases will produce clean signals in
CP-violating asymmetries. We also identify a number of correlations between
various observables which will allow a clear distinction between different New
Physics scenarios.
