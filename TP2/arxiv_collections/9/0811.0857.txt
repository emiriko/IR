We develop a method for executing robust and selective transfer of
populations between a single level and pre-selected superpositions of energy
eigenstates. Viewed in the frequency domain, our method amounts to executing a
series of simultaneous adiabatic passages into each component of the target
superposition state. Viewed in {the} time domain, the method works by
accumulating the wavefunction of the target wave packet as it revisits the
Franck Condon region, in what amounts to an extension of the Piecewise
Adiabatic Passage technique [ Shapiro et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 033002
(2007)] to the multi-state regime. The viability of the method is verified by
performing numerical tests for the Na_2 molecule.
