The angular momentum mixing in a non-spherical CSC with nonzero azimuthal
quantum number and therefore violating time reversal invariance has been
examined. The mixing is bound to occur because of the equal strength of the
pairing potential mediated by one-gluon exchange for all partial waves to the
leading order QCD running coupling constant and the nonlinearity of the gap
equation. The free energy with mixing is lower than that with p-wave pairing
only, but still higher than that of the spherical CSL state.
