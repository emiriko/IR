We discuss the appearance of supersolid phases for interacting hardcore
bosons on the square lattice when, in addition to the standard nearest neighbor
hopping and repulsion, correlated or next-nearest neighbor hopping is present.
Having in mind dimer-based quantum magnets in a field described by effective
bosonic models of this kind, we put special emphasis on a comparison between
the different cases of relative signs of the kinetic processes, which
correspond to unfrustrated or frustrated magnetic models. In the unfrustrated
case, we compare Quantum Monte Carlo simulations with a mean-field (classical)
approach, which is shown to give qualitatively correct results. Using this
classical approach for the frustrated case, we find that the phase diagram is
generically richer than in the unfrustrated case. We also investigate in detail
the differences between standard next-nearest neighbour and correlated hopping
over the diagonal, with the conclusion that both cases are similar if
checkerboard order is present at half-filling, while a supersolid phase can be
stabilized without any adjacent solid phase only in the case of correlated
hopping.
