A certain modification of the semiclassical quantization condition based on
the summarization of the known power expansion in the squared Planck constant
is proposed. Corresponding deviation from exact spectra arises only together
with the deviation of the studied potential from the supersymmetric one so that
on the base of the presented method a new kind of the perturbation theory not
connected with the Planck constant may be developed
