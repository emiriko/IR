Soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) has become a standard tool to study
the factorization of short- and long-distance effects in processes involving
low-energetic (soft) particles and high-energetic/low-virtuality (collinear)
modes. In this contribution I give a brief overview on recent results for
inclusive and exclusive B decays and on applications in collider physics.
