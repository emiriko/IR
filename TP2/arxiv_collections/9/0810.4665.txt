We report that axions and photons exhibit instability in the presence of
cosmic strings that are carrying magnetic flux in their core. The strength of
the instability is determined by the symmetry breaking scale of the cosmic
string theory. This result would be evident in gamma ray bursts and axions
emanating from the cosmic string. These effects will eventually lead to
evaporation of the cosmic string.
