We introduce a classification number $n$ which describes the baryon mass
information in a fuzzy manner. According to $n$ and $J^p$ of baryons, we put
all known light baryons in a simple table in which some baryons with same ($n$,
$J^p$) are classified as members of known octets or decuplets. Meanwhile, we
predict two new possible octets.
