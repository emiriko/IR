All the BRST-invariant operators in pure spinor formalism in $d=10$ can be
represented as BRST commutators, such as
$V=\lbrace{Q_{brst}},{{\theta_{+}}\over{\lambda_{+}}}V\rbrace$ where
$\lambda_{+}$ is the U(5) component of the pure spinor transforming as
$1_{5\over2}$. Therefore, in order to secure non-triviality of BRST cohomology
in pure spinor string theory, one has to introduce "small Hilbert space" and
"small operator algebra" for pure spinors, analogous to those existing in RNS
formalism. As any invariant vertex operator in RNS string theory can also
represented as a commutator $V=\lbrace{Q_{brst}},LV\rbrace$ where
$L=-4c\partial\xi{\xi}e^{-2\phi}$, we show that mapping
${{\theta_{+}}\over{\lambda_{+}}}$ to L leads to identification of the pure
spinor variable $\lambda^{\alpha}$ in terms of RNS variables without any
additional non-minimal fields. We construct the RNS operator satisfying all the
properties of $\lambda^\alpha$ and show that the pure spinor BRST operator
$\oint{\lambda^\alpha{d_\alpha}}$ is mapped (up to similarity transformation)
to the BRST operator of RNS theory under such a construction. We also observe
that BRST cohomology of pure spinor superstring theory contains vertex
operators non-trivially coupled to the pure spinor ghost variable. The physical
interpretation of these operators remains unclear.
