The method of surrogates is widely used in the field of nonlinear data
analysis for testing for weak nonlinearities. The two most commonly used
algorithms for generating surrogates are the amplitude adjusted Fourier
transform (AAFT) and the iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transfom (IAAFT)
algorithm. Both the AAFT and IAAFT algorithm conserve the amplitude
distribution in real space and reproduce the power spectrum (PS) of the
original data set very accurately. The basic assumption in both algorithms is
that higher-order correlations can be wiped out using a Fourier phase
randomization procedure. In both cases, however, the randomness of the Fourier
phases is only imposed before the (first) Fourier back tranformation. Until
now, it has not been studied how the subsequent remapping and iteration steps
may affect the randomness of the phases. Using the Lorenz system as an example,
we show that both algorithms may create surrogate realizations containing
Fourier phase correlations. We present two new iterative surrogate data
generating methods being able to control the randomization of Fourier phases at
every iteration step. The resulting surrogate realizations which are truly
linear by construction display all properties needed for surrogate data.
