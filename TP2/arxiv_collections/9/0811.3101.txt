We constructed two sets of twist-3 correlation functions that are responsible
for generating the novel single transverse-spin asymmetry in the QCD collinear
factorization approach. We derive evolution equations for these universal
three-parton correlation functions. We calculate evolution kernels relevant to
the gluonic pole contributions to the asymmetry at the order of $\alpha_s$. We
find that all evolution kernels are infrared safe as they should be and have a
lot in common to the DGLAP evolution kernels of unpolarized parton
distributions. By solving the evolution equations, we explicitly demonstrate
the factorization scale dependence of these twist-3 correlation functions.
