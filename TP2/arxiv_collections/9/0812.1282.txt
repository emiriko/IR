We show that, when a single relaxation time lattice Boltzmann algorithm is
used to solve the hydrodynamic equations of a binary fluid for which the two
components have different viscosities, strong spurious velocities in the steady
state lead to incorrect results for the equilibrium contact angle. We identify
the origins of these spurious currents, and demonstrate how the results can be
greatly improved by using a lattice Boltzmann method based on a
multiple-relaxation-time algorithm. By considering capillary filling we
describe the dependence of the advancing contact angle on the interface
velocity.
