We show four formulas for calculating the orders of finite reductive monoids
with zero. As applications, these formulas are then used to calculate the
orders of finite reductive monoids induced from the $F_q$-split
$\J$-irreducible monoids $\overline {K^*\rho(G_0)}$ where $G_0$ is a simple
algebraic group over the algebraic closure of $F_q$, and $\rho: G_0\to GL(V)$
is the irreducible representation associated with any dominant weight. Finally,
we give an explicit formula for the orders of finite symplectic monoids
associated with the last fundamental dominant weight of type $C_l$; the
connections to $H$-polynomials and Betti numbers are shown.
