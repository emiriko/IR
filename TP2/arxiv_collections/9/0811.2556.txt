We propose a dark matter (DM) scenario in an extension of a left-right
symmetric model with a gauge-singlet scalar field. The gauge-singlet scalar can
automatically become a DM candidate, provided that both P and CP symmetries are
only broken spontaneously. Thus no extra discrete symmetries are needed to make
the DM candidate stable. After constraining the model parameters from the
observed relic DM density we make predictions for direct detection experiments.
We show that for some parameter range, the predicted WIMP-nucleon elastic
scattering cross section can reach the current experimental upper bound, which
can be tested by the experiments in the near future.
