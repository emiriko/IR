Recent developments in photo-detectors and photo-detector systems are
reviewed. The main emphasis is made on Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPM) - novel
and very attractive photo-detectors. Their main features are described.
Properties of detectors manufactured by different producers are compared.
Different applications are discussed including calorimeters, muon detection,
tracking, Cherenkov light detection, and time of flight measurements.
