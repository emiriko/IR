We report muon-spin relaxation measurements on SrFeAsF, which is the parent
compound of a newly discovered iron-arsenic-fluoride based series of
superconducting materials. We find that this material has very similar magnetic
properties to LaFeAsO, such as separated magnetic and structural transitions
(TN = 120 K, Ts = 175 K), contrasting with SrFe2As2 where they are coincident.
The muon oscillation frequencies fall away very sharply at TN, which suggests
that the magnetic exchange between the layers is weaker than in comparable
oxypnictide compounds. This is consistent with our specific heat measurements,
which find that the entropy change S = 0.05 J/mol/K largely occurs at the
structural transition and there is no anomaly at TN.
