In this work, a new Bayesian framework for OFDM channel estimation is
proposed. Using Jaynes' maximum entropy principle to derive prior information,
we successively tackle the situations when only the channel delay spread is a
priori known, then when it is not known. Exploitation of the time-frequency
dimensions are also considered in this framework, to derive the optimal channel
estimation associated to some performance measure under any state of knowledge.
Simulations corroborate the optimality claim and always prove as good or better
in performance than classical estimators.
