We propose an original adaptive wavefront holographic setup based on the
photorefractive effect (PR), to make real-time measurements of acousto-optic
signals in thick scattering media, with a high flux collection at high rates
for breast tumor detection. We describe here our present state of art and
understanding on the problem of breast imaging with PR detection of the
acousto-optic signal.
