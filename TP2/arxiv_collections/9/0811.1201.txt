The drift waves in field-reversed configurations without a toroidal magnetic
field, therefore no shear, play an important role in plasma transport. The
short connection length of the poloidal field in these systems leads to
significant stabilization by influencing the wave particle resonance. The field
reversed configuration is modeled by the cylindrical Bennett pinch in the limit
of large aspect ratio. The radial eigenmode equation for the universal mode is
derived from kinetic theory and the method of quadratic forms is used to study
its stability. The short connection lengths of the field lines lead to ion
Landau damping on the inside of the plasma and the stability of the mode depend
on the value of the temperature ratio Ti/Te
