The usual development of the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) proceeds by
assuming that the present is one of the jumping times. Under this restrictive
assumption integral equations for the propagator and mean escape times have
been derived. We generalize these results to the case when the present is an
arbitrary time by recourse to renewal theory. The case of Erlang distributed
times is analyzed in detail. Several concrete examples are considered.
