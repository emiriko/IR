The chiral structure of supersymmetric particle couplings involving third
generation Standard Model fermions depends on left-right squark and slepton
mixings as well as gaugino-higgsino mixings. The shapes and intercorrelations
of invariant mass distributions of a first or second generation lepton with
bottoms and taus arising from adjacent branches of SUSY cascade decays are
shown to be a sensitive probe of this chiral structure. All possible cascade
decays that can give rise to such correlations within the MSSM are considered.
For bottom-lepton correlations the distinctive structure of the invariant mass
distributions distinguishes between decays originating from stop or sbottom
squarks through either an intermediate chargino or neutralino. For decay
through a chargino the spins of the stop and chargino are established by the
form of the distribution. When the bottom charge is signed through soft muon
tagging, the structure of the same-sign and opposite-sign invariant mass
distributions depends on a set function of left-right and gaugino-higgsino
mixings, as well as establishes the spins of all the superpartners in the
sequential two-body cascade decay. Tau-lepton and tau-tau invariant mass
distributions arising from MSSM cascade decays are likewise systematically
considered with particular attention to their dependence on tau polarization.
All possible tau-lepton and tau-tau distributions are plotted using a
semi-analytic model for hadronic one-prong taus. Algorithms for fitting tau-tau
and tau-lepton distributions to data are suggested.
