We investigate the spatio-temporal structure of the bi-photon entanglement in
parametric down-conversion (PDC) and we demonstrate its non-factorable X-shaped
geometry. Such a structure gives access to the ultra-broad bandwidth of PDC,
and can be exploited to achieve a bi-photon temporal localization in the
femtosecond range. This extreme localization is connected to our ability to
resolve the photon positions in the source near-field. The non factorability
opens the possibility of tailoring the temporal entanglement by acting on the
spatial degrees of freedom of twin photons.
