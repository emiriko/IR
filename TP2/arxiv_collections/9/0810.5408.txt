Electron transport through a quantum dot chain with two neighboring dots
coupled to both leads is theoretically studied. In such a system, it is found
that only for the even-numbered quantum dot structure with the same-number
quantum dots coupled to each connecting dot, some eigenstates of the quantum
dots decouple from the leads. Namely, all odd eigenstates decouple from the
leads in the absence of magnetic flux, but all even eigenstates will decouple
from the leads when a magnetic flux is introduced. In addition, by adjusting
the magnetic fluxes through any subring, some eigenstates decouple from one
lead but still couple to the other, and then some new antiresonances occur.
