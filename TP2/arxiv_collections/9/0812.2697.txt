We re-analyzed the issue whether the resonance peak observed in neutron
scattering experiments on the cuprates is an exciton, a \pi-resonance, or a
magnetic plasmon. We considered a toy model with on-cite Hubbard U and
nearest-neighbor interactions in both charge and spin channels. We found that
the resonance is predominantly an exciton, even if magnetic interaction is
absent and d-wave pairing originates from attractive density-density
interaction. Our results indicate that one cannot distinguish between spin and
charge-mediated pairing interactions by just looking at the resonance peak in
the dynamic spin susceptibility.
