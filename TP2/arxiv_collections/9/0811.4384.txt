Starting from the classical Saltzman 2D convection equations, we derive via a
severe spectral truncation a minimal 10 ODE system which includes the thermal
effect of viscous dissipation. Neglecting this process leads to a dynamical
system which includes a decoupled (generalized) Lorenz system. The
consideration of this process breaks an important symmetry, couples the
dynamics of fast and slow variables, ensuing modifications of the structural
properties of the attractor and of the spectral features. When the relevant
nondimensional number (Eckert number Ec) is different from zero, the system is
ergodic and hyperbolic, the slow variables feature long term memory with 1/f
3/2 power spectra, and the fast variables feature amplitude modulation on time
scale of 1/Ec. Increasing the strength of the thermal-viscous feedback has a
stabilizing effect, as both the metric entropy and the Kaplan-Yorke attractor
dimension decrease monotonically with Ec. The analyzed system features very
rich dynamics: it overcomes some of the limitations of the Lorenz system and
might have prototypical value in relevant processes in complex systems
dynamics, such as the interaction between slow and fast variables. the presence
of long term memory and the associated extreme value statistics. Analysis shows
how, neglecting the coupling of slow and fast variables only on the basis of
scale analysis can be catastrophic. In fact, this leads to spurious invariances
that affect essential dynamical properties (ergodicity, hyperbolicity) and that
cause the model losing ability in describing intrinsically multiscale
processes.
