Low frequency spin fluctuation dynamics in paramagnetic spinel LiV$_2$O$_4$,
a rare 3$d$-electron heavy fermion system, is investigated. A parametrized
self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory of the dominant AFM spin
fluctuations is developed and applied to describe temperature and pressure
dependences of the low-$T$ nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ in this
material. The experimental data for $1/T_1$ available down to $\sim 1$K are
well reproduced by the SCR theory, showing the development of AFM spin
fluctuations as the paramagnetic metal approaches a magnetic instability under
the applied pressure. The low-$T$ upturn of $1/T_1T$ detected below 0.6 K under
the highest applied pressure of 4.74 GPa is explained as the nuclear spin
relaxation effect due to the spin freezing of magnetic defects unavoidably
present in the measured sample of LiV$_2$O$_4$.
