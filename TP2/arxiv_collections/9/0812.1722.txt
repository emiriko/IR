Capability of medium energy setup of a beta beam experiment to probe new
physics contributions to neutrino-W and neutrino-Z couplings are investigated.
We employ the effective lagrangian approach of Buchmuller and Wyler and obtain
95% confidence level limits on neutrino couplings to these gauge bosons without
assuming the flavor universality of the coupling of neutrinos. We show that a
beta beam facility can place 3 to 20 times more restrictive limits than present
ones on the deviations from the electron neutrino couplings in the Standard
Model.
