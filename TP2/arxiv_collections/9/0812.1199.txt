The formalism developed recently to study vector meson--vector meson
interaction, and applied to the case of $\rho\rho$, is extended to study the
interaction of the nonet of vector mesons among themselves. The interaction
leads to poles of the scattering matrix corresponding to bound states or
resonances. We show that 11 states (either bound or resonant) get dynamically
generated in nine strangeness-isospin-spin channels. Five of them can be
identified with those reported in the PDG, i.e., the $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1710)$,
$f_2(1270)$, $f'_2(1525)$, and $K^*_2(1430)$. The masses of the latter three
tensor states have been used to fine-tune the free parameters of the unitary
approach, i.e., the subtraction constants in evaluating the vector meson
-vector meson loop functions in the dimensional regularization scheme. The
branching ratios of these five dynamically generated states are found to be
consistent with data. The existence of the other six states should be taken as
predictions to be tested by future experiments.
