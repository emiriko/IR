We examine a simple model of interaction of gravitational waves with matter
(primarily represented by dust). The aim is to investigate a possible damping
effect on the intensity of gravitational wave when passing through media. This
might be important for gravitational wave astronomy when the sources are
obscured by dust or molecular clouds.
