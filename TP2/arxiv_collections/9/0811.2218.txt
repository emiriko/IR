We study a bandwidth controlled Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) between
a Fermi liquid metal and a quantum spin-liquid insulator at half-filling in
three dimensions (3D). Using a slave rotor approach, and incorporating gauge
field fluctuations, we find a continuous MIT and discuss the finite temperature
crossovers around this critical point. We show that the specific heat C=T ln ln
(1/T) at the MIT and argue that the electrical transport on the metallic side
near the transition should exhibit a `conductivity minimum' as a function of
temperature. A possible candidate to test these predictions is the 3D spin
liquid insulator Na4Ir3O8 which exhibits a pressure-tuned transition into a
metallic phase. We also present the electron spectral function of Na4Ir3O8 at
the transition.
