We study a microscopic mechanism of Fe-pnictide superconductor, considering
the screening effects of Coulomb interaction in addition to the conventional
spin-fluctuation mechanism. It is shown that, by electron doping, the
transition temperature of superconductivity increases due to the "unscreening"
effect even though the density of states decrease, while that of spin-density
wave rapidly decreases due to breaking of nesting conditions. Our results give
a clear interpretation to the mystery of interrelation between T_c and the
density of states observed in the Fe-pnictide superconductors.
