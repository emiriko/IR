High fluxes of cold polar molecules are efficiently produced by electric
guiding and velocity filtering. Here, we investigate different aspects of the
beam formation. Variations of the source parameters such as density and
temperature result in characteristic changes in the guided beam. These are
observed in the velocity distribution of the guided molecules as well as in the
dependence of the signal of guided molecules on the trapping electric field. A
model taking into account velocity-dependent collisional losses of cold
molecules in the region close to the nozzle accurately reproduces this
behavior. This clarifies an open question on the parameter dependence of the
detected signal and gives a more detailed understanding of the velocity
filtering and guiding process.
