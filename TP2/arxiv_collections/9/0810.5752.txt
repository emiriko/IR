Many non-equilibrium processes on scale-free networks present anomalous
critical behavior that is not explained by standard mean-field theories. We
propose a systematic method to derive stochastic equations for mean-field order
parameters that implicitly account for the degree heterogeneity. The method is
used to correctly predict the dynamical critical behavior of some binary spin
models and reaction-diffusion processes. The validity of our non-equilibrium
theory is furtherly supported by showing its relation with the generalized
Landau theory of equilibrium critical phenomena on networks.
