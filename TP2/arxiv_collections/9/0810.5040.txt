In this article it is shown that in a classical equilibrium canonical
ensemble of molecules with $s$-body interaction full Gibbs distribution can be
uniquely expressed in terms of a reduced s-particle distribution function. This
means that whenever a number of particles $N$ and a volume $V$ are fixed the
reduced $s$-particle distribution function contains as much information about
the equilibrium system as the whole canonical Gibbs distribution. The latter is
represented as an absolutely convergent power series relative to the reduced
$s$-particle distribution function. As an example a linear term of this
expansion is calculated. It is also shown that reduced distribution functions
of order less than $s$ don't possess such property and, to all appearance,
contain not all information about the system under consideration.
