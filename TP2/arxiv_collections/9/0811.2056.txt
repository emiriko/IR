We study the performance of a quantum wire spin filter that is based on the
Rashba spin-orbit interaction in the presence of the electron-electron
interaction. The finite length wire is attached to two semi-infinite
nonmagnetic leads. Analyzing the spin polarization of the linear conductance at
zero temperature, we show that spin-filtering is possible by adequate tuning of
the system parameters first considering noninteracting electrons. Next, the
functional renormalization group method is used to capture correlation effects
induced by the Coulomb interaction. For short wires we show that the energy
regime in which spin polarization is found is strongly affected by the Coulomb
interaction. For long wires we find the power-law suppression of the total
conductance on low energy scales typical for inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids
while the degree of spin polarization stays constant.
