Spintronics has attracted wide attention by promising novel functionalities
derived from both the electron charge and spin. While branching into new areas
and creating new themes over the past years, the principal goals remain the
spin and magnetic control of the electrical properties, essentially the I-V
characteristics, and vice versa. There are great challenges ahead to meet these
goals. One challenge is to find niche applications for ferromagnetic
semiconductors, such as GaMnAs. Another is to develop further the science of
hybrid ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor heterostructures, as alternatives to
all-semiconductor room temperature spintronics. Here we present our
representative recent efiorts to address such challenges. We show how to make a
digital magnetoresistor by combining two magnetic resonant diodes, or how
introducing ferromagnetic semiconductors as active regions in resonant
tunneling diodes leads to novel efiects of digital magnetoresistance and of
magnetoelectric current oscillations. We also discuss the phenomenon of
tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in Fe/GaAs junctions by introducing the
concept of the spin-orbit coupling field, as an analog of such fields in
all-semiconductor junctions. Finally, we look at fundamental electronic and
optical properties of GaMnAs by employing reasonable tight-binding models to
study disorder efiects.
