We investigate the total entropy production of a Brownian particle in a
driven bistable system. This system exhibits the phenomenon of stochastic
resonance. We show that in the time-periodic steady state, the probability
density function for the total entropy production satisfies Seifert's integral
and detailed fluctuation theorems over finite time trajectories.
