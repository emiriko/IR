The anisotropic complex dielectric response was accurately extracted from
spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements at phonon frequencies for the three
principal crystallographic directions of an orthorhombic (Pbnm) YTiO_3 single
crystal. We identify all twenty five infrared-active phonon modes allowed by
symmetry, 7B_1u, 9B_2u, and 9B_3u, polarized along the c-, b-, and a-axis,
respectively. From a classical dispersion analysis of the complex dielectric
functions \tilde\epsilon(\omega) and their inverses -1/\tilde\epsilon(\omega)
we define the resonant frequencies, widths, and oscillator strengths of the
transverse (TO) and longitudinal (LO) phonon modes. We calculate
eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of B_1u, B_2u, and B_3u normal modes and
suggest assignments of the TO phonon modes observed in our ellipsometry spectra
by comparing their frequencies and oscillator strengths with those resulting
from the present lattice-dynamics study. Based on these assignments, we
estimate dynamical effective charges of the atoms in the YTiO_3 lattice. We
find that, in general, the dynamical effective charges in YTiO_3 lattice are
typical for a family of perovskite oxides. By contrast to a ferroelectric
BaTiO_3, the dynamical effective charge of oxygen related to a displacement
along the c-axis does not show the anomalously large value. At the same time,
the dynamical effective charges of Y and ab-plane oxygen exhibit anisotropy,
indicating strong hybridization along the a-axis.
