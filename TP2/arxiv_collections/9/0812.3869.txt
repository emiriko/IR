The possibility of physics in multiple time dimensions is investigated.
Drawing on recent work by Walter Craig and myself, I show that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, there is a well-posed initial value
problem--deterministic, stable evolution--for theories in multiple time
dimensions. Though similar in many ways to ordinary, single-time theories,
multi-time theories have some rather intriguing properties which suggest new
directions for the understanding of fundamental physics.
