We review the physics of charged impurities in the vicinity of graphene. The
long-range nature of Coulomb impurities affects both the nature of the ground
state density profile as well as graphene's transport properties. We discuss
the screening of a single Coulomb impurity and the ensemble averaged density
profile of graphene in the presence of many randomly distributed impurities.
Finally, we discuss graphene's transport properties due to scattering off
charged impurities both at low and high carrier density.
