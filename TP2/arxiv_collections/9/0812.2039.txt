A key element in the generation of optical torque in optical traps, which
occurs when electromagnetic angular momentum is transferred from the trapping
beam to the trapped particle by scattering, is the symmetries of the scattering
particle and the trapping beam. We discuss the effect of such symmetries on the
generation and measurement of optical torque in optical tweezers, and some
consequent general principles for the design of optically-driven micromachines.
