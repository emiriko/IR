We present a next-to-leading order calculation of Higgs boson production via
gluon fusion interfaced to shower Monte Carlo programs, implemented according
to the POWHEG method. A detailed comparison with MC@NLO and PYTHIA is carried
out for several observables, for the Tevatron and LHC colliders. Comparisons
with next-to-next-to-leading order results and with resummed ones are also
presented.
