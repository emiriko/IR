The ground state energy of a collection of n pions and m kaons with short
range interactions is calculated for a volume with finite spatial extent L and
periodic boundary conditions. This calculation is accomplished to order L^-6 in
the large volume expansion. With this result one can extract the various two-
and three-body interactions between pions and kaons from lattice QCD data.
