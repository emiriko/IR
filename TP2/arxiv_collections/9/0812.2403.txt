We study the impact of explicit chiral symmetry breaking of Wilson fermions
on mesonic correlators in the epsilon-regime using Wilson chiral perturbation
theory (WChPT). We generalize the epsilon-expansion of continuum ChPT to
nonzero lattice spacings for various quark mass regimes. It turns out that the
corrections due to a nonzero lattice spacing are highly suppressed for typical
quark masses of the order aLambda_QCD^2. The lattice spacing effects become
more pronounced for smaller quark masses and lead to non-trivial corrections of
the continuum ChPT results at next-to-leading order. We compute these
corrections for the standard current and density correlation functions. A fit
to lattice data shows that these corrections are small, as expected.
