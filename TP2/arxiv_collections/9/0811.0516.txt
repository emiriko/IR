The m\alpha^6(m/M) order corrections to the hyperfine splitting in the H_2^+
ion are calculated. That allows to reduce uncertainty in the frequency
intervals between hyperfine sublevels of a given rovibrational state to about
10 ppm. Results are in good agreement with the high precision experiment
carried out by Jefferts in 1969.
