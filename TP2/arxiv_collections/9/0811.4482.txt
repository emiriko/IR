We study the dynamics of a system made up of particles of two different
species undergoing irreversible quadratic autocatalytic reactions: $A + B \to
2A$. We especially focus on the reaction velocity and on the average time at
which the system achieves its inert state. By means of both analytical and
numerical methods, we are also able to highlight the role of topology in the
temporal evolution of the system.
