Liquid-liquid wetting failure is investigated in a two-dimensional Couette
system with two immiscible fluids of arbitrary viscosity. The problem is solved
exactly using a sharp interface treatment of hydrodynamics (lubrication theory)
as a function of the capillary number, viscous ratio and separation of scale,
i.e. slip length versus macroscopic scale of the system. The existence of
critical velocities, above which no stationary solutions are found, is analyzed
in detail in terms of the relevant parameters of the system. Comparisons with
existing analysis for other geometries are also carried out. A numerical method
of analysis is also presented, based on diffuse interface models obtained from
multiphase extensions of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). Sharp interface
and diffuse interface models are quantitatively compared face to face
indicating the correct limit of applicability of the diffuse interface models.
