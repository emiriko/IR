The prospect of self-consistent propagation of more than two pulses
contemporaneously through multi-resonant media raises open questions: whether
soliton solutions exist, and whether a useful generalization of two-level pulse
Area can be found. We answer these questions positively for the case of four
pulses interacting in combined V and Lambda fashion with an idealized pair of
atomic D-lines.
