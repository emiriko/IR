The classical statistics indication for the impossibility to derive quantum
mechanics from classical mechanics is proved. The formalism of the statistical
Fisher information is used. Next the Fisher information as a tool of the
construction of a self-consistent field theory, which joins the quantum theory
and classical field theory, is proposed.
