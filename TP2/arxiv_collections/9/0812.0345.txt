Low energy non linear QED effects in vacuum have been predicted since 1936
and have been subject of research for many decades. Two main schemes have been
proposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by
a linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct
light-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an
external field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence
of axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature
would cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the
presence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of
the light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project
sensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has
opened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED
corrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low
energies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence
measurements and index of refraction measurements. We propose an almost
parasitic implementation of an external magnetic field along the arms of the
VIRGO interferometer and discuss the advantage of this choice in comparison to
a previously proposed configuration based on shorter prototype interferometers
which we believe is inadequate. Considering the design sensitivity in the
strain, for the near future VIRGO+ interferometer, of $h<2\cdot10^{-23}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rm Hz}}$ in the range 40 Hz $- 400$ Hz leads to a variable
dipole magnet configuration at a frequency above 20 Hz such that $B^{2}D \ge
13000$ T$^{2}$m/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for a `first' vacuum non linear QED detection.
