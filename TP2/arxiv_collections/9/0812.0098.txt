Two coupled channel effects connected with kaon pair production in
proton-proton collisions are discussed. (1) Although there is ample evidence
that the antikaon is strongly attracted to the recoil protons in pp -> K+pK-p,
residual effects of the K+K- interaction are seen, including a possible cusp at
the K0\bar{K}0 threshold. This is investigated within a simple K-matrix
approach. (2) The production rates and invariant mass distributions for pp ->
K+p{K-p} and pp -> K+p{pi0 Sigma0} are related using a separable potential
description of the coupled K-p/pi0 Sigma0 channels. It can be plausibly argued
that this pair of reactions is driven through the production of the
Lambda(1405).
