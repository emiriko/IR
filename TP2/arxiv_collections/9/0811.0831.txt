We present an idea for a future D0-D0bar mixing and CP violation experiment
to run at the Fermilab Tevatron. We estimate that in three years of running,
such an experiment could reconstruct an order of magnitude more flavor-tagged
D0->K+pi- decays than will be reconstructed by the B-factory experiments with
their full data sets. The resulting sensitivity to CP-violating parameters
|q/p| and Arg(q/p) is calculated from a global fit to CP-violating observables,
and it is found to be much greater than current world sensitivity.
