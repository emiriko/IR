One of the most striking manifestations of quantum coherence in interacting
boson systems is superfluidity. Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor
microcavities are two-dimensional composite bosons predicted to behave as
particular quantum fluids. We report the observation of superfluid motion of
polaritons created by a laser in a semiconductor microcavity. Superfluidity is
investigated in terms of the Landau criterion and manifests itself as the
suppression of scattering from defects when the flow velocity is slower than
the speed of sound in the fluid. On the other hand, a Cerenkov-like wake
pattern is clearly observed when the flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound.
The experimental findings are in excellent quantitative agreement with the
predictions based on a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii theory, showing that
polaritons in microcavities constitute a very rich system for exploring the
physics of non-equilibrium quantum fluids.
