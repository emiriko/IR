A description of complete normal varieties with lower dimensional torus
action has been given by Altmann, Hausen, and Suess, generalizing the theory of
toric varieties. Considering the case where the acting torus T has codimension
one, we describe T-invariant Weil and Cartier divisors and provide formulae for
calculating global sections, intersection numbers, and Euler characteristics.
As an application, we use divisors on these so-called T-varieties to define new
evaluation codes called T-codes. We find estimates on their minimum distance
using intersection theory. This generalizes the theory of toric codes and
combines it with AG codes on curves. As the simplest application of our general
techniques we look at codes on ruled surfaces coming from decomposable vector
bundles. Already this construction gives codes that are better than the related
product code. Further examples show that we can improve these codes by
constructing more sophisticated T-varieties. These results suggest to look
further for good codes on T-varieties.
