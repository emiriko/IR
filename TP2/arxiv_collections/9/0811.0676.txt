We present measurements on side gated graphene constrictions of different
geometries. We characterize the transport gap by its width in back gate voltage
and compare this to an analysis based on Coulomb blockade measurements of
localized states. We study the effect of an applied side gate voltage on the
transport gap and show that high side gate voltages lift the suppression of the
conductance. Finally we study the effect of an applied magnetic field and
demonstrate the presence of edge states in the constriction.
