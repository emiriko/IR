Understanding the time evolution of fragmented animal populations and their
habitats, connected by migration, is a problem of both theoretical and
practical interest. This paper presents a method for calculating the time
evolution of the habitats' population size distribution from a general
stochastic dynamic within each habitat, using a deterministic approximation
which becomes exact for an infinite number of habitats. Fragmented populations
are usually thought to be characterized by a separation of time scale between,
on the one hand, colonization and extinction of habitats and, on the other
hand, the local population dynamics within each habitat. The analysis in this
paper suggests an alternative view: the effective population dynamic stems from
a law of large numbers, where stochastic fluctuations in population size of
single habitats are buffered through the dispersal pool so that the global
population dynamic remains approximately smooth. For illustration, the
deterministic approximation is compared to simulations of a stochastic model
with density dependent local recruitment and mortality. The article is
concluded with a discussion of the general implications of the results, and
possible extensions of the method.
