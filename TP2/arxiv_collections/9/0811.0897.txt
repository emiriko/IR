The microscopic superconductivity theory in MgB2 systems in the magnetic
fields directed parallel and perpendicular to the plane (ab) is built. The two
energy bands of different dimensions overlapping on the Fermi surface
(two-dimensional sigma- band and three-dimensional pi-band) are taken into
account. The theory is built taking into account the weak dispersion of the
electron energy of sigma -band in z direction. The systems of equations for the
superconductive transition temperature Tc and the upper critical field Hc2(ab)
are obtained. The analytic solutions of the equations for Hc2^0(ab) are found
in the two temperature areas: nearby the zero temperature T<<Tc^0 and in the
vicinity of the superconductive transition temperature Tc^0-T<<Tc^0. The
temperature dependencies of the upper critical fields Hc2(ab) and Hc2(c) on the
temperature are built, and the anisotropy coefficient gammaH=Hc2^0(ab)/Hc2^0(c)
is determined. It is shown that the value of Hc2(ab) exceeds greatly the value
of Hc2(c) due to the system anisotropy (to small values of the average velocity
of electrons in the crystallographic axis direction).
