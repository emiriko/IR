In this article, recent measurements of diffraction in deep inelastic
scattering are presented along with QCD fits to extract the partonic structure
of the exchange. These so-called diffractive parton density functions can then
be used in predictions for other processes to test factorisation in
diffraction. This is an important verification of QCD and has significance for
predicting exotic signals such as diffractive Higgs production at the LHC.
