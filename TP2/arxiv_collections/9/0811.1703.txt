In 2003, Fomin and Zelevinsky obtained Cartan-Killing type classification of
all cluster algebras of finite type, i.e. cluster algebras having only finitely
many distinct cluster variables. A wider class of cluster algebras is formed by
cluster algebras of finite mutation type which have finitely many exchange
matrices (but are allowed to have infinitely many cluster variables). In this
paper we classify all cluster algebras of finite mutation type with
skew-symmetric exchange matrices. Besides cluster algebras of rank 2 and
cluster algebras associated with triangulations of surfaces there are exactly
11 exceptional skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite mutation type. More
precisely, 9 of them are associated with root systems $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$,
$\widetilde E_6$, $\widetilde E_7$, $\widetilde E_8$, $E_6^{(1,1)}$,
$E_7^{(1,1)}$, $E_8^{(1,1)}$; two remaining were recently found by Derksen and
Owen. We also describe a criterion which determines if a skew-symmetric cluster
algebra is of finite mutation type, and discuss growth rate of cluster
algebras.
