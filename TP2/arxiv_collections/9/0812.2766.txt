The phase structure of an eight-fermion interaction model is investigated in
a compact space-time with non-trivial topology, $M^{D-1}\otimes S^1$. The phase
boundary dividing the symmetric and the broken phase is shown as a function of
the space-time dimensions. It is found that the eight-fermion interaction does
not modify the phase boundary for the chiral symmetry breaking.
