Using a dynamical quantum Zeno effect, we propose a general approach to
control the coupling between a two-level system (TLS) and its surroundings, by
modulating the energy level spacing of the TLS with a high frequency signal. We
show that the TLS--surroundings interaction can be turned on or off when the
ratio between the amplitude and the frequency of the modulating field is
adjusted to be a zero of a Bessel function. The quantum Zeno effect of the TLS
can also be observed by the vanishing of the photon reflection at these zeros.
Based on these results, we propose a quantum switch to control the transport of
a single photon in a 1D waveguide. Our analytical results agree well with
numerical results using Floquet theory.
