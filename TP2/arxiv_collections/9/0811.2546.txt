The Local Search algorithm (or Hill Climbing, or Iterative Improvement) is
one of the simplest heuristics to solve the Satisfiability and
Max-Satisfiability problems. It is a part of many satisfiability and
max-satisfiability solvers, where it is used to find a good starting point for
a more sophisticated heuristics, and to improve a candidate solution. In this
paper we give an analysis of Local Search on random planted 3-CNF formulas. We
show that if there is k<7/6 such that the clause-to-variable ratio is less than
k ln(n) (n is the number of variables in a CNF) then Local Search whp does not
find a satisfying assignment, and if there is k>7/6 such that the
clause-to-variable ratio is greater than k ln(n)$ then the local search whp
finds a satisfying assignment. As a byproduct we also show that for any
constant r there is g such that Local Search applied to a random (not
necessarily planted) 3-CNF with clause-to-variable ratio r produces an
assignment that satisfies at least gn clauses less than the maximal number of
satisfiable clauses.
