We investigate spin and orbital states of the two-orbital Hubbard model on a
square lattice by using a variational Monte Carlo method at quarter-filling,
i.e., the electron number per site is one. As a variational wave function, we
consider a Gutzwiller projected wave function of a mean-field type wave
function for a staggered spin and/or orbital ordered state. Then, we evaluate
expectation value of energy for the variational wave functions by using the
Monte Carlo method and determine the ground state. In the strong Coulomb
interaction region, the ground state is the perfect ferromagnetic state with
antiferro-orbital (AF-orbital) order. By decreasing the interaction, we find
that the disordered state becomes the ground state. Although we have also
considered the paramagnetic state with AF-orbital order, i.e., purely orbital
ordered state, and partial ferromagnetic states with and without AF-orbital
order, they do not become the ground state.
