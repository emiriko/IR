In [13], K. Roth showed that the expected value of the $L^2$ discrepancy of
the cyclic shifts of the $N$ point van der Corput set is bounded by a constant
multiple of $\sqrt{\log N}$, thus guaranteeing the existence of a shift with
asymptotically minimal $L^2$ discrepancy, [11]. In the present paper, we
construct a specific example of such a shift.
