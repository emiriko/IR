Magnetic and charge susceptibilities in the Kondo lattice are derived by the
continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT-QMC) method combined with the dynamical
mean-field theory. For a weak exchange coupling J and near half filling of the
conduction band, antiferromagnetic transition occurs as signalled by divergence
of the staggered magnetic susceptibility with lowering temperature. With
increasing J, the Kondo effect suppresses the divergence, and the critical
value of J agrees well with Doniach's estimate which considers the RKKY
interaction as competing with the Kondo effect. For low density of conduction
electrons, a ferromagnetic ordering is observed where Doniach's estimate does
not work. Around quarter filling, a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition is
found. The CDW is interpreted from the strong-coupling limit in terms of
effective repulsion between Kondo singlets.
