We consider particles prepared by the von Neumann-L\"uders projection. For
those particles the standard deviation of the momentum is discussed. We show
that infinite standard deviations are not exceptions but rather typical. A
necessary and sufficient condition for finite standard deviations is given.
Finally, a new uncertainty relation is derived and it is shown that the latter
cannot be improved.
