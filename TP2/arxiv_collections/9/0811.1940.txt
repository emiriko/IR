The current knowledge of the neutron $\beta$-decay lifetime has come under
scrutiny as of late due to large disagreements between recent precise
measurements. Measurements using magnetically trapped Ultra-Cold Neutrons
(UCNs) offer the possibility of storage without spurious losses which can
provide a reliable value for the neutron lifetime. The progress towards
realizing a neutron lifetime measurement using a Ioffe-type trap made with a
Halbach-type permanent octupole magnet is presented here. The experimental
procedure extracts a gas of UCNs into vacuum, which reduces many known channels
of neutron losses, and detects the neutron decays via in-situ detection of the
produced protons.
