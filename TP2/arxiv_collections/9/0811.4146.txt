The focus of this report is the lattice calculation of hadronic parameters
relevant to heavy flavour phenomenology. I will review recent results and the
current status of studies of the B and D decay constants, semileptonic decay
form factors, B^0-\bar B^0 mixing, and determinations of the quark masses m_c
and m_b. Some studies of heavy flavour observables have used current lattice
results to derive Standard Model predictions that seem to disagree with
experimental measurements. That is the case, for example, of sin(2\beta) and
f_{D_s}. This report discusses efforts to resolvethe origin of those
discrepancies from the lattice side.
