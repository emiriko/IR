Coherent nuclear excitation in strongly laser-driven muonic atoms is
calculated. The nuclear transition is caused by the time-dependent Coulomb
field of the oscillating charge density of the bound muon. A closed-form
analytical expression for electric multipole transitions is derived and applied
to various isotopes; the excitation probabilities are in general very small. We
compare the process with other nuclear excitation mechanisms through coupling
with atomic shells and discuss the prospects to observe it in experiment.
