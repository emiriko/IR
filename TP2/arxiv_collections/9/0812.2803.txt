In analogy with conventional quantum mechanics, non-commutative quantum
mechanics is formulated as a quantum system on the Hilbert space of
Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on non-commutative configuration space. It is
argued that the standard quantum mechanical interpretation based on Positive
Operator Valued Measures, provides a sufficient framework for the consistent
interpretation of this quantum system. The implications of this formalism for
rotational and time reversal symmetry are discussed. The formalism is applied
to the free particle and harmonic oscillator in two dimensions and the physical
signatures of non commutativity are identified.
