The paper introduces the notion of off-line justification for Answer Set
Programming (ASP). Justifications provide a graph-based explanation of the
truth value of an atom w.r.t. a given answer set. The paper extends also this
notion to provide justification of atoms during the computation of an answer
set (on-line justification), and presents an integration of on-line
justifications within the computation model of Smodels. Off-line and on-line
justifications provide useful tools to enhance understanding of ASP, and they
offer a basic data structure to support methodologies and tools for debugging
answer set programs. A preliminary implementation has been developed in
ASP-PROLOG.
