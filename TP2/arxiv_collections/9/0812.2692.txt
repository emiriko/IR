In this paper we review our main results for Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV)
semileptonic tau decays and muon-electron conversion in nuclei within the
context of two Constrained SUSY-Seesaw Models, the CMSSM and the NUHM. The
relevant spectrum is that of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model extended
by three right handed neutrinos, $\nu_{R_i}$ and their corresponding SUSY
partners, ${\tilde \nu}_{R_i}$, ($i=1,2,3$). We use the seesaw mechanism for
neutrino mass generation and choose a parameterisation of this mechanism that
allows us to incorporate the neutrino data in our analysis of LFV processes. In
addition to the full one-loop results for the rates of these processes, we will
also review the set of simple formulas, valid at large $\tan \beta$, which are
very useful to compare with present experimental bounds. The sensitivity to
SUSY and Higgs sectors in these processes will also be discussed. This is a
very short summary of the works in Refs. \cite{Arganda:2008jj} and
\cite{Arganda:2007jw} to which we refer the reader for more details.
