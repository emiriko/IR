Motivated by the isomorphism between osp(4|6) superalgebra and D=3 N=6
superconformal algebra we consider the superstring action on the AdS_4 x CP^3
background parametrized by D=3 N=6 super-Poincare and CP^3 coordinates
supplemented by the coordinates corresponoding to dilatation and superconformal
generators. It is also discussed the relation between the degeneracy of
fermionic equations of motion and the action kappa-invariance in the framework
of the supercoset approach.
