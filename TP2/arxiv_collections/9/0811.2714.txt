A brief introduction on the issue of stability in generalized modified
gravity is presented and the dynamical system methods are used in the
investigation of the stability of spatially flat homogeneous cosmologies within
a large class of generalized modified gravity models in the presence of a
relativistic matter-radiation fluid.
