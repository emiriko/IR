A stochastic model is here introduced to investigate the molecular mechanisms
which trigger the perception of pain. The action of analgesic drug compounds is
discussed in a dynamical context, where the competition with inactive species
is explicitly accounted for. Finite size effects inevitably perturb the
mean-field dynamics: Oscillations in the amount of bound receptors
spontaneously manifest, driven by the noise which is intrinsic to the system
under scrutiny. These effects are investigated both numerically, via stochastic
simulations and analytically, through a large-size expansion. The claim that
our findings could provide a consistent interpretative framework to explain the
emergence of cyclic behaviors in response to analgesic treatments, is
substantiated.
