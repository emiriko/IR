Freezing is a fundamental physical phenomenon that has been studied over many
decades; yet the role played by surfaces in determining nucleation has remained
elusive. Here we report direct computational evidence of surface induced
nucleation in supercooled systems with a negative slope of their melting line
(dP/dT < 0). This unexpected result is related to the density decrease
occurring upon crystallization, and to surface tension facilitating the initial
nucleus formation. Our findings support the hypothesis of surface induced
crystallization of ice in the atmosphere, and provide insight, at the atomistic
level, into nucleation mechanisms of widely used semiconductors.
