We present here an overview of the SuperIso program which is a public code
dedicated to the calculation of flavor physics observables in supersymmetry.
The main purpose of the SuperIso program is to provide, by confronting the
theoretical predictions to the experimental data for flavor observables,
indirect constraints on the parameters of supersymmetry. These constraints can
then provide limits on physical masses of yet undiscovered new particles, such
as charged Higgs bosons.
