We consider the effective surface motion of a particle that freely diffuses
in the bulk and intermittently binds to that surface. From an exact approach we
derive various regimes of the effective surface motion characterized by
physical rates for binding/unbinding and the bulk diffusivity. We obtain a
transient regime of superdiffusion and, in particular, a saturation regime
characteristic for the cylindrical geometry. This saturation, however, in a
finite system is not terminal but eventually turns over to normal surface
diffusion. The first passage behavior of particles to the cylinder surface is
derived. Consequences for actual systems are discussed.
