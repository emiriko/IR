$(\alpha,\gamma)$ and $(\alpha$,n) reaction cross sections recently measured
close to the reaction thresholds are rather well described by a previously
developed regional optical potential. Thus, particular features of the
$\alpha$-particle optical potential at energies below the Coulomb barrier,
besides parameters describing $\alpha$-particle elastic scattering at higher
energies are confirmed. Additional limitations of similar statistical model
calculations for minor reaction channels are shown to be most likely due to an
overlooked process or critical values of statistical model parameters around
closed nuclear shells.
