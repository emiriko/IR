We prove asymptotic stability of periodic oscillations in two-bodies
vibrating screen model under assumption that the frequencies w1 and w2 of the
generating system (without obstacle and periodic driving) satisfy the
assumption w1:w2=1:2. We also assume that the frequency of the external
periodic driving equals to w1. These settings correspond to nonlinear resonance
which is a well known phenomenon in industrial implementation of the vibrating
screen. The justification is performed over nonsmooth analog of the second
Bogolyubov's theorem proposed by the author in his previous papers. It is
rigorously proven that the periodic oscillations obtained have two frequencies,
in contrast with the case when the obtacle is absent.
