Spherically symmetric gravity in Ashtekar variables coupled to Yang-Mills
theory in two dimensions and its relation to dilaton gravity and Poisson sigma
models are discussed. After introducing its loop quantization, quantum
corrections for inverse triad components are shown to provide a consistent
deformation without anomalies. The relation to Poisson sigma models provides a
covariant action principle of the quantum corrected theory with effective
couplings. Results are also used to provide loop quantizations of spherically
symmetric models in arbitrary D space-time dimensions.
