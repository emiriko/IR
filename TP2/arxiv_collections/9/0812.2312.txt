By employing the perturbative QCD(pQCD) factorization approach, we calculated
the partial next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions to $B_s \to P P$ decays
($P= \pi, K, \etap $), coming from the QCD vertex corrections, the quark-loops
and the chromo-magnetic penguins. we found numerically that (a) for three
measured decays $\bar{B}_s \to K^+ \pi^-, K^+K^-$ and $\pi^+\pi^-$, the
consistency between the pQCD predictions and the measured values are improved
effectively by the inclusion of the NLO contributions; (b) for $\bar{B}_s \to
K^0\etap$ and $K^0\pi^0$ decays, the NLO enhancements to the branching ratios
can be significant, from $\sim 50%$ to 170%, to be tested by the LHC
experiments; (c) for the CP-violating asymmetries, the leading order pQCD
predictions can also be changed significantly by the inclusion of the NLO
contributions; (d) for $\bar{B}_s \to K^+\pi^-$ decay, the pQCD prediction for
the direct CP asymmetry is $\acp^{dir}(\bar{B}_s \to K^+\pi^-)=0.26\pm 0.06$,
which agrees very well with the only measured value available currently.
