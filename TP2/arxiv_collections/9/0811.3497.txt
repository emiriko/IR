Potentials between static quarks and antiquarks from a few lowest
representations were evaluated in numerical simulations of 4-dimensional pure
G$_2$ lattice gauge theory at various couplings. The obtained potentials are
linearly rising at intermediate distances and their string tensions exhibit
(approximate) Casimir scaling. This result is in accordance with a model of the
vacuum of non-Abelian gauge theories with a domain structure, in which the
(color) magnetic flux randomly fluctuates within a domain, but the total flux
in each domain is quantized in units of the gauge group center.
