The thermochemistry of the carbon clusters C$_n$ (n=2--10) has been revisited
by means of W4 theory and W3.2lite theory. Particularly the larger clusters
exhibit very pronounced post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. Despite this, our
best calculated total atomization energies agree surprisingly well with 1991
estimates obtained from scaled CCD(ST)/6-31G* data. Accurately reproducing the
small singlet-triplet splitting in C$_2$ requires inclusion of connected
quintuple and sextuple excitations. Post-CCSD(T) correlation effects in C$_4$
stabilize the linear form. Linear/cyclic equilibria in C$_6$, C$_8$, and
C$_{10}$ are not strongly affected by connected quadruples, but they are
affected by higher-order triples, which favor polyacetylenic rings but disfavor
cumulenic ones. Near the CCSD(T) basis set limit, C$_{10}$ does undergo bond
angle alternation in the bottom-of-the-well structure, although it is expected
to be absent in the vibrationally averaged structure. The thermochemistry of
these systems, and particularly the longer linear chains, is a particularly
difficult test for density functional methods. Particularly for the smaller
chains and the rings, double-hybrid functionals clearly outperform convential
DFT functionals for these systems. Among compound thermochemistry schemes, G4
clearly outperforms the other members of the G$n$ family. Our best estimates
for total atomization energies at 0 K should be reliable to 1 kJ/mol up to
C$_5$ inclusive, and to better than 1 kcal/mol up to C$_9$ inclusive.
