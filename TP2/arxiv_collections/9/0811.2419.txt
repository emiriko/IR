The large-distance asymptotic behavior of the field-field correlators has
been computed for one-dimensional impenetrable anyons at finite temperatures.
The asymptotic behavior agrees with the predictions of conformal field theory
at low temperatures and reproduces the known results for impenetrable bosons
and free fermions in appropriate limits. We have also obtained an integrable
system of partial nonlinear differential equations which completely
characterizes the 2-point correlation functions. The system is the same as for
bosons but with different initial conditions.
