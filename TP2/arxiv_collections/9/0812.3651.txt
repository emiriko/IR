The aim of the paper is to extend the model of "fishing problem". The simple
formulation is following. The angler goes to fishing. He buys fishing ticket
for a fixed time. There are two places for fishing at the lake. The fishes are
caught according to renewal processes which are different at both places. The
fishes' weights and the inter-arrival times are given by the sequences of
i.i.d. random variables with known distribution functions. These distributions
are different for the first and second fishing place. The angler's satisfaction
measure is given by difference between the utility function dependent on size
of the caught fishes and the cost function connected with time. On each place
the angler has another utility functions and another cost functions. In this
way, the angler's relative opinion about these two places is modeled. For
example, on the one place better sort of fish can be caught with bigger
probability or one of the places is more comfortable. Obviously our angler
wants to have as much satisfaction as possible and additionally he have to
leave the lake before the fixed moment. Therefore his goal is to find two
optimal stopping times in order to maximize his satisfaction. The first time
corresponds to the moment, when he eventually should change the place and the
second time, when he should stop fishing. These stopping times have to be less
than the fixed time of fishing. The value of the problem and the optimal
stopping times are derived.
