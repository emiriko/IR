We study $A$-hypergeometric functions introduced by
Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky and prove a formula for the eigenvalues of their
monodromy automorphisms defined by the analytic continuaions along large loops
contained in complex lines parallel to the coordinate axes. A method of toric
compactifications will be used to prove our main theorem.
