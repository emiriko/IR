Using different experimental techniques combined with density functional
based theoretical methods we have explored the formation of
interface-stabilized manganese oxide structures grown on Pd(100) at
(sub)monolayer coverage. Amongst the multitude of phases experimentally
observed we focus our attention on four structures which can be classified into
two distinct regimes, characterized by different building blocks. Two
oxygen-rich phases are described in terms of MnO(111)-like O-Mn-O trilayers,
whereas the other two have a lower oxygen content and are based on a
MnO(100)-like monolayer structure. The excellent agreement between calculated
and experimental scanning tunneling microscopy images and vibrational electron
energy loss spectra allows for a detailed atomic description of the explored
models.
