Boulat, Saleur and Schmitteckert (BSS) reported results on the full $I-V$
characteristics of the interacting resonant level model (IRLM) exhibiting
region with unexpected negative differential conductance (NDC). Using
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group complemented with the exact
solution performed at a special point (the self-dual point) in the parameter
space BSS have shown that at nonzero Coulomb interaction $U$ the current
flowing through the impurity level (IL) exhibits a power-law asymptotics as a
function of large applied bias voltage. Similar conclusion was earlier reached
by Doyon. Even though their results are solid and supported by both analytic
and numeric arguments, BSS concluded that "the NDC at large voltage seems a
truly nonperturbative behavior, with unclear physical origin". On the contrary,
the remarkable physics of NDC can be explained by simple physical arguments
and, as we shall show in this Comment, in certain circumstances can be
calculated in the framework of perturbation theory.
