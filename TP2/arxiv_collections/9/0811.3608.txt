I analyze the IR fixed point structure of Landau gauge QCD. Precisely the
fixed point with a strong kinematic singularity of the quark-gluon vertex that
proved crucial for the recently proposed confinement mechanism in the quenched
approximation is absent in dynamical QCD. Therefore, the IR singularities do
not induce asymptotic quark confinement but the long-range interaction is
screened by unquenching loops at scales of the order of the quark mass. This
provides the prerequisite for a microscopic description of deconfinement and
string breaking. The fixed points determine the qualitative form of the heavy
quark potential and may be relevant for hot and dense matter.
