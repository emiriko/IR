We show that dark matter could be made of massive gauge bosons whose
stability doesn't require to impose by hand any discrete or global symmetry.
Stability of gauge bosons can be guaranteed by the custodial symmetry
associated to the gauge symmetry and particle content of the model. The
particle content we consider to this end is based on a hidden sector made of a
vector multiplet associated to a non-abelian gauge group and of a scalar
multiplet charged under this gauge group. The hidden sector interacts with the
Standard Model particles through the Higgs portal quartic scalar interaction in
such a way that the gauge bosons behave as thermal WIMPS. This can lead easily
to the observed dark matter relic density in agreement with the other various
constraints, and can be tested experimentally in a large fraction of the
parameter space. In this model the dark matter direct detection rate and the
annihilation cross section can decouple if the Higgs portal interaction is
weak.
