The presence of macroscopic phase separation into superconducting and
magnetic phases in LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ (LFAOF) and CaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsF
(CFCAF) is demonstrated by muon spin rotation (muSR) measurement across their
phase boundaries ($x=0.06$ for LFAOF and $x=0.075$--0.15 for CFCAF). In LFAOF,
both magnetism and superconductivity develop simultaneously below a common
critical temperature, $T_m =~ T_c =~ 18$ K, where the magnetism is
characterized by strong randomness. A similar, but more distinct segregation of
these two phases is observed in CFCAF, where the magnetic phase retains $T_m$
as close to that of the parent compound ($T_c << T_m =~ 80$--120 K) and the
superconducting volume fraction is proportional to the Co content $x$. The
close relationship between magnetism and superconductivity is discussed based
on these experimental observations. Concerning superconducting phase, an
assessment is made on the anisotropy of order parameter in the superconducting
state of LFAOF, CFCAF, and Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (BKFA, $x=0.4$) based on
the temperature dependence of superfluid density [$n_s(T)$] measured by muSR.
The gap parameter, $2\Delta/k_BT_c$, determined from $n_s(T)$ exhibits a
tendency that hole-doped pnictides (BKFA) is much greater than those in
electron-doped ones (LFAOF, CFCAF), suggesting difference in the coupling to
bosons mediating the Cooper pairs between relevant $d$ electron bands.
