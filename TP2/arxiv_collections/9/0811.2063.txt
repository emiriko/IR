We report on new beam-helicity asymmetry measurements (A_h) of the
H(\vec{e},e'p)\gamma reaction in the Delta(1232)$ resonance at Q2=0.20
(GeV/c)2. The measurements were performed at MAMI and were carried out
simultaneously with the measurement of the H(\vec{e},e'p)\pi^0 reaction
channel. It is the lowest Q2 for which the $A_h$ for the virtual Compton
scattering (VCS) reaction has been measured in the first resonance region. The
measured asymmetries have been compared and have been found to be well
described by dispersion-relation (DR) calculations for VCS. The sensitivity of
the data to the Generalized Polarizabilities (GPs) of the proton and to the
amplitudes associated with the nucleon excitation to the Delta(1232) has been
explored through the DR formalism. The measured asymmetries have been found to
exhibit a much higher sensitivity to the GPs while it is suggested that future
measurements of higher statistical precision will offer stronger constraints to
theoretical calculations and will provide valuable insight towards a more
complete understanding of the GPs of the proton and of the pi-N amplitudes.
