We propose a quasi-particle model to describe the lattice QCD equation of
state for pure SU(3) gauge theory in its deconfined state, for $T \ge 1.5T_c$.
The method involves mapping the interaction part of the equation of state to an
effective fugacity of otherwise non-interacting quasi-gluons. We find that this
mapping is exact. Using the quasi-gluon distribution function, we determine the
energy density and the modified dispersion relation for the single particle
energy, in which the trace anomaly is manifest. As an application, we first
determine the Debye mass, and then the important transport parameters, {\it
viz}, the shear viscosity, $\eta$ and the shear viscosity to entropy density
ratio, $\eta/{\mathcal S}$. We find that both $\eta$ and $\eta/{\mathcal S}$
are sensitive to the interactions, and that the interactions significantly
lower both $\eta$ and $\eta/\mathcal S$.
