We consider QCD near but above critical temperature Tc. The pressure,
susceptibilities and the renormalized Polyakov loop -- which is an order
parameter for the deconfining phase transition -- dramatically change up to
temperatures a few times Tc. We refer to this region as a "semi"-QGP, where
partial confinement plays important role. We show that the shear viscosity
,eta, is suppressed by two powers of the Polyakov loop. This suggests that
eta/T^3 decreases markedly as QCD cools down to temperatures near Tc. We also
show a ratio of the viscosity to the entropy becomes small near Tc.
