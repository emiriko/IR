The dynamics of F=1 spinor condensates initially prepared in a double-well
potential is studied in the mean field approach. It is shown that a small seed
of $m=0$ atoms on a system with initially well separated m=1 and m=-1
condensates has a dramatic effect on their mixing dynamics, acting as an
effective barrier for a remarkably long time. We show that this effect is due
to the spinor character of the system, and provides an observable example of
the interplay between the internal spin dynamics and the macroscopic evolution
of the magnetization in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate.
