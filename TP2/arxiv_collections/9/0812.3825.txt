We recently derived the Hamiltonian of fermionic composites by an exact
procedure of bosonization. In the present paper expand this Hamiltonian in the
inverse of the number of fermionic states in the composite wave function and
give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of such an
expansion. We compare the results to the Random phase Approximation and the BCS
theory and perform an illustrative application of the method.
