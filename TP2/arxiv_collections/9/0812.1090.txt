We prove that integral blocks of parabolic category O associated to the
subalgebra gl(m) x gl(n) of gl(m+n) are Morita equivalent to quasi-hereditary
covers of generalised Khovanov algebras. Although this result is in principle
known, the existing proof is quite indirect, going via perverse sheaves on
Grassmannians. Our new approach is completely algebraic, exploiting Schur-Weyl
duality for higher levels. As a by-product we get a concrete combinatorial
construction of 2-Kac-Moody representations in the sense of Rouquier
corresponding to level two weights in finite type A.
