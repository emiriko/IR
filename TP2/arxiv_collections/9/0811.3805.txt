Polyhedral nanocrystals of <alpha>-Fe2O3 are successfully synthesized by
annealing FeCl3 on silicon substrate at 1000 oC in the presence of H2 gas
diluted with argon (Ar). Uniformly shaped polyhedral nanoparticles (diameter
~50-100 nm) are observed at 1000 oC and gases flow rate such as; Ar = 200
ml/min and H2 = 150 ml/min. Non-uniform shaped nanoparticles (diameter ~ 20-70
nm) are also observed at an annealing temperature of 950 oC with lower gases
flow rate (Ar = 100 ml/min and H2 = 75 ml/min). Nanoparticles are characterized
in detail by field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive
x-ray (EDX) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
techniques. HRTEM study shows well resolved (110) fringes corresponding to
<alpha>-Fe2O3, and selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) confirms the
crystalline nature of <alpha>-Fe2O3 polyhedral nanoparticles. It is observed
that polyhedral formation of <alpha>-Fe2O3 nano crystals depends upon annealing
temperature and the surface morphology highly rely on the gas flow rate inside
the reaction chamber.
