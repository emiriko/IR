The London penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ has been measured in single
crystals of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ using the tunnel diode
resonator technique. The measured doping levels of $x=$~0.038, 0.047, 0.058,
0.074 and 0.10 range from underdoped to overdoped concentrations. The
measurements have shown that the density of carriers participating in
superconductivity decreases sharply in the underdoped regime, but the
penetration depth as a function of temperature exhibits a robust power law,
$\Delta\lambda(T)\sim T^{n}$, for all measured dopings, with $n$ between 2 and
2.5. We discuss the implications of these results and possible interpretations
of such robust behavior.
