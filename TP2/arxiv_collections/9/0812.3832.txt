A quantum ensemble $\{(p_x, \rho_x)\}$ is a set of quantum states each
occurring randomly with a given probability. Quantum ensembles are necessary to
describe situations with incomplete a priori information, such as the output of
a stochastic quantum channel (generalized measurement), and play a central role
in quantum communication. In this paper, we propose measures of distance and
fidelity between two quantum ensembles. We consider two approaches: the first
one is based on the ability to mimic one ensemble given the other one as a
resource and is closely related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation
problem, while the second one uses the idea of extended-Hilbert-space (EHS)
representations which introduce auxiliary pointer (or flag) states. Both types
of measures enjoy a number of desirable properties. The Kantorovich measures,
albeit monotonic under deterministic quantum operations, are not monotonic
under generalized measurements. In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present
operational interpretations for both types of measures. We also show that the
EHS fidelity between ensembles provides a novel interpretation of the fidelity
between mixed states--the latter is equal to the maximum of the fidelity
between all pure-state ensembles whose averages are equal to the mixed states
being compared. We finally use the new measures to define distance and fidelity
for stochastic quantum channels and positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
These quantities may be useful in the context of tomography of stochastic
quantum channels and quantum detectors.
