This paper investigates the spinodal behavior of non-thermal damage
phenomena. As an example, a non-thermal fiber-bundle model with the global
uniform (meanfield) load sharing is considered. In the vicinity of the spinodal
point the power-law scaling behavior is found. For the meanfield fiber-bundle
model the spinodal exponents are found to have typical meanfield values.
