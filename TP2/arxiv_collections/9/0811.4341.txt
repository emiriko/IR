In this paper we introduce the notion of enlargement of a positive set in SSD
spaces. To a maximally positive set $A$ we associate a family of enlargements
$\E(A)$ and characterize the smallest and biggest element in this family with
respect to the inclusion relation. We also emphasize the existence of a
bijection between the subfamily of closed enlargements of $\E(A)$ and the
family of so-called representative functions of $A$. We show that the extremal
elements of the latter family are two functions recently introduced and studied
by Stephen Simons. In this way we extend to SSD spaces some former results
given for monotone and maximally monotone sets in Banach spaces.
