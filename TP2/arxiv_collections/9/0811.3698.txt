Motivated to simplify the structure of tensor representations we give a new
set of generators for the Yangian $Y(sl(n))$ using the principal realization in
simple Lie algebras. The isomorphism between our new basis and the standard
Cartan-Weyl basis is also given. We show by example that the principal basis
simplifies the Yangian action significantly in the tensor product of the
fundamental representation and its dual.
