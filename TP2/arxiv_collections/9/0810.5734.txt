The notion of simple compact quantum group is introduced. As non-trivial
(noncommutative and noncocommutative) examples, the following families of
compact quantum groups are shown to be simple: (a) The universal quantum groups
$B_u(Q)$ for $Q \in GL(n, {\mathbb C})$ satisfying $Q \bar{Q} = \pm I_n$, $n
\geq 2$; (b) The quantum automorphism groups $A_{aut}(B, \tau)$ of finite
dimensional $C^*$-algebras $B$ endowed with the canonical trace $\tau$ %endowed
with a tracial functional $tr$ when $\dim(B) \geq 4$, including the quantum
permutation groups $A_{aut}(X_n)$ on $n$ points ($n \geq 4$); (c) The standard
deformations $K_q$ of simple compact Lie groups $K$ and their twists $K_q^u$,
as well as Rieffel's deformation $K_J$.
