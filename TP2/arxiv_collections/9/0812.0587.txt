We present a model for electron- and neutrino-scattering off nucleons and
nuclei focussing on the quasielastic and resonance region. The lepton-nucleon
reaction is described within a relativistic formalism that includes, besides
quasielastic scattering, the excitation of 13 N* and Delta resonances and a
non-resonant single-pion background. Recent electron-scattering data is used
for the state-of-the-art parametrizations of the vector form factors; the axial
couplings are determined via PCAC and, in the case of the Delta resonance, the
axial form factor is refitted using neutrino-scattering data. Scattering off
nuclei is treated within the GiBUU framework that takes into account various
nuclear effects: the local density approximation for the nuclear ground state,
mean-field potentials and in-medium spectral functions. Results for inclusive
scattering off Oxygen are presented and, in the case of electron-induced
reactions, compared to experimental data and other models.
