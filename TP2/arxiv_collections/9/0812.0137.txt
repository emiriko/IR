In this paper we investigate the magnetic state and the role of the
crystalline structure in RuSr2Eu1.5Ce0.5Cu2O10 (Ru-1222). Measurements were
made in the isomorphic series (Nb1-xRux)Sr2Eu1.5Ce0.5Cu2O10 [(Nb,Ru)-1222],
with x between 0 and 1. 3D XY fluctuations above the magnetic transition were
not observed in Ru-1222, suggesting a weak inter-plane coupling between the
RuO2 layers. The compositional dependence of the magnetic susceptibility shows
a rapid broadening with increasing Nb content, explained in terms of a
cluster-glass state. The variation of several superconducting parameters as a
function of Ru content is linear in the whole concentration range, with no
jumps at the critical concentration for which percolation of long range order
is expected. 3D Arrhenius and Vogel-Fulcher-type dependencies fail to describe
the dynamic properties. Fitting of a generalized Vogel-Fulcher-type dependence,
with ln(tau/tau0) = A(T-T0)^-B, yield B = 2.0, in excellent agreement with
Monte Carlo simulations for 2D systems. The value deduced for T0 agrees well
with the re-opening of hysteresis in the M(H) curves. The observed
superconducting and magnetic features are explained in terms of a scenario of
2D magnetic islands at the RuO2 layers, with no long range magnetic order.
