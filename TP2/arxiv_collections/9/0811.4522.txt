We propose a conjecture on special values of $ L $-functions in a function
field context with positive characteristic coefficients.
  For $ M $ a uniformizable $ t $-motive with everywhere good reduction we
conjecture a relation between the value of the Goss $ L $-function $ L(M^\vee,
s) $ at $ s = 0 $ and the uniformization of the abelian $ t $-module associated
with $ M $.
  When $ M $ is a power of the Carlitz $ t $-motive the conjecture specializes
to a theorem of Anderson and Thakur on Carlitz zeta values. Beyond this case we
present numerical evidence.
