Bose gas in a random external field is considered. The sigma model like
effective action both for weak and strong random fields compared with the
interaction between particles is derived by averaging over the random field and
integration over the quantum fluctuations in the framework of the
Keldysh-Schwinger technique for irreversible processes. Using this effective
action the properties of the system in strongly fluctuating random field are
analyzed.
