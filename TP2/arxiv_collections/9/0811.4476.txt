A systematic method to construct the complete set of conserved quantities of
the Haldane-Shastry type spin chains is proposed. The hidden relationship
between the Yang-Baxter relation and the conservation laws of the long-range
interacting integrable models is exposed explicitly. An integrable anisotropic
Haldane-Shastry model is also constructed.
