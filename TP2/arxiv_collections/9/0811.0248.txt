The antiferromagnetic phase of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
(3D) Hubbard model with nearest neighbors hopping is studied on a bipartite
cubic lattice by means of the quantum SU(2)xU(1) rotor approach that yields a
fully self-consistent treatment of the antiferromagnetic state that respects
the symmetry properties the model and satisfy the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The
collective variables for charge and spin are isolated in the form of the
space-time fluctuating U(1) phase field and rotating spin quantization axis
governed by the SU(2) symmetry, respectively. As a result interacting electrons
appear as a composite objects consisting of bare fermions with attached U(1)
and SU(2) gauge fields. An effective action consisting of a spin-charge rotor
and a fermionic fields is derived as a function of the Coulomb repulsion U and
hopping parameter t. At zero temperature, our theory describes the evolution
from a Slater (U<<t) to a Mott-Heisenberg (U>>t) antiferromagnet. The results
for zero-temperature sublatice magnetization (2D) and finite temperature (3D)
phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Hubbard model as a function of the
crossover parameter U/t are presented and the role of the spin Berry phase in
the interaction driven crossover is analyzed.
