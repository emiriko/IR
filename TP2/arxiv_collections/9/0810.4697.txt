Water wave propagation can be attenuated by various physical mechanisms. One
of the main sources of wave energy dissipation lies in boundary layers. The
present work is entirely devoted to thorough analysis of the dispersion
relation of the novel visco-potential formulation. Namely, in this study we
relax all assumptions of the weak dependence of the wave frequency on time. As
a result, we have to deal with complex integro-differential equations that
describe transient behaviour of the phase and group velocities. Using numerical
computations, we show several snapshots of these important quantities at
different times as functions of the wave number. Good qualitative agreement
with previous study [Dutykh2009] is obtained. Thus, we validate in some sense
approximations made anteriorly. There is an unexpected conclusion of this
study. According to our computations, the bottom boundary layer creates
disintegrating modes in the group velocity. In the same time, the imaginary
part of the phase velocity remains negative for all times. This result can be
interpreted as a new kind of instability which is induced by the bottom
boundary layer effect.
