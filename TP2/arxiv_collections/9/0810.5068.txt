We compute the leading chiral-logarithmic corrections to the S parameter in
the four-site Higgsless model. In addition to the usual electroweak gauge
bosons of the Standard Model, this model contains two sets of heavy charged and
neutral gauge bosons. In the continuum limit, the latter gauge bosons can be
identified with the first excited Kaluza-Klein states of the W^\pm and Z bosons
of a warped extra-dimensional model with an SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times
U(1)_X bulk gauge symmetry. We consider delocalized fermions and show that the
delocalization parameter must be considerably tuned from its tree-level ideal
value in order to reconcile experimental constraints with the one-loop results.
Hence, the delocalization of fermions does not solve the problem of large
contributions to the S parameter in this class of theories and significant
contributions to S can potentially occur at one-loop.
