We demonstrate that voltage-controlled negative index can be obtained in
self-organized InAs quantum dot systems. As the bias voltage changes, the
refractive index can be adjusted and controlled continuously from -7 to 7.
Simultaneously, the absorption of light in the system will be very small. The
single-negative index materials and the double-negative index materials can be
achieved in different bias voltages.
