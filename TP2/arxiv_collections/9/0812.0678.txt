Path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (and also other equivalent
formulations) depends on a Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian function that is
chosen to describe the underlying classical system. The arbitrariness presented
in this choice leads to a phenomenon called Quantization ambiguity. For example
both $L_1=\dot{q}^2$ and $L_2=e^\dot{q}$ are suitable Lagrangians on a
classical level ($\delta L_1=0=\delta L_2$), but quantum mechanically they are
diverse. This paper presents a simple rearrangement of the path integral to a
surface functional integral. It is shown that the surface functional integral
formulation gives transition probability amplitude which is free of any
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian and requires just the underlying classical equations of
motion. A simple example examining the functionality of the proposed method is
considered.
