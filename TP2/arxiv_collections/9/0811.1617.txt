We report a systematic investigation of Ba[Fe(1-x)Co(x)]2As2 based on
transport and 75-As NMR measurements, and establish the electronic phase
diagram. We demonstrate that doping progressively suppresses the uniform spin
susceptibility and low frequency spin fluctuations. The optimum superconducting
phase emerges at x_c~0.08 when the tendency toward spin ordering completely
diminishes. Our findings point toward the presence of a quantum critical point
near x_c between the SDW (spin density wave) and superconducting phases.
