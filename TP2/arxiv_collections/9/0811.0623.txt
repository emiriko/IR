A system comprised of an elastic solid and its response to an external random
force sequence is shown to behave based on the principles of the theory of
algorithmic complexity and randomness. The solid distorts the randomness of an
input force sequence in a way proportional to its algorithmic complexity. We
demonstrate this by numerical analysis of a one-dimensional vibrating elastic
solid (the system) on which we apply a maximally random input force. The level
of complexity of the system is controlled via external parameters. The output
response is the field of displacements observed at several positions on the
body. The algorithmic complexity and stochasticity of the resulting output
displacement sequence is measured and compared against the complexity of the
system. The results show that the higher the system complexity the more
random-deficient the output sequence. This agrees with the theory introduced in
[16] which states that physical systems such as this behave as algorithmic
selection-rules which act on random actions in their surroundings.
