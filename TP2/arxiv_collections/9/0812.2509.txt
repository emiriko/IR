The current driven magnetisation dynamics of a helical spin-density wave is
investigated. Expressions for calculating the spin-transfer torque of real
systems from first principles density functional theory are presented. These
expressions are used for calculating the spin-transfer torque for the spin
spirals of Er and fcc Fe at two different lattice volumes. It is shown that the
calculated torque induces a rigid rotation of the order parameter with respect
to the spin spiral axis. The torque is found to depend on the wave vector of
the spin spiral and the spin-polarisation of the Fermi surface states. The
resulting dynamics of the spin spiral is also discussed.
