Here we give a more detailed account of the part of the conference report
that was devoted to reinterpreting the Einstein `unified models of gravity and
electromagnetism' (1923) as the unified theory of dark energy (cosmological
constant) and dark matter (neutral massive vector particle having only
gravitational interactions). After summarizing Einstein's work and related
earlier work of Weyl and Eddington, we present an approach to finding
spherically symmetric solutions of the simplest variant of the Einstein models
that was earlier mentioned in Weyl's work as an example of his generalization
of general relativity. The spherically symmetric static solutions and
homogeneous cosmological models are considered in some detail. As the theory is
not integrable we study approximate solutions. In the static case, we show that
there may exist two horizons and derive solutions near the horizons. In
cosmology, we propose to study the corresponding expansions of possible
solutions near the origin and derive these expansions in a simplified model
neglecting anisotropy. The structure of the solutions seems to hint at a
possibility of an inflation mechanism that does not require adding scalar
fields.
