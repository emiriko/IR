This paper is devoted to the study of the processes e^+e^- \to J/\Psi \eta_c,
J/\Psi \eta_c', \psi' \eta_c, \psi' \eta_c' within light cone formalism. It is
shown that if one disregards the contribution of higher fock states, the
twist-3 distribution amplitudes needed in the calculation can be unambiguously
determined from the twist-2 distribution amplitudes and equations of motion.
Using models of the twist-2 distribution amplitudes the cross sections of the
processes under study have been calculated. The results of the calculation are
in agreement with Belle and BaBar experiments. It is also shown that
relativistic and radiative corrections to the cross sections play crucial role
in the achievement of the agreement between the theory and experiments. The
comparison of the results of this paper with the results obtained in other
papers has been carried out. In particular, it is shown that the results of
papers where relativistic and radiative corrections were calculated within
NRQCD are overestimated by a factor of ~1.5.
