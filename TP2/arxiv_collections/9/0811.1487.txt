We computed by a modified tight binding approximation, the total electronic
energy of three different hybrid polymers: $H-SiO_2$, $CH_3-SiO_2$ and
$C_6H_5-SiO_2$. We made the hypothesis that the structures of these polymers
are amorphous. Computational results regarding the total electronic energy and
experimental data \cite{ferchichi} on the toughness of these three hybrid
polymers were compared. A good qualitative agreement was found between
computations and experiments.
