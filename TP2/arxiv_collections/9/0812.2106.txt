We investigate gauge coupling unification at 2-loops for theories with 5
extra vectorlike SU(5) fundamentals added to the MSSM. This is a borderline
case where unification is only predicted in certain regions of parameter space.
We establish a lower bound on the scale for the masses of the extra flavors, as
a function of the sparticle masses. Models far outside of the bound do not
predict unification at all (but may be compatible with unification), and models
outside but near the boundary cannot reliably claim to predict it with an
accuracy comparable to the MSSM prediction. Models inside the boundary can work
just as well as the MSSM.
