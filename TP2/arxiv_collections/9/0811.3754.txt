We investigate the quantum phase transition in the random transverse-field
Ising model under the influence of Ohmic dissipation. To this end, we
numerically implement a strong-disorder renormalization-group scheme. We find
that Ohmic dissipation destroys the quantum critical point and the associated
quantum Griffiths phase by smearing. Our results quantitatively confirm a
recent theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 100}, 240601 (2008)] of smeared quantum
phase transitions.
