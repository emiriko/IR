We analyze a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) obtained by adding a
complex singlet to the scalar sector (cxSM). We show that the cxSM can contain
one or two viable cold dark matter candidates and analyze the conditions on the
parameters of the scalar potential that yield the observed relic density. When
the cxSM potential contains a global U(1) symmetry that is both softly and
spontaneously broken, it contains both a viable dark matter candidate and the
ingredients necessary for a strong first order electroweak phase transition as
needed for electroweak baryogenesis. We also study the implications of the
model for discovery of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider.
