In this paper, we study metrics of quantum states. These metrics are natural
generalization of trace metric and Bures metric. We will prove that the metrics
are joint convex and contractive under quantum operation. Our results can find
important application in studying the geometry of quantum states and is useful
to detect entanglement.
