The black hole information paradox is one of the most important issues in
theoretical physics. We review some recent progress using string theory in
understanding the nature of black hole microstates. For all cases where these
microstates have been constructed, one finds that they are horizon sized
`fuzzballs'. Most computations are for extremal states, but recently one has
been able to study a special family of non-extremal microstates, and see
`information carrying radiation' emerge from these gravity solutions. We
discuss how the fuzzball picture can resolve the information paradox. We use
the nature of fuzzball states to make some conjectures on the dynamical aspects
of black holes, observing that the large phase space of fuzzball solutions can
make the black hole more `quantum' than assumed in traditional treatments.
