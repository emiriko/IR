A type of coupled variable coefficient modified Korteweg-de Vries system is
derived from a two-layered fluid system. It is known that the formation,
maintenance, and collapse of an atmospheric blocking are always related with
large-scale weather or shorts term climate anomalies. One special analytical
solution of the obtained system successfully features the evolution cycle of an
atmospheric monopole type blocking event. In particular, our theoretical
results captures a real monopole type blocking case happened during 19 Feb 2008
to 26 Feb 2008 can be well described by our analytical solution.
