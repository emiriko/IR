Recent concept of integrable nonholonomic deformation found for the KdV
equation is extended to the mKdV equation and generalized to the AKNS system.
For the deformed mKdV equation we find a matrix Lax pair, a novel two-fold
integrable hierarchy and exact N-soliton solutions exhibiting unusual
accelerating motion. We show that both the deformed KdV and mKdV systems
possess infinitely many generalized symmetries, conserved quantities and a
recursion operator.
