We present a model of high energy soft $pp$ interactions that has multi s-
and t-channel components, which has been tuned to describe all the available
data. The t-channel components allow matching of the soft to the hard (QCD)
Pomeron. Absorptive effects are found to be large, and, for example, suppress
the prediction of the total $pp$ cross section to about 90 mb at the LHC. We
use the model to calculate the survival probability, S^2, of the rapidity gaps
in the exclusive process pp \to p+H+p, a process with great advantages for
searching for the H \to \bb signal. We consider both eikonal and enhanced
rescattering.
