A quantum-mechanical framework is set up to describe the full counting
statistics of particles flowing between reservoirs in an open system under
time-dependent driving. A symmetry relation is obtained which is the
consequence of microreversibility for the probability of the nonequilibrium
work and the transfer of particles and energy between the reservoirs. In some
appropriate long-time limit, the symmetry relation leads to a steady-state
quantum fluctuation theorem for the currents between the reservoirs. On this
basis, relationships are deduced which extend the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity
relations to the nonlinear response coefficients.
