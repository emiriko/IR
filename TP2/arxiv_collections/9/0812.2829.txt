The PEN Collaboration is conducting a new measurement of the pi+ -> e+ nu
branching ratio at the Paul Scherrer Institute, with the goal uncertainty of
delta B/B(pie2)=5E-4 or lower. At present, the combined accuracy of all
published pie2 decay measurements lags behind the theoretical calculation by a
factor of 40. In this contribution we report on the PEN detector configuration
and its performance during two development runs done in 2007 and 2008.
