Recent angle resolved photoemission \cite{yang-nature-08} and scanning
tunneling microscopy \cite{kohsaka-nature-08} measurements on underdoped
cuprates have yielded new spectroscopic information on quasiparticles in the
pseudogap phase. New features of the normal state such as particle-hole
asymmetry, maxima in the energy dispersion and accompanying drops in the
spectral weight of quasiparticles agree with the ansatz of Yang \textit{et al.}
for the single particle propagator in the pseudogap phase. The coherent
quasiparticle dispersion and reduced asymmetry in the tunneling density of
states in the superconducting state can also be described by this propagator.
