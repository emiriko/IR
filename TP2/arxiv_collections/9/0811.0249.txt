We look for local unitary operators $W_1 \otimes W_2$ which would rotate all
equally entangled two-qubit pure states by the same but arbitrary amount. It is
shown that all two-qubit maximally entangled states can be rotated through the
same but arbitrary amount by local unitary operators. But there is no local
unitary operator which can rotate all equally entangled non-maximally entangled
states by the same amount, unless it is unity. We have found the optimal sets
of equally entangled non-maximally entangled states which can be rotated by the
same but arbitrary amount via local unitary operators $W_1 \otimes W_2$, where
at most one these two operators can be identity. In particular, when $W_1 = W_2
= (i/\sqrt{2})({\sigma}_x + {\sigma}_y)$, we get the local quantum NOT
operation. Interestingly, when we apply the one-sided local depolarizing map,
we can rotate all equally entangled two-qubit pure states through the same
amount. We extend our result for the case of three-qubit maximally entangled
state.
