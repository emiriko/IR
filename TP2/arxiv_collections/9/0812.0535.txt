We describe the Bose-Einstein condensate of magnetic bosonic quasiparticles
in insulating spin systems using a phenomenological standard functional method
for T = 0. We show that results that are already known from advanced
computational techniques immediately follow. The inclusion of a perturbative
anisotropy term that violates the axial symmetry allows us to remarkably well
explain a number of experimental features of the dimerized spin-1/2 system
TlCuCl3. Based on an energetic argument we predict a general intrinsic
instability of an axially symmetric magnetic condensate towards a violation of
this symmetry, which leads to the spontaneous formation of an anisotropy gap in
the energy spectrum above the critical field. We, therefore, expect that a true
Goldstone mode in insulating spin systems, i.e., a strictly linear
energy-dispersion relation down to arbitrarily small excitations energies,
cannot be observed in any real material.
