In this lecture I give an introduction to technicolor and extended
technicolor theories. I discuss the issues models of dynamical electroweak
symmetry breaking struggle with and propose how non QCD-like dynamics, such as
a `walking' or nearly-conformal technicolor coupling, can invalidate many
conventional arguments against technicolor. I provide a short discussion of
AdS/CFT-inspired extra-dimensional (Higgsless) models and their similarities
and differences with older 4D technicolor models. To conclude, a summary of
some possible LHC signatures is given.
