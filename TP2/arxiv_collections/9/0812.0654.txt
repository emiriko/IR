The infrared behaviour of QCD Green's functions in Landau gauge has been
focus of intense study. Different non-perturbative approaches lead to a
prediction in line with the conditions for confinement in local quantum field
theory as spelled out in the Kugo-Ojima criterion. Detailed comparisons with
lattice studies have revealed small but significant differences, however. But
aren't we comparing apples with oranges when contrasting lattice Landau gauge
simulations with these continuum results? The answer is yes, and we need to
change that. We therefore propose a reformulation of Landau gauge on the
lattice which will allow us to perform gauge-fixed Monte-Carlo simulations
matching the continuum methods of local field theory which will thereby be
elevated to a non-perturbative level at the same time.
