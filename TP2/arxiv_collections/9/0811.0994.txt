Ageing of organic glasses to the equilibrium liquid state is studied by
measuring the dielectric loss utilizing a microregulator where temperature is
controlled by means of a Peltier element. Compared to conventional equipment
the new device adds almost two orders of magnitude to the span of observable
ageing times. Data for five organic glass-forming liquids are presented. The
existence of an "inner clock" is confirmed by a model-free test showing that
the ageing of structure is controlled by the same material time that controls
the dielectric properties. At long times relaxation is not stretched, but
simple exponential, and there is no "expansion gap" between the limits of the
relaxation rates following up and down jumps to the same temperature.
