We have developed a silicon pixel detector to enhance the physics
capabilities of the PHENIX experiment. This detector, consisting of two layers
of sensors, will be installed around the beam pipe at the collision point and
covers a pseudo-rapidity of | \eta | < 1.2 and an azimuth angle of | \phi | ~
2{\pi}. The detector uses 200 um thick silicon sensors and readout chips
developed for the ALICE experiment. In order to meet the PHENIX DAQ readout
requirements, it is necessary to read out 4 readout chips in parallel. The
physics goals of PHENIX require that radiation thickness of the detector be
minimized. To meet these criteria, the detector has been designed and
developed. In this paper, we report the current status of the development,
especially the development of the low-mass readout bus and the front-end
readout electronics.
