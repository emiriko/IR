The negativity of a given state's Wigner function has been proposed as a
measure of quantumness of that state in a unipartite system. This otherwise
physically intuitive and useful phase-space measure however does not yield the
right correspondence principle limit, and also turns out to yield infinite
values for the infinite square well. We show that both these issues can be
sensibly resolved using coarse-graining of the Wigner function.
