Transport measurements on an etched graphene nanoribbon are presented. It is
shown that two distinct voltage scales can be experimentally extracted that
characterize the parameter region of suppressed conductance at low charge
density in the ribbon. One of them is related to the charging energy of
localized states, the other to the strength of the disorder potential. The
lever arms of gates vary by up to 30% for different localized states which must
therefore be spread in position along the ribbon. A single-electron transistor
is used to prove the addition of individual electrons to the localized states.
In our sample the characteristic charging energy is of the order of 10 meV, the
characteristic strength of the disorder potential of the order of 100 meV.
