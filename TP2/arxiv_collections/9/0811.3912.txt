One more mode developed to get eigen energies and states for the one-electron
Dirac's equation with spherically symmetric bound potential. For the particular
case of the Coulomb potential it was shown that the method is free of so called
spurious states. The procedure could be adapted to receive highly exited states
with great precision.
