We investigate a version of the abelian Higgs model with a non-standard
kinetic term (K field theory) in 2+1 dimensions. The existence of vortex type
solutions with compact support (topological compactons) is established by a
combination of analytical and numerical methods. This result demonstrates that
the concept of compact solitons in K field theories can be extended to higher
dimensions.
