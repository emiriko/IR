In this work we present the results of theoretical analysis of the de
Haas-van Alphen oscillations in quasi-two-dimensional conductors. We have been
studying the effect of the Fermi-liquid correlations of charge carriers on the
above oscillations. It was shown that at reasonably low temperatures and weak
electron scattering the Fermi-liquid interactions may cause noticeable changes
in both amplitude and shape of the oscillations even at realistically small
values of the Fermi-liquid parameters. Also, we show that the Fermi-liquid
interactions in the system of the charge carriers may cause magnetic
instability of a quasi-two-dimensional conductor near the peaks of quantum
oscillations in the electron density of states at the Fermi surface, indicating
the possibility for the diamagnetic phase transition within the relevant ranges
of the applied magnetic fields.
