The hadronic correlation among particle-antiparticle pairs was highlighted in
the late 1990's, culminating with the demonstration that it should exist if the
masses of the hadrons were modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high
energy heavy ion collisions. They were called Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC)
of particle-antiparticle pairs, also known as squeezed correlations. However,
even though they are well-established theoretically, such hadronic correlations
have not yet been experimentally discovered. Expecting to compel the
experimentalists to search for this effect, we suggest here a clear way to look
for the BBC signal, by constructing the squeezed correlation function of
phi-phi and K+K- pairs at RHIC energies, plotted in terms of the average
momentum of the pair, K12=(k1+k2)/2, inspired by procedures adopted in
Hanbury-Brown & Twiss (HBT) correlations.
