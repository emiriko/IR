A ternary ferrimagnetic half-metal, constructed through substituting 25% Fe
for Mn in zincblende semiconductor MnTe, is predicted in terms of accurate
first-principles calculations. It has a large half-metallic (HM) gap of 0.54eV
and its ferrimagnetic order is very stable against other magnetic fluctuations.
The HM ferrimagnetism is formed because the complete moment compensation in the
antiferromagnetic MnTe is replaced by an uncomplete one in the Fe-substituted
MnTe. This should make a novel approach to new HM materials. The half-metal
could be fabricated because Fe has good affinity with Mn, and useful for
spintronics.
