We numerically study the superconductor-insulator phase transition in a model
disordered 2D superconductor as a function of applied magnetic field. The
calculation involves quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the (2+1)D XY model in
the presence of both disorder and magnetic field. The XY coupling is assumed to
have the form -J\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j-A_{ij}), where A_{ij} has a mean of zero
and a standard deviation \Delta A_{ij}. In a real system, such a model would be
approximately realized by a 2D array of small Josephson-coupled grains with
slight spatial disorder and a uniform applied magnetic field. The different
values \Delta A_{ij} then corresponds to an applied field such that the average
number of flux quanta per plaquette has various integer values N: larger N
corresponds to larger \Delta A_{ij}. For any value of \Delta A_{ij}, there
appears to be a critical coupling constant K_c(\Delta
A_{ij})=\sqrt{[J/(2U)]_c}, where U is the charging energy, above which the
system is a Mott insulator; there is also a corresponding critical conductivity
\sigma^*(\Delta A_{ij}) at the transition. For \Delta A_{ij}=\infty, the order
parameter of the transition is a renormalized coupling constant g. Using a
numerical technique appropriate for disordered systems, we show that the
transition at this value of \Delta A_{ij} takes place from an insulating (I)
phase to a Bose glass (BG) phase, and that the dynamical critical exponent
characterizing this transition is z \sim 1.3. By contrast, z=1 for this model
at \Delta A_{ij}=0. We suggest that the superconductor to insulator transition
is actually of this I to BG class at all nonzero \Delta A_{ij}'s, and we
support this interpretation by both numerical evidence and an analytical
argument based on the Harris criterion.
