We outline a general framework to determine the effect of non-equilibrium
fluctuations on driven collective coordinates, and apply it to a current-driven
domain wall in a nanocontact. In this case the collective coordinates are the
domain-wall position and its chirality, that give rise to momentum transfer and
spin transfer, respectively. We determine the current-induced fluctuations
corresponding to these processes and show that at small frequencies they can be
incorporated by two separate effective temperatures. As an application, the
average time to depin the domain wall is calculated and found to be lowered by
current-induced fluctuations. It is shown that current-induced fluctuations
play an important role for narrow domain walls, especially at low temperatures.
