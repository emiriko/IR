We discuss effects of two-photon exchange (TPE) in various observables of the
elastic ep-scattering. The imaginary part of the TPE amplitude manifests in
target and beam normal spin asymmetries. The real part contributes to the
cross-section. A model-independent phenomenological analysis of experimental
data is performed. Its results are compared with theoretical calculations.
