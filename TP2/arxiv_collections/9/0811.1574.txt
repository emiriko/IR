We develop the homology theory of the algebra of a regular semigroup, which
is a particularly nice case of a quasi-hereditary algebra in good
characteristic. Directedness is characterized for these algebras, generalizing
the case of semisimple algebras studied by Munn and Ponizovksy. We then apply
homological methods to compute (modulo group theory) the quiver of a right
regular band of groups, generalizing Saliola's results for a right regular
band. Right regular bands of groups come up in the representation theory of
wreath products with symmetric groups in much the same way that right regular
bands appear in the representation theory of finite Coxeter groups via the
Solomon-Tits algebra of its Coxeter complex. In particular, we compute the
quiver of Hsiao's algebra, which is related to the Mantaci-Reutenauer descent
algebra.
