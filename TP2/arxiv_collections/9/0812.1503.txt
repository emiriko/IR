Standard practice attempts to remove coordinate influence in physics through
the use of invariant equations. Trans-coordinate physics proceeds differently
by not introducing space-time coordinates in the first place. Differentials
taken from a novel limiting process are defined for a particle's wave function,
allowing the particle's dynamic principle to operate locally without the use of
coordinates. These differentials replace the covariant differentials of
Riemannian geometry. With coordinates out of the way regional conservation
principles and the Einstein field equation are no longer fundamentally defined;
although they are constructible along with coordinate systems so they continue
to be analytically useful. Gravity waves as presently understood are not
defined, so we conclude that the gravitational detectors LIGO and Weber bar
will not work. We assume that gravitons alone are fundamentally responsible for
gravity. It is shown how gravitational uncertainty can be reconciled with the
certainty of quantum mechanical dynamics. Keywords: covariance, invariance,
