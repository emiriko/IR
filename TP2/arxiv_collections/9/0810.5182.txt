We have analyzed data of the DISTO experiment on the exclusive pp to K^+
Lambda p process at T_p = 2.85$ GeV to search for a K^-pp (= X) nuclear bound
state to be formed in the pp to K^+ + X reaction. The deviation spectra of the
K^+ missing-mass MM (K^+) and Lambda p invariant-mass M(Lambda-p) with
selection of large-angle proton emission revealed a structure with M_X = 2265
+- 2 MeV/c2 and Gamma_X = 118 +- 8$ MeV.
