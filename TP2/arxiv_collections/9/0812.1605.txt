We calculate the orbital angular momentum of the `quark' in the scalar
diquark model as well as that of the electron in QED (to order $\alpha$). We
compare the orbital angular momentum obtained from the Jaffe-Manohar
decomposition to that obtained from the Ji relation and estimate the importance
of the vector potential in the definition of orbital angular momentum.
