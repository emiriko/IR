We present the first observation of the 1s2p 3P2 ? 1s2s 3S1 transition in
He-like uranium. The experiment was performed at the internal gas-jet target of
the ESR storage ring at GSI exploiting a Bragg crystal spectrometer and a
germanium solid state detector. Using the 1s2 2p 2P3/2 ? 1s2 2s 2S1/2
transition in Li-like uranium as reference and the deceleration capabilities of
the ESR storage rings, we obtained the first evaluation of the He-like heavy
ion intra-shell transition energy.
