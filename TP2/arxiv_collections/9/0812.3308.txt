Sr_(9-x)PbxCe2Ti12O36 system is derived from the perovskite SrTiO3 and its
chemical formula can be written as (Sr_(1-y)Pby)0.75Ce0.167TiO3. We
investigated dielectric response of Sr_(9-x)PbxCe2Ti12O36 ceramics (x = 0-9)
between 100 Hz and 100 THz at temperatures from 10 to 700 K using low- and
high-frequency dielectric, microwave (MW), THz and infrared spectroscopy. We
revealed that Sr9Ce2Ti12O36 is an incipient ferroelectric with the R-3c
trigonal structure whose relative permittivity e' increases from 167 at 300 K
and saturates near 240 below 30 K. The subsequent substitution of Sr by Pb
enhances e' to several thousands and induces a ferroelectric phase transition
to monoclinic Cc phase for x>=3. Its critical temperature Tc linearly depends
on the Pb concentration and reaches 550 K for x=9. The phase transition is of
displacive type. The soft mode frequency follows the Barrett formula in samples
with x<=2 (typical for quantum paraelectrics) and the Cochran formula for x>=3.
The MW dispersion is lacking and quality factor Q is high in samples with low
Pb concentration, although the permittivity is very high in some cases.
However, due to the lattice softening, the temperature coefficient of the
permittivity is rather high. The best MW quality factor was observed for x=1:
Q*f=5800 GHz and e'=250. Concluding, the dielectric properties of Sr_(9-
x)PbxCe2Ti12O36 are similar to those of Ba_(1-x)SrxTiO3 so that this system can
be presumably used as an alternative for MW devices or capacitors.
