A full three-dimensional angular momentum projection on top of a triaxial
relativistic mean-Geld calculation is implemented for the first time. The
underlying Lagrangian is a point coupling model and pairing correlations are
taken into account by a monopole force. This method is applied for the
low-lying excited states in 24Mg. Good agreement with the experimental data is
found for the ground state properties. A minimum in the potential energy
surface for the 2+ state, with beta = 0.55, gamma = 10 deg, is used as the
basis to investigate the rotational energy spectrum as well as the
corresponding B(E2) transition probabilities as compared to the available data.
