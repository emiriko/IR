Colour symmetries with ten colours are presented for different tilings. In
many cases, the existence of these colourings were predicted by group
theoretical methods. Only in a few cases explicit constructions were known,
sometimes using combination of two-colour and five-colour symmetries. Here we
present explicit constructions of several of the predicted colourings for the
first time, and discuss them in contrast to already known colourings with ten
colours.
