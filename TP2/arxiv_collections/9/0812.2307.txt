We study the normal form of multipartite density matrices. It is shown that
the correlation matrix (CM) separability criterion can be improved from the
normal form we obtained under filtering transformations. Based on CM criterion
the entanglement witness is further constructed in terms of local orthogonal
observables for both bipartite and multipartite systems.
