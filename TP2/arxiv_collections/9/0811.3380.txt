We propose a new setup to measure an electrical field in one direction. This
setup is made of a piezoelectric sintered lead zinconate titanate film and an
optical interferometric probe. We used this setup to investigate how the shape
of the extremity of a coaxial cable influences the longitudinal electrical
near-field generated by it. For this application, we designed our setup to have
a spatial resolution of 100 um in the direction of the electrical field.
Simulations and experiments are presented.
