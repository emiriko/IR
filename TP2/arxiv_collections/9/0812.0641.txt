We report on our code, in which the moving puncture method is applied and an
adaptive/fixed mesh refinement is implemented, and on its preliminary
performance on black hole simulations. Based on the BSSN formulation,
up-to-date gauge conditions and the modifications of the formulation are also
implemented and tested. In this work we present our primary results about the
simulation of a single static black hole, of a moving single black hole, and of
the head-on collision of a binary black hole system. For the static punctured
black hole simulations, different modifications of the BSSN formulation are
applied. It is demonstrated that both the currently used sets of modifications
lead to a stable evolution. For cases of a moving punctured black hole with or
without spin, we search for viable gauge conditions and study the effect of
spin on the black hole evolution. Our results confirm previous results obtained
by other research groups. In addition, we find a new gauge condition, which has
not yet been adopted by any other researchers, which can also give stable and
accurate black hole evolution calculations. We examine the performance of the
code for the head-on collision of a binary black hole system, and the agreement
of the gravitational waveform it produces with that obtained in other works. In
order to understand qualitatively the influence of matter on the binary black
hole collisions, we also investigate the same head-on collision scenarios but
perturbed by a scalar field. The numerical simulations performed with this code
not only give stable and accurate results that are consistent with the works by
other numerical relativity groups, but also lead to the discovery of a new
viable gauge condition, as well as clarify some ambiguities in the modification
of the BSSN formulation.
