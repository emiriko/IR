Motivated by the physics of the Moore-Read \nu = 1/2 state away from
half-filling, we investigate collective states of non-abelian e/4
quasiparticles in a magnetic field. We consider two types of collective states:
incompressible liquids and Wigner crystals. In the incompressible liquid case,
we construct a natural series of states which can be thought of as a
non-abelian generalization of the Laughlin states. These states are associated
with a series of hierarchical states derived from the Moore-Read state - the
simplest of which occur at filling fraction 8/17 and 7/13. Interestingly, we
find that the hierarchical states are abelian even though their parent state is
non-abelian. In the Wigner crystal case, we construct two candidate states. We
find that they, too, are abelian - in agreement with previous analysis.
