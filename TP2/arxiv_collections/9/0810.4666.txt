We describe a software package for constructing minimal free resolutions of
GL_n(Q)-equivariant graded modules M over Q[x_1, ..., x_n] such that for all i,
the ith syzygy module of M is generated in a single degree. We do so by
describing some algorithms for manipulating polynomial representations of the
general linear group GL_n(Q) following ideas of Olver and
Eisenbud-Floystad-Weyman.
