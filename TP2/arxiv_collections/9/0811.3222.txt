We analyze a quantum spin Hall (QSH) device with a point contact connecting
two of its edges. The contact supports a net spin tunneling current that can be
probed experimentally via a two-terminal resistance measurement. We find that
the low-bias tunneling current and the differential conductance exhibit scaling
with voltage and temperature that depend nonlinearly on the strength of the
electron-electron interaction.
