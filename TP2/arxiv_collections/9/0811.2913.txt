We report on magnetization measurements performed on a series of
Fe$_{x}$Ni$_{1-x}$Zr$_{2}$ superconducting metallic glasses with $0\leq
x\leq0.5$ using the Hall effect of a nearby 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
in a GaAs/Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$As heterostructure as a local probe. The great
sensitivity of the Hall effect of the 2DEG in such heterostructure is exploited
to determine the magnetization of the superconductor due to the Meissner effect
and flux trapping. The data is used to determine the lower critical field
B$_{c1}$ of the superconductors as a function of temperature. Surprisingly
large fluctuations in the magnetization are also observed and attributed to the
presence of large flux clusters in the superconductor.
