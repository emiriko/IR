The free photon dispersion relation is a reference quantity for high
precision tests of Lorentz Invariance. We first outline theoretical approaches
to a conceivable Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Next we address
phenomenological tests based on the propagation of cosmic rays, in particular
in Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). As a specific concept, which could imply LIV, we
then focus on field theory in a non-commutative (NC) space, and we present
non-perturbative results for the dispersion relation of the NC photon.
