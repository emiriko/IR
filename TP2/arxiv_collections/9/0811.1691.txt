The gauge polyvalence of a new numerical code is tested, both in
harmonic-coordinate simulations (gauge-waves testbed) and in
singularity-avoiding coordinates (simple Black-Hole simulations, either with or
without shift). The code is built upon an adjusted first-order
flux-conservative version of the Z4 formalism and a recently proposed family of
robust finite-difference high-resolution algorithms. An outstanding result is
the long-term evolution (up to 1000M) of a Black-Hole in normal coordinates
(zero shift) without excision.
