We present a detailed quantum oscillation study of the Fermi surface of the
recently discovered Yb-based heavy fermion superconductor beta-YbAlB4 . We
compare the data, obtained at fields from 10 to 45 Tesla, to band structure
calculations performed using the local density approximation. Analysis of the
data suggests that f-holes participate in the Fermi surface up to the highest
magnetic fields studied. We comment on the significance of these findings for
the unconventional superconducting properties of this material.
