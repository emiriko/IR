A recent paper by the CDF collaboration suggests (but does not claim) an
anomalous event sample containing muons produced with large impact parameter,
often with high multiplicity and at small angles from one another. This curious
hint of a signal is potentially consistent with the hidden valley scenario, as
well as with some other classes of models. Despite its tenuous nature, this
hint highlights the experimental difficulties raised by such signals, and
merits some consideration. Some of the simplest interpretations of the data,
such as a light neutral particle decaying to muon and/or tau pairs, are largely
disfavored; three-body decays to $\tau\tau\nu$ appear slightly better. An
alternative speculative possibility -- a "micro-cascade decay" -- might be
consistent with the data. It is suggested that the experimentalists involved
provide additional plots showing invariant mass distributions of same- and
opposite-sign dimuon pairs, invariant masses of various classes of displaced
vertices, and spatial correlations among vertices within a cone.
