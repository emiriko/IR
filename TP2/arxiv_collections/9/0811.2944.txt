A method for exploring unstable structures generated by nonlinear dynamical
systems is introduced. It is based on the sampling of initial conditions and
parameters by Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REM), and efficient both for the
search of rare initial conditions and for the combined search of rare initial
conditions and parameters. Examples discussed here include the sampling of
unstable periodic orbits in chaos and search for the stable manifold of
unstable fixed points, as well as construction of the global bifurcation
diagram of a map.
