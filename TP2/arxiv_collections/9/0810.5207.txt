The vacuum expectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum
tensor are investigated for a scalar field with Dirichlet boundary conditions
and for the electromagnetic field inside a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical
boundary. In the case of the electromagnetic field perfectly conducting
boundary conditions are assumed on the bounding surfaces. By using the
Abel-Plana-type formula for the series over the zeros of the Bessel function,
the vacuum expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of two
terms. The first one corresponds to the geometry without a cylindrical boundary
and the second one is induced by the presence of the cylindrical shell. The
additional vacuum forces acting on the wedge sides due the presence of the
cylindrical boundary are evaluated and it is shown that these forces are
attractive for both scalar and electromagnetic fields.
