I give an overview of efforts in the last year to calculate interactions
among hadrons using lattice QCD. Results discussed include the extraction of
low-energy phase shifts and three-body interactions, and the study of pion and
kaon condensation. A critical appraisal is offered of recent attempts to
calculate nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-hyperon potentials on the lattice.
