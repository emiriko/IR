Magnetostatic spin wave dispersion and loss are measured in micron scale spin
wave-guides in ferromagnetic, metallic CoTaZr. Results are in good agreement
with model calculations of spin wave dispersion. The measured attenuation
lengths, of the order of 3um, are several of orders of magnitude shorter than
that predicted from eddy currents in these thin wires. Spin waves effectively
"tunnel" through air gaps, produced by focused ion beam etching, as large as
1.5 um.
