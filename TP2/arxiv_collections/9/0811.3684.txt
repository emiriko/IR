The irreversible transport of multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
is investigated within the Stimulated Adiabatic Raman Passage (STIRAP) scheme.
A general formalism for a single BEC in M-well trap is derived and analogy
between multi-photon and tunneling processes is demonstrated. STIRAP transport
of BEC in a cyclic triple-well trap is explored for various values of detuning
and interaction between BEC atoms. It is shown that STIRAP provides a complete
population transfer at zero detuning and interaction and persists at their
modest values. The detuning is found not to be obligatory. The possibility of
non-adiabatic transport with intuitive order of couplings is demonstrated.
Evolution of the condensate phases and generation of dynamical and geometric
phases are inspected. It is shown that STIRAP allows to generate the
unconventional geometrical phase which is now of a keen interest in quantum
computing.
