This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of neutralino dark matter
within classes of extended supersymmetric models referred to as the USSM
containing one additional SM singlet Higgs plus an extra $Z'$, together with
their superpartners the singlino and bino'. These extra states of the USSM can
significantly modify the nature and properties of neutralino dark matter
relative to that of the minimal (or even next-to-minimal) supersymmetric
standard models. We derive the Feynman rules for the USSM and calculate the
dark matter relic abundance and direct detection rates for elastic scattering
in the USSM for interesting regions of parameter space where the largest
differences are expected.
