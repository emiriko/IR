We solve the Faddeev equations for the two meson-one baryon system $\pi\pi N$
and coupled channels using the experimental two-body $t$-matrices for the $\pi
N$ interaction as input and unitary chiral dynamics to describe the interaction
between the rest of coupled channels. In addition to the $N^*(1710)$ obtained
before with the $\pi\pi N$ channel, we obtain, for $J^\pi=1/2^+$ and total
isospin of the three-body system $I=1/2$, a resonance peak whose mass is around
2080 MeV and width of 54 MeV, while for $I=3/2$ we find a peak around 2126 MeV
and 42 MeV of width. These two resonances can be identified with the $N^*
(2100)$ and the $\Delta (1910)$, respectively. We obtain another peak in the
isospin 1/2 configuration, around 1920 MeV which can be interpreted as a
resonance in the $N a_0(980)$ and $N f_0(980)$ systems.
