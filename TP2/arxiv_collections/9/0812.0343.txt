Weak-coupling approaches to the pairing problem in the iron pnictide
superconductors have predicted a wide variety of superconducting ground states.
We argue here that this is due both to the inadequacy of certain approximations
to the effective low-energy band structure, and to the natural near-degeneracy
of different pairing channels in superconductors with many distinct Fermi
surface sheets. In particular, we review attempts to construct two-orbital
effective band models, the argument for their fundamental inconsistency with
the symmetry of these materials, and the comparison of the dynamical
susceptibilities in two- and five-orbital models. We then present results for
the magnetic properties, pairing interactions, and pairing instabilities within
a five-orbital Random Phase Approximation model. We discuss the robustness of
these results for different dopings, interaction strengths, and variations in
band structure. Within the parameter space explored, an anisotropic,
sign-changing s-wave state and a d_x2-y2 state are nearly degenerate, due to
the near nesting of Fermi surface sheets.
