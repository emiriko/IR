The Belle experiment at the KEKB electron-positron collider is expected to
have collected close to one billion $\Upsilon$(4S) events by the time it comes
to an end in 2009. An upgrade to KEKB has been proposed. It is designed for an
order of magnitude higher luminosity than KEKB, following a three-year
construction period. The ultimate goal of $8 \times 10^{35}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm
s}^{-1}$ luminosity would be reached through further improvements over several
years. To exploit the physics accessible through this improved luminosity, an
upgrade of the Belle detector is also planned. A new international
collaboration, temporarily named sBelle, is in the process of being formed.
Super-KEKB and sBelle were officially placed on the KEK 5-year Roadmap in early
2008.
