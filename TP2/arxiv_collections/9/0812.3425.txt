We provide evidence that plastic depinning falls into the same class of
phenomena as the random organization which was recently studied in periodically
driven particle systems [L. Corte et al., Nature Phys. 4, 420 (2008)]. In the
plastic flow system, the pinned regime corresponds to the quiescent state and
the moving state corresponds to the fluctuating state. When an external force
is suddenly applied, the system eventually organizes into one of these two
states with a time scale that diverges as a power law at a nonequilibrium
transition. We propose a simple experiment to test for this transition in
colloidal systems and superconducting vortex systems with random disorder.
