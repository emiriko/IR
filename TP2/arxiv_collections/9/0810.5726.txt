The persistent current in two vertically coupled quantum rings containing few
electrons is studied. We find that the Coulomb interaction between the rings in
the absence of tunneling affects the persistent current in each ring and the
ground state configurations. Quantum tunneling between the rings alters
significantly the ground state and the persistent current in the system.
