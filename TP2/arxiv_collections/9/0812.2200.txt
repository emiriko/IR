In view of the recent excitement about a tension between determinations of
f_Ds from experiment and from simulations of lattice QCD with dynamical quarks,
we try to clear up the picture of lattice determinations in the continuum limit
of the quenched approximation. For O(a) improved Wilson quarks we see linear
scaling in the squared lattice spacing a^2 only for a<~0.08fm. For coarser
lattices we observe significant contaminations from higher order cutoff
effects. As an aside we also study the scaling of the charm quark mass and the
ratio of the vector to the pseudo-scalar decay constant and the spin-splitting.
