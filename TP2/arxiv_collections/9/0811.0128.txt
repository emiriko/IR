In this paper, dedicated to the career of Iver Brevik, we review the
derivation of the retarded van der Waals or Casimir-Polder interaction between
polarizable molecules from the general multiple scattering formulation of
Casimir interactions between bodies. We then apply this van der Waals potential
to examine the interaction between tenuous cylindrical bodies, including
eccentric cylinders, and revisit the vanishing self-energy of a tenuous
dielectric cylinder. In each case, closed-form expressions are obtained.
