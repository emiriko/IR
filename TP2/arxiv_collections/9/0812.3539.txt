Electromagnetic form factors of proton and neutron, obtained from a new fit
of data, are presented. The proton form factors are obtained from a
simultaneous fit to the ratio $\mu_p G_{Ep}/G_{Mp}$ determined from
polarization transfer measurements and to $ep$ elastic cross section data.
Phenomenological two-photon exchange corrections are taken into account. The
present fit for proton was performed in the kinematical region $Q^2\in (0,6)$
GeV$^2$. Both for protons and neutrons we use the latest available data. For
all form factors the uncertainties and correlations of form factor parameters
are investigated with the $\chi^2$ method.
