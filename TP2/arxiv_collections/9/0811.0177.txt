This thesis describes experimental and theoretical study of static and
dynamic aspects of the irreversible magnetic behavior of high-Tc
superconductors. Experimentally, conventional magnetometry and novel Hall-probe
array techniques are employed. Using both techniques extends significantly the
experimental possibilities and yields a wealth of new experimental results.
