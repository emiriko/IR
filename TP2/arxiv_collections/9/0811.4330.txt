A self-consistent model of bipolar charge-carrier injection and transport
processes in a semiconductor/insulator/conductor system is developed which
incorporates space-charge effects in the description of the injection process.
The amount of charge-carriers injected is strongly determined by the energy
barrier emerging at the contact, but at the same time the electrostatic
potential generated by the injected charge-carriers modifies the height of this
injection barrier itself. In our model, self-consistency is obtained by
assuming continuity of the electric displacement and of the electrochemical
potential all over the system. The constituents of the system are properly
taken into account by means of their respective density of state distributions.
The consequences resulting from our model are discussed on the basis of an
indium tin oxide/organic semiconductor/conductor structure. The distributions
of the charge carriers and the electric field through the electrodes and the
organic layer are calculated. The recombination- and current-voltage
characteristics are analyzed for different heights of injection barriers and
varying values of the recombination rate and compared with the measured
current-voltage dependences for an indium tin oxide/poly(phenylene vinylene)/Ca
structure. The voltage dependences of the recombination efficiency for the
different values of injection barriers and recombination rate reveal optimum
conditions for the device performance.
