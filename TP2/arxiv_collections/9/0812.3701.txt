We experimentally find an interesting and unexpected thing: a rubidium cell
with long decay time can not be used to generate a non-classical correlated
photon pair via the D2 transition of $^{87}$Rb using four-wave mixing
configuration [Opt. Express {\bf 16}, 21708 (2008)]. In this work, we give a
detail theoretical analysis on the EIT of hot $^{87}$Rb with different ground
decay time, which shows a probable reason why a rubidium cell with long decay
time is not a useful candidate for preparation of a non-classical photon pair
via the D2 transition. The simulations agree well with the experimental
results. We believe our find is very instructive to such kind of research.
