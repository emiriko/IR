We review recent work on the local geometry and optimal regularity of
Lorentzian manifolds with bounded curvature. Our main results provide an
estimate of the injectivity radius of an observer, and a local canonical
foliations by CMC (Constant Mean Curvature) hypersurfaces, together with
spatially harmonic coordinates. In contrast with earlier results based on a
global bound for derivatives of the curvature, our method requires only a
sup-norm bound on the curvature near the given observer.
