We consider planar quadrangulations with three marked vertices and discuss
the geometry of triangles made of three geodesic paths joining them. We also
study the geometry of minimal separating loops, i.e. paths of minimal length
among all closed paths passing by one of the three vertices and separating the
two others in the quadrangulation. We concentrate on the universal scaling
limit of large quadrangulations, also known as the Brownian map, where pairs of
geodesic paths or minimal separating loops have common parts of non-zero
macroscopic length. This is the phenomenon of confluence, which distinguishes
the geometry of random quadrangulations from that of smooth surfaces. We
characterize the universal probability distribution for the lengths of these
common parts.
