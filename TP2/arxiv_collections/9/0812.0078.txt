In this work, we propose a model based on a non-minimal coupling of neutrinos
to a Kalb-Ramond field. The latter is taken as a possible source for
gravitational radiation. As an immediate illustration of this system, we have
studied the case where gravitational (plane) wave solutions behave as damped
harmonic oscillators.
