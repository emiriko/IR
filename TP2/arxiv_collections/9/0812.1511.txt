In the first part, the second quantization procedure and the free Bosonic
scalar field will be introduced, and the axioms for quantum fields and nets of
observable algebras will be discussed.
  The second part is mainly devoted to an illustration of the
Bisognano-Wichmann theorem for Wightman fields and in the algebraic setting,
with a discussion on the physical meaning of this result.
  In the third part some reconstruction theorems based on modular groups will
be described, in particular the possibility of constructing an action of the
symmetry group of a given theory via modular groups, and the construction of
free field algebras via representations of the symmetry group.
