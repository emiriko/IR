We present an embedding approach based on localized basis functions which
permits an efficient application of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to
inhomogeneous correlated materials, such as semi-infinite surfaces and
heterostructures. In this scheme, the semi-infinite substrate leads connected
to both sides of the central region of interest are represented via complex,
energy-dependent embedding potentials that incorporate one-electron as well as
many-body effects within the substrates. As a result, the number of layers
which must be treated explicitly in the layer-coupled DMFT equation is greatly
reduced. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we present numerical
results for strongly correlated surfaces, interfaces, and heterostructures of
the single-band Hubbard model.
