We have developed an efficient algorithm for steady axisymmetrical 2D fluid
equations. The algorithm employs multigrid method as well as standard implicit
discretization schemes for systems of partial differential equations. Linearity
of the multigrid method with respect to the number of grid points allowed us to
use $256\times 256$ grid, where we could achieve solutions in several minutes.
Time limitations due to nonlinearity of the system are partially avoided by
using multi level grids(the initial solution on $256\times 256$ grid was
extrapolated steady solution from $128\times 128$ grid which allowed using
"long" integration time steps). The fluid solver may be used as the basis for
hybrid codes for DC discharges.
