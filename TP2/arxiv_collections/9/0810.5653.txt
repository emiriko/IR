We report on scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of grain
boundaries in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Grain boundaries showed a
periodic structure and an enhanced charge density compared to the bare graphite
surface. Two possible periodic structures have been observed along grain
boundaries. A geometrical model producing periodically distributed point
defects on the basal plane of graphite has been proposed to explain the
structure of grain boundaries. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy on grain
boundaries revealed two strong localized states at -0.3 V and 0.4 V.
