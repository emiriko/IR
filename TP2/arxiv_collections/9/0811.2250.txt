We study here fundamental issues involved in top-k query evaluation in
probabilistic databases. We consider simple probabilistic databases in which
probabilities are associated with individual tuples, and general probabilistic
databases in which, additionally, exclusivity relationships between tuples can
be represented. In contrast to other recent research in this area, we do not
limit ourselves to injective scoring functions. We formulate three intuitive
postulates that the semantics of top-k queries in probabilistic databases
should satisfy, and introduce a new semantics, Global-Topk, that satisfies
those postulates to a large degree. We also show how to evaluate queries under
the Global-Topk semantics. For simple databases we design dynamic-programming
based algorithms, and for general databases we show polynomial-time reductions
to the simple cases. For example, we demonstrate that for a fixed k the time
complexity of top-k query evaluation is as low as linear, under the assumption
that probabilistic databases are simple and scoring functions are injective.
