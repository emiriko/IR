We investigate non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs) in the triplet
seesaw model featuring non-trivial correlations between NSI parameters and
neutrino masses and mixing parameters. We show that sizable NSIs can be
generated as a consequence of a nearly degenerate neutrino mass spectrum. Thus,
these NSIs could lead to quite significant signals of lepton flavor violating
decays such as \mu^- \to e^- \nu_e anti\nu_\mu and \mu^+ \to e^+ anti\nu_e
\nu_\mu at a future neutrino factory, effects adding to the uncertainty in
determination of the Earth matter density profile, as well as characteristic
patterns of the doubly charged Higgs decays observable at the Large Hadron
Collider.
