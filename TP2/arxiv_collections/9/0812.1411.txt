We report a thermoelectric study of graphene in both zero and applied
magnetic fields. As a direct consequence of the linear dispersion of massless
particles, we find that the Seebeck coefficient Sxx diverges with 1 /, where
n2D is the carrier density. We observe a very large Nernst signal Sxy (~ 50
uV/K at 8 T) at the Dirac point, and an oscillatory dependence of both Sxx and
Sxy on n2D at low temperatures. Our results underscore the anomalous
thermoelectric transport in graphene, which may be used as a highly sensitive
probe for impurity bands near the Dirac point.
