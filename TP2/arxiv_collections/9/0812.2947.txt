Complex spatiotemporal structures develop during the process of aging glasses
after cooling and of rejuvenating glasses upon heating. The key to
understanding these structures is the interplay between the activated
reconfiguration events which generate mobility and the transport of mobility.
These effects are both accounted for by combining the random first order
transition theory of activated events with mode coupling theory in an
inhomogeneous setting. The predicted modifications by mobility transport of the
time course of the aging regime are modest. In contrast, the rejuvenation
process is strongly affected through the propagation of fronts of enhanced
mobility originating from the initial reconfiguration events. The structures in
a rejuvenating glass resemble flames. An analysis along the lines of combustion
theory provides an estimate of the front propagation speed. Heterogeneous
rejuvenation naturally should occur for glasses with free surfaces. The analogy
with combustion also provides a new way of looking at the uptake of diluents by
glasses described by case II and super case II diffusion.
