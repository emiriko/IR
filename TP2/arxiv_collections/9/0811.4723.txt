We study electronic transport through an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with
single-level quantum dots embedded in the two arms. The full counting
statistics in the shot-noise regime is calculated to first order in the
tunnel-coupling strength. The interplay of interference and charging energy in
the dots leads to a dynamical channel blockade that is tunable by the magnetic
flux penetrating the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We find super-Poissonian behavior with
diverging second and higher cumulants when the Aharonov-Bohm flux approaches an
integer multiple of the flux quantum.
