The superconductivity of MgB2, AlB2, NbB2+x and TaB2+x is inter-compared. The
stretched c-lattice parameter (c = 3.52 A) of MgB2 in comparison to NbB2.4 (c =
3.32 A) and AlB2 (c = 3.25 A) decides empirically the population of their p and
s bands and as a result their transition temperature, Tc values respectively at
39K and 9.5K for the first two and no superconductivity for the later. Besides
the electron doping from substitution of Mg+2 by Al+3, the stretched
c-parameter also affects the Boron plane constructed hole type Sigma-band
population and the contribution from Mg or Al plane electron type Pi band. This
turns the electron type (mainly Pi-band conduction) non-superconducting AlB2 to
hole type (mainly s-band conduction) MgB2 superconductor (39 K) as indicated by
the thermoelectric power study. Keeping this strategy in mind that stretching
of c-parameter enhances superconductivity, the NbB2+x and TaB2+x samples are
studied for existence of superconductivity. The non-stoichiometry induces an
increase in c parameter with Boron excess in both borides. Magnetization (M-T)
and Resistivity measurements (R-T) in case of niobium boride samples show the
absence of superconductivity in stoichiometric NbB2 sample (c = 3.26 A) while a
clear diamagnetic signal and a R = 0 transition for Boron excess NbB2+x
samples. On the other hand, superconductivity is not achieved in TaB2+x case.
The probable reason behind is the comparatively lesser or insufficient
stretching of c-parameter.
