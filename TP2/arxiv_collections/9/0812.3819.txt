We present a quantum analysis of three-mode optoacoustic parametric
interactions in an optical cavity, in which two orthogonal transverse
optical-cavity modes are coupled to one acoustic mode through radiation
pressure. Due to the optimal frequency matching -- the frequency separation of
two cavity modes is equal to the acoustic-mode frequency -- the carrier and
sideband fields simultaneously resonate and coherently build up. This mechanism
significantly enhances the optoacoustic couplings in the quantum regime. It
allows exploration of quantum behavior of optoacoustic interactions in
small-scale table-top experiments. We show explicitly that given an
experimentally achievable parameter, three-mode scheme can realize quantum
ground-state cooling of milligram scale mechanical oscillators and create
robust stationary tripartite optoacoustic quantum entanglements.
