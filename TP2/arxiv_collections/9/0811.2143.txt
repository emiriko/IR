Model independent sum rules for heavy baryon masses are tested for baryons
containing charmed or bottom quarks. The sum rules depend only on the
assumption that baryon mass differences are determined by spin-dependent
two-body energies of quark pairs that do not depend on which baryon the quark
pair is in. No assumption is made about the details of the quark-quark
interaction. The sum rules are generally well satisfied, although better
experimental accuracy would be required for a quantitative test of some of the
sum rules. The success of the sum rules is evidence that "baryon independence"
of quark-quark interaction is a good assumption for baryon mass calculations.
It also means that the success of some detailed baryon mass calculations may
not depend on the specific mechanism used in the calculation.
