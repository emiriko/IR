By means of an original approach, called "method of the moving frame", we
establish existence, uniqueness and stability results for mild and weak
solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with path
dependent coefficients driven by an infinite dimensional Wiener process and a
compensated Poisson random measure. Our approach is based on a time-dependent
coordinate transform, which reduces a wide class of SPDEs to a class of simpler
SDE problems. We try to present the most general results, which we can obtain
in our setting, within a self-contained framework to demonstrate our approach
in all details. Also several numerical approaches to SPDEs in the spirit of
this setting are presented.
