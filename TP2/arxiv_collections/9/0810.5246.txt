This paper is devoted to general balance laws (with a possibly non local
source term) with a non-characteristic boundary. Basic well posedness results
are obtained, trying to provide sharp estimates. In particular, bounds tend to
blow up as the boundary tends to be characteristic. New uniqueness results for
the solutions to conservation and/or balance laws with boundary are also
provided.
