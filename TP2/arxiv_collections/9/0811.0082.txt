We propose an approach to realize a quantum random number generator (QRNG)
based on the photon number decision of weak laser pulses. This type of QRNG can
generate true random numbers at a high speed and can be adjusted to zero bias
conveniently, thus is suitable for the applications in quantum cryptography.
