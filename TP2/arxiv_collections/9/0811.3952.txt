We present the first numerical simulations of an initially non-spinning
black-hole binary with mass ratio as large as 10:1 in full general relativity.
The binary completes approximately 3 orbits prior to merger and radiates about
0.415% of the total energy and 12.48% of the initial angular momentum in the
form of gravitational waves. The single black hole resulting from the merger
acquires a kick of about 66.7 km/s relative to the original center of mass
frame. The resulting gravitational waveforms are used to validate existing
formulas for the recoil, final spin and radiated energy over a wider range of
the symmetric mass ratio parameter eta=M1*M2/(M1+M2)^2 than previously
possible. The contributions of l > 2 multipoles are found to visibly influence
the gravitational wave signal obtained at fixed inclination angles.
