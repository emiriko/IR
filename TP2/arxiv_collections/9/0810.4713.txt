A new watermarking algorithm is given, it is based on the so-called chaotic
iterations and on the choice of some coefficients which are deduced from the
description of the carrier medium. After defining these coefficients, chaotic
discrete iterations are used to encrypt the watermark and to embed it in the
carrier medium. This procedure generates a topological chaos and ensures that
the required properties of a watermarking algorithm are satisfied.
