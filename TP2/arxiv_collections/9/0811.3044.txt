How to select out those collisions with the desired geometry such as tip-tip
and/or body-body in experiment is one key point for performing high energy UU
collisions. With a relativistic transport model, we performed a simulation for
deformed UU collision with vast different orientations at CSR energy area
corresponding to the high net-baryon density region in QCD phase diagram. By
investigating the centrality and initial collision orientation dependence of
the center baryon density, we found that the tip-tip like UU collisions with
extended high density phase, which is very important for studying the nuclear
EoS of high baryon density matter and the possible end-point of the phase
boundary, are those events with small initial orientations ($\leq20^{0}$) for
bath projectile and target in reaction plane and small impact parameter
($\leq2.6fm$). We pointed out quantificationally two observations --
multiplicity of forward neutron and nuclear stopping power that both allows us
to select out those most interesting events (i.e. tip-tip like), which will be
very helpful for the future experiments at performing UU collisions.
