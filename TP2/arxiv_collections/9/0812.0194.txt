Part I: The error of eq. (15b) in my article [Z.D. Zhang, Phil. Mag. 87, 5309
(2007), arXiv:0705.1045] in the application of the Jordan-Wigner transformation
does not affect the validity of the putative exact solution, since the solution
is not derived directly from it. Other objections of Perk's Comment
arXiv:0811.1802v2 are the same as those in Wu et al's Comments arXiv:0811.3876
and arXiv:0812.2837, which do not stand on solid ground and have been rejected
in the previous Response arXiv:0812.2330. The conjectured solution can be
utilized to understand critical phenomena in various systems, while the
conjectures are open to prove rigorously. Part II: This is a Reply to Perk's
Rejoinder arXiv:0901.2935. It is shown that the basis of the objections in
Perk's Rejoinder, with respect to singularities at/near infinite temperature,
is based on an error that mixes the concepts of T approaching infinite and T =
infinite. It is shown that the reduced free energy per site f can be used only
for finite temperatures (beta > 0), not for 'exactly' infinite temperature
(beta = 0). At the thermodynamic limit N approaches infinite, besides
infinite-temperature zeros of Z at z = -1 for H = +/- i infinite in the limit
of beta approaching zero, there exists another singularity at z = 1 for the
partition function, which is usually concealed in literature by setting Z to
the power of 1/N and dividing the total free energy F by N (equally,
disregarding the singularity of zeros of 1/Z. The objections in Perk's
Rejoinder are thoroughly disproved.
