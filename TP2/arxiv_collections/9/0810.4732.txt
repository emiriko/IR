Tumour progression has been described as a sequence of traits or phenotypes
that cells have to acquire if the neoplasm is to become an invasive and
malignant cancer. Although the genetic mutations that lead to these phenotypes
are random, the process by which some of these mutations become successful and
spread is influenced by the tumour microenvironment and the presence of other
phenotypes. It is thus likely that some phenotypes that are essential in tumour
progression will emerge in the tumour population only with the prior presence
of other different phenotypes. In this paper we use evolutionary game theory to
analyse the interactions between three different tumour cell phenotypes defined
by autonomous growth, anaerobic glycolysis, and cancer cell invasion. The model
allows to understand certain specific aspects of glioma progression such as the
emergence of diffuse tumour cell invasion in low-grade tumours. We find that
the invasive phenotype is more likely to evolve after the appearance of the
glycolytic phenotype which would explain the ubiquitous presence of invasive
growth in malignant tumours. The result suggests that therapies which increase
the fitness cost of switching to anaerobic glycolysis might decrease the
probability of the emergence of more invasive phenotypes
