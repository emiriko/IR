It is argued that the chiral partners of the lowest-lying hadrons are
hadronic molecules and not three-quark or quark-antiquark states, respectively.
As an example the case of a_1 as the chiral partner of the rho is discussed.
Deconfinement -- or as a precursor large in-medium widths for hadronic states
-- is proposed as a natural way to accommodate for the fact that at chiral
restoration the respective in-medium spectra of chiral partners must become
degenerate. Ingredients for a systematic and self-consistent in-medium
calculation are presented with special emphasis on vector-meson dominance which
emerges from a recently proposed systematic counting scheme for the mesonic
sector including pseudoscalar and vector mesons as active degrees of freedom.
