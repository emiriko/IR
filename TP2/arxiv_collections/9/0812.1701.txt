In multi-band superconductors as inter-metallic systems and heavy fermions,
external pressure can reduce the critical temperature and eventually destroy
superconductivity driving these systems to the normal state. In many cases this
transition is continuous and is associated with a superconducting quantum
critical point (SQCP). In this work we study a two-band superconductor in the
presence of hybridization V. This one-body mixing term is due to the overlap of
the different wave-functions. It can be tuned by external pressure and turns
out as an important control parameter to study the phase diagram and the nature
of the phase transitions. We use a BCS approximation and include both inter and
intra-band attractive interactions. For negligible inter-band interactions, as
hybridization (pressure) increases we find a SQCP separating a superconductor
from a normal state at a critical value of the hybridization Vc. We obtain the
behavior of the electronic specific heat close to the SQCP and the shape of the
critical line as V approaches Vc.
