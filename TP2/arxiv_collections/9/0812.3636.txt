Josephson junctions were fabricated using two different methods of barrier
formation. The trilayers employed were Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb on sapphire, where the
first two layers were epitaxial. The oxide barrier was formed either by
exposing the Al surface to O2 or by codepositing Al in an O2 background. The
codeposition process yielded junctions that showed the theoretically predicted
subgap current and no measurable shunt conductance. In contrast, devices with
barriers formed by thermal oxidation showed a small shunt conductance in
addition to the predicted subgap current.
