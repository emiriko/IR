It is shown that, at variance with previous analyses, the MIT bag model can
explain the available data of the Sivers function and satisfies the Burkardt
Sum Rule to a few percent accuracy. The agreement is similar to the one
recently found in the constituent quark model. Therefore, these two model
calculations of the Sivers function are in agreement with the present
experimental and theoretical wisdom.
