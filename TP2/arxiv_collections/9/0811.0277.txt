We present a microscopic derivation of the form factors of strong-interaction
piNN and piNDelta vertices within a relativistic constituent quark model. The
results are compared with form factors from phenomenological meson-baryon
models and recent lattice QCD calculations. We give an analytical
representation of the vertex form factors suitable for applications in further
studies of hadron reactions.
