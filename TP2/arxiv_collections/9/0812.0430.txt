We present a realistic study for electronic and magnetic properties in dilute
magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. A multi-orbital Haldane-Anderson model
parameterized by density-functional calculations is presented and solved with
the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Results well reproduce
experimental results in the dilute limit. When the chemical potential is
located between the top of the valence band and an impurity bound state, a
long-range ferromagnetic correlations between the impurities, mediated by
antiferromagnetic impurity-host couplings, are drastically developed. We
observe an anisotropic character in local density of states at the
impurity-bound-state energy, which is consistent with the STM measurements. The
presented combined approach thus offers a firm starting point for realistic
calculations of the various family of dilute magnetic semiconductors.
