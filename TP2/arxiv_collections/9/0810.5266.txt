We explore the \Delta L=2 same-sign dilepton signal from top-quark decay via
a Majorana neutrino at the LHC in the top anti-top pair production samples. The
signature is same-sign dilepton plus multi-jets with no significant missing
energy. The most optimistic region lies where the Majorana neutrino mass is
between 15-65 GeV. For 300 fb^-1 integrated luminosity, it is possible to probe
S_{ij}, the effective mixing parameter, to order of 10^-5.
