An adaptive voting algorithm for digital media was introduced in this study.
Availability was improved by incoherence scoring in voting mechanism of
Multi-Modular Redundancy. Regulation parameters give the algorithm flexibility
of adjusting priorities in decision process. Proposed adaptive voting algorithm
was shown to be more aware of fault status of redundant modules
