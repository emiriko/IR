We consider the new-physics (NP) solution to the polarization puzzle in B ->
phi K* decays. We note that any such solution must reproduce the data in B ->
phi Ks, where there are disagreements with the standard model in CP-asymmetry
measurements. We examine 10 NP operators, of S/P, V/A and T variety. We find
that, as long as B -> phi Ks exhibits large CP-violating effects, no single
operator can explain the observations in both B -> phi K* and B -> phi Ks. For
2-NP-operator solutions, there are four possibilities, all of S/P type, which
are presently allowed. We discuss ways of distinguishing among these solutions
in the future. Models which contain only V/A operators, such as those with
supersymmetry or extra Z' bosons, cannot explain both B -> phi Ks and B -> phi
K* data. On the other hand, the two-Higgs-doublet model, which has only S/P
operators, is favored.}
