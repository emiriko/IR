An important experiment for cosmic ray physics is going to be conducted with
the colliding proton beams of the CERN LHC. The equivalent energy of the 14 TeV
center of mass energy of the colliding proton beams in the LHC is 1017eV in the
laboratory frame. Two small electromagnetic calorimeters have been installed at
zero degree collision angle +/-140m from the interaction point IP1. The
calorimeters measure the energies and the positions of the axes of showers
produced by forward neutral particles created in the proton-proton collisions.
The shower calorimeters are therefore able to measure the production
cross-section of neutral pions emitted in the very forward region. The
experimental results will be obtained during the early operation phase of LHC
when the luminosity is below 1030cm-2s-1. The data obtained will be extremely
important for benchmarking the various Monte Carlo codes used for interpreting
super high energy cosmic ray phenomena.
