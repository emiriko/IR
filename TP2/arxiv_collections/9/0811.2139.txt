We reanalyze the non-linear population dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate
(BEC) in a double well trap considering a semiclassical approach based on a
time dependent variational principle applied to coherent states associated to
SU(2) group. Employing a two-mode local approximation and hard sphere type
interaction, we show in the Schwinger's pseudo-spin language the occurrence of
a fixed point bifurcation that originates a separatrix of motion on a sphere.
This separatrix corresponds to the borderline between two dynamical regimes of
Josephson oscillations and mesoscopic self-trapping. We also consider the
effects of interaction between particles in different wells, known as cross
collisions. Such terms are usually neglected for traps sufficiently far apart,
but recently it has been shown that they contribute to the effective tunneling
constant with a factor growing linearly with the particle number. This effect
changes considerably the effective tunneling of the system for sufficiently
large number of trapped atoms, in perfect accord with experimental data.
Finally, we identify analytically the transition parameter associated to the
bifurcation in the generalized phase space of the model with cross-collision
terms, and show how the dynamical regime depends on the initial conditions of
the system and the collisional parameters values.
