We derive the higher dimensional generalization of Penrose-Tod equation
describing apparent horizons in Robinson-Trautman spacetimes. New results
concerning the existence and uniqueness of its solutions in four dimensions are
proven. Namely, previous results of Tod are generalized to nonvanishing
cosmological constant.
