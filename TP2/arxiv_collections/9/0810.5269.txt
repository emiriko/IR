In the paper we give an introduction to Anosov diffeomorphisms, ways to
represent their chaotic properties and some historical remarks on this subject.
A complete classification of hyperbolic linear automorphisms of 2-torus is
presented. We introduce a notion of pre-Markov partition for such automorphisms
and give their classification and an algorithm for their construction.
