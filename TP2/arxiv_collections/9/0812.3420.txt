We study the field dependence of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg
model on the square lattice by means of exact diagonalizations. In a first
part, we calculate the spin-wave velocity, the spin-stiffness, and the magnetic
susceptibility and thus determine the microscopic parameters of the low-energy
long-wavelength description. In a second part, we present a comprehensive study
of dynamical spin correlation functions for magnetic fields ranging from zero
up to saturation. We find that at low fields, magnons are well defined in the
whole Brillouin zone, but the dispersion is substantially modified by quantum
fluctuations compared to the classical spectrum. At higher fields, decay
channels open and magnons become unstable with respect to multi-magnon
scattering. Our results directly apply to inelastic neutron scattering
experiments.
