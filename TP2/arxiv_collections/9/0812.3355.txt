Given a projective scheme $X$ over a field $k$, an automorphism $\sigma$ of
$X$, and a $\sigma$-ample invertible sheaf $L$, one may form the twisted
homogeneous coordinate ring $B = B(X, L, \sigma)$, one of the most fundamental
constructions in noncommutative projective algebraic geometry. We study the
primitive spectrum of $B$, as well as that of other closely related algebras
such as skew and skew-Laurent extensions of commutative algebras. Over an
algebraically closed, uncountable field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove
that that the primitive ideals of $B$ are characterized by the usual
Dixmier-Moeglin conditions whenever the dimension of $X$ is no more than 2.
