We present results from a detailed GEANT4 simulation of a proposed Muon
Tomography System that employs compact Micro Pattern Gas Detectors with high
spatial resolution. A basic Point-Of-Closest-Approach algorithm is applied to
reconstructed muon tracks for forming 3D tomographic images of interrogated
targets. Criteria for discriminating materials by Z and discrimination power
achieved by the technique for simple scenarios are discussed for different
integration times. The simulation shows that Muon Tomography can clearly
distinguish high-Z material from low-Z and medium-Z material. We have studied
various systematic effects that affect the performance of the MT and the
discrimination power. The implications of the simulation results for the
planned development of a prototype MT station are discussed.
