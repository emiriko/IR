Let S be a closed surface of genus at least 2, and consider two measured
geodesic laminations that fill S. Right earthquakes along these laminations are
diffeomorphisms of the Teichm\"uller space of S. We prove that the composition
of these earthquakes has a fixed point in the Teichm\"uller space. Another way
to state this result is that it is possible to prescribe any two measured
laminations that fill a surface as the upper and lower measured bending
laminations of the convex core of a globally hyperbolic AdS manifold. The proof
uses some estimates from the geometry of those AdS manifolds.
