In this work, we exhibit abstract conditions on a functional space E who
insure the existence of a global mild solution for small data in E or the
existence of a local mild solution in absence of size constraints for a class
of semi-linear parabolic equations, which contains the incompressible
Navier-Stokes system as a fundamental example. We also give an abstract
criterion toward regularity of the obtained solutions. These conditions, given
in terms of Littlewood-Paley estimates for products of spectrally localized
elements of $E$, are simple to check in all known cases: Lebesgue, Lorents,
Besov, Morrey... spaces. These conditions also apply to non-invariant spaces E
and we give full details in the case of some 2-microlocal spaces. The following
comments did not show on the first version: This article was written around
1998-99 and never published, because at that time, Koch and Tataru announced
their result on well-posedness of Navier-stokes equations with initial data in
$BMO^{-1}$. We believe though that some results and counterexamples here are of
independent interest and we make them available electronically.
