The effects of line-tying on resistive tearing instability in slab geometry
is studied within the framework of reduced magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD).\citep{KadomtsevP1974,Strauss1976} It is found that line-tying has a
stabilizing effect. The tearing mode is stabilized when the system length $L$
is shorter than a critical length $L_{c}$, which is independent of the
resistivity $\eta$. When $L$ is not too much longer than $L_{c}$, the
growthrate $\gamma$ is proportional to $\eta$ . When $L$ is sufficiently long,
the tearing mode scaling $\gamma\sim\eta^{3/5}$ is recovered. The transition
from $\gamma\sim\eta$ to $\gamma\sim\eta^{3/5}$ occurs at a transition length
$L_{t}\sim\eta^{-2/5}$.
