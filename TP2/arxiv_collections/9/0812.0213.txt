We show that strictly local observables with arbitrarily small support in
space-time exist in covariant free open bosonic string field theory. The main
ingredient of the proof is a modified version of the well known DDF operators,
which we rigourously define. This result allows in principle the definition of
a net of local observable algebras and should be considered as a first step
towards the application of algebraic quantum field theory to this case
