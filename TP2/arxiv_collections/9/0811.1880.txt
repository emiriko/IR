\indent First results of the exposure of nuclear track emulsions in a
secondary beam enriched by $^9$C nuclei at energy of 1.2 A GeV are described.
The presented statistics corresponds to the most peripheral $^9$C interactions.
For the first time a dissociation $^9$C $\to3^3$He not accompanied by target
fragments and mesons is identified.\par
