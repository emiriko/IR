In this paper, we develop a method for obtaining the approximate solution for
the evolution of single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions.
We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical
expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks. These
analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's
description allowing easy curve fitting to experiment. A remarkable property is
that the evolutions of the transformed fraction obtained at different heating
rates are identical when time is scaled by a time constant. The accuracy
achieved with our method is checked against several reaction models and
different temperature dependencies of the transformation rate constant. It is
shown that its accuracy is closely related with that of the Kissinger method.
