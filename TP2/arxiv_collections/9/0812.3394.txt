Motivated by pressure experiments on FeAs-122 superconductors, we propose a
scenario based on local-moment physics to explain the simultaneous
disappearance of magnetism, reduction of the unit cell volume, and decrease in
resistivity. In this scenario, the low-pressure magnetic phase derives from Fe
moments, which become screened in the paramagnetic high-pressure phase. The
quantum phase transition can be described as an orbital-selective Mott
transition, which is rendered first order by coupling to the lattice, in
analogy to a Kondo volume collapse. Spin-fluctuation driven superconductivity
competes with antiferromagnetism and may be stabilized at low temperatures in
the high-pressure phase. The ideas are illustrated by a suitable mean-field
analysis of an Anderson lattice model.
