We compute the 3-loop O(\alpha \alpha_s) correction to the Higgs boson
production cross section arising from light quarks using an effective theory
approach. Our calculation probes the factorization of QCD and electroweak
perturbative corrections to this process. We combine our results with the best
current estimates for contributions from top and bottom quarks to derive an
updated theoretical prediction for the Higgs boson production cross section in
gluon fusion. With the use of the MSTW 2008 parton distribution functions that
include the newest experimental data, our study results in cross sections
approximately 4-6% lower for intermediate Higgs boson masses than those used in
recent Tevatron analyses that imposed a 95% confidence level exclusion limit of
a Standard Model Higgs boson with M_H=170 GeV.
