Let (g,k) be a reductive symmetric superpair of even type, i.e. so that there
exists an even Cartan subspace a in p. The restriction map S(p^*)^k->S(a^*)^W
where W=W(g_0:a) is the Weyl group, is injective. We determine its image
explicitly.
  In particular, our theorem applies to the case of a symmetric superpair of
group type, i.e. (k+k,k) with the flip involution where k is a classical Lie
superalgebra with a non-degenerate invariant even form (equivalently, a
finite-dimensional contragredient Lie superalgebra). Thus, we obtain a new
proof of the generalisation of Chevalley's restriction theorem due to Sergeev
and Kac, Gorelik.
  For general symmetric superpairs, the invariants exhibit a new and surprising
behaviour. We illustrate this phenomenon by a detailed discussion in the
example g=C(q+1)=osp(2|2q,C), endowed with a special involution. In this case,
the invariant algebra defines a singular algebraic curve.
