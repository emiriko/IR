It is well known that a quadratic function defined on a finite field of odd
degree is almost bent (AB) if and only if it is almost perfect nonlinear (APN).
For the even degree case there is no apparent relationship between the values
in the Fourier spectrum of a function and the APN property. In this article we
compute the Fourier spectrum of the new quadranomial family of APN functions.
With this result, all known infinite families of APN functions now have their
Fourier spectra and hence their nonlinearities computed.
