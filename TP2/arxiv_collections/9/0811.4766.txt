We construct a model for tri-bimaximal lepton mixing which employs only
family symmetries and their soft breaking; neither vacuum alignment nor
supersymmetry, extra dimensions, or non-renormalizable terms are used in our
model. It is an extension of the Standard Model making use of the seesaw
mechanism with five right-handed neutrino singlets. The scalar sector comprises
four Higgs doublets and one complex gauge singlet. The horizontal symmetry of
our model is based on the permutation group S_3 of the lepton families together
with the three family lepton numbers--united this constitutes a symmetry group
Delta(6\infty^2). The model makes no predictions for the neutrino masses.
