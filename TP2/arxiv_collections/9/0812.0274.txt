We investigate the Bose-Einstein Condensation on nonhomogeneous amenable
networks for the model describing arrays of Josephson junctions. The resulting
topological model, whose Hamiltonian is the pure hopping one given by the
opposite of the adjacency operator, has also a mathematical interest in itself.
We show that for the nonhomogeneous networks like the comb graphs, particles
condensate in momentum and configuration space as well. In this case different
properties of the network, of geometric and probabilistic nature, such as the
volume growth, the shape of the ground state, and the transience, all play a
role in the condensation phenomena. The situation is quite different for
homogeneous networks where just one of these parameters, e.g. the volume
growth, is enough to determine the appearance of the condensation.
