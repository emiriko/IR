Superconducting single crystals of SmFeAsO$_{1-x}$ without fluorine doping
were grown at a pressure of 3.3 GPa and a temperature of 1350-1450 $^\circ$C by
using the self-flux method. Plate-like single crystals of a few-150 $\mu$m in
their lateral size were obtained. Single crystals showed the superconducting
transition at about 53.5 K with a narrow transition width of 0.5 K. The
synchrotron-irradiated x-ray diffractometry patterns and
high-angle-annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images
point to the high quality of the crystals with a well-defined layered
tetragonal structure. The chemical compositions of the crystals were estimated
by using the electron-probe x-ray microanalysis.
