In discriminating between objects from different classes, the more separable
these classes are the less computationally expensive and complex a classifier
can be used. One thus seeks a measure that can quickly capture this
separability concept between classes whilst having an intuitive interpretation
on what it is quantifying. A previously proposed separability measure, the
separability index (SI) has been shown to intuitively capture the class
separability property very well. This short note highlights the limitations of
this measure and proposes a slight variation to it by combining it with another
form of separability measure that captures a quantity not covered by the
Separability Index.
