Double-differential cross sections for light-ion (p, d, t, 3He and alpha)
production in carbon induced by 96 MeV neutrons have been measured at eight
laboratory angles from 20 degrees to 160 degrees in steps of 20 degrees.
Experimental techniques are presented as well as procedures for data taking and
data reduction. Deduced energy-differential, angle-differential and production
cross sections are reported. Experimental cross sections are compared with
theoretical reaction model calculations and experimental data in the
literature. The measured particle data show marked discrepancies from the
results of the model calculations in spectral shape and magnitude. The measured
production cross sections for protons, deuterons, tritons, 3He, and alpha
particles support the trends suggested by data at lower energies.
