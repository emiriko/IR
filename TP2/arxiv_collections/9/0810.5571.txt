We study the affine orbifold laminations that were constructed by Lyubich and
Minsky. An important question left open in their construction is whether these
laminations are always locally compact. We show that this is not the case.
  The counterexample we construct has the property that the regular leaf space
contains (many) hyperbolic leaves that intersect the Julia set; whether this
can happen is itself a question raised by Lyubich and Minsky.
