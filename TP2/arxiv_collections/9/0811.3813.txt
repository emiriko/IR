The numerical calculations of the standard Eliashberg-Nambu strong coupling
theory and a formula of isotope effect derived in this paper provide direct
evidences that an-harmonic vibrations of lattice enhance isotope effect with
anomalous coefficient $\alpha>1/2$. The results in this paper explain very well
the wide distributed $\alpha$ values for the samples with different ratios of
substitutions of $^{12}$C by $^{13}$C of fulleride superconductor
Rb$_{3}$C$_{60}$. The calculations of isotope effects indicate that the
intra-molecule radial modes have more important contributions to
superconductivity than the intra-molecule tangential modes with higher phonon
frequencies
