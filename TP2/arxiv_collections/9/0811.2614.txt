A simple model describing the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect (NEE) in
two-component electronic liquids is formulated. The examples considered include
graphite, where the normal and Dirac fermions coexist, superconductor in
fluctuating regime, with coexisting Cooper pairs and normal electrons, and the
inter-stellar plasma of electrons and protons. We give a general expression for
the Nernst constant and show that the origin of a giant NEE is in the strong
dependence of the chemical potential on temperature in all cases.
