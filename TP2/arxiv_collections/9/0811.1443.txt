Starting from the three dimensional N=8 BLG and N=6 BL theories with CS level
k=1, a dimensional reduction is performed on the M2-branes worldvolume. The IR
limit of these 2D EFTs should represent the action of F1 strings in type IIA.
The CS term reduces to a particular Phi*F term and the scalars and fermions get
"mass" terms. The reduced actions still rely on three-algebra, which we did not
require to define precisely.
