New limits for the Violation of Equivalence Principle (VEP) are obtained
considering the mass-flavor mixing hypothesis. This analysis includes
observations of solar and reactor neutrinos and has obtained a limit for the
VEP parameter $|\Delta \gamma|$ contributing to the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$
disappearance channels of the order $|\Delta \gamma|<10^{-14}$, when it is
assumed that neutrinos are mainly affected by the gravitational potential
$\varphi\approx 10^{-5}$ due to the Great Attractor.
