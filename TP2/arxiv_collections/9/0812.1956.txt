A two-temperature linear spin model is presented that allows an easily
understandable introduction to non-equilibrium statistical physics. The model
is one that includes the concepts that are typical of more realistic
non-equilibrium models but that allows straightforward steady state solutions
and, for small systems, development of the full time dependence for
configuration probabilities. The model is easily accessible to upper-level
undergraduate students, and also provides a good check for computer models of
larger systems.
