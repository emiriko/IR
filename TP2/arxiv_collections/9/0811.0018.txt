Using a unique two-arm detector system for heavy ions (the BRS, binary
reaction spectrometer) coincident fission events have been measured from the
decay of $^{60}$Zn compound nuclei formed at 88MeV excitation energy in the
reactions with $^{36}$Ar beams on a $^{24}$Mg target at $E_{lab}(^{36}$Ar) =
195 MeV. The detectors consisted of two large area position sensitive (x,y) gas
telescopes with Bragg-ionization chambers. From the binary coincidences in the
two detectors inclusive and exclusive cross sections for fission channels with
differing losses of charge were obtained. Narrow out-of-plane correlations
corresponding to coplanar decay are observed for two fragments emitted in
binary events, and in the data for ternary decay with missing charges from 4 up
to 8. After subtraction of broad components these narrow correlations are
interpreted as a ternary fission process at high angular momentum through an
elongated shape. The lighter mass in the neck region consists dominantly of two
or three-particles. Differential cross sections for the different mass splits
for binary and ternary fission are presented. The relative yields of the binary
and ternary events are explained using the statistical model based on the
extended Hauser-Feshbach formalism for compound nucleus decay. The ternary
fission process can be described by the decay of hyper-deformed states with
angular momentum around 45-52 $hbar$.
