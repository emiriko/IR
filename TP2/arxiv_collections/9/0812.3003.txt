We report very simple and accurate algebraic expressions for the van der
Waals (vdW) potentials and the forces between two parallel and crossed carbon
nanotubes. The Lennard-Jones potential for two carbon atoms and the method of
the smeared out approximation suggested by L.A. Girifalco were used. It is
found that interaction between parallel and crossed tubes are described by
different uniform curves which depend only on dimensionless distance. The
explicit functions for equilibrium vdW distances, well depths, and maximal
attractive forces have been given. These results may be used as a guide for
analysis of experimental data to investigate interaction between nanotubes of
various natures.
