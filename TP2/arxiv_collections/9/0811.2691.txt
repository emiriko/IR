The value-at-risk of a delta-gamma approximated derivatives portfolio can be
computed by numerical integration of the characteristic function. However,
while the choice of parameters in any numerical integration scheme is
paramount, in practice it often relies on ad hoc procedures of trial and error.
For normal and multivariate $t$-distributed risk factors, we show how to
calculate the necessary parameters for one particular integration scheme as a
function of the data (the distribution of risk factors, and delta and gamma)
\emph{in order to satisfy a given error tolerance}. This allows for
implementation in a fully automated risk management system. We also demonstrate
in simulations that the method is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo
method, for a given error tolerance.
