We develop a novel quantum transfer matrix method to study thermodynamic
properties of one-dimensional (1D) disordered electronic systems. It is shown
that the partition function can be expressed as a product of $2\times2$ local
transfer matrices. We demonstrate this method by applying it to the 1D
disordered Anderson model. Thermodynamic quantities of this model are
calculated and discussed.
