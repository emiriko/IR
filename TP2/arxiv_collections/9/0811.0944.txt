We discuss the configuration and acoustic phonon effect on the conditional
phase gate using self assembled quantum dots. As an example, we discuss the
simplest three dots conditional phase gate, and we found that the fidelity of
conditional phase gate depends strongly on the configuration and temperature.
Numerical simulation shows that line-configuration resonant with lower single
exciton energy level performs better during the gate operation.
