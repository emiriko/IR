In this paper, with the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity, we first present a
special experimental scheme called C-path gate with which the realization of
all possible bipartite POVMs of two-photon polarization states can be simpler
and nearly deterministic. Following the same technique, the schemes of the
realization of quantum control gates have been proposed, including the CNOT
gate (1/2), Fredkin gate (1/8), Toffoli gate (2/23), CU gate and even MCU gate.
All these gates are scalable with the certain probabilities which are larger
than those gates in linear optics. Less resource are required and the
structures of these gates are so simple that we think they are feasible with
current technology and may be useful for the realization of universal
computation in optics.
