Wormhole and time machine are very interesting objects in general relativity.
However, they need exotic matters which are impossible in classical level to
support them. But if we introduce the quantum effects of gravity into the
stress-energy tensor, these peculiar objects can be constructed
self-consistently. Fortunately, loop quantum cosmology (LQC) has the potential
to serve as a bridge connecting the classical theory and quantum gravity.
Therefore it provides a simple way for the study of quantum effect in the
semiclassical case. As is well known, loop quantum cosmology is very successful
to deal with the behavior of early universe. In the early stage, if taken the
quantum effect into consideration, inflation is natural because of the
violation of every kind of local energy conditions. Similar to the inflationary
universe, the violation of the averaged null energy condition is the necessary
condition for the traversable wormholes. In this paper, we investigate the
averaged null energy condition in LQC in the framework of effective
Hamiltonian, and find out that LQC do violate the averaged null energy
condition in the massless scalar field coupled model.
