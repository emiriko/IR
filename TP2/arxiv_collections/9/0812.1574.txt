In this paper we provide a possible realization of Penrose's idea of
nonlinear gravitons using a new description of nonmetric general relativity. In
the addressal of issues surrounding the normalizability of the Kodama state and
its reliability as a ground state for gravity, we expand the theory in
fluctuations about the Kodama state. This produces a theory of complex gravity
with a well-defined Hilbert space structure, whose quantization we carry out
both at the linearized level and in the full nonlinear theory. The results of
this paper demonstrate the preservation of the physical degrees of freedom of
the full nonlinear theory under linearization, as well provide a Hilbert space
of states of the former annihilated by the quantum Hamiltonian constraint.
