We consider the distribution of cycles in two models of random permutations,
that are related to one another. In the first model, cycles receive a weight
that depends on their length. The second model deals with permutations of
points in the space and there is an additional weight that involves the length
of permutation jumps. We prove the occurrence of infinite macroscopic cycles
above a certain critical density.
