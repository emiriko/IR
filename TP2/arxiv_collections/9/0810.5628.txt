When the bilocal heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) operator for the B-meson
distribution amplitude has a light-like distance t between the quark and
antiquark fields, the scale \sim 1/t separates the UV and IR regions, which
induce the cusp singularity in radiative corrections and the mixing of
multiparticle states in nonperturbative corrections, respectively. We treat
these notorious UV and IR behaviors simultaneously using the operator product
expansion, with the local operators of dimension $d \le 5$ and radiative
corrections at order \alpha_s for the corresponding Wilson coefficients. The
result is derived in the coordinate space, which manifests the Wilson
coefficients with Sudakov-type double logarithms and the higher-dimensional
operators with additional gluons. This result yields the B-meson distribution
amplitude for t less than \sim 1 GeV^{-1}, in terms of $\bar{\Lambda}=m_B -
m_b$ and the two additional HQET parameters as matrix elements of dimension-5
operators. The impact of these novel HQET parameters on the integral relevant
to exclusive B decays, \lambda_B, is also discussed.
