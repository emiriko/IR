The reflectivity of a highly localized magnetic inhomogeneity is
experimentally studied. The inhomogeneity is created by a dc-current carrying
wire placed on the surface of a ferrite film. The reflection of propagating
dipole-dominated spin-wave pulses is found to be strongly dependent on the
spin-wave frequency if the current locally increases the magnetic field. In the
opposite case the frequency dependence is negligible.
