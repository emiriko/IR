The TOTEM experiment at the LHC measures the total proton-proton cross
section with the luminosity-independent method and the elastic proton-proton
cross-section over a wide |t|-range. It also performs a comprehensive study of
diffraction, spanning from cross-section measurements of individual diffractive
processes to the analysis of their event topologies. Hard diffraction will be
studied in collaboration with CMS taking advantage of the large common rapidity
coverage for charged and neutral particle detection and the large variety of
trigger possibilities even at large luminosities. TOTEM will take data under
all LHC beam conditions including standard high luminosity runs to maximize its
physics reach. This contribution describes the main features of the TOTEM
physics programme including measurements to be made in the early LHC runs. In
addition, a novel scheme to extend the diffractive proton acceptance for high
luminosity runs by installing proton detectors at IP3 is described.
