The dynamical breaking of gauge symmetry in the supersymmetric quantum
electrodynamics in three-dimensional spacetime is studied at two-loop
approximation. At this level, the effective superpotential is evaluated in a
supersymmetric phase. At one-loop order, we observe a generation of the
Chern-Simons term due to a parity violating term present in the classical
action. At two-loop order, the scalar background superfield acquires a
nonvanishing vacuum expectation value, generating a mass term
$A^{\alpha}A_{\alpha}$ through Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. It is observed that
the mass of gauge superfield is predominantly an effect of the topological
Chern-Simons term.
