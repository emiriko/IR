Top quarks may be produced in large numbers in association with new physics
at the LHC. The polarization of these top quarks probes the chiral structure of
the new physics. We discuss several kinematic distributions which are sensitive
to the polarization of single top quarks and can be used without full event
reconstruction. For collimated tops we construct polarization-sensitive
observables for both hadronic and leptonic decay modes and plot their
distributions. We compute the observable polarization signals from top quarks
produced in the on-shell cascade decay of a stop squark into a top quark and a
neutralino, as well as top quarks produced in the analogous decay chain in
same-spin partner models.
