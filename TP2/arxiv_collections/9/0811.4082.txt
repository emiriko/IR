We propose a new mechanism to induce a novel one-magnon excitation by the
electric component of light in cycloidal spin states, i.e. so called
electromagnon process. We calculated optical spectra in the cycloidal spin
structures as observed in multiferroic perovskite manganites RMnO3 where novel
magnetic excitations induced by oscillating electric fields are observed. When
symmetric spin-dependent electric polarizations are introduced, we have light
absorptions at terahertz frequencies with one- and two-magnon excitations
driven by the electric component of light. Our results show that some parts of
optical spectra observed experimentally at terahertz frequencies are one-magnon
excitation absorptions.
