The optical coupling of guided modes in a GaP waveguide to nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers in diamond is demonstrated. The electric field penetration into
diamond and the loss of the guided mode are measured. The results indicate that
the GaP-diamond system could be useful for realizing coupled microcavity-NV
devices for quantum information processing in diamond.
