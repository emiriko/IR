We report the observation of a highly unusual Hall current in the MnSi in an
applied pressure P = 6-12 kbar. The Hall conductivity displays a distinctive
step-wise field profile quite unlike any other Hall response observed in
solids. We identify the origin of this Hall current with the effective
real-space magnetic field due to chiral spin textures, which may be a precursor
of the partial-order state at P>14.6 kbar. We discuss evidence favoring the
chiral spin mechanism for the origin of the observed Hall anomaly.
