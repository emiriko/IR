In the half century since the 1950s computer simulation has transformed our
understanding of physics. The rare, expensive, slow, and bulky mainframes of
World War II have given way to today's millions of cheap, fast, desksized
workstations and personal computers. As a result of these changes, the
theoretical formal view of physics has gradually shifted, so as to focus on the
pragmatic and useful. General but vague approaches are being superceded by
specific results for definite models. During this evolving change of emphasis I
learned, developed, and described my simulation skills at Michigan, at Duke, at
Livermore, and in Nevada, while forming increasingly wide-ranging contacts
around the world. Computation is now pervasive in all the scientific fields. My
own focus has been on the physics of particle simulations, mainly away from
equilibrium. I outline my particle work here. It has led me to a model-based
understanding of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium physics. There are still
some gaps. There is still much to do.
