We consider the metric perturbations around a stationary rotating Nambu-Goto
string in Minkowski spacetime. By solving the linearized Einstein equations, we
study the effects of azimuthal frame-dragging around the rotation axis and
linear frame-dragging along the rotation axis, the Newtonian logarithmic
potential, and the angular deficit around the string as the potential mode. We
also investigate gravitational waves propagating off the string and propagating
along the string, and show that the stationary rotating string emits
gravitational waves toward the directions specified by discrete angles from the
rotation axis. Waveforms, polarizations, and amplitudes which depend on the
direction are shown explicitly.
