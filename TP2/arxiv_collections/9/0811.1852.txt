This paper presents the design and results of detailed tests of a CMOS active
pixel chip for charged particle detection with in-pixel charge storage for
correlated double sampling and readout in rolling shutter mode at frequencies
up to 25 MHz. This detector is developed in the framework of R&D for the Vertex
Tracker for a future e+e- Linear Collider.
