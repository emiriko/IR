We demonstrate that strong suppression of the relative production rate
(d+Au)/(p+p) of inclusive high-pT hadrons at forward rapidities observed at
RHIC is due to parton multiple rescatterings in nuclear matter. The light-cone
dipole approach-based calculations are in a good agreement with BRAHMS and STAR
data. They also indicate a significant nuclear suppression at midrapidities
with a weak onset of the coherence effects. This prediction is supported by the
preliminary d+Au data from the PHENIX Collaboration. Moreover, since similar
suppression pattern is also expected to show up at lower energies where effects
of parton saturation are not expected, we are able to exclude from the
interpretation of observed phenomena models based on the Color Glass
Condensate.
