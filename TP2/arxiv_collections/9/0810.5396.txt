The mass spectra of doubly heavy baryons are systematically calculated in the
framework of QCD sum rules. With a tentative heavy-diquark--light-quark
configuration, the interpolating currents representing the doubly heavy baryons
are proposed. Contributions of the operators up to dimension six are included
in operator product expansion. The numerical results are compatible with other
theoretical predictions, which may support the $(QQ)-(q)$ structure of doubly
heavy baryons.
