The relativistic four-quark equations in the framework of the dispersion
relation technique are derived. The four-quark amplitudes of the scalar
tetraquarks with open bottom, including u, d, s and bottom quarks, are
constructed. The poles of these amplitudes determine the masses and widths of
scalar tetraquarks.
