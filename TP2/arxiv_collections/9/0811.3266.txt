We perform a systematic study of the masses of charmed and bottom baryons in
the framework of the QCD sum rule approach. Contributions of the operators up
to dimension six are included in operator product expansion. The resulting
heavy baryon masses from the calculations are well consistent with the
experimental values, and predictions to the spectroscopy of the unobserved
bottom baryons are also presented.
