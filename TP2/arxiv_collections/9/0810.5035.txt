It has been noticed that the critical current density Jc of some of the
superconducting samples, calculated on the basis of Bean model, increases with
increasing magnetic field H up to a significant range above H=0. This is an
inconsistent behavior of Jc since the theory of Kim and the theories based on
vortex dynamics, all, lead to decreasing Jc with increasing H for H > 0. It has
been argued that a realistic variation of Jc for low H may be obtained within
Bean framework by redefining the width of the hysteresis loop. The new
definition of the loop width is guided by the requirement that Jc stays as
close to the Jc of the theory of Kim as possible. Illustrative calculations of
Jc show its considerable enhancement over the Bean values.
