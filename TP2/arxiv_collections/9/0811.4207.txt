By combining aspects of the coherent and self intermediate scattering
functions, measured by dynamical light scattering on a suspension of hard
sphere-like particles, we show that the arrest of particle number density
fluctuations spreads from the position of the main structure factor peak.
Taking the velocity auto-correlation function into account we propose that as
density fluctuations are arrested the system's ability to respond to diffusing
momentum currents is impaired and, accordingly, the viscosity increases. From
the stretching of the coherent intermediate scattering function we read a
quantitative manifestation of the undissipated thermal energy, the source of
those, ergodicity restoring, processes that short-circuit the sharp transition
to a perfect glass.
