PAMELA and ATIC recently reported excesses in e+ e- cosmic rays. Since the
interpretation in terms of DM annihilations was found to be not easily
compatible with constraints from photon observations, we consider the DM decay
hypothesis and find that it can explain the e+ e- excesses compatibly with all
constraints, and can be tested by dedicated HESS observations of the Galactic
Ridge. ATIC data indicate a DM mass of about 2 TeV: this mass naturally implies
the observed DM abundance relative to ordinary matter if DM is a quasi-stable
composite particle with a baryon-like matter asymmetry. Technicolor naturally
yields these type of candidates.
