We consider three-dimensional maximally superconformal
Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) theory and its topologically gauged version
(constructed recently in arXiv:0809.4478 [hep-th]) in the light-cone gauge.
After eliminating the entire Chern-Simons gauge field, the ungauged BLG theory
looks more conventional and, apart from the order of the interaction terms,
resembles N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. The light-cone
superspace version of the BLG theory is given to quadratic and quartic order
and some problems with constructing the sixth order interaction terms are
discussed. In the topologically gauged case, we analyze the field equations
related to the three Chern-Simons type terms of N=8 conformal supergravity and
discuss some of the special features of this theory and its couplings to BLG.
