We estimate the CP asymmetry A_{CP}(q^2) in the decays B --> X_s mu+ mu- and
B --> X_d mu+ mu- in the standard model (SM) with an additional fourth
generation. We use a parametrization that allows us to explore the complete
parameter space of the 4X4 quark mixing matrix, and constrain these parameters
from the current data on B decays. We find that the enhancement in A_{CP}(q^2)
depends strongly on the mass of the t', the up-type quark in the fourth
generation. For m_t' around 400 GeV, the CP asymmetry in the high-q^2 region
(q^2 > 14.4 GeV^2) can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude for B -->
X_s mu+ mu- and up to a factor of 6 for B --> X_d mu+ mu-. There is no
enhancement in the low-q^2 region (1< q^2 <6 GeV^2). With increasing m_t', the
A_{CP}(q^2) in the high-q^2 (low-q^2) region first decreases (increases) and
then saturates at a value a few times the SM prediction. In the high-q^2 region
of B --> X_s mu+ mu-, this saturation value may be up to 25 times the SM
expectation.
