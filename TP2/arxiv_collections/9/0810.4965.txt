A review of the most popular Linear Multistep (LM) Methods for solving
Ordinary Differential Equations numerically is presented. These methods are
first derived from first principles, and are discussed in terms of their order,
consistency, and various types of stability. Particular varieties of stability
that may not be familiar, are briefly defined first. The methods that are
included are the Adams-Bashforth Methods, Adams-Moulton Methods, and Backwards
Differentiation Formulas. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are
also described. Not much prior knowledge of numerical methods or ordinary
differential equations is required, although knowledge of basic topics from
calculus is assumed.
