From the integration of non-symmetrical hyperboles, a one-parameter
generalization of the logarithmic function is obtained. Inverting this
function, one obtains the generalized exponential function. We show that
functions characterizing complex systems can be conveniently written in terms
of this generalization of the exponential function. The gamma function is then
generalized and we generalize the factorial operation. Also a very reliable
rank distribution can be conveniently described by the generalized exponential
function. Finally, we turn the attention to the generalization of one- and
two-tail stretched exponential functions. One obtains, as particular cases, the
generalized error function, the Zipf-Mandelbrot probability density function
(pdf), the generalized gaussian and Laplace pdf. One can also obtain
analytically their cumulative functions and moments.
