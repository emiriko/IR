We study the effects of cotunneling and a non-uniform Zeeman splitting on the
stationary and transient leakage current through a double quantum dot in the
Pauli spin blockade regime. We find that the stationary current due to
cotunneling vanishes at low temperature and large applied magnetic field,
allowing for the dynamical preparation of a pure spin ground state, even at
large voltage bias. Additionally, we analyze current that flows between
blocking events, characterized, in general, by a fractional effective charge
$e^*$. This charge can be used as a sensitive probe of spin relaxation
mechanisms and can be used to determine the visibility of Rabi oscillations.
