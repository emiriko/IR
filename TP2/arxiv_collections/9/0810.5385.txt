We investigate thermodynamical properties of quantum electrodynamics in 1+1
dimensions. Discrete light cone quantization is used to compute the partition
function of the canonical ensemble and the thermodynamical potential. The
potential is evaluated for different system sizes and coupling strengths. We
perform the continuum limit and the thermodynamical limit and present basic
thermodynamical quantities as a function of temperature for the interacting
system. A more accurate estimation of low lying bound state masses at
non-perturbative coupling strength are determined due to the higher harmonic
resolution.
