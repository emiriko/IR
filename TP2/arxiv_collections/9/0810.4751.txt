A measurement of the forward-backward charge asymmetry in top-antitop
(t\bar{t}) pair production in proton-antiproton (p\bar{p}) collisions is
presented. The asymmetry is measured for different jet multiplicities in the
lepton+jets final state on 0.9 fb^{-1} of data collected by the D0 experiment
at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The result is sensitive to new physics,
which is demonstrated by setting an upper limit on t\bar{t} production via
heavy neutral gauge bosons (Z^{\prime}).
