Motivated by the results of the recent experimental discoveries for charm and
bottom baryons, the masses and magnetic moments of the heavy baryons with
$J^P=3/2^+$ containing a single heavy quark are studied within light cone QCD
sum rules method. Our results on the masses of heavy baryons are in good
agreement with predictions of other approaches, as well as with the existing
experimental data.
