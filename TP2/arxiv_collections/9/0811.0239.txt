On the basis of the classical dislocation theory, the Solid Solution
Hardening (SSH) is commonly ascribed to the pinning of the edge dislocations.
At the atomic level, the theoretical study of the dislocation cores contrasts
with such a prediction. Using the static molecular simulations with some
interatomic effective potentials, we demonstrate numerically that the critical
resolved shear stress associated to a screw dislocation in a random Ni(Al)
single crystal has same order as the edge one. Such a result is imposed by the
details of the dislocation stacking fault and the core dissociation into
Shockley partials. The SSH statistical theory is employed to tentatively
predict analytically the data acquired through our atomistic simulations at
different Al concentration.
