We consider zero temperature behavior of dynamic response functions of 1D
systems near edges of support in momentum-energy plane $(k, \omega).$ The
description of the singularities of dynamic response functions near an edge
$\epsilon(k)$ is given by the effective Hamiltonian of a mobile impurity moving
in a Luttinger liquid. For Galilean-invariant systems, we relate the parameters
of such an effective Hamiltonian to the properties of the function $\epsilon
(k).$ This allows us to express the exponents which characterize singular
response functions of spinless bosonic or fermionic liquids in terms of
$\epsilon(k)$ and Luttinger liquid parameters for any $k.$ For an
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in a zero magnetic field, SU(2)
invariance fixes the exponents from purely phenomenological considerations.
