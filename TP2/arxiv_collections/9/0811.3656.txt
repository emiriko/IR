We present a geometric characterization of the ferrotoroidic moment in terms
of a set of Abelian Berry phases. We also introduce a fundamental complex
quantity which provides an alternative way to calculate the ferrotoroidic
moment and its moments, and is derived from a second order tensor. This
geometric framework defines a natural computational approach for density
functional and many-body theories.
