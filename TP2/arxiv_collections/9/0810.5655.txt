In the popular approach of "Bayesian variable selection" (BVS), one uses
prior and posterior distributions to select a subset of candidate variables to
enter the model. A completely new direction will be considered here to study
BVS with a Gibbs posterior originating in statistical mechanics. The Gibbs
posterior is constructed from a risk function of practical interest (such as
the classification error) and aims at minimizing a risk function without
modeling the data probabilistically. This can improve the performance over the
usual Bayesian approach, which depends on a probability model which may be
misspecified. Conditions will be provided to achieve good risk performance,
even in the presence of high dimensionality, when the number of candidate
variables "$K$" can be much larger than the sample size "$n$." In addition, we
develop a convenient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to implement BVS with
the Gibbs posterior.
