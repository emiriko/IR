Masses of the ground state light tetraquarks are dynamically calculated in
the framework of the relativistic diquark-antidiquark picture. The internal
structure of the diquark is taken into account by calculating the form factor
of the diquark-gluon interaction in terms of the overlap integral of the
diquark wave functions. It is found that scalar mesons with masses below 1 GeV:
f_0(600) (\sigma), K^*_0(800) (\kappa), f_0(980) and a_0(980) agree well with
the light tetraquark interpretation.
