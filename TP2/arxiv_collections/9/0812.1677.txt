The widely accepted interpretation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment assumes
the objective atomic trajectories (the "classical trajectories") in front of
the screen. Following this interpretation, we perform an {\it ab initio}
analysis of the experiment and conclude that the objective trajectories do not
physically exist. The alternative to our conclusion is substantially to change
the model of the experiment.
