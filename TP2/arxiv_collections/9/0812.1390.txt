We address the problem of curvature estimation from sampled compact sets. The
main contribution is a stability result: we show that the gaussian, mean or
anisotropic curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K with positive
$\mu$-reach can be estimated by the same curvature measures of the offset of a
compact set K' close to K in the Hausdorff sense. We show how these curvature
measures can be computed for finite unions of balls. The curvature measures of
the offset of a compact set with positive $\mu$-reach can thus be approximated
by the curvature measures of the offset of a point-cloud sample. These results
can also be interpreted as a framework for an effective and robust notion of
curvature.
