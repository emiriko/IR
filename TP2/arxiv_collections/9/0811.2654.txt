Decoherence may significantly affect the polarization state of optical pulses
propagating in dispersive media because of the unavoidable presence of more
than a single frequency in the envelope of the pulse. Here we report on the
suppression of polarization decoherence in a ring cavity obtained by properly
retooling for photonic qubits the ``bang-bang'' protection technique already
employed for nuclear spins and nuclear-quadrupole qubits. Our results show that
bang-bang control can be profitably extended to quantum information processes
involving flying polarization qubits.
