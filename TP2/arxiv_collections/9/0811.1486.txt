Spectra of Kaluza-Klein gauge fields are calculated at the background of the
magnetic fluxbrane throat-like solution of the Type IIA supergravity equations.
Magnetic flux plays the role of Higgs scalar generating the electroweak scale
mass of non-abelian KK gauge field. The same "flux-Higgs" mechanism gives the
scale of the "second mass hierarchy", 0.001 eV, in the spectrum of KK
excitations at the background of the throat deformed in a Reissner-Nordstrom
way. Gauge coupling constants in 4 dimensions are calculated; they prove to be
of the physically sensible values for the EW scale massive modes of the gauge
fields and are extremely small for the long range gauge fields. 5D effective
Action with the flux-generated mass terms of the KK gauge fields associated
with isometries of compactified subspaces is put down, correspondence of the
"classical" KK approach and dual holography approach to the low-dimensional
gauge theories is discussed, and idea of Bootstrap Holography is set forth.
