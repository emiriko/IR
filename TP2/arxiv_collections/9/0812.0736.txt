The task management is a critical component for the computational grids. The
aim is to assign tasks on nodes according to a global scheduling policy and a
view of local resources of nodes. A peer-to-peer approach for the task
management involves a better scalability for the grid and a higher fault
tolerance. But some mechanisms have to be proposed to avoid the computation of
replicated tasks that can reduce the efficiency and increase the load of nodes.
In the same way, these mechanisms have to limit the number of exchanged
messages to avoid the overload of the network.
  In a previous paper, we have proposed two methods for the task management
called active and passive. These methods are based on a random walk: they are
fully distributed and fault tolerant. Each node owns a local tasks states set
updated thanks to a random walk and each node is in charge of the local
assignment. Here, we propose three methods to improve the efficiency of the
active method. These new methods are based on a circulating word. The nodes
local tasks states sets are updated thanks to periodical diffusions along trees
built from the circulating word. Particularly, we show that these methods
increase the efficiency of the active method: they produce less replicated
tasks. These three methods are also fully distributed and fault tolerant. On
the other way, the circulating word can be exploited for other applications
like the resources management or the nodes synchronization.
