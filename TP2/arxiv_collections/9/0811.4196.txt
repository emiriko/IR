The forward limit of the chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs)
and their lower moments are investigated within the framework of the chiral
quark soliton model (CQSM), with particular emphasis upon the transversity
decomposition of nucleon angular momentum proposed by Burkardt. A strong
correlation between quark spin and orbital angular momentum inside the nucleon
is manifest itself in the derived second moment sum rule within the CQSM,
thereby providing with an additional support to the qualitative connection
between chiral-odd GPDs and the Boer-Mulders effects. We further confirm
isoscalar dominance of the corresponding first moment sum rule, which indicates
that the Boer-Mulders functions for the $u$- and $d$-quarks have roughly equal
magnitude with the same sign. Also made are some comments on the recent
empirical extraction of the tensor charges of the nucleon by Anselmino et al.
We demonstrate that a comparison of their result with any theoretical
predictions must be done with great care, in consideration of fairly strong
scale dependence of tensor charges, especially at lower renormalization scale.
