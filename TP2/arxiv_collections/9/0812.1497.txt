The ArDM experiment, a 1 ton liquid argon TPC/Calorimeter, is designed for
the detection of dark matter particles which can scatter off the spinless argon
nuclei. These events producing a recoiling nucleus will be discerned by their
light to charge ratio, as well as the time structure of the scintillation
light. The experiment is presently under construction and will be commissioned
on surface at CERN. Here we describe the detector concept and give a short
review on the main detector components.
