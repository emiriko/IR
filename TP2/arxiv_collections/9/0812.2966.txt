We present a calculation of the three-quark core contribution to the mass of
the Delta-baryon in a Poincare-covariant Faddeev framework. A consistent setup
for the dressed-quark propagator, the quark-quark and quark-diquark
interactions is used, where all the ingredients are solutions of their
respective Dyson-Schwinger or Bethe-Salpeter equations in rainbow-ladder
truncation. We discuss the evolution of the Delta mass with the current-quark
mass and compare to the previously obtained mass of the nucleon.
