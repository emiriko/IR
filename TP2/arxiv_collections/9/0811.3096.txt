A detailed exposition is made of recent transport and 'quantum oscillation'
results from HTSC systems covering the full range from overdoped to underdoped
material. This now very extensive and high quality data set is interpreted here
within the framework developed by the author of local pairs and boson-fermion
resonance, arising in the context of negative-U behaviour in an inhomogeneous
electronic environment. The strong inhomogeneity comes with the mixed-valent
condition of these materials, which when underdoped lie in close proximity to
the Mott-Anderson transition. The observed intense scattering is presented as
resulting from pair formation and electron-boson collisions in the resonant
crossover circumstance. The high level of scattering brings the systems to
incoherence in the pseudogapped state, p < pc (= 0.183). In a high magnetic
field the striped partition of the inhomogeneous charge distribution is much
strengthened and regularized. Magnetization and resistance oscillations, of
period dictated by the favoured positioning of the square fluxon array within
the real space environment of the diagonal 2D charge striping array, are
demonstrated to be responsible for the recently reported behaviour hitherto
widely attributed to the quantum oscillation response of a much more standard
Fermi liquid condition. A detailed analysis embracing all the experimental data
serves to indicate that in the given conditions of very high field, low
temperature, 2D-striped, underdoped, d-wave superconducting, HTSC material the
flux quantum becomes doubled to h/e.
