We prove a local in time existence and uniqueness theorem of classical
solutions of the coupled Einstein--Euler system, and therefore establish the
well posedness of this system. We use the condition that the energy density
might vanish or tends to zero at infinity and that the pressure is a certain
function of the energy density, conditions which are used to describe
simplified stellar models. In order to achieve our goals we are enforced, by
the complexity of the problem, to deal with these equations in a new type of
weighted Sobolev spaces of fractional order. Beside their construction, we
develop tools for PDEs and techniques for elliptic and hyperbolic equations in
these spaces. The well posedness is obtained in these spaces. The results
obtained are related to and generalize earlier works of Rendall for the
Euler-Einstein system under the restriction of time symmetry and of Gamblin for
the simpler Euler--Poisson system.
