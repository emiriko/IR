We prove that a Schur function of rectangular shape $(M^n)$ whose variables
are specialized to $x_1,x_1^{-1},...,x_n,x_n^{-1}$ factorizes into a product of
two odd orthogonal characters of rectangular shape, one of which is evaluated
at $-x_1,...,-x_n$, if $M$ is even, while it factorizes into a product of a
symplectic character and an even orthogonal character, both of rectangular
shape, if $M$ is odd. It is furthermore shown that the first factorization
implies a factorization theorem for rhombus tilings of a hexagon, which has an
equivalent formulation in terms of plane partitions. A similar factorization
theorem is proven for the sum of two Schur functions of respective rectangular
shapes $(M^n)$ and $(M^{n-1})$.
