We report on light emission from high-Q neodymium-implanted silica
microtoroids. Following the description of the fabrication process of
microtoroids, neodymium light emission is analysed. This emission is coupled to
various cavity modes. Using evanescent wave coupling we achieve selective
detection of Whispering Gallery Modes of a microtoroid.
