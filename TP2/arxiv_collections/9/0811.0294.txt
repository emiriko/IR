Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), stellar-mass compact objects (SCOs)
inspiralling into a massive black hole, are one of the main sources of
gravitational waves expected for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
To extract the EMRI signals from the expected LISA data stream, which will also
contain the instrumental noise as well as other signals, we need very accurate
theoretical templates of the gravitational waves that they produce. In order to
construct those templates we need to account for the gravitational
backreaction, that is, how the gravitational field of the SCO affects its own
trajectory. In general relativity, the backreaction can be described in terms
of a local self-force, and the foundations to compute it have been laid
recently. Due to its complexity, some parts of the calculation of the
self-force have to be performed numerically. Here, we report on an ongoing
effort towards the computation of the self-force based on time-domain
multi-grid pseudospectral methods.
