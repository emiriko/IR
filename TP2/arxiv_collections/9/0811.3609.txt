Most attempts to argue for the second law of thermodynamics fail because (1)
they use the unviable frequency theory of probability and (2) they do not
explain why the arrow of time seen in experiments is aligned with the
thermodynamic arrow of time. I use the decision theoretic interpretation of
quantum probability from the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to
solve the probability problem. I then derive a correlation between the
knowledge arrow of time and the entropy arrow of time using physical
constraints on knowledge creation imposed by Popper's evolutionary theory of
knowledge and the many worlds interpretation.
