Motivated by the Green-Griffiths conjecture, we study maximal rank
holomorphic maps from $\C^p$ into complex manifolds. When $p>1$ such maps
should in principle be more tractable than entire curves. We extend to this
setting the jet-bundles techniques introduced by Semple, Green-Griffiths and
Demailly. Our main application is the non-existence of maximal rank holomorphic
maps from $\C^2$ into the very general degree $d$ hypersurface in $\bP^4$, as
soon as $d\geq 93.$
