We discuss a nonperturbative mechanism for generation of the single-spin
asymmetries in hadron interactions. It is based on the chiral quark model
combined with unitarity and impact parameter picture and provides explanation
for the experimental regularities observed under the measurements of the spin
asymmetries.
