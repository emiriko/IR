The network concept is increasingly used for the description of complex
systems. Here we summarize key aspects of the evolvability and robustness of
the hierarchical network-set of macromolecules, cells, organisms, and
ecosystems. Listing the costs and benefits of cooperation as a necessary
behaviour to build this network hierarchy, we outline the major hypothesis of
the paper: the emergence of hierarchical complexity needs cooperation leading
to the ageing (i.e. gradual deterioration) of the constituent networks. A
stable environment develops cooperation leading to over-optimization, and
forming an "always-old" network, which accumulates damage, and dies in an
apoptosis-like process. A rapidly changing environment develops competition
forming a "forever-young" network, which may suffer an occasional
over-perturbation exhausting system-resources, and causing death in a
necrosis-like process. Giving a number of examples we demonstrate how
cooperation evokes the gradual accumulation of damage typical to ageing.
Finally, we show how various forms of cooperation and consequent ageing emerge
as key elements in all major steps of evolution from the formation of
protocells to the establishment of the globalized, modern human society.
