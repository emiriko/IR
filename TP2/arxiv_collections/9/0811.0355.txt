We briefly review existing proposals for the renormalization of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and study the numerical effects of
several of them on the W-boson hadronic partial decay widths. We then use these
results to evaluate the relative shifts on the CKM parameters |V_{ij}|^2
induced by the quark mixing renormalization effects, as well as their scheme
dependence. We also discuss the implications of this analysis for the most
precise unitarity test of the CKM matrix.
