We study transport through a single channel t-stub geometry strongly coupled
to a superconducting reservoir. In contrast to the standard stub geometry which
has both transmission resonances and anti-resonances in the coherent limit, we
find that due to the proximity effect, this geometry shows neither a T=1
resonance (T is the transmission probability for electrons incident on the
t-stub) nor a T=0 anti-resonance as we vary the energy of the incident
electron. Instead, we find that there is only one resonant value at T=1/4,
where charge transport vanishes while the spin transport is perfect.
