Atmospheric pressure plasma jet can protrude some 5.0 cm into air. It holds
promise for multivarious innovative applications, but its formation mechanism
remains unsettled. We show that the plasma jet is essentially a streamer corona
totally independent of, but obscured by, dielectric barrier discharge.
Consequently, the jets can be equally successfully generated even with one
single bare metal electrode attached to the tube orifice, both downstream and
upstream simultaneously, and at a significantly reduced voltage. These results
will help understand the underlying physics and facilitate a safer and more
flexible implementation of this marvelous plasma source.
