There exists a large number of experimental and theoretical results
supporting the picture of "macroscopic qubits" implemented, for instance, by
Rydberg atoms, Josephson junctions or Bose-Einstein condensates - the systems
which should rather emerge in localized semiclassical states. In this note it
is shown how, under realistic conditions, the false qubit interpretation can be
consistent with the restricted set of experimental data collected for
semiclassical systems. The recent experiments displaying semiclassical
character of Bose-Einstein condensates and possible quantumness tests for a
single system are briefly invoked also.
