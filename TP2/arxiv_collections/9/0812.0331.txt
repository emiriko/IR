The prediction of the equation of state and the phase behavior of simple
fluids (noble gases, carbon dioxide, benzene, methane, short alkane chains) and
their mixtures by Monte Carlo computer simulation and analytic approximations
based on thermodynamic perturbation theory is discussed. Molecules are
described by coarse grained (CG) models, where either the whole molecule
(carbon dioxide, benzene, methane) or a group of a few successive CH_2 groups
(in the case of alkanes) are lumped into an effective point particle.
Interactions among these point particles are fitted by Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potentials such that the vapor-liquid critical point of the fluid is reproduced
in agreement with experiment; in the case of quadrupolar molecules a
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is included. These models are shown to
provide a satisfactory description of the liquid-vapour phase diagram of these
pure fluids. Investigations of mixtures, using the Lorentz-Berthelot (LB)
combining rule, also produce satisfactory results if compared with experiment,
while in some previous attempts (in which polar solvents were modelled without
explicitly taking into account quadrupolar interaction), strong violations of
the LB rules were required. For this reason, the present investigation is a
step towards predictive modelling of polar mixtures at low computational cost.
These very simple coarse-grained models of small molecules developed here
should be useful e.g. for simulations of polymer solutions with such molecules
as solvent.
