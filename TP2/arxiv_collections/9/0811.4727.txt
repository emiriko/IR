The ion-sputtering (IS) process is active in many planetary environments in
the Solar System where plasma precipitates directly on the surface (for
instance, Mercury, Moon, Europa). In particular, solar-wind sputtering is one
of the most important agents for the surface erosion of a Near-Earth Object
(NEO), acting together with other surface release processes, such as Photon
Stimulated Desorption (PSD), Thermal Desorption (TD) and Micrometeoroid Impact
Vaporization (MIV). The energy distribution of the IS-released neutrals peaks
at a few eVs and extends up to hundreds of eVs. Since all other release
processes produce particles of lower energies, the presence of neutral atoms in
the energy range above 10 eV and below a few keVs (Sputtered High-Energy Atoms
- SHEA) identifies the IS process. SHEA easily escape from the NEO, due to
NEO's extremely weak gravity. Detection and analysis of SHEA will give
important information on surface-loss processes as well as on surface elemental
composition. The investigation of the active release processes, as a function
of the external conditions and the NEO surface properties, is crucial for
obtaining a clear view of the body's present loss rate as well as for getting
clues on its evolution, which depends significantly on space weather. In this
work, an attempt to analyze the processes that take place on the surface of
these small airless bodies, as a result of their exposure to the space
environment, has been realized. For this reason a new space weathering model
(Space Weathering on NEO - SPAWN), is presented. Moreover, an instrument
concept of a neutral-particle analyzer specifically designed for the
measurement of neutral density and the detection of SHEA from a NEO is proposed
