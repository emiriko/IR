In the framework of the instanton vacuum model we make expansion over the
current mass $m$ and number of colors $N_c$ and evaluate ${\cal O}(1/N_c, m,
m/N_c, m \ln m/N_c)$-corrections to the dynamical quark mass $M$, the quark
condensate $<\bar qq>$, the pion mass $M_\pi$ and decay constant $F_\pi$. We
found the SU(2) $\chi$PT low-energy constants $\bar l_3, \bar l_4$ in a good
correspondence with the phenomenology and lattice calculations.
