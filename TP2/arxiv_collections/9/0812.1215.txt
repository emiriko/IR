The electronic structure and lattice vibrational frequencies of the newly
discovered superconductors, LiFeAs and NaFeAs, are calculated within density
functional theory. We show that in the vicinity of the Fermi energy, the
density of states is dominated by contributions from Fe 3d states. We also
calculate the electron-phonon coupling strength and show that it is too weak to
account for the observed values of the superconducting transition temperatures.
This seems to indicate that the iron-based superconductors are not of the
conventional type.
