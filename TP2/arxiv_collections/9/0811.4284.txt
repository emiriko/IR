We consider elastic single-particle scattering from a one-dimensional
two-component trapped superfluid Fermi gas when the incoming projectile
particle is identical to one of the confined species. Our theoretical treatment
is based on the Hartree-Fock ground state of the trapped gas and a
configuration-interaction description of the excitations. We determine the
scattering phase shifts for the system and predict Fano-type scattering
resonances that are a direct consequence of inter-atomic pairing. We describe
the main characteristics of the scattering resonances and make a comparison
with the results of BCS mean-field theory.
