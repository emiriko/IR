We consider a fractional Josephson vortex in an infinitely long 0-kappa
Josephson junction. A uniform bias current applied to the junction exerts a
Lorentz force acting on a vortex. When the bias current becomes equal to the
critical (or depinning) current, the Lorentz force tears away an integer fluxon
and the junction switches to the resistive state. In the presence of thermal
and quantum fluctuations this escape process takes place with finite
probability already at subcritical values of the bias current. We analyze the
escape of a fractional vortex by mapping the Josephson phase dynamics to the
dynamics of a single particle in a metastable potential and derive the
effective parameters of this potential. This allows us to predict the behavior
of the escape rate as a function of the topological charge of the vortex.
