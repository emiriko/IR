We propose a new class of resonant electromagnetic structures, and study
their response to free-space illumination. The structures consist of partial
cylindrical shells that have cloaking material properties proposed by Pendry et
al. These metamaterial shells have apertures that allow the propagation of
incident irradiation into an interior resonant cavity. We use full wave
time-harmonic analysis to study the field distribution inside the cavity, and
show that an analogue of Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs) can be efficiently
excited via free-space illumination.
