We examine the response of a plane wave incident on a flat surface of a
medium characterized by simultaneously negative electric and magnetic
susceptibilities by solving Maxwell's equations explicitly and without making
any assumptions on the way. In the literature up to date, it has been assumed
that negative refractive materials are necessarily frequency dispersive. We
propose an alternative to this assumption by suggesting that the requirement of
positive energy density should be relaxed, and discuss the implications of such
a proposal. More specifically, we show that once negative energy solutions are
accepted, the necessity for frequency dispersion is no longer necessary.
Finally, we argue that, for the purposes of discussing negative index
materials, the use of group velocity as the physically significant quantity is
misleading, and suggest that any discussion involving it should be carefully
reconsidered.
