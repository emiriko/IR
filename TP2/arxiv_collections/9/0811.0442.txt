We derive an effective action of the bosonic sector of the Standard Model by
integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom in the worldline approach. The
CP violation due to the complex phase in the CKM matrix gives rise to
CP-violating operators in the effective action. We calculate the prefactor of
the appropriate next-to-leading order operators and give general estimates of
CP violation in the bosonic sector of the Standard Model. In particular, we
show that the effective CP violation for weak gauge fields is not suppressed by
the Yukawa couplings of the light quarks and is much larger than the bound
given by the Jarlskog determinant.
