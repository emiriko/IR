In the present paper we investigate the onset of the pasta phase with
different parametrisations of the density dependent hadronic model and compare
the results with one of the usual parametrisation of the non-linear Walecka
model. The influence of the scalar-isovector virtual delta meson is shown. At
zero temperature two different methods are used, one based on coexistent phases
and the other on the Thomas-Fermi approximation. At finite temperature only the
coexistence phases method is used. npe matter with fixed proton fractions and
in beta-equilibrium are studied. We compare our results with restrictions
imposed on the the values of the density and pressure at the inner edge of the
crust, obtained from observations of the Vela pulsar and recent isospin
diffusion data from heavy-ion reactions, and with predictions from spinodal
calculations.
