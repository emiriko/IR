We review some of the recent developments which have enabled the heavy quark
mass to be incorporated into both the calculation of the hard-scattering cross
section and the PDFs. We compare and contrast some of the schemes that have
been used in recent global PDF analyses, and look at issues that arise when
these calculations are extended to NNLO.
