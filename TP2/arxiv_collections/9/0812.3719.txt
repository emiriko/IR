The recent apparition of mobile wireless sensor aware to their physical
environment and able to process information must allow proposing applications
able to take into account their physical context and to react according to the
changes of the environment. It suppose to design applications integrating both
software and hardware components able to communicate. Applications must use
context information from components to measure the quality of the proposed
services in order to adapt them in real time. This work is interested in the
integration of sensors in distributed applications. It present a service
oriented software architecture allowing to manage and to reconfigure
applications in heterogeneous environment where entities of different nature
collaborate: software components and wireless sensors.
