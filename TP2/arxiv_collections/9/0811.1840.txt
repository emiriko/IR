We present a self-contained theory for the mechanical response of DNA in
single molecule experiments. Our model is based on a 1D continuum description
of the DNA molecule and accounts both for its elasticity and for DNA-DNA
electrostatic interactions. We consider the classical loading geometry used in
experiments where one end of the molecule is attached to a substrate and the
other one is pulled by a tensile force and twisted by a given number of turns.
We focus on configurations relevant to the limit of a large number of turns,
which are made up of two phases, one with linear DNA and the other one with
superhelical DNA. The model takes into account thermal fluctuations in the
linear phase and electrostatic interactions in the superhelical phase. The
values of the torsional stress, of the supercoiling radius and angle, and key
features of the experimental extension-rotation curves, namely the slope of the
linear region and thermal buckling threshold, are predicted. They are found in
good agreement with experimental data.
