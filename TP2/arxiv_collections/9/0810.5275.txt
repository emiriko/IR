We investigate the vortex-lattice structure for single- and two-component
Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of an optical lattice, which acts as
a pinning potential for the vortices. The problem is considered in the
mean-field quantum-Hall regime, which is reached when the rotation frequency
$\Omega$ of the condensate in a radially symmetric trap approaches the (radial)
trapping frequency $\omega$ and the interactions between the atoms are weak. We
determine the vortex-lattice phase diagram as a function of optical-lattice
strength and geometry. In the limit of strong pinning the vortices are always
pinned at the maxima of the optical-lattice potential, similar to the
slow-rotation case. At intermediate pinning strength, however, due to the
competition between interactions and pinning energy, a structure arises for the
two-component case where the vortices are pinned on lines of minimal potential.
