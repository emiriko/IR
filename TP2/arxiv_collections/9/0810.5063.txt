We consider a class of semilinear stochastic evolution equations driven by an
additive cylindrical stable noise.We investigate structural properties of the
solutions like Markov, irreducibility, stochastic continuity, Feller and strong
Feller properties, and study integrability of trajectories. The obtained
results can be applied to semilinear stochastic heat equations with Dirichlet
boundary conditions and bounded and Lipschitz nonlinearities.
