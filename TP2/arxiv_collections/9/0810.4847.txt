We study codimension one foliations with singularities defined locally by
Bott-Morse functions on closed oriented manifolds.
  We carry to this setting the classical concepts of holonomy of invariant sets
and stability, and prove a stability theorem in the spirit of the local
stability theorem of Reeb. This yields, among other things, a good topological
understanding of the leaves one may have around a center-type component of the
singular set, and also of the topology of its basin. The stability theorem
further allows the description of the topology of the boundary of the basin and
how the topology of the leaves changes when passing from inside to outside the
basin. This is described via fiberwise Milnor-Wallace surgery. A key-point for
this is to show that if the boundary of the basin of a center is non-empty,
then it contains a saddle; in this case we say that the center and the saddle
are paired. We then describe the possible pairings one may have in dimension
three and use a construction motivated by the classical saddle-node
bifurcation, that we call foliated surgery, that allows the reduction of
certain pairings of singularities of a foliation. This is used together with
our previous work on the topic to prove an extension for 3-manifolds of Reeb's
sphere recognition theorem.
