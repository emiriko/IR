We generalize the methods of Moy-Prasad, in order to define and study the
genuine depth zero representations of some nonlinear covers of reductive groups
over $p$-adic local fields. In particular, we construct all depth zero
supercuspidal representations of the metaplectic group $Mp_{2n}$ over a
$p$-adic field of odd residue characteristic.
