In general line with our early works [Yu.A. Markov, M.A. Markova, Nucl. Phys.
A770 (2006) 162; 784 (2007) 443] within the framework of a semiclassical
approximation the general theory of calculation of effective currents and
sources generating bremsstrahlung of an arbitrary number of soft quarks and
soft gluons at collision of a high-energy color-charged particle with thermal
partons in a hot quark-gluon plasma, is developed. For the case of one- and
two-scattering thermal partons with radiation of one or two soft excitations,
the effective currents and sources are calculated in an explicit form. In the
model case of `frozen' medium, approximate expressions for energy losses
induced by the most simple processes of bremsstrahlung of soft quark and soft
gluon, are derived. On the basis of a conception of the mutual cancellation of
singularities in the sum of so-called `diagonal' and `off-diagonal'
contributions to the energy losses, an effective method of determining color
factors in scattering probabilities, containing the initial values of Grassmann
color charges, is suggested. The dynamical equations for Grassmann color
charges of hard particle used by us early are proved to be insufficient for
investigation of the higher radiative processes. It is shown that for correct
description of these processes the given equations should be supplemented
successively with the higher-order terms in powers of the soft fermionic field.
