We propose an effective description of squark interactions with
charginos/neutralinos. We recompute the strong corrections to squark partial
decay widths, and compare the full one-loop computation with the effective
description. The effective description includes the effective Yukawa couplings,
and another logarithmic term which encodes the supersymmetry-breaking. The
proposed effective couplings reproduce correctly the radiative-corrected
partial decay widths of the squark decays into charginos and neutralinos in all
relevant regions of the parameter space.
