We show how the new precise data on kaon decays together with forward
dispersion relations, sum rules and once- and twice-subtracted
  Roy's equations allow for a precise determination of the sigma meson pole
position. We present a comparison and a study of the different sources of
uncertainties when using either once- or twice-subtracted Roy's equations to
analyze the data. Finally we present a preliminary determination of the sigma
pole from the constrained dispersive data analysis.
