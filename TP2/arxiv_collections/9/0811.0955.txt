In frustrated antiferromagnets with isotropic exchange interactions, there is
typically a manifold of degenerate classical ground states. This degeneracy is
broken by the (free) energy of quantum or thermal fluctuations, or the uniform
effects of bond disorder. We derive effective Hamiltonians to express each kind
of selection effect, in both exact forms and convenient approximate forms. It
is argued that biquadratic terms, representing the collinear-selecting effects
of quantum fluctuations, should be included in classical simulations of
large-$S$ frustrated magnets at low temperatures
