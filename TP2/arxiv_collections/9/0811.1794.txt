We consider the strongly coupled limit of conformal gauge theory plasmas with
conserved U(1) charges which have a gravity dual. We show that, under mild
restrictions, the second order transport coefficients of such theories satisfy
a universal relation among themselves, similar to the shear viscosity to
entropy ratio.
