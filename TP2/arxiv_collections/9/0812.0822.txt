Let $\gg$ be the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group and let $\theta$ be any
automorphism of $\gg$. Let $\gk$ denote the fixed point subalgebra
$\gg^\theta$. In this paper we present LiE programs that, for any finite
dimensional complex representation $\pi$ of $\gg$, give the explicit branching
$\pi|_\gk$ of $\pi$ on $\gk$. Cases of special interest include the cases where
$\theta$ has order 2 (corresponding to compact riemannian symmetric spaces
$G/K$), where $\theta$ has order 3 (corresponding to compact nearly--kaehler
homogeneous spaces $G/K$), where $\theta$ has order 5 (which include the
fascinating 5--symmetric space $E_8/A_4A_4$), and the cases where $\gk$ is the
centralizer of a toral subalgebra of $\gg$.
