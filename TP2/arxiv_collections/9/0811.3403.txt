This part offers a survey of models proposed to cope with the
symmetry-breaking challenge. Among them are the two-component neutrinos, the
neutrino twins, the universal Fermi interaction, etc. Moreover, the broken
discrete symmetries in physics are very much on the agenda and may occupy
considerable time for LHC experiments next year aimed at revealing the
symmetry-breaking mechanisms.
