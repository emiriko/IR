Correlations in music that exist within its waveform are studied. Monophonic
wave files of random music are generated and the probability distribution
function of time interval between large signal values is analyzed. A power law
behavior for the distribution function in the range from 0.1 millisecond to 20
milliseconds is observed. An attempt is made to investigate the origin of these
correlations by randomizing each of the factors (frequencies, intensities and
durations of notes of the random music files) separately.
