In ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, the multiplicity of multi-strange
baryons per participating nucleon increases with centrality in a different
fashion for different systems and energies. At RHIC, for copper+copper (CuCu)
collisions the increase is much steeper than for gold-gold (AuAu) collisions.
We show that this system size dependence is due to a core-corona effect: the
relative importance of the corona as compared to the core (thermalized matter)
contribution varies and the contribution of a corona nucleon to the
multiplicity differs from that of a core nucleon. $\phi$ mesons follow in
principle the same trend, but the difference between core and corona
multiplicity is relatively small, and therefore the CuCu and AuAu results are
quite similar. This simple geometrical explanation makes also a strong case in
favor of the validity of Glauber geometry in the peripheral regions of
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, which is crucial for understanding the
early evolution of the system.
