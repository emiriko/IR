We examine a possible spin Hall effect for localized spin systems with no
charge degrees of freedom. In this scenario, a longitudinal magnetic field
gradient induces a transverse spin current carried by spin wave excitations
with an anomalous velocity which is associated with the Berry curvature raised
by spin chirality, in analogy with anomalous Hall effects in itinerant electron
systems. Our argument is based on a semiclassical equations of motion
applicable to general spin systems. Also, a microscopic model of frustrated
magnets which exhibits the anamalous spin Hall effect is presented.
