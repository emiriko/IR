We discuss three applications of NJL- and PNJL-like models to assess aspects
of the QCD phase diagram: First, we study the effect of mesonic correlations on
the pressure below and above the finite temperature phase transition within a
nonlocal PNJL model beyond the mean-field approximation. Second, we reconstruct
the phase boundary of an NJL model from a Taylor expansion of the chiral
susceptibility about $\mu = 0$ and compare the result with the exact phase
boundary. Finally, we demonstrate the realization of the "non-standard
scenario" for the critical surface in a three-flavor PNJL model with a
$\mu$-dependent determinant interaction.
