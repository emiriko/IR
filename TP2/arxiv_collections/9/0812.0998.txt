We investigate synchronization in a Kuramoto-like model with nearest
neighbour coupling. Upon analyzing the behaviour of individual oscillators at
the onset of complete synchronization, we show that the time interval between
bursts in the time dependence of the frequencies of the oscillators exhibits
universal scaling and blows up at the critical coupling strength. We also bring
out a key mechanism that leads to phase locking. Finally, we deduce forms for
the phases and frequencies at the onset of complete synchronization.
