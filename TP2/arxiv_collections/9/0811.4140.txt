CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model may reside in triple
boson vertices of the electroweak theory. We review the effective theory
description and discuss how CP violating contributions to these vertices might
be discerned by electric dipole moments (EDM) or diboson production at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Despite triple boson CP violating interactions
entering EDMs only at the two-loop level, we find that EDM experiments are
generally more powerful than the diboson processes. To give example to these
general considerations we perform the comparison between EDMs and collider
observables within supersymmetric theories that have heavy sfermions, such that
substantive EDMs at the one-loop level are disallowed. EDMs generally remain
more powerful probes, and next-generation EDM experiments may surpass even the
most optimistic assumptions for LHC sensitivities.
