We have used the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method to
calculate some ground state properties of polarized liquid $^{3}He$ at zero
temperature with the spin-dependent correlation function employing the
Lennard-Jones and Aziz pair potentials. We have seen that the total energy of
polarized liquid $^{3}He$ increases by increasing polarization. For all
polarizations, it is shown that the total energy in the spin-dependent case is
lower than the spin-independent case. We have seen that the difference between
the energies of spin-dependent and spin-independent cases decreases by
increasing polarization. We have shown that the main contribution of the
potential energy comes from the spin-triplet state.
