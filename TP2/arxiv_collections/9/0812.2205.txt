Correlation between trigger and associated particles in jets produced on near
and away sides of high-p_T triggers in heavy-ion collisions is studied.
Hadronization of jets on both sides is treated by thermal-shower and
shower-shower recombination. Energy loss of semihard and hard partons
traversing the nuclear medium is parametrized in a way that renders good fit of
the single-particle inclusive distributions at all centralities. The associated
hadron distribution in the near-side jet can be determined showing weak
dependence on system size because of trigger bias. The inverse slope increases
with trigger momentum in agreement with data. The distribution of associated
particle in the away-side jet is also studied with careful attention given to
antitrigger bias that is due to the longer path length that the away-side jet
recoiling against the trigger jet must propagate in the medium to reach the
opposite side. Centrality dependence is taken into account after determining a
realistic probability distribution of the dynamical path length of the parton
trajectory within each class of centrality. For symmetric dijets with
p_T^{trig}=p_T^{assoc}(away) it is shown that the per-trigger yield is
dominated by tangential jets. The average parton momentum for the recoil jet is
shown to be always larger than that of the trigger jet for fixed p_T^{trig} and
centrality and for any measurable p_T^{assoc}(away). With the comprehensive
treatment of dijet production described here it is possible to answer many
questions regarding the behavior of partons in the medium under conditions that
can be specified on measurable hadron momenta.
