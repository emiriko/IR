Thin films of high-permittivity dielectrics are considered ideal candidates
for realizing high charge density nanosized capacitors for use in next
generation energy storage and nanoelectronic applications. The experimentally
observed capacitance of such film nanocapacitors is, however, an order of
magnitude lower than expected. This dramatic drop in capacitance is attributed
to the so called dead layer - a low-permittivity layer at the metal-dielectric
interface in series with the high-permittivity dielectric. The exact nature of
the dead layer and the reasons for its origin still remain somewhat unclear.
Based on insights gained from recently published ab initio work on
SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 and our first principle simulations on Au/MgO/Au and
Pt/MgO/Pt nanocapacitors, we construct an analytical model that isolates the
contributions of various physical mechanisms to the intrinsic dead layer. In
particular we argue that strain-gradients automatically arise in very thin
films even in absence of external strain inducers and, due to flexoelectric
coupling, are dominant contributors to the dead layer effect. Our theoretical
results compare well with existing as well as our own ab initio calculations
and suggest that inclusion of flexoelectricity is necessary for qualitative
reconciliation of atomistic results. Our results also hint at some novel
remedies for mitigating the dead layer effect.
