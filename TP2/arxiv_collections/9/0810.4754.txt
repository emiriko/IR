The high-mass spectrum of lepton and photon pairs is sensitive to a broad
range of new physics. Examples are extra dimensions and new gauge bosons such
as the W' and Z'. Additionally, electron compositeness would result in excited
electrons that decay into an electron and a photon. We report the latest
results of searches for high-mass dilepton, diphoton, and electron-photon
resonances by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron.
