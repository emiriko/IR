By carrying out extensive lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo
calculations, we study the spin and density dependence of the ground state
energy for a quasi-one-dimensional electron gas, with harmonic transverse
confinement and long-range $1/r$ interactions. We present a parametrization of
the exchange-correlation energy suitable for spin density functional
calculations, which fulfills exact low and high density limits.
