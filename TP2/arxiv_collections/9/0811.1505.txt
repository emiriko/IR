The experimental studies of magnetoelectric effects in pulse magnetic field
up to 250 kOe and their theoretical analysis on the basis of magnetic symmetry
consideration are carried out. It is shown that the nonvanishing components of
quadratic magnetoelectric effect tensor corresponding to the electric
polarization along b- and c-axes point out the triclinic distortion of the
crystal symmetry. Anomalous temperature dependence of magnetically induced
polarization Pa(Hb) testifies to the magnetically induced pyroelectric effect.
The torque curves measurements show the deflection of the spin orientation from
the b-axis at 9 degrees of arc.
