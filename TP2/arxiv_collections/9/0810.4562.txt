The notion of nonpositive curvature in Alexandrov's sense is extended to
include p-uniformly convex Banach spaces. Infinite dimensional manifolds of
semi-negative curvature with a p-uniformly convex tangent norm fall in this
class on nonpositively curved spaces, and several well-known results, such as
existence and uniqueness of best approximations from convex closed sets, or the
Bruhat-Tits fixed point theorem, are shown to hold in this setting, without
dimension restrictions. Homogeneous spaces G/K of Banach-Lie groups of
semi-negative curvature are also studied, explicit estimates on the geodesic
distance and sectional curvature are obtained. A characterization of convex
homogeneous submanifolds is given in terms of the Banach-Lie algebras. A
splitting theorem via convex expansive submanifolds is proven, inducing the
corresponding splitting of the Banach-Lie group G. Finally, these notions are
used to study the structure of the classical Banach-Lie groups of bounded
linear operators acting on a Hilbert space, and the splittings induced by
conditional expectations in such setting.
