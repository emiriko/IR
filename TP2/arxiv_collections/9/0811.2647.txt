We analyze the entanglement dynamics of a system composed by a pair of
neutral two-level atoms that are initially entangled, and the electromagnetic
field, initially in the vacuum state, within the formalism of perturbative
quantum field theory up to the second order. We show that entanglement sudden
death and revival can occur while the atoms remain spacelike-separated and
therefore cannot be related with photon exchange between the atoms. We
interpret these phenomena as the consequence of a transfer of atom-atom
entanglement to atom-field entanglement and viceversa. We also consider the
different bi-partitions of the system, finding similar relationships between
their entanglement evolutions.
