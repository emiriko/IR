Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) films were deposited on quartz substrates using
Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) method. The formation of ${\rm sp^3}$ bonds as is it's
content in the film strongly depends on the substrate and it seems quartz is
not a suitable substrate. However, we report here the formation of DLC films on
quartz substrates that were maintained at elevated temperatures and show the
content of carbon atoms with ${\rm sp^3}$ bonds in the film is directly
proportional to the substrate's temperature. Not only does this give good
control of film fabrication, but also shows how to take advantage of DLC film's
anti-wear, scratch resistant properties on material surfaces that require
protection.
