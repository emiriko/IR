We present a theoretical study of radiative heat transport in nonlinear
solid-state quantum circuits. We give a detailed account of heat rectification
effects, i.e. the asymmetry of heat current with respect to a reversal of the
thermal gradient, in a system consisting of two reservoirs at finite
temperatures coupled through a nonlinear resonator. We suggest an
experimentally feasible superconducting circuit employing the Josephson
nonlinearity to realize a controllable low temperature heat rectifier with a
maximal asymmetry of the order of 10%. We also discover a parameter regime
where the rectification changes sign as a function of temperature.
