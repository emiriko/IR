The Semantic Web is becoming more and more a reality, as the required
technologies have reached an appropriate level of maturity. However, at this
stage, it is important to provide tools facilitating the use and deployment of
these technologies by end-users. In this paper, we describe EdHibou, an
automatically generated, ontology-based graphical user interface that
integrates in a semantic portal. The particularity of EdHibou is that it makes
use of OWL reasoning capabilities to provide intelligent features, such as
decision support, upon the underlying ontology. We present an application of
EdHibou to medical decision support based on a formalization of clinical
guidelines in OWL and show how it can be customized thanks to an ontology of
graphical components.
