In the context of our recently developed emergent quantum mechanics, and, in
particular, based on an assumed sub-quantum thermodynamics, the necessity of
energy quantization as originally postulated by Max Planck is explained by
means of purely classical physics. Moreover, under the same premises, also the
energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator is derived.
Essentially, Planck's constant h is shown to be indicative of a particle's
"zitterbewegung" and thus of a fundamental angular momentum. The latter is
identified with quantum mechanical spin, a residue of which is thus present
even in the non-relativistic Schroedinger theory.
