The vacuum of supersymmetric gauge theories (SQCD) with N=2 softly broken to
N=1 resembles that of a BCS superconductor in that it has a condensate which
collimates flux into vortices, leading to confinement. We embed the SQCD vortex
into the BCS theory by identifying the N=1 vector multiplet mass and lightest
massive chiral multiplet mass with the Fermi velocity divided by the London
penetration depth and coherence length respectively. Thus embedded the
superconductivity is type I and so the vortex core is smaller than the
coherence length. Therefore nonlocal effects (Pippard electrodynamics) imply
that the vortex solution is beyond the range of validity of the Landau-Ginzburg
approximation implicit in the gauge theory. In other words, the vortex solution
contains gradients greater than those for which the BCS and gauge theory
descriptions agree. We consider more general superpotentials which are
polynomial in the chiral multiplets and find that, unless one adds a SUSY
breaking sector, one obtains type II superconductivity only when the
superpotential perturbation is at least quadratic in the fundamental chiral
multiplets and at least linear in the adjoint chiral multiplets, in which case
there is no N=2 supersymmetry in the ultraviolet.
