We study the parameter dependence of the Higgs mass in a chirally invariant
lattice Higgs-Yukawa model emulating the same Higgs-fermion coupling structure
as in the Higgs sector of the electroweak Standard Model. Eventually, the aim
is to establish upper and lower Higgs mass bounds. Here we present our
preliminary results on the lower Higgs mass bound at several selected values
for the cutoff and give a brief outlook towards the upper Higgs mass bound.
