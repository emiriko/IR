We present a general framework for analyzing inhomogeneous (color-)
superconducting phases in mean-field approximation without restriction to the
Ginzburg-Landau approach. As a first application, we calculate real gap
functions with general one-dimensional periodic structures for a
3+1-dimensional toy model having two fermion species. The resulting solutions
are energetically favored against homogeneous superconducting (BCS) and normal
conducting phases in a window for the chemical potential difference which is
about twice as wide as for the most simple plane-wave ansatz ("Fulde-Ferrell
phase"). At the lower end of this window, we observe the formation of a soliton
lattice and a continuous phase transition to the BCS phase. At the higher end
of the window the gap functions are sinusoidal, and the transition to the
normal conducting phase is of first order. We also discuss the quasiparticle
excitation spectrum in the inhomogeneous phase. Finally, we compare the gap
functions with the known analytical solutions of the 1+1-dimensional theory.
