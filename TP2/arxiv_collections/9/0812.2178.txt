We observed undulated smectic textures for some compounds of the
4,n-alkyloxybenzoic (nOBAC) acid series, at transitions between the smectic and
the isotropic phase and between the smectic and nematic phase. Studied
compounds were 12OBAC, 16OBAC and a binary mixture of 12- and 16OBAC. The
undulations are dressing a usual Schlieren texture. In the case of the binary
mixture, an interesting fingerprint pattern is observed too.
