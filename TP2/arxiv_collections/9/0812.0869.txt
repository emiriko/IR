The three photons from the dominant ortho-positronium decay and two vector
mesons from the $\eta_c$ exclusive decays are found to be in tripartite and
high-dimensional entangled states, respectively. These two classes of entangled
states possess the Hardy type nonlocality and allow a priori for quantum
mechanics vs local realism test via Bell inequalities. The experimental
realizations are shown to be feasible, and a concrete scheme to fulfill the
test in experiment via two-vector-meson entangled state is proposed.
