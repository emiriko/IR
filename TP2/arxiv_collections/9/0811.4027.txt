We derive the Christoffel-Geronimus-Uvarov transformations of a system of
bi-orthogonal polynomials and associated functions on the unit circle, that is
to say the modification of the system corresponding to a rational modification
of the weight function. In the specialisation of the weight function to the
regular semi-classical case with an arbitrary number of regular singularities $
\{z_1, ..., z_M \} $ the bi-orthogonal system is known to be isomonodromy
preserving with respect to deformations of the singular points. If the zeros
and poles of the Christoffel-Geronimus-Uvarov factors coincide with the
singularities then we have the Schlesinger transformations of this
isomonodromic system. Compatibility of the Schlesinger transformations with the
other structures of the system - the recurrence relations, the spectral
derivatives and deformation derivatives is explicitly deduced. Various forms of
Hirota-Miwa equations are derived for the $ \tau $-functions or equivalently
Toeplitz determinants of the system.
