We report that normal incidence reflection and transmission of circularly
polarized electromagnetic waves from and through planar split-ring
metamaterials with chiral symmetry breaking depends on the incidence direction
and handedness of circular polarization. The effect has a resonant nature and
is linked to the lack of mirror-symmetry in the metamaterial pattern leading to
a polarization-sensitive excitation of electric and magnetic dipolar responses
in the meta-molecules.
