We present a measurement of the top quark mass in the all-hadronic channel
(\tt $\to$ \bb$q_{1}\bar{q_{2}}q_{3}\bar{q_{4}}$) using 943 pb$^{-1}$ of \ppbar
collisions at $\sqrt {s} = 1.96$ TeV collected at the CDF II detector at
Fermilab (CDF). We apply the standard model production and decay matrix-element
(ME) to $\ttbar$ candidate events. We calculate per-event probability densities
according to the ME calculation and construct template models of signal and
background. The scale of the jet energy is calibrated using additional
templates formed with the invariant mass of pairs of jets. These templates form
an overall likelihood function that depends on the top quark mass and on the
jet energy scale (JES). We estimate both by maximizing this function. Given 72
observed events, we measure a top quark mass of 171.1 $\pm$ 3.7 (stat.+JES)
$\pm$ 2.1 (syst.) GeV/$c^{2}$. The combined uncertainty on the top quark mass
is 4.3 GeV/$c^{2}$.
