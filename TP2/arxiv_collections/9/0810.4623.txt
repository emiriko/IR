A novel information-geometrodynamical approach to chaotic dynamics (IGAC) on
curved statistical manifolds based on Entropic Dynamics (ED) is presented and a
new definition of information geometrodynamical entropy (IGE) as a measure of
chaoticity is proposed. The general classical formalism is illustrated in a
relatively simple example. It is shown that the hyperbolicity of a
non-maximally symmetric 6N-dimensional statistical manifold M_{s} underlying an
ED Gaussian model describing an arbitrary system of 3N degrees of freedom leads
to linear information-geometric entropy growth and to exponential divergence of
the Jacobi vector field intensity, quantum and classical features of chaos
respectively. An information-geometric analogue of the Zurek-Paz quantum chaos
criterion in the classical reversible limit is proposed. This analogy is
illustrated applying the IGAC to a set of n-uncoupled three-dimensional
anisotropic inverted harmonic oscillators characterized by a Ohmic distributed
frequency spectrum.
