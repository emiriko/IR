A random-field Ising model that is capable of exhibiting a rich variety of
multicritical phenomena, as well as a smearing of such behavior, is
investigated. The model consists of an infinite-range-interaction Ising
ferromagnet in the presence of a triple-Gaussian random magnetic field, which
is defined as a superposition of three Gaussian distributions with the same
width $\sigma$, centered at H=0 and $H=\pm H_{0}$, with probabilities $p$ and
$(1-p)/2$, respectively. Such a distribution is very general and recovers as
limiting cases, the trimodal, bimodal, and Gaussian probability distributions.
