Let X be a smooth, linearly normal n dimensional complex projective variety.
Assume that the projective dual of X has codimension one with defining
polynomial D(X). In this paper the log of the norm of
  D(X) is expressed as the restriction to the Bergman metrics of an energy
functional on X. We show how, for smooth plane curves, this energy functional
reduces to the standard action functionals of Kahler geometry.
