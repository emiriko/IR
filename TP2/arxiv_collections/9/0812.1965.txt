In a typical exclusive quarkonium production process, when the center-of-mass
energy, $\sqrt{s}$, is much greater than the heavy quark mass $m$, large
kinematic logarithms of $s/m^2$ will unavoidably arise at each order of
perturbative expansion in the short-distance coefficients of the
nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism, which may potentially harm
the perturbative expansion. This symptom reflects that the hard regime in NRQCD
factorization is too coarse and should be further factorized. We suggest that
this regime can be further separated into "hard" and "collinear" degrees of
freedom, so that the familiar light-cone approach can be employed to reproduce
the NRQCD matching coefficients at the zeroth order of $m^2/s$ and order by
order in $\alpha_s$. Taking two simple processes, exclusive $\eta_b+\gamma$
production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation and Higgs boson radiative decay into
$\Upsilon$, as examples, we illustrate how the leading logarithms of $s/m^2$ in
the NRQCD matching coefficients are identified and summed to all orders in
$\alpha_s$ with the aid of Brodsky-Lepage evolution equation.
