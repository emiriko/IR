First passage models, where corporate assets undergo correlated random walks
and a company defaults if its assets fall below a threshold provide an
attractive framework for modeling the default process. Typical one year default
correlations are small, i.e., of order a few percent, but nonetheless including
correlations is very important, for managing portfolio credit risk and pricing
some credit derivatives (e.g. first to default baskets). In first passage
models the exact dependence of the joint survival probability of more than two
firms on their asset correlations is not known. We derive an expression for the
dependence of the joint survival probability of $n$ firms on their asset
correlations using first order perturbation theory in the correlations. It
includes all terms that are linear in the correlations but neglects effects of
quadratic and higher order. For constant time independent correlations we
compare the first passage model expression for the joint survival probability
with what a multivariate normal Copula function gives. As a practical
application of our results we calculate the dependence of the five year joint
survival probability for five basic industrials on their asset correlations.
