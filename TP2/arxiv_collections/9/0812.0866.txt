It was observed recently by Randall and Wise that, any particle in the
Standard Model cannot decay to $e^+e^-$ and $\gamma \gamma$ final states with
comparably measurable branching ratios. This is also true for most extensions
of the Standard Model, with the Randall-Sundrum model as an outstanding
exception. In this paper, we show that two-Higgs-Doublet-Models (2HDM) yield
another possible exception if certain parameters are properly chosen. In
addition, we have checked that this model survives the tests of low energy
processes, including the anomalous magnetic moment and electric dipole moment
of leptons, lepton-flavor-violating decays $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$ and $e^- e^+
e^-$.
