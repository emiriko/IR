For any natural number $\ell $ and any prime $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ not
dividing $\ell $ there is a Hermitian modular form of arbitrary genus $n$ over
$L:=\Q [\sqrt{-\ell}]$ that is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ which is a Hermitian
theta series of an $O_L$-lattice of rank $p-1$ admitting a fixed point free
automorphism of order $p$. It is shown that also for non-free lattices such
theta series are modular forms.
