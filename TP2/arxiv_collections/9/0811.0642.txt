Starting from the Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD we find a single
variable light-front equation for QCD which determines the eigenspectrum and
the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular
momentum. This light-front wave equation is equivalent to the equations of
motion which describe the propagation of spin-$J$ modes on anti-de Sitter (AdS)
space.
