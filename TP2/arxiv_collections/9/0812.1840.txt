We consider various homotopy algebras related to Yang-Mills theory and
two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our main objects of study are
Yang-Mills $L_{\infty}$ and $C_{\infty}$ algebras and their relation to the
certain algebraic structures of Lian-Zuckerman type in CFT. We also consider
several examples of algebras related to gauge theory, involving first order
formulations and gauge theories with matter fields.
