We consider the extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit on a Bethe lattice
with coordination number z. By using the equations of motion formalism, the
model is exactly solved for both attractive and repulsive intersite potential
V. By focusing on the case of negative V, i.e., attractive intersite
interaction, we study the phase diagram at finite temperature and find, for
various values of the filling and of the on-site coupling U, a phase transition
towards a state with phase separation. We determine the critical temperature as
a function of the relevant parameters, U/|V|, n and z and we find a reentrant
behavior in the plane (U/|V|,T). Finally, several thermodynamic properties are
investigated near criticality.
