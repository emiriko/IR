We introduce a simple "patchy particle" model to study the thermodynamics and
dynamics of self-assembly of homomeric protein complexes. Our calculations
allow us to rationalize recent results for dihedral complexes. Namely, why
evolution of such complexes naturally takes the system into a region of
interaction space where (i) the evolutionarily newer interactions are weaker,
(ii) subcomplexes involving the stronger interactions are observed to be
thermodynamically stable on destabilization of the protein-protein interactions
and (iii) the self-assembly dynamics are hierarchical with these same
subcomplexes acting as kinetic intermediates.
