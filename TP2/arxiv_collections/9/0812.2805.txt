Compatibility conditions between the (global) spectrum of an $n$-mode
Gaussian state and the spectra of the individual modes are presented, making
optimal use of beam splitter and (two-mode) squeezing transformations. An
unexpected bye-product of our elementary approach is the result that every
two-mode Gaussian state is uniquely determined, modulo local transformations,
by its global spectrum and local spectra -- a property shared not even by a
pair of qubits.
