In the covariant light-front quark model, we investigate the form factors of
$B_c$ decays into $D, D^*, D_s, D_s^*, \eta_c, J/\psi, B, B^*, B_s, B_s^*$
mesons. The form factors in the spacelike region $q^2<0$ are directly
evaluated. To extrapolate the form factors to the full kinematic region, we fit
the form factors by adopting a three-parameter form from the spacelike region.
$b\to u,d,s$ transition form factors at maximally recoiling point ($q^2=0$) are
smaller than $b\to c$ and $c\to d,s$ transition form factors, while the $b\to
d,s,c$ form factors at zero recoiling point are close to each other. In the
fitting procedure, we find the parameters for the form factors $A_2(B_c\to
B^*)$ and $A_2(B_c\to B^*_s)$ strongly depend on the decay constants of $B^*$
and $B_s^*$ mesons. Fortunately, the semileptonic and nonleptonic $B_c$ decays
are not sensitive to these form factors. With the form factors, we also
investigate the branching fractions, polarizations of the semileptonic $B_c\to
Ml\nu$ decays. Semileptonic $B_c\to (\eta_c,J/\psi)l\nu$ and $B_c\to
(B_s,B_s^*)l\nu$ decays have much larger branching fractions than $B_c\to
(D,D^*,B,B^*)l\nu$. In the three kinds of $B_c\to Vl\nu$ decays, contributions
from the longitudinal polarized vector is comparable with those from the
transversely polarized vector. These predictions will be tested at the ongoing
and forthcoming hadron colliders.
