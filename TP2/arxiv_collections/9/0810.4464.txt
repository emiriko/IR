We study heat transport in a one-dimensional chain of a finite number $N$ of
identical cells, coupled at its boundaries to stochastic particle reservoirs.
At the center of each cell, tracer particles collide with fixed scatterers,
exchanging momentum. In a recent paper, \cite{CE08}, a spatially continuous
version of this model was derived in a scaling regime where the scattering
probability of the tracers is $\gamma\sim1/N$, corresponding to the Grad limit.
A Boltzmann type equation describing the transport of heat was obtained. In
this paper, we show numerically that the Boltzmann description obtained in
\cite{CE08} is indeed a bona fide limit of the particle model. Furthermore, we
also study the heat transport of the model when the scattering probability is
one, corresponding to deterministic dynamics. At a coarse grained level the
model behaves as a persistent random walker with a broad waiting time
distribution and strong correlations associated to the deterministic
scattering. We show, that, in spite of the absence of global conserved
quantities, the model leads to a superdiffusive heat transport.
