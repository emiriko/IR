Random noise can generate a unidirectional heat current across asymmetric
nano objects in the absence (or against) a temperature gradient. We present a
minimal model for a molecular-level stochastic heat pump that may operate
arbitrarily close to the Carnot efficiency. The model consists a fluctuating
molecular unit coupled to two solids characterized by distinct phonon spectral
properties. Heat pumping persists for a broad range of system and bath
parameters. Furthermore, by filtering the reservoirs' phonons the pump
efficiency can approach the Carnot limit.
