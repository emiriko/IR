We report 139La, 57Fe and 75As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear
quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on powders of the new LaO1-xFxFeAs
superconductor for x = 0 and x = 0.1 at temperatures up to 480 K, and compare
our measured NQR spectra with local density approximation (LDA) calculations.
For all three nuclei in the x = 0.1 material, it is found that the local Knight
shift increases monotonically with an increase in temperature, and scales with
the macroscopic susceptibility, suggesting a single magnetic degree of freedom.
Surprisingly, the spin lattice relaxation rates for all nuclei also scale with
one another, despite the fact that the form factors for each site sample
different regions of q-space. This result suggests a lack of any q-space
structure in the dynamical spin susceptibility that might be expected in the
presence of antiferromagnetic correlations. Rather, our results are more
compatible with simple quasi-particle scattering. Furthermore, we find that the
increase in the electric field gradient at the As cannot be accounted for by
LDA calculations, suggesting that structural changes, in particular the
position of the As in the unit cell, dominate the NQR response.
