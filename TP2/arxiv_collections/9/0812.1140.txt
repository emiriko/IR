A realization of the elliptic quantum algebra $U_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ for
any given level $k$ is constructed in terms of three free boson fields and
their accompanying twisted partners. It can be viewed as the elliptic
deformation of Wakimoto realization. Two screening currents are constructed;
they commute or anti-commute with $U_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ modulo total
q-differences. The free fields realization for two types vertex operators
nominated as the type $I$ and the type $II$ vertex operators are presented. The
twisted version of the two types vertex operators are also obtained. They all
play crucial roles in calculating correlation functions.
