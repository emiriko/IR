We investigate the dynamics and modulation of ring dark soliton in 2D
Bose-Einstein condensates with tunable interaction both analytically and
numerically. The analytic solutions of ring dark soliton are derived by using a
new transformation method. For shallow ring dark soliton, it is stable when the
ring is slightly distorted, while for large deformation of the ring, vortex
pairs appear and they demonstrate novel dynamical behaviors: the vortex pairs
will transform into dark lumplike solitons and revert to ring dark soliton
periodically. Moreover, our results show that the dynamical evolution of the
ring dark soliton can be dramatically affected by Feshbach resonance, and the
lifetime of the ring dark soliton can be largely extended which offers a useful
method for observing the ring dark soliton in future experiments.
