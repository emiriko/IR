A new release of the Monte Carlo program Herwig++ (version 2.3) is now
available. This version includes a number of improvements including: the
extension of the program to lepton-hadron collisions; the inclusion of several
processes accurate at next-to-leading order in the POsitive Weight Hardest
Emission Generator (POWHEG) scheme; the inclusion of three-body decays and
finite-width effects in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics processes; a
new procedure for reconstructing the kinematics of the parton shower based on
the colour structure of the hard scattering process; a new model for baryon
decays including excited baryon multiplets; the addition of a soft component to
the multiple scattering model of the underlying event; new matrix elements for
Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and e+e- processes.
