New physics interactions can affect the strength and structure of the $tbW$
vertex. We investigate the magnitudes and phases of "anomalous" contributions
to this vertex in a two-Higgs doublet and the minimal supersymmetric extension
of the standard model, and in a top-color assisted technicolor (TC2) model.
While the magnitudes of the anomalous couplings remain below 1 percent in the
first two models, TC2 interactions can reduce the left-chiral coupling $f_L$ by
several percent.
