The cloaking performance of two microwave cloaks, both based on the recently
proposed transmission-line approach, are studied using commercial full-wave
simulation software. The cloaks are shown to be able to reduce the total
scattering cross sections of metallic objects of some restricted shapes and
sizes. One of the studied cloaks is electrically small in diameter, and the
other is electrically large, with the diameter equal to several wavelengths.
