A brief overview of loop quantum cosmology of homogeneous isotropic models is
presented with emphasis on the origin of and subtleties associated with the
resolution of big bang and big crunch singularities. These results bear out the
remarkable intuition that John Wheeler had. Discussion is organized at two
levels. The the main text provides a bird's eye view of the subject that should
be accessible to non-experts. Appendices address conceptual and technical
issues that are often raised by experts in loop quantum gravity and string
theory.
