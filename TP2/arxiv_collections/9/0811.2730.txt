There are, among others, currently two important views on the
non-perturbative structure of Yang-Mills theory. One is through topological
configurations and one is through Green's functions, in particular their
(asymptotic) infrared behavior. Based on both views, various scenarios for
confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and other non-perturbative effects have
been developed. However, if both views are correct then they can only be
different aspects of the same underlying physics, and it must be possible to
relate them.
  After discussing the current status of the understanding of this connection,
smeared and cooled configurations in lattice gauge theory are used to determine
the properties of Green's functions in the low-momentum regime. It is found
that the qualitative properties are essentially unchanged compared to results
on unsmeared configurations. This is also the case when the configurations are
smeared sufficiently strongly to reach the almost (anti-)self-dual domain.
