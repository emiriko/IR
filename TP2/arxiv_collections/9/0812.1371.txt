We consider a system of birational functional equations (BFEs) (or
finite-difference equations at w=m \in Z) for functions y(w) of the form:
y(w+1)=F_n(y(w)), y(w):C \to C^N, n=deg(F_n(y)), F_n \in (\bf Bir}(C^N), where
the map F_n is a given birational one of the group of all automorphisms of C^N
\to C^N. The relation of the BFEs with ordinary differential equations is
discussed. We present a general solution of the above BFEs for n=1,\forall N
and of the ones with the map F_n birationally equivalent to F_1: F_n\equiv
V\comp F_1\comp V^{-1}, \forall V \in (\bf Bir}(C^N).
