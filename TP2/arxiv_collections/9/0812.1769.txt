Low-temperature transport spectroscopy measurements on a suspended few-hole
carbon nanotube quantum dot are presented, showing a gate-dependent harmonic
excitation spectrum which, strikingly, occurs in the Coulomb blockade regime.
The quantized excitation energy corresponds to the scale expected for
longitudinal vibrations of the nanotube. The electronic transport processes are
identified as cotunnel-assisted sequential tunneling, resulting from
non-equilibrium occupation of the mechanical mode. They appear only above a
high-bias threshold at the scale of electronic nanotube excitations. We discuss
models for the pumping process that explain the enhancement of the
non-equilibrium occupation and show that it is connected to a subtle interplay
between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom.
