Electrical spin injection from ferromagnetic metals into graphene is hindered
by the impedance mismatch between the two materials. This problem can be
reduced by the introduction of a thin tunnel barrier at the interface. We
present room temperature non-local spin valve measurements in
cobalt/aluminum-oxide/graphene structures with an injection efficiency as high
as 25%, where electrical contact is achieved through relatively transparent
pinholes in the oxide. This value is further enhanced to 43% by applying a DC
current bias on the injector electrodes, that causes carrier drift away from
the contact. A reverse bias reduces the AC spin valve signal to zero or
negative values. We introduce a model that quantitatively predicts the behavior
of the spin accumulation in the graphene under such circumstances, showing a
good agreement with our measurements.
