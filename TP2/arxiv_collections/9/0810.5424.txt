By making use of renormalized mean-field theory, we investigate possible
superconducting symmetries in the ground states of t1-t2-J1-J2 model on square
lattice. The superconducting symmetries of the ground states are determined by
the frustration amplitude t2/t1 and doping concentration. The phase diagram of
this system in frustration-doping plane is given. The order of the phase
transitions among these different superconducting symmetry states of the system
is discussed.
