The present paper is an introduction to a combinatorial theory arising as a
natural generalisation of classical and virtual knot theory. There is a way to
encode links by a class of `realisable' graphs. When passing to generic graphs
with the same equivalence relations we get `graph-links'. On one hand
graph-links generalise the notion of virtual link, on the other hand they do
not feel link mutations. We define the Jones polynomial for graph-links and
prove its invariance. We also prove some a generalisation of the
Kauffman-Murasugi-Thistlethwaite theorem on `minmal diagrams' for graph-links
