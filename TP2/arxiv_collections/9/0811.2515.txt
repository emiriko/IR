Ultra-thin oxide (UTO) films were grown on Si(111) in ultrahigh vacuum at
room temperature and characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy. The
ultra-thin oxide films were then used as substrates for room temperature growth
of pentacene. The apparent height of the first layer is 1.57 +/- 0.05 nm,
indicating standing up pentacene grains in the thin-film phase were formed.
Pentacene is molecularly resolved in the second and subsequent molecular
layers. The measured in-plane unit cell for the pentacene (001) plane (ab
plane) is a=0.76+/-0.01 nm, b=0.59+/-0.01 nm, and gamma=87.5+/-0.4 degrees. The
films are unperturbed by the UTO's short-range spatial variation in tunneling
probability, and reduce its corresponding effective roughness and correlation
exponent with increasing thickness. The pentacene surface morphology follows
that of the UTO substrate, preserving step structure, the long range surface
rms roughness of ~0.1 nm, and the structural correlation exponent of ~1.
