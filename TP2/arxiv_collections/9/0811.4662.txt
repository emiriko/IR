In this paper it is shown that the key to understanding the ghost imaging
mystery are the crossing symmetric photon reactions in the nonlinear media.
Then, an intuitive mechanism for the description of the ghost imaging in terms
of the quantum mirror (QM) is presented. Moreover, we prove that the ghost
imaging laws depend only on the energy-momentum conservation and not on the
photons entanglement.
