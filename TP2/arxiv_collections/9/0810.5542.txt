Recently it was shown that there is a class of models in which colored vector
and scalar resonances can be copiously produced at the Tevatron with decays to
multijet final states, consistent with all experimental constraints and having
strong discovery potential. We investigate the collider phenomenology of TeV
scale colored resonances at the LHC and demonstrate a strong discovery
potential for the scalars with early data as well as the vectors with
additional statistics. We argue that the signal can be self-calibrating and
using this fact we propose a search strategy which we show to be robust to
systematic errors typically expected from Monte Carlo background estimates. We
model the resonances with a phenomenological Lagrangian that describes them as
bound states of colored vectorlike fermions due to new confining gauge
interactions. However, the phenomenological Lagrangian treatment is quite
general and can represent other scenarios of microscopic physics as well.
