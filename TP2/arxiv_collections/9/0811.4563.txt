Finding the causes for the nonstatistical vibrational energy relaxation in
the planar carbonyl sulfide (OCS) molecule is a longstanding problem in
chemical physics: Not only is the relaxation incomplete long past the predicted
statistical relaxation time, but it also consists of a sequence of abrupt
transitions between long-lived regions of localized energy modes. We report on
the phase space bottlenecks responsible for this slow and uneven vibrational
energy flow in this Hamiltonian system with three degrees of freedom. They
belong to a particular class of two-dimensional invariant tori which are
organized around elliptic periodic orbits. We relate the trapping and
transition mechanisms with the linear stability of these structures.
