One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model that explains the
observed abundance of dark matter is the inert doublet model. In this theory a
discrete symmetry ensures that the neutral component of an additional
electroweak doublet scalar is stable, and constitutes a dark matter candidate.
As massive bodies such as the Sun and Earth move through the dark matter halo,
dark matter particles can become gravitationally trapped in their cores.
Annihilations of these particles result in neutrinos, which can potentially be
observed with neutrino telescopes. We calculate the neutrino detection rate at
these experiments from inert doublet dark matter annihilations in the cores of
the Sun and the Earth.
