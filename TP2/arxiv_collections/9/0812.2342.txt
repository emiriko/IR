In 2002 Haviv gave a way of assigning Lie tensors to directed trivalent
graphs. Weight systems on oriented chord idagrams modulo 6T can then be
constructed from such tensors. In this paper we give explicit combinatorial
formulas of weight systems using Manin triples constrcted from classical Lie
algebras. We then compose these oriented weight systems with the averaging map
to get weight systems on unoriented chord diagrams and show that they are the
same as the ones obtained by Bar-Natan in 1991. In the last section we carry
out calculations on certain examples.
