Multi-band systems as intermetallic and heavy fermion compounds have
quasi-particles arising from different orbitals at their Fermi surface. Since
these quasi-particles have different masses or densities, there is a natural
mismatch of the Fermi wave-vectors associated with different orbitals. This
makes these materials potential candidates to observe exotic superconducting
phases as Sarma or FFLO phases, even in the absence of an external magnetic
field. The distinct orbitals coexisting at the Fermi surface are generally
hybridized and their degree of mixing can be controlled by external pressure.
In this Communication we investigate the existence of an FFLO phase in a
two-band BCS superconductor controlled by hybridization. At zero temperature,
as hybridization (pressure) increases we find that the BCS state becomes
unstable with respect to an inhomogeneous superconducting state characterized
by a single wave-vector q.
