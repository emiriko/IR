Magnon interactions give important contributions to the wrapping interactions
of the N=4 spin-chain. Similar effects are expected for the finite size
corrections to the giant magnon energy in AdS_5 x S^5. In this paper I review
the finite gap description of giant magnons and the leading order calculation
of the finite size corrections to the giant magnon dispersion relation for
multi-magnon states.
