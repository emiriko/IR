A novel ultra-bright high-intensity source of X-ray and gamma radiation is
suggested. It is based on the double Doppler effect, where a relativistic
flying mirror reflects a counter-propagating electromagnetic radiation causing
its frequency multiplication and intensification, and on the inverse double
Doppler effect, where the mirror acquires energy from an ultra-intense
co-propagating electromagnetic wave. The role of the flying mirror is played by
a high-density thin plasma slab accelerating in the radiation pressure dominant
regime. Frequencies of high harmonics generated at the flying mirror by a
relativistically strong counter-propagating radiation undergo multiplication
with the same factor as the fundamental frequency of the reflected radiation,
approximately equal to the quadruple of the square of the mirror Lorentz
factor.
