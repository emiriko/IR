We establish a novel method of obtaining the gauge-invariant bilocal
condensate of gluon fields from the solutions of the Dyson--Schwinger equations
(DSE) which works in the infrared and ultraviolet limits. We present explicit
results for SU(3) case in four dimensions, and compare to other related
analytical and lattice results.
