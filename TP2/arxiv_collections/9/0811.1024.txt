In supersymmetric models, scalar top quarks, or stops, generically have
parity-violating couplings to top quarks. As a result, tops produced in stop
decays should be polarized. In this paper, we will argue that this effect may
be observable at the LHC with realistic integrated luminosities, provided that
one of the stops is copiously produced and can decay to a top and a neutralino.
We define the "effective" stop mixing angle, which determines the degree of top
polarization, and discuss the prospects for a measurement of this angle at the
LHC. If some information about the neutralino mixing matrix is available, this
measurement can be used to constrain the mixing angle in the stop sector, one
of the most important ingredients in assessing the naturalness of electroweak
symmetry breaking in the MSSM.
