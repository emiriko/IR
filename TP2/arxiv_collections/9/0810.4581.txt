The full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method with the
generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation potential
(LAPW-GGA) is used to understand the electronic band structure of
fluorine-arsenide SrFeAsF as a possible parent material for a new group of
oxygen-free FeAs superconductors. The electronic bands, density of states,
Fermi surface and atomic charges have been evaluated and discussed for
high-temperature tetragonal and low-temperature orthorhombic SrFeAsF phases.
