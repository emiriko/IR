After the initial discovery of the so-called "spin crisis in the parton
model" in the 1980's, a large set of polarization data in deep inelastic
lepton-nucleon scattering was collected at labs like SLAC, DESY and CERN. More
recently, new high precision data at large x and in the resonance region have
come from experiments at Jefferson Lab. These data, in combination with the
earlier ones, allow us to study in detail the polarized parton densities, the
Q^2 dependence of various moments of spin structure functions, the duality
between deep inelastic and resonance data, and the nucleon structure in the
valence quark region. Together with complementary data from HERMES, RHIC and
COMPASS, we can put new limits on the flavor decomposition and the gluon
contribution to the nucleon spin. In this report, we provide an overview of our
present knowledge of the nucleon spin structure and give an outlook on future
experiments. We focus in particular on the spin structure functions g_1 and g_2
of the nucleon and their moments.
