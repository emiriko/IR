We provide two equivalent approaches for computing the tail distribution of
the first hitting time of the boundary of the Weyl chamber by a radial Dunkl
process. The first approach is based on a spectral problem with initial value.
The second one expresses the tail distribution by means of the $W$-invariant
Dunkl-Hermite polynomials. Illustrative examples are given by the irreducible
root systems of types $A$, $B$, $D$. The paper ends with an interest in the
case of Brownian motions for which our formulae take determinantal forms.
