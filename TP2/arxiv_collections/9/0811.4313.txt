The high linear charge density of 20-base-pair oligomers of DNA is shown to
lead to a striking non-monotonic dependence of the long-time self-diffusion on
the concentration of the DNA in low-salt conditions. This generic non-monotonic
behavior results from both the strong coupling between the electrostatic and
solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions, and from the renormalization of
these electrostatic interactions at large separations, and specifically from
the dominance of the far-field hydrodynamic interactions caused by the strong
repulsion between the DNA fragments.
