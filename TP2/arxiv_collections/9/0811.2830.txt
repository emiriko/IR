Stationary light pulses (SLPs), i.e., light pulses without motion, are formed
via the retrieval of stored probe pulses with two counter-propagating coupling
fields. We show that there exist non-negligible hybrid Raman excitations in
media of cold atoms that prohibit the SLP formation. We experimentally
demonstrate a method to suppress these Raman excitations and realize SLPs in
laser-cooled atoms. Our work opens the way to SLP studies in cold as well as in
stationary atoms and provides a new avenue to low-light-level nonlinear optics.
