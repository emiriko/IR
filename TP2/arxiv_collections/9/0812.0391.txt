The behavior of coupled harmonic oscillators in systems with specified
boundary conditions is typically characterized by resonances whose frequency
spectra represent harmonics according to properties of the individual
oscillators, the interactions between them, and the overall symmetry of the
system. Here it is demonstrated that classical one- and two-dimensional
radiofrequency resonators constrained to a Mobius topology are the formal
partners of cylindrical ring resonators, and specifically give rise to
half-integral harmonic excitations that are orthogonal to the integral
excitations of a ring. In particular, the half-integral harmonics are formally
invariant under rotations at a minimum of 4pi rather than 2pi radians, in
analogy to the rotational symmetry of fermions in quantum mechanics. The
results offer a pathway for discovery in other physical systems as well as the
design of novel materials and electronic instrumentation.
