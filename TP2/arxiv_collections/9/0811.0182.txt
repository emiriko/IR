The market events of 2007-2009 have reinvigorated the search for realistic
return models that capture greater likelihoods of extreme movements. In this
paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both
fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a Poisson trade arrival
model with variable size orders. With simplifications we are led to a hybrid
SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions, whose solution is
given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against
another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the
hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered
by Nagahara, which is a type of "Pearson diffusion", or equivalently a
hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on
the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally
at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type
IV form. Under less restrictive assumptions richer dynamics are possible,
including bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is
identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a
priori been expected, so that "$25\sigma$" events are significantly more
probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation
that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian
facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with
a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market
behaviours. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an
example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also
suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity.
