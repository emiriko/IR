Ultracold Fermi atoms allow the realization of the crossover from
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superconductivity to Bose- Einstein
condensation (BEC), by varying with continuity the attraction between fermions
of different species. In this context, radio frequency (RF) spectroscopy
provides a microscopic probe to infer the nature of fermionic pairing. In the
strongly-interacting regime, this pairing affects a wide temperature range
comprising the critical temperature T_c, in analogy to the pseudogap physics
for high-temperature superconductors. By including what are known in
superconductors as "paraconductivity" fluctuations, here we calculate the RF
spectra above T_c for fermions with balanced populations and compare them with
available experimental data, thus revealing that the role of these fluctuations
is considerably enhanced with respect to superconductors. In addition, we
extract from the spectra an energy scale associated with pairing and relate it
to a universal quantity recently introduced for Fermi gases.
