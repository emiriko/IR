We present the experimental realization of spatial quantum correlations of
photons that are induced by multiple scattering of squeezed light. The quantum
correlation relates photons propagating along two different light trajectories
through the random medium and is infinite in range. Both positive and negative
spatial quantum correlations are observed when varying the quantum state
incident to the multiple scattering medium, and the magnitude of the
correlations is controlled by the number of photons. The experimental results
are in excellent agreement with recent theoretical proposals by implementing
the full quantum model of multiple scattering.
