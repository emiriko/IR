We report on growth-mode transitions in the growth of SrRuO3 thin films on
atomically flat Ti4+ single-terminated SrTiO3 (111) substrates, investigated by
reflection high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy. Over
the first ~9 unit cells, the dominant growth mode changes from island to
layer-by-layer for the growth rate of 0.074 unit cells/sec and the growth
temperature of 700 C. Moreover, in the course of growing SrRuO3 films, the
governing growth mode of interest can be manipulated by changing the growth
temperature and the growth rate, which change allows for the selection of the
desired layer-by-layer mode. The present study thus paves the way for
integrations of SrRuO3 thin layers into (111)-orientated oxide
heterostructures, and hence multi-functional devices, requiring control of the
sharp atomic-level interfaces and the layer-by-layer growth mode.
