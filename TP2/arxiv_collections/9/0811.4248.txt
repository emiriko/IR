GaAs nanowires were grown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy on evaporated
metal films (Au, Au / Pd, Ag, Ni, Ga, Cu, Al, Ti). The samples were
characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron
microscope (TEM). SEM images reveal that nanowires grow directly on the metals.
TEM characterization shows crystalline nanowire (nw) structure originating from
Au. Article presents state of the art about nanowire-metal interface growth and
enumerates nanowire contacting methods with metals.
