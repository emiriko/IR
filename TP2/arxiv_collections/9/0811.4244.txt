We show that the structural properties and phase behavior of a self-avoiding
polymer chain on adhesive substrate, subject to pulling at the chain end, can
be obtained by means of a Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE) approach. We derive
analytical expressions for the mean length of the basic structural units of
adsorbed polymer, such as loops and tails, in terms of the adhesive potential
and detachment force, and determine values of the universal exponents which
govern their probability distributions. Most notably, the hitherto
controversial value of the critical adsorption exponent $\phi$ is found to
depend essentially on the interaction between different loops. The chain
detachment transition turns out to be of the first order, albeit dichotomic,
i.e., no coexistence of different phase states exists. These novel theoretical
predictions and the suggested phase diagram of the adsorption-desorption
transformation under external pulling force are verified by means of extensive
Monte Carlo simulations.
