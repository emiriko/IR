A superconducting hybrid structure composed of three layers is
considerated.The 2D layers interact mutually by higher grade inter-layer
couplings.We determine the possible superconducting modes. Those solutions
enable to discuss the conditions for the onset and enhancement of 3D
superconductivity in such a structure.
