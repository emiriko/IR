The classification of life should be based upon the fundamental mechanism in
the evolution of life. We found that the global relationships among species
should be circular phylogeny, which is quite different from the common sense
based upon phylogenetic trees. The genealogical circles can be observed clearly
according to the analysis of protein length distributions of contemporary
species. Thus, we suggest that domains can be defined by distinguished
phylogenetic circles, which are global and stable characteristics of living
systems. The mechanism in genome size evolution has been clarified; hence main
component questions on C-value enigma can be explained. According to the
correlations and quasi-periodicity of protein length distributions, we can also
classify life into three domains.
