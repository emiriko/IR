W-value, mobility and gas gain measurements have been carried out in
electronegative gaseous CS2 and CS2 gas mixtures at a pressure of 40 Torr
making use of a single electron proportional counter method. The experimental
results have revealed that W-values obtained for CS2 (40 Torr), CS2-CF4 (30
Torr - 10 Torr), CS2-Ar (35 Torr - 5 Torr), CS2-Ne (35 Torr - 5 Torr) and
CS2-He (35 Torr - 5 Torr) gas mixtures are 21.1+/-2.7(stat)+/-3(syst) eV,
16.4+/-1.8(stat)+/-2(syst) eV, 13.1+/-1.5(stat)+/-2(syst) eV,
16.3+/-3.0(stat)+/-3(syst) eV and 17.3+/-3.0(stat)+/-3(syst) eV. The mobility
for all CS2 gas mixtures was found to be slightly greater and the gas gain was
found to be significantly greater relative to pure CS2.
