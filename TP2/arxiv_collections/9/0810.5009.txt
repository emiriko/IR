We consider the system {\Delta}u - W_u (u) = 0, for u: R^2 -> R^2, W: R^2 ->
R, where W_u (u) is a smooth potential, symmetric with respect to the u_1, u_2
axes, possessing two global minima a^\pm := (\pma,0) and two connections
e^\pm(x_1) connecting the minima. We prove that there exists an equivariant
solution u(x_1, x_2) satisfying u(x_1, x_2) -> a^\pm, as x_1 -> \pminfiniti,
and u(x_1, x_2) -> e^\pm(x_1), as x_2 -> \pminfiniti. The problem above was
first studied by Alama, Bronsard, and Gui under related hypotheses to the ones
introduced in the present paper. At the expense of one extra symmetry
assumption, we avoid their considerations with the normalized energy and
strengthen their result. We also provide examples for W.
