This paper reports results of the computation of the drag force exerted on an
oscillating object in quantum turbulence in superfluid $^4$He. The drag force
is calculated on the basis of numerical simulations of quantum turbulent flow
about the object. The drag force is proportional to the square of the magnitude
of the oscillation velocity, which is similar to that in classical turbulence
at high Reynolds number. The drag coefficient is also calculated, and its value
is found to be of the same order as that observed in previous experiments. The
correspondence between quantum and classical turbulences is further clarified
by examining the turbulence created by oscillating objects.
