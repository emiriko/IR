We theoretically report that, utilizing electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT), the transverse spatial properties of weak probe fields can
be fast modulated by using optical patterns (e.g. images) with desired
intensity distributions in the coupling fields. Consequently, EIT systems can
function as high-speed optically addressed spatial light modulators. To
exemplify our proposal, we indicate the generation and manipulation of
Laguerre-Gaussian beams based on either phase or amplitude modulation in hot
vapor EIT systems.
