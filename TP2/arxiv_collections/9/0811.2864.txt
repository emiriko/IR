Using the dedicated computer Janus, we follow the nonequilibrium dynamics of
the Ising spin glass in three dimensions for eleven orders of magnitude. The
use of integral estimators for the coherence and correlation lengths allows us
to study dynamic heterogeneities and the presence of a replicon mode and to
obtain safe bounds on the Edwards-Anderson order parameter below the critical
temperature. We obtain good agreement with experimental determinations of the
temperature-dependent decay exponents for the thermoremanent magnetization.
This magnitude is observed to scale with the much harder to measure coherence
length, a potentially useful result for experimentalists. The exponents for
energy relaxation display a linear dependence on temperature and reasonable
extrapolations to the critical point. We conclude examining the time growth of
the coherence length, with a comparison of critical and activated dynamics.
