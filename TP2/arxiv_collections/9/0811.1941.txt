By describing within the chiral unitary approach the s-wave interaction of
the vector meson nonet with the octet of pseudoscalar Goldstone Bosons, we find
that the main component of the axial vector mesons b_1(1235), h_1(1170),
h_1(1380), a_1(1260), f_1(1285) and the two states associated to the K_1(1270)
does not follow the QCD dependence on the number of colors for ordinary qqbar
mesons.
