We discuss the luminescence spectra of coupled light-matter systems realized
with semiconductor heterostructures in microcavities in the presence of a
continuous, incoherent pumping, when the matter field is Fermionic. The linear
regime--which has been the main topic of investigation both experimentally and
theoretically--converges to the case of coupling to a Bosonic material field,
and has been amply discussed in the first part of this work. We address here
the nonlinear regime, and argue that, counter to intuition, it is better
observed at low pumping intensities. We support our discussion with particular
cases representative of, and beyond, the experimental state of the art. We
explore the transition from the quantum to the classical regime, by decomposing
the total spectrum into individual transitions between the dressed states of
the light-matter coupling Hamiltonian, reducing the problem to the positions
and broadenings of all possible transitions. As the system crosses to the
classical limit, rich multiplet structures mapping the quantized energy levels
melt and turn to cavity lasing and to an incoherent Mollow triplet in the
direct exciton emission for very good structure. Less ideal figures of merit
can still betray the quantum regime, with a proper balance of cavity versus
electronic pumping.
