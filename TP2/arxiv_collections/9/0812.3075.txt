We firstly describe a maximal inequality for dual Sobolev spaces W^{-1,p}.
This one corresponds to a "Sobolev version" of usual properties of the
Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in Lebesgue spaces. Even in the euclidean
space, this one seems to be new and we develop arguments in the general
framework of Riemannian manifold. Then we present an application to obtain
interpolation results for Sobolev spaces.
