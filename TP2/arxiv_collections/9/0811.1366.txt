Following a brief outline of the CLIC project, this talk summarizes some of
the principal motivations for an e+ e- collider with E_CM = 3 TeV. It is shown
by several examples that CLIC would represent a significant step beyond the LHC
and ILC in its capabilities for precision measurements at high energies. It
would make possible a complete study of a light Higgs boson, including rare
decay modes, and would provide a unique tool to study a heavy Higgs boson. CLIC
could also complete the studies of supersymmetric spectra, if sparticles are
relatively light, and discover any heavier sparticles. It would also enable
deeper probes of extra dimensions, new gauge bosons and excited quarks or
leptons. CLIC has unique value to add to experimental particle physics,
whatever the LHC discovers.
