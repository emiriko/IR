We formulate eikonal approximation to the calculation of high energy
scattering amplitude in the frame where both colliding objects are very
energetic. We express the eikonal scattering matrix in terms of the color
charge densities of the colliding objects. The calculation is performed in the
Hamiltonian formalism. We also show that the appearance of the longitudinal
electric and magnetic fields immediately following the collision is fully taken
into account in the eikonal approximation.
