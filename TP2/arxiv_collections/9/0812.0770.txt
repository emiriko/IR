This is the user's manual of MC@NLO 3.4. This package is a practical
implementation, based upon the HERWIG event generator, of the MC@NLO formalism,
which allows one to incorporate NLO QCD matrix elements consistently into a
parton shower framework. Processes available in this version include the
hadroproduction of single vector and Higgs bosons, vector boson pairs, heavy
quark pairs, single top, single top in association with a W, lepton pairs, and
Higgs bosons in association with a W or Z. Spin correlations are included for
all processes except ZZ and WZ production. This document is self-contained, but
we emphasise the main differences with respect to previous versions.
