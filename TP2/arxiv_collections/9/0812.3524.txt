This review article is focused on the tremendous progress realized during the
last fifteen years in the understanding of multifragmentation and its
relationship to the liquid-gas phase diagram of nuclei and nuclear matter. The
explosion of the whole nucleus, early predicted by Bohr [N. Bohr, Nature 137
(1936) 351], is a very complex and rich subject which continues to fascinate
nuclear physicists as well as theoreticians who extend the thermodynamics of
phase transitions to finite systems.
