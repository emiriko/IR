Using density functional calculations we have examined the evolution of the
electronic structure of SrRuO3 films grown on SrTiO3 substrates as a function
of film thickness. At the ultrathin limit of two monolayers (RuO2-terminated
surface) the films are found to be at the brink of a spin-state transition
which drives the system to an antiferromagnetic and insulating state.
Increasing the film thickness to four monolayers, one finds the surprising
result that two entirely different solutions coexist. An antiferromagnetic
insulating solution coexists with a metallic solution corresponding to an
antiferromagnetic surface and a ferromagnetic bulk. The electronic structure
found at the ultrathin limit persists for thicker films and an unusual result
is predicted. Thicker films are found to be metallic as expected for the bulk,
but the magnetism does not directly evolve to the bulk ferromagnetic state. The
surface remains antiferromagnetic while the bulk exhibits ferromagnetic
ordering.
