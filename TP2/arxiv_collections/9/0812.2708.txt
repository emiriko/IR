A definition for the statistical significance of a signal in an experiment is
proposed by establishing a correlation between the observed p-value and the
normal distribution integral probability, which is suitable for both counting
experiment and continuous test statistics. The explicit expressions to
calculate the statistical significance for both cases are given.
