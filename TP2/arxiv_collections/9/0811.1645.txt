We introduce random survival forests, a random forests method for the
analysis of right-censored survival data. New survival splitting rules for
growing survival trees are introduced, as is a new missing data algorithm for
imputing missing data. A conservation-of-events principle for survival forests
is introduced and used to define ensemble mortality, a simple interpretable
measure of mortality that can be used as a predicted outcome. Several
illustrative examples are given, including a case study of the prognostic
implications of body mass for individuals with coronary artery disease.
Computations for all examples were implemented using the freely available
R-software package, randomSurvivalForest.
