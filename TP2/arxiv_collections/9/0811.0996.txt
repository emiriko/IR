We consider the effect of rescattering of pairs of quasiparticles in the
Cooper channel resulting in the strong renormalization of second-order
corrections to the spin susceptibility in a two-dimensional electron system. We
use the Fourier expansion of the scattering potential in the vicinity of the
Fermi surface to find that each harmonic becomes renormalized independently.
Since some of those harmonics are negative, the first derivative of the spin
susceptibility is bound to be negative at small momenta, in contrast to the
lowest order perturbation theory result, which predicts a positive slope. We
present in detail an effective method to calculate diagrammatically corrections
to the spin susceptibility to infinite order.
