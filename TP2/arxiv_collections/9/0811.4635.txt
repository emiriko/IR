Lattice gluon propagators are studied using tadpole and Symanzik improved
gauge action in Landau gauge. The study is performed using anisotropic lattices
with asymmetric volumes. The Landau gauge dressing function for the gluon
propagator measured on the lattice is fitted according to a leading power
behavior: $Z(q^2)\simeq (q^2)^{2\kappa}$ with an exponent $\kappa$ at small
momenta. The gluon propagators are also fitted using other models and the
results are compared. Our result is compatible with a finite gluon propagator
at zero momentum in Landau gauge.
