Bulk samples of TbFeAsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$ (T$_{c}$(on) = 50K) were measured by
point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. The spectra show unambiguous
evidence for multiple gap-like features plus the presence of high bias
shoulders. By measuring the spectra as a function of temperature with both gold
and superconducting niobium tips, we establish that the gap-like features are
associated with superconducting order parameter in this material. We discuss
whether the well defined zero bias conductance peak that we observe
infrequently is associated with a nodal superconducting order parameter.
