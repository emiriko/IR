We study the stability of singly- and doubly-quantized vortex states of
harmonically trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) by calculating
the low-lying excitations of these condensates. We map the dynamical stability
of these vortices as functions of the dipole-dipole interaction strength and
trap geometry by finding where their excitations have purely real energy
eigenvalues. In contrast to BECs with purely contact interactions, we find that
dipolar BECs in singly-quantized vortex states go unstable to modes with an
increasing number of angular and radial nodes for more oblate trap aspect
ratios, corresponding to \emph{local} collapse that occurs on a characteristic
length scale. Additionally, we find that dipolar BECs in doubly-quantized
vortex states are unstable to decay into a different topological state (with
two singly-quantized vortices) for all interaction strengths when the trap
geometry is sufficiently prolate to make the dipoles attractive, and in windows
of interaction strength when the trap geometry is sufficiently oblate to make
the dipoles repulsive.
