The investigation of temperature dependence of damping and period of
vibrations of HTSC superconductive cylinder of Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system
suspended by a thin elastic thread and performing axial-torsional vibrations in
a magnetic field at temperatures above the critical one for the main phase
Tc=107 K were carried out. It was observed some "chaos" temperature region in
the temperature interval 107-138 K, where it is seen separate ripples of
dissipation and oscillation frequency. It is assumed that the "chaos" region
could point to a possibility of existence of other magnetic and more
high-temperature phases as single islands in a normal materials matrix.
