Combining higher-order abstract syntax and (co)induction in a logical
framework is well known to be problematic. Previous work described the
implementation of a tool called Hybrid, within Isabelle HOL, which aims to
address many of these difficulties. It allows object logics to be represented
using higher-order abstract syntax, and reasoned about using tactical theorem
proving and principles of (co)induction. In this paper we describe how to use
it in a multi-level reasoning fashion, similar in spirit to other meta-logics
such as Twelf. By explicitly referencing provability in a middle layer called a
specification logic, we solve the problem of reasoning by (co)induction in the
presence of non-stratifiable hypothetical judgments, which allow very elegant
and succinct specifications of object logic inference rules.
