There has been an increasing technological interest on magnetic thin films
containing antidot arrays of hexagonal or square symmetry. Part of this
interest is related to the possibility of domain formation and pinning at the
antidots boundaries. In this paper, we develop a method for the calculation of
the magnetic moment distribution for such arrays which concentrates on the
immediate vicinity of each antidot. For each antidot distribution (square or
hexagonal) a suitable system of coordinates is defined to exploit the shape of
the unit-cells of the overall nanostructure. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown
equations that govern the distribution of moments are rewritten in terms of
these coordinates. The equilibrium moments orientation is calculated for each
position in a Cartesian grid defined for these new coordinate systems, and then
a conformal transformation is applied to insert the moment vectors into the
actual unit-cell. The resulting vector maps display quite clearly regions of
different moment orientation around the antidots, which can be associated with
nanoscale domains. These results are similar to the ones obtained by other
authors[1-4] using the NIST oommf method.
