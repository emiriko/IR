We study the density and spatial distribution of thermal Abelian monopoles in
the deconfined phase of SU(2) pure gauge theory: they display non-trivial
interactions with a well defined continuum limit. The Maximal Abelian Gauge
(MAG) has been chosen to perform the Abelian projection. Questions related to
the choice of the Abelian projection, as well as possible directions for future
studies, are discussed.
