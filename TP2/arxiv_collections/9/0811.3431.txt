A method based off of operator consideration for solving the time evolution
of a wave function is developed. The method is applied to free space, constant
force and harmonic oscillator potentials where general solutions are derived
for the wave function time evolutions for these potentials. Solving the
Heisenberg equations of motion is discussed. A method to obtain exact solutions
to Heisenberg's equations of motion is developed based off of solutions of
classical equations of motion. Approximation methods for the time evolution of
operators and wave functions are developed. A connection between classical and
quantum chaos is made where it is realized that whenever a classical system
behaves chaotically, the quantum system will as well.
