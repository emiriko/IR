Valencia et al. recently claimed that the mass of a Super-Earth (SE) is a
sole factor in determining whether a SE is tectonically active or not. However,
mass resolving astrometry is unable to discern between a SE and its moons if
any. The fact that no exomoons have been discovered yet is rather a matter of
instrumentation imperfection at the present, not of physical absence of
exomoons. This, with recently discovered relationships between geometric and
physical properties in astronomical bodies (Transiting planets; the Earth)
makes it impossible to know yet if the Wageners (here constraining) supposition
on somehow-tidally caused tectonics holds universally or not also.
