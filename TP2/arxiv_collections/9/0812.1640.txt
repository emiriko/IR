The purpose of this contribution is to point out connections between recent
ideas about gerbes and gerbal actions (as higher categorical extension of
representation theory) and old discussion in quantum field theory on commutator
anomalies, gauge group extensions, and 3-cocycles. The unifying concept is the
classical obstruction theory for group extensions as explained in the reference
[ML].
