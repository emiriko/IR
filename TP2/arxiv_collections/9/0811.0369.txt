The SciBooNE Collaboration has performed a search for charged current
coherent pion production from muon neutrinos scattering on carbon, \nu_\mu
^{12}C \to \mu^- ^{12}C \pi^+, with two distinct data samples. No evidence for
coherent pion production is observed. We set 90% confidence level upper limits
on the cross section ratio of charged current coherent pion production to the
total charged current cross section at 0.67\times 10^{-2} at mean neutrino
energy 1.1 GeV and 1.36\times 10^{-2} at mean neutrino energy 2.2 GeV.
