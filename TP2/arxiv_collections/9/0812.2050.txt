Classical Schur analysis is intimately connected to the theory of orthogonal
polynomials on the circle [Simon, 2005]. We investigate here the connection
between multipoint Schur analysis and orthogonal rational functions.
Specifically, we study the convergence of the Wall rational functions via the
development of a rational analogue to the Szeg\H o theory, in the case where
the interpolation points may accumulate on the unit circle. This leads us to
generalize results from [Khrushchev,2001], [Bultheel et al., 1999], and yields
asymptotics of a novel type.
