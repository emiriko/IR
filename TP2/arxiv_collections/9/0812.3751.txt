We study the bonding and diffusion of Au in graphene vacancies using
density-functional theory. Energetics show that Au adsorbs preferably to double
vacancies, steadily in-plane with graphene. All diffusion barriers for the
complex of Au in double vacancy are above 4 eV, whereas the barriers for larger
vacancies are below 2 eV. Our results support the main results of a recent
experiment [Gan et al., Small 4, 587 (2008)], but suggest that the observed
diffusion mechanism is not thermally activated, but radiation-enhanced.
