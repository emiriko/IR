Some important aspects of hadronic tau decays are reviewed: the determination
of alpha_s from the inclusive tau hadronic width, the measurement of |V_{us}|
through the Cabibbo-suppressed decays of the tau, and the theoretical
description of the tau -> nu_tau K pi spectrum. The present status of other
relevant electroweak topics, such as charged-current universality tests or
bounds on lepton-flavour violation, has been already summarized in a previous
review.
