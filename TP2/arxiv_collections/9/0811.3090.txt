We study the evolution of cooperation within the spatial prisoner's dilemma
game on a square lattice where a fraction of players $\mu$ can spread their
strategy more easily than the rest due to a predetermined larger teaching
capability. In addition, players characterized with the larger teaching
capability are allowed to temporarily link with distant opponents of the same
kind with probability $p$, thus introducing shortcut connections among the
distinguished. We show that these additional temporary connections are able to
sustain cooperation throughout the whole range of the temptation to defect.
Remarkably, we observe that as the temptation to defect increases the optimal
$\mu$ decreases, and moreover, only minute values of $p$ warrant the best
promotion of cooperation. Our study thus indicates that influential individuals
must be few and sparsely connected in order for cooperation to thrive in a
defection prone environment.
