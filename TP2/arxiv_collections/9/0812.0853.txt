We extend the definition of algebraic entropy to endomorphisms of affine
varieties. We calculate algebraic entropy of the action of elements of mapping
class groups on various character varieties, and show that it is equal to a
quantity we call the spectral radius, a generalization of the dilatation of a
Pseudo-Anosov mapping class. Our calculations are compatible with all known
calculations of the topological entropy of this action.
