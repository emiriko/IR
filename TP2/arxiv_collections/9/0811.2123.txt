In 1867, during the time when Maxwell was publishing his electromagnetic
theory, L. Lorenz published his theory equating light vibrations with electric
currents. Starting from Kirchhoff's Ohm's law expression, Lorenz introduces
scalar potential retardation to obtain an expression for the electric field
using retarded potentials. In his theory Lorenz sets the vacuum light speed
equal to \sqrt{2}/2 times Weber's measured superluminal value for magnetic
induction speed. Using the wave equation Green's function paradigm Lorenz
reduces his integral, retarded Ohm's law formulation to a differential
formulation for current density. This represents his solution to the
electromagnetic action at a distance problem. During the reduction he presents
a light like, plane wave solution for current density that can not satisfy
initial conditions on the expanding wave front and, using a faulty by parts
integration that neglects retardation, he develops the eponymic Lorenz
condition. Although generally accepted, this condition relates vector and
scalar potentials erroneously. A proper relation is given and major
consequences are developed in appendices. As a finale Lorenz suggests a light
model that I interpret as magnetoinductive waves. Such waves are only now being
studied using Kirchhoff's laws without retardation. I redo this important paper
using modern day notation with critical annotations. This elevates the paper to
a teaching tool position in the millennial search to understand light's dual
nature as wave and corpuscle and brings us full circle, back to Kirchhoff's
laws where Lorenz began.
