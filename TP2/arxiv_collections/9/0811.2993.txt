We study the work fluctuations of a particle, confined to a moving harmonic
potential, under the influence of friction and external Poissonian shot noise.
The asymmetry of the noise induces an effective nonlinearity in the potential,
which in turn leads to singular features in the work distribution. On the basis
of an analytic solution we find that the conventional fluctuation theorem is
violated in this model, even though the distribution exhibits a large deviation
form. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interplay of the various time scales
leads to critical behaviors, such as a negative fluctuation function and a
divergence in the work distribution at the singularity. In a certain parameter
regime large negative work fluctuations are more likely to occur than the
corresponding positive ones, though the average work is always positive, in
agreement with the second law.
