In this paper we present a theoretical calculation of the acoustic Casimir
pressure in a model micro system. Unlike the quantum case, the acoustic Casimir
pressure can be made attractive or repulsive depending on the frequency
bandwidth of the acoustic noise. As a case study, a one degree of freedom
simple-lumped system in an acoustic resonant cavity is considered. We show that
the frequency bandwidth of the acoustic field can be tuned to increase the
stability in existing microswitch systems by selecting the sign of the force.
The acoustic intensity and frequency bandwidth are introduced as two additional
control parameters of the microswitch.
