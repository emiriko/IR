It is argued that the use of the initial Gaussian energy density profile for
hydrodynamics leads to much better uniform description of the RHIC heavy-ion
data than the use of the standard initial condition obtained from the Glauber
model. With the modified Gaussian initial conditions we successfully reproduce
the transverse-momentum spectra, v2, and the pionic HBT radii (including their
azimuthal dependence). The emerging consistent picture of hadron production
hints that a solution of the long standing RHIC HBT puzzle has been found.
