Previous studies modelled the origin of life and the emergence of
photosynthesis on the early Earth-i.e. the origin of plants-in terms of
biological heat engines that worked on thermal cycling caused by suspension in
convecting water. In this new series of studies, heat engines using a more
complex mechanism for thermal cycling are invoked to explain the origin of
animals as well. Biological exploitation of the thermal gradient above a
submarine hydrothermal vent is hypothesized, where a relaxation oscillation in
the length of a protein 'thermotether' would have yielded the thermal cycling
required for thermosynthesis. Such a thermal transition driven movement is not
impeded by the low Reynolds number of a small scale. In the model the
thermotether together with the protein export apparatus evolved into a
'flagellar proton pump' that turned into today's bacterial flagellar motor
after the acquisition of the proton-pumping respiratory chain. The flagellar
pump resembles Feynman's ratchet, and the 'flagellar computer' that implements
chemotaxis a Turing machine: the stator would have functioned as Turing's paper
tape and the stator's proton-transferring subunits with their variable
conformation as the symbols on the tape. The existence of a cellular control
centre in the cilium of the eukaryotic cell is proposed that would have evolved
from the prokaryotic flagellar computer.
