We report about the realization of a quantum device for force sensing at
micrometric scale. We trap an ultracold $^{88}$Sr atomic cloud with a 1-D
optical lattice, then we place the atomic sample close to a test surface using
the same optical lattice as an elevator. We demonstrate precise positioning of
the sample at the $\mu$m scale. By observing the Bloch oscillations of atoms
into the 1-D optical standing wave, we are able to measure the total force on
the atoms along the lattice axis, with a spatial resolution of few microns. We
also demonstrate a technique for transverse displacement of the atoms, allowing
to perform measurements near either transparent or reflective test surfaces. In
order to reduce the minimum distance from the surface, we compress the
longitudinal size of the atomic sample by means of an optical tweezer. Such
system is suited for studies of atom-surface interaction at short distance,
such as measurement of Casimir force and search for possible non-Newtonian
gravity effects.
