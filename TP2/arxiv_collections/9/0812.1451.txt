We consider the anharmonic oscillator with an arbitrary-degree anharmonicity,
a damping term and a forcing term, all coefficients being time-dependent: u" +
g_1(x) u' + g_2(x) u + g_3(x) u^n + g_4(x) = 0, n real. Its physical
applications range from the atomic Thomas-Fermi model to Emden gas dynamics
equilibria, the Duffing oscillator and numerous dynamical systems. The present
work is an overview which includes and generalizes all previously known results
of partial integrability of this oscillator. We give the most general two
conditions on the coefficients under which a first integral of a particular
type exists. A natural interpretation is given for the two conditions. We
compare these two conditions with those provided by the Painleve' analysis.
