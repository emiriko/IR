We have studied surface morphology and magnetic properties of Fe/MgO(001)
films deposited at an angle varying between 0o and 60o with respect to the
surface normal and with azimuth along the Fe[010] or the Fe[110] direction. Due
to shadowing, elongated grains appear on the film surface for deposition at
sufficiently large angle. X-ray reflectivity reveals that, depending on the
azimuthal direction, films become either rougher or smoother for oblique
deposition. For deposition along Fe[010] the pronounced uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy (UMA) results in the occurrence of reversed two-step and of
three-step hysteresis loops. For deposition along Fe[110] the growth-induced
UMA is much weaker, causing a small rotation of the easy axes.
