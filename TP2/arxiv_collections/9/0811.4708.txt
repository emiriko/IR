We analyze the transport properties of relativistic fluid composed of
constituent quarks at finite temperature and density. We focus on the shear and
bulk viscosities and study their behavior near chiral phase transition. We
model the constituent quark interactions through the Nambu--Jona Lasinio
Lagrangian. The transport coefficients are calculated within kinetic theory
under relaxation time approximation including in--medium modification of
quasi--particles dispersion relations. We quantify the influence of the order
of chiral phase transition and the critical end point on dissipative phenomena
in such a medium. Considering the changes of shear and bulk viscosities along
the phase boundary we discuss their sensitivity to probe the existence of the
critical end point.
