A relation between temperature, Fermi momentum and radius of the nucleon has
been derived. The percentage increase in radii of the nucleon with temperature
and the temperature dependent F$_{2}$ structure function of the nucleon have
been investigated. An estimate of the Fermi momentum of the nucleon has been
made. The results are found to be in agreement with existing theoretical and
experimental suggestions .
