We present an overview of strong correlations in single-wall carbon
nanotubes, and an introduction to the techniques used to study them
theoretically. We concentrate on zigzag nanotubes, although universality
dictates that much ofthe theory can also be applied to armchair or chiral
nanotubes. We show how interaction effects lead to exotic low energy properties
and discuss future directions for studies on correlation effects in nanotubes.
