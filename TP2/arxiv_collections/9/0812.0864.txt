In this paper, we study the quantum statistical entropy in a 5D Ricci-flat
black string solution, which contains a 4D Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole
on the brane, by using the improved thin-layer method with the generalized
uncertainty principle. The entropy is the linear sum of the areas of the event
horizon and the cosmological horizon without any cut-off and any constraint on
the bulk's configuration rather than the usual uncertainty principle. The
system's density of state and free energy are convergent in the neighborhood of
horizon. The small-mass approximation is determined by the asymptotic behavior
of metric function near horizons. Meanwhile, we obtain the minimal length of
the position $\Delta x$ which is restrained by the surface gravities and the
thickness of layer near horizons.
