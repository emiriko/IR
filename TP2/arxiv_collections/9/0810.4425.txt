Magnetotransport measurements have been performed on two-dimensional electron
gases formed at InAs(110) surfaces covered with a submonolayer of Fe.
Hysteresis in the magnetoresistance, a difference in remanent magnetoresistance
between zero-field-cooling procedures and field-cooling procedures, and
logarithmic time-dependent relaxation after magnetic field sweep are clearly
observed at 1.7 K for a coverage of 0.42 monolayer. These features are
associated with spin-glass ordering in the Fe film.
