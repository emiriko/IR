We have carried out an analysis of singularities in Kohn variational
calculations for low energy e^{+}-H_{2} elastic scattering. Provided that a
sufficiently accurate trial wavefunction is used, we argue that our
implementation of the Kohn variational principle necessarily gives rise to
singularities which are not spurious. We propose two approaches for optimizing
a free parameter of the trial wavefunction in order to avoid anomalous
behaviour in scattering phase shift calculations, the first of which is based
on the existence of such singularities. The second approach is a more
conventional optimization of the generalized Kohn method. Close agreement is
observed between the results of the two optimization schemes; further, they
give results which are seen to be effectively equivalent to those obtained with
the complex Kohn method. The advantage of the first optimization scheme is that
it does not require an explicit solution of the Kohn equations to be found. We
give examples of anomalies which cannot be avoided using either optimization
scheme but show that it is possible to avoid these anomalies by considering
variations in the nonlinear parameters of the trial function.
