Alternative theories of gravity predict the presence of massive scalar,
vector, and tensor gravitational wave modes in addition to the standard
massless spin~2 graviton of general relativity. The deflection and frequency
shift effects on light from distant sources propagating through a stochastic
background of gravitational waves, containing such modes, differ from their
counterparts in general relativity. Such effects are considered as a possible
signature for alternative gravity in attempts to detect deviations from
Einstein's gravity by astrophysical means.
