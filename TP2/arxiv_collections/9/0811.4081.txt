We consider Hamiltonian PDEs that can be split into a linear unbounded
operator and a regular non linear part. We consider abstract splitting methods
associated with this decomposition where no discretization in space is made. We
prove a normal form result for the corresponding discrete flow under generic
non resonance conditions on the frequencies of the linear operator and on the
step size. This result implies the conservation of the regularity of the
numerical solution associated with the splitting method over arbitrary long
time, provided the initial data is small enough. This result holds for
numerical schemes controlling the round-off error at each step to avoid
possible high frequency energy drift. We apply this results to nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equations as well as the nonlinear wave equation.}
