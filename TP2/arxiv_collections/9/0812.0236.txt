New measurements of the total and partial fragmentation cross sections in the
energy range 0.3-10 A GeV of Fe^{26+}, Si^{14+} and C^{6+} beams on
polyethylene, CR39 and aluminum targets are presented. The exposures were made
at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), USA, and Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator
in Chiba (HIMAC), Japan. The CR39 nuclear track detectors were used to identify
the incident and survived beams and their fragments. The total fragmentation
cross sections for all targets are almost energy independent while they depend
on the target mass. The measured partial fragmentation cross sections are also
discussed.
