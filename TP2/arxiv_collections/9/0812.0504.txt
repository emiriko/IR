We discuss the three-body decay mechanisms of many-body resonances. R-matrix
sequential description is compared with full Faddeev computation. The role of
the angular momentum and boson symmetries is also studied. As an illustration
we show the computed $\alpha$-particle energy distribution after the decay of
12C(1^+) resonance at 12.7 MeV.
