Recent results from PAMELA and ATIC hint that O(TeV) dark matter (DM) is
annihilating, in our galactic neighborhood, predominantly to leptons. The
annihilation rate is much larger now than during freeze-out, one possible
explanation of this is a low-velocity enhancement of the annihilation cross
section. In a model independent fashion, we show that in this case the rate of
neutrino emission from the Earth, due to DM annihilation, may be greatly
enhanced while the rate from the Sun is unaltered. There is potential for
IceCube to see these earthborn neutrinos while the same parameter space will be
soon covered by direct detection experiments. Combining these near-future data
will allow extraction of valuable information about the DM sector dynamics.
