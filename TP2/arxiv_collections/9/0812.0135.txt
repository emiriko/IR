As a nuclear spin model of scalable quantum register, the one-dimensional
chain of the magnetic atoms with nuclear spins 1/2 substituting the basic atoms
in the plate of nuclear spin free easy-axis 3D antiferromagnet is considered.
It is formulated the generalized antiferromagnet Hamiltonian in spin-wave
approximation (low temperatures) considering the inhomogeneous external
magnetic field, which is directed along the easy axis normally to plane of the
plate and has a constant gradient along the nuclear spin chain. Assuming a weak
gradient, the asymptotic expression for coefficients of unitary transformations
to the diagonal form of antiferromagnet Hamiltonian is found. With this result
the expression for indirect interspin coupling, which is due to hyperfine
nuclear electron coupling in atoms and the virtual spin wave propagation in
antiferromagnet ground state, was evaluated.
  It is shown that the inhomogeneous magnetic field essentially modifies the
characteristics of indirect interspin coupling. The indirect interaction
essentially grows and even oscillates in relation to the interspin distance
when the local field value in the middle point of two considered nuclear spin
is close to the critical field for quantum phase transition of spin-flop type
in bulk antiferromagnet or close to antiferromagnetic resonance. Thus, the
external magnetic field, its gradient, microwave frequency and power can play
the role of control parameters for qubit states.
  Finally, the one and two qubit states decoherence and longitudinal relaxation
rate are caused by the interaction of nuclear spins with virtual spin waves in
antiferromagnet ground state are calculated.
