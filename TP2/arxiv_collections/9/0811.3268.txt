The local lattice structure in newly discovered LaFeAsO1-xFx superconductors
is studied by extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements. An
anomalous upturn of the mean-square relative displacement of the Fe-As bond is
detected below ~70 K as electron carriers are introduced,reflecting the
occurrence of Fe-As bond local lattice fluctuation. Similar to that in
cuprates, this lattice fluctuation exhibits an abrupt depression at the onset
superconducting transition temperature. The results indicate that strong
electron-lattice interaction is involved in the superconducting transition in
oxypcnictide superconductors, putting a strict limitation on possible
theoretical models.
