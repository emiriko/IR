The alternative approach to QCD analysis of the photon structure function
$F_2^{\gamma}$ is presented. It differs from the conventional one by the
presence of the terms which in conventional approach appear in higher orders.
We show that this difference concerns also the photonic parton distribution
functions. In the alternative approach, the complete LO analysis of
$F_2^{\gamma}$ can be performed as all required quantities are known. At the
NLO, however, one of the coefficient function is so far not available and thus
only the photonic parton distribution function can be computed and compared to
those of standard approach. We discuss the numerical difference of these
approaches at the LO and the NLO approximation and show that in case of
$F_2^{\gamma}$ this difference is non-negligible and may play an important role
in the analysis on photon data of the future experiments.
