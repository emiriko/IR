We simplify the general form of the fermion-fermion-gauge boson interactions
generated by dimension-six gauge-invariant effective operators by using the
equations of motion to remove redundant operators. It is found that the most
general vertex for off-shell fermions fi, fj and an off-shell boson
V=W,Z,gamma,g only involves gamma^mu and sigma^{mu nu} q_nu terms, with
q=p_i-p_j. Examples are given for the Wtb, Ztt, gamma tt and gtt interactions,
whose general expression is greatly simplified with respect to previous results
in the literature. The same arguments apply to top flavour-changing neutral
interactions with the Z boson, the photon or the gluon, which can also be
parameterised in full generality with only gamma^mu and sigma^{mu nu} q_nu
couplings. Explicit expressions are given for these vertices in terms of
dimension-six gauge-invariant operators. We also discuss how effective operator
coefficients might be determined from eventual measurements of anomalous
couplings.
