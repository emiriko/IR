Physiological changes which result in changes in bacterial gene expression
are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric
bacteria. Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent
on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of
promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which
is difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model
describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs
transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to
DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli
allow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce
the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to
predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive
(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent
regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in
transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth
rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene
expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP
expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the
case of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate
the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control
proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and
biosynthetic operons.
