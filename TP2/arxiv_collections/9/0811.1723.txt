At low energies, electrons in doped graphene sheets are described by a
massless Dirac fermion Hamiltonian. In this work we present a semi-analytical
expression for the dynamical density-density linear-response function of
noninteracting massless Dirac fermions (the so-called "Lindhard" function) at
finite temperature. This result is crucial to describe finite-temperature
screening of interacting massless Dirac fermions within the Random Phase
Approximation. In particular, we use it to make quantitative predictions for
the specific heat and the compressibility of doped graphene sheets. We find
that, at low temperatures, the specific heat has the usual normal-Fermi-liquid
linear-in-temperature behavior, with a slope that is solely controlled by the
renormalized quasiparticle velocity.
