Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has been largely exploited as a
tool for absolute calibration of photon-counting detectors, i.e detectors
registering very small photon fluxes. In [J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 23, 2185 (2006)]
we derived a method for absolute calibration of analog detectors using SPDC
emission at higher photon fluxes, where the beam is seen as a continuum by the
detector. Nevertheless intrinsic limitations appear when high-gain regime of
SPDC is required to reach even larger photon fluxes. Here we show that
stimulated parametric down conversion allow one to avoid this limitation, since
stimulated photon fluxes are increased by the presence of the seed beam.
