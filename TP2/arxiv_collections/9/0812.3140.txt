We describe and analyze in detail our recent theoretical proposal for the
realization and manipulation of anyons in a weakly interacting system
consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime
adjacent to a type-II superconducting film with an artificial array of pinning
sites. The anyon is realized in response to a defect in the pinned vortex
lattice and carries a charge \pm e/2 and a statistical angle pi/4. We establish
this result, both analytically and numerically, in three complementary
approaches: (i) a continuum model of two-dimensional electrons in the vortex
lattice of the superconducting film; (ii) a minimal tight-binding lattice model
that captures the essential features of the system; and (iii) an effective
theory of the superconducting vortex lattice superposed on the integer quantum
Hall state. We propose a novel method to measure the fractional charge directly
in a bulk transport experiment and an all-electric setup for an ``anyon
shuttle'' implementing the braiding operations. We briefly discuss conditions
for fabricating the system in the lab and its potential applications in quantum
information processing with non-Abelian anyons.
