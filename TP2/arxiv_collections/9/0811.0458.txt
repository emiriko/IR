Based on the concept of complementary media, we propose an invisibility cloak
operating at a finite frequency that can cloak an object with a pre-specified
shape and size within a certain distance outside the shell. The cloak comprises
of a dielectric core, and an "anti-object" embedded inside a negative index
shell. The cloaked object is not blinded by the cloaking shell since it lies
outside the cloak. Full-wave simulations in two dimensions have been performed
to verify the cloaking effect.
