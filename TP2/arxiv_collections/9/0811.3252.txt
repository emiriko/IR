We study the new boundary condition of the O(n) model proposed by Jacobsen
and Saleur using the matrix model. The spectrum of boundary operators and their
conformal weights are obtained by solving the loop equations. Using the
diagrammatic expansion of the matrix model as well as the loop equations, we
make an explicit correspondence between the new boundary condition of the O(n)
model and the "alternating height" boundary conditions in RSOS model.
