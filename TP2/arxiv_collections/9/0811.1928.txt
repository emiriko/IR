We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a semi-infinite
chain which is coupled at the end to a reservoir with a particle density that
changes periodically in time. It is shown that the density profile assumes a
time-periodic sawtooth-like shape. This shape does not depend on initial
conditions and is found analytically in the hydrodynamic limit. In a finite
system, the stationary state is shown to be governed by effective boundary
densities and the extremal flux principle. Effective boundary densities are
determined numerically via Monte Carlo simulations and compared with those
given by mean field approach and numerical integration of the hydrodynamic
limit equation which is the Burgers equation. Our results extend
straightforwardly beyond the ASEP to a wide class of driven diffusive systems
with one conserved particle species.
