Though intuitively appealing, the concept of spinodal is rigourously defined
only in systems with infinite range interactions (mean field systems). In
short-range systems, a pseudo-spinodal can be defined by extrapolation of
metastable measurements, but the point itself is not reachable because it lies
beyond the metastability limit. In this work we show that a sensible definition
of spinodal points can be obtained through the short time dynamical behavior of
the system deep inside the metastable phase, by looking for a point where the
system shows critical behavior. We show that spinodal points obtained by this
method agree both with the thermodynamical spinodal point in mean field systems
and with the pseudo-spinodal point obtained by extrapolation of
meta-equilibrium behavior in short range systems. With this definition, a
practical determination can be achieved without regard for equilibration
issues.
