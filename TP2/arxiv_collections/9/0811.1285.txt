We compute the entanglement between separated blocks in certain spin models
showing that at criticality this entanglement is a function of the ratio of the
separation to the length of the blocks and can be written as a product of a
power law and an exponential decay. It thereby interpolates between the
entanglement of individual spins and blocks of spins. It captures features of
correlation functions at criticality as well as the monogamous nature of
entanglement. We exemplify invariant features of this entanglement to
microscopic changes within the same universality class. We find this
entanglement to be invariant with respect to simultaneous scale transformations
of the separation and the length of the blocks. As a corollary, this study
estimates the entanglement between separated regions of those quantum fields to
which the considered spin models map at criticality.
