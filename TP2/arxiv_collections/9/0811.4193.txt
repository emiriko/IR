Proof-of-principle experiments have demonstrated an electrostatic field
evaporation based deuterium ion source for use in compact, high-output
deuterium-tritium neutron generators. The ion source produces principally
atomic deuterium and titanium ions. More than 100 monolayers of deuterated
titanium thin film can be removed and ionized from a single tip in less than 20
ns. The measurements indicate that with the use of microfabricated tip arrays
the deuterium ion source could provide sufficient ion current to produce 10^9
to 10^10 n/cm^2 of tip array area.
