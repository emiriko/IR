We study bifurcations in a spatially extended nonlinear system representing
population dynamics with the help of analytic calculations based on the
time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a quantum particle subjected to a
uniform gravitational field. Despite the linear character of the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the result we obtain helps in the understanding of
the onset of abrupt transitions leading to extinction of biological
populations. The result is expressed in terms of Airy functions and sheds light
on the behavior of bacteria in a Petri dish as well as of large animals such as
rodents moving over a landscape.
