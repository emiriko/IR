We extend the formulation of spin 2 fields on Minkowski space which makes the
action manifestly invariant under duality rotations to the case of interactions
with external electric and magnetic sources by adding suitable potentials for
the longitudinal and trace parts. In this framework, the string singularity of
the linearized Taub-NUT solution is resolved into a Coulomb-like solution.
Suitable surface charges to measure energy-momentum and angular momentum of
both electric and magnetic type are constructed.
