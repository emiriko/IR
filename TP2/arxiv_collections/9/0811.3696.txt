Standard quantum mechanics undeniably violates the notion of separability
that classical physics accustomed us to consider as valid. By relating the
phenomenon of quantum nonseparability to the all-important concept of
potentiality, we effectively provide a coherent picture of the puzzling
entangled correlations among spatially separated systems. We further argue that
the generalized phenomenon of quantum nonseparability implies contextuality for
the production of well-defined events in the quantum domain, whereas
contextuality entails in turn a structural-relational conception of quantal
objects, viewed as carriers of dispositional properties. It is finally
suggested that contextuality, if considered as a conditionalization preparation
procedure of the object to be measured, naturally leads to a separable concept
of reality whose elements are experienced as distinct, well-localized objects
having determinate properties. In this connection, we find it necessary to
distinguish the meaning of the term reality from the criterion of reality for
us. The implications of the latter considerations for the notion of objectivity
in quantum mechanics are also discussed.
