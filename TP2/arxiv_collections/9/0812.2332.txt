Based on the 4D momentum, the influence of quintessence on the gravitational
frequency shift and the deflection of light are examined in modified
Schwarzschild space. We find that the frequency of photon depends on the state
parameter of quintessence $w_q$: the frequency increases for $-1<w_q<-1/3$ and
decreases for $-1/3<w_q<0$. Meanwhile, we adopt an integral power number $a$
($a = 3\omega_q + 2$) to solve the orbital equation of photon. The photon's
potentials become higher with the decrease of $\omega_q$. The behavior of
bending light depends on the state parameter $\omega_q$ sensitively. In
particular, for the case of $\omega_q = -1$, there is no influence on the
deflection of light by quintessence. Else, according to the H-masers of GP-A
redshift experiment and the long-baseline interferometry, the constraints on
the quintessence field in Solar system are presented here.
