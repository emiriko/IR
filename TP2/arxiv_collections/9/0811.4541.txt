A fundamental spacetime scale in the universe leads to noncommutative
spacetime and thence to a modified energy - momentum dispersion relation or
equivalently to a modification of Lorentz symmetry as shown by the author and
others. This latter consideration has also been used by some scholars though
based on purely phenomenological models that have been suggested by the
observation of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. On the other hand a parallel
development has been the proposal of a small but non zero photon mass by some
scholars including the author, such a mass being within experimentally
allowable limits. This too leads to a small violation of Lorentz symmetry
observable in principle in very high energy gamma rays, as in fact is claimed.
We show in this paper that the latter mechanism in fact follows from the
former, thus unifying two apparently different approaches.
