QCD string model formulated in the framework of the Field Correlator Method
(FCM) in QCD is employed to calculate the masses of $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c$ and
recently observed at Tevatron $\Sigma_b$, $\Xi_b$ baryons and their orbital
excitations.
  The auxiliary field formalism allows one to write a simple local form of the
effective Hamiltonian for the three quark system, which comprises both
confinement and relativistic effects, and contains only universal parameters:
the string tension $\sigma$, the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$, and the
bare (current) quark masses $m_i$. We calculate the hyperfine splitting with
account of the both perturbative and non--perturbative spin-spin forces between
quarks in a baryon. For the orbital excitations we estimate the string
correction for the confinement potential - the leading correction to the
contribution of the proper inertia of the rotating string. This correction
lowers the masses of the P-states by 50 MeV. We find our numerical results to
be in good agreement with experimental data.
