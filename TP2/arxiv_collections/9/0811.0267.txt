Magnetic nanomaterials are considered, formed by magnetic nanomolecules with
high spins. The problem of spin reversal in these materials is analyzed, which
is of interest for the possible use of such materials for quantum information
processing and quantum computing. The fastest spin reversal can be achieved by
coupling the spin sample to a resonant electric circuit and by an appropriate
choice of the system parameters. A principal point is to choose these
parameters so that to organize coherent spin motion. Dynamics of collective
motion is modelled by computer simulations, which confirm the high level of
dynamical coherence of molecular spins in the process of spin reversal.
