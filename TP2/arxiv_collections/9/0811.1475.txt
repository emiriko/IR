We propose a two-dimensional phase-field-crystal model for the
(2$\times$1)-(1$\times$1) phase transitions of Si(001) and Ge(001) surfaces.
The dimerization in the 2$\times$1 phase is described with a
phase-field-crystal variable which is determined by solving an evolution
equation derived from the free energy. Simulated periodic arrays of
dimerization variable is consistent with scanning-tunnelling-microscopy images
of the two dimerized surfaces. Calculated temperature dependence of the
dimerization parameter indicates that normal dimers and broken ones coexist
between the temperatures describing the charactristic temperature width of the
phase-transition, $T_L$ and $T_H$, and a first-order phase transition takes
place at a temperature between them. The dimerization over the whole
temperature is determined. These results are in agreement with experiment. This
phase-field-crystal approach is applicable to phase-transitions of other
reconstructed surface phases, especially semiconductor $n\times$1 reconstructed
surface phases.
