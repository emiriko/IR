At zero chemical potential mu, the order of the temperature-driven
quark-hadron transition depends on the quark masses m_{u,d} and m_s. Along a
critical line bounding the region of first-order chiral transitions in the
(m_{u,d},m_s) plane, this transition is second order. When the chemical
potential is turned on, this critical line spans a surface, whose curvature at
mu=0 can be determined without any sign or overlap problem. Our past
measurements on N_t=4 lattices suggest that the region of quark masses for
which the transition is first order shrinks when mu is turned on, which makes a
QCD chiral critical point at small mu/T unlikely. We present results from two
complementary methods, which can be combined to yield information on
higher-order terms. It turns out that the O(mu^4) term reinforces the effect of
the leading O(mu^2) term, and there is strong evidence that the O(mu^6) and
O(mu^8) terms do as well. We also report on simulations underway, where the
strange quark is given its physical mass, and where the lattice spacing is
reduced.
