We systematically study relativistic two-species fermions with tunable
attractive interactions and number-density asymmetry at zero temperature. In
general, a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) - Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) -
relativistic BEC (RBEC) crossover is observed. A generalized BCS ground state
and its stability are analyzed. The homogeneous superfluid phase can become
unstable and we consider phase separation in real space for neutral systems. In
the nonrelativistic limit, our results are consistent with well-known results.
In addition to a BCS-BEC crossover similar to that in the nonrelativistic case,
in the strongly attractive regime gapless excitations of antifermions and a
RBEC state are observed. We address how different phases respond to number
density asymmetry and present predictive phase diagrams of BCS-BEC-RBEC
crossover.
