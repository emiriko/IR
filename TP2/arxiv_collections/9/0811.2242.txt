Repeated observations of inhomogeneity in cuperate superconductors[1-5] make
one immediately question the existance of coherent quasiparticles(qp's) and the
applicability of a momentum space picture. Yet, obversations of interference
effects[6-9] suggest that the qp's maintain a remarkable coherence under
special circumstances. In particular, quasi-particle interference (QPI) imaging
using scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed a highly unusual form of
coherence: accumulation of coherence only at special points in momentum space
with a particular energy dispersion[5-7]. Here we show that nematic quantum
critical fluctuations[10], combined with the known extreme velocity
anisotropy[11] provide a natural mechanism for the accumulation of coherence at
those special points. Our results raise the intriguing question of whether the
nematic fluctuations provide the unique mechanism for such a phenomenon.
