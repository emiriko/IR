We show that the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$ can be directly observed
in phonon spectra, as predicted by recent theories. In addition, since each
phonon probes the gap on only a small part of the Fermi surface, the gap
anisotropy can be studied in detail. Our neutron scattering investigation of
the anisotropic conventional superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C demonstrates this new
application of phonon spectroscopy.
