A finite temperature model of strongly correlated nucleons with underlying
isospin symmetries is developed. The model can be used to study the role of
bound states and Feshbach resonances on the thermal properties of a spin 1/2,
isospin 1/2 system of protons and neutrons by varying the proton fraction. An
analysis of features associated with a universal thermodynamic limit or unitary
limit is given. In the limit of very large scattering length, the effective
range to quantum thermal wavelength appears as a limiting scale in an
interaction energy and equation of state.
