In a previous work we showed that massive test particles exhibit a
non-geodesic acceleration in a modified theory of gravity obtained by a
non-commutative deformation of General Relativity (so-called Matrix Gravity).
We propose that this non-geodesic acceleration might be the origin of the
anomalous acceleration experienced by the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11
spacecrafts.
