The auxiliary field method has been recently proposed as an efficient
technique to compute analytical approximate solutions of eigenequations in
quantum mechanics. We show that the auxiliary field method is completely
equivalent to the envelope theory, which is another well-known procedure to
analytically solve eigenequations, although relying on different principles
\textit{a priori}. This equivalence leads to a deeper understanding of both
frameworks.
