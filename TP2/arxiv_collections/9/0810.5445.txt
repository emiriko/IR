A Raman scattering spectroscopy study is reported through all four phases of
a (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 crystal and ((K0.5Na0.5)1-xLix)NbO3 for x=0.02 and 0.03. The
transitions among the ferroelectric phases in the Li-free crystal are
homogeneous and strongly hysteretic, with no evidence of a mixed-phase region
between the rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases. The Raman pattern in the
lowest-temperature phase in the Li-doped material differs significantly from
that found for x=0 and suggest a structural phase boundary exists at for a Li
concentration of less than 2%.
