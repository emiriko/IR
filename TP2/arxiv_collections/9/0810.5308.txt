We evaluate typical performance of irregular low-density generator-matrix
(LDGM) codes, which is defined by sparse matrices with arbitrary irregular bit
degree distribution and arbitrary check degree distribution, for lossy
compression. We apply the replica method under one-step replica symmetry
breaking (1RSB) ansatz to this problem.
