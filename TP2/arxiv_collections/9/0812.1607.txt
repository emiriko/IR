The phenomenology of gluon saturation at small parton momentum fraction,
Bjorken-x, in the proton and in the nucleus is introduced. The
experimentally-accessible kinematic domains at the nucleus-nucleus colliders
RHIC and LHC are discussed. Finally, the saturation hints emerging from
measurements at RHIC and the perspectives for LHC are described.
