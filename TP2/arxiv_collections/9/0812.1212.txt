We outline how one can understand the Skyrme model from the modern
perspective. We review the quantization of the SU(3) rotations of the Skyrmion,
leading to the exotic baryons that cannot be made of three quarks. It is shown
that in the limit of large number of colours the lowest-mass exotic baryons can
be studied from the kaon-Skyrmion scattering amplitudes, an approach known
after Callan and Klebanov. We follow this approach and find, both analytically
and numerically, a strong Theta+ resonance in the scattering amplitude that is
traced to the rotational mode. The Skyrme model does predict an exotic
resonance Theta+ but grossly overestimates the width. To understand better the
factors affecting the width, it is computed by several methods giving, however,
identical results. In particular, we show that insofar as the width is small,
it can be found from the transition axial constant. The physics leading to a
narrow Theta+ resonance is briefly reviewed and affirmed.
