We study the dislocation formation in 2D nanoscopic islands with two methods,
the Molecular Static method and the Phase Field Crystal method. It is found
that both methods indicate the same qualitative stages of the nucleation
process. The dislocations nucleate at the film-substrate contact point and the
energy decreases monotonously when the dislocations are farther away from the
island-wetting film contact points than the distance of the highest energy
barrier.
