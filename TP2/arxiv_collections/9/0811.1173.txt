Let f be a smooth diffeomorphism of the half-line fixing only the origin and
Z^r its centralizer in the group of C^r diffeomorphisms. According to
well-known results of Szekeres and Kopell, Z^1 is a one-parameter group. On the
other hand, Sergeraert constructed an f whose centralizer Z^r, $2\le r\le
\infty$, reduces to the group generated by f. We show that Z^r can actually be
a proper dense and uncountable subgroup of Z^1 and that this phenomenon is not
scarce.
