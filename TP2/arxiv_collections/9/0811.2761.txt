Complex networks have acquired a great popularity in recent years, since the
graph representation of many natural, social and technological systems is often
very helpful to characterize and model their phenomenology. Additionally, the
mathematical tools of statistical physics have proven to be particularly
suitable for studying and understanding complex networks. Nevertheless, an
important obstacle to this theoretical approach is still represented by the
difficulties to draw parallelisms between network science and more traditional
aspects of statistical physics. In this paper, we explore the relation between
complex networks and a well known topic of statistical physics:
renormalization. A general method to analyze renormalization flows of complex
networks is introduced. The method can be applied to study any suitable
renormalization transformation. Finite-size scaling can be performed on
computer-generated networks in order to classify them in universality classes.
We also present applications of the method on real networks.
