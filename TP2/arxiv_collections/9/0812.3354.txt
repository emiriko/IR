In a previous paper, we announced a formula to compute Gromov-Witten and
Welschinger invariants of some toric varieties, in terms of combinatorial
objects called floor diagrams. We give here detailed proofs in the tropical
geometry framework, in the case when the ambient variety is a complex surface,
and give some examples of computations using floor diagrams. The focusing on
dimension 2 is motivated by the special combinatoric of floor diagrams compared
to arbitrary dimension.
  We treat a general toric surface case in this dimension: the curve is given
by an arbitrary lattice polygon and include computation of Welschinger
invariants with pairs of conjugate points. See also \cite{FM} for combinatorial
treatment of floor diagrams in the projective case.
