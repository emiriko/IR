The ATLAS detector is intended to verify the standard model and to search for
new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, CERN). In addition to this
primary goal, it also allows detection of muons of cosmic rays. On the other
hand, unusual bursts of the muon intensity, which correlate with powerful solar
flares were recorded and investigated earlier at the Baksan Underground
Scintillation Telescope (BUST, INR, Russia) in period from 1981 to 2006 (~2.5
solar cycles). The nature of the muon bursts and their probable relation to the
solar cosmic rays is still not quite clear. ATLAS has an excellent muon system
allowing search for similar muon bursts. Within the next few years, when the
LHC and ATLAS should start to operate, an increase in the solar activity is
expected in the new 24th cycle. It increases the probability of finding the
muon bursts from powerful flares. Hence ATLAS has a good opportunity to verify
the relation of muon bursts to the solar cosmic rays.
