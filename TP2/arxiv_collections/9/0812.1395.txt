Suppose that at any stage of a statistical experiment a control variable $X$
that affects the distribution of the observed data $Y$ can be used. The
distribution of $Y$ depends on some unknown parameter $\theta$, and we consider
the classical problem of testing a simple hypothesis $H_0: \theta=\theta_0$
against a simple alternative $H_1: \theta=\theta_1$ allowing the data to be
controlled by $X$, in the following sequential context. The experiment starts
with assigning a value $X_1$ to the control variable and observing $Y_1$ as a
response. After some analysis, we choose another value $X_2$ for the control
variable, and observe $Y_2$ as a response, etc. It is supposed that the
experiment eventually stops, and at that moment a final decision in favour of
$H_0$ or $H_1$ is to be taken.
  In this article, our aim is to characterize the structure of optimal
sequential procedures, based on this type of data, for testing a simple
hypothesis against a simple alternative.
