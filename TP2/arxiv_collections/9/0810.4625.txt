In this paper, we report our latest research on a novel theoretical
information-geometric framework suitable to characterize chaotic dynamical
behavior of arbitrary complex systems on curved statistical manifolds.
Specifically, an information-geometric analogue of the Zurek-Paz quantum chaos
criterion of linear entropy growth and an information-geometric
characterization of chaotic (integrable) energy level statistics of a quantum
antiferromagnetic Ising spin chain in a tilted (transverse) external magnetic
field are presented.
