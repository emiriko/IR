We have fabricated a custom cryogenic Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
(CMOS) integrated circuit that has a higher measurement bandwidth compared with
conventional room temperature electronics. This allowed implementing single
shot operations and observe the real-time evolution of the current of a
phosphorous-doped silicon single electron transistor that was irradiated with a
microwave pulse. Relaxation times up to 90 us are observed, suggesting the
presence of well isolated electron excitations within the device. It is
expected that these are associated with long decoherence time and the device
may be suitable for quantum information processing.
