As nuclear wave functions have to obey the Pauli principle, potentials issued
from reaction theory or Hartree-Fock formalism using finite-range interactions
contain a non-local part. Written in coordinate space representation, the
Schrodinger equation becomes integro-differential, which is difficult to solve,
contrary to the case of local potentials, where it is an ordinary differential
equation. A simple and powerful method has been proposed several years ago,
with the trivially equivalent potential method, where non-local potential is
replaced by an equivalent local potential, which is state-dependent and has to
be determined iteratively. Its main disadvantage, however, is the appearance of
divergences in potentials if the wave functions have nodes, which is generally
the case. We will show that divergences can be removed by a slight modification
of the trivially equivalent potential method, leading to a very simple, stable
and precise numerical technique to deal with non-local potentials. Examples
will be provided with the calculation of the Hartree-Fock potential and
associated wave functions of 16O using the finite-range N3LO realistic
interaction.
