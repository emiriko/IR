The nonequilibrium photon Green function for a bounded medium surrounded by
vacuum is analyzed on the basis of the Dyson equation. As its components, the
field-field fluctuations as well as the spectral function split up into parts
related to medium and vacuum. Particularly, it is shown that the vacuum-induced
fluctuations describe propagation of arbitrary, even nonclassical light in
terms of solutions of the classical wave propagation problem. The results
generalize previously obtained ones for steadily excited media in slab
geometry.
