We investigate numerically the Multiple Quantum (MQ) NMR dynamics in systems
of nuclear spins 1/2 coupled by the dipole-dipole interactions in the case of
the pseudopure initial state. Simulations of the MQ NMR with the real molecular
structures such as six dipolar-coupled proton spins of a benzene, hydroxyl
proton chains in calcium hydroxyapatite and fluorine chains in calcium
fluorapatite open the way to experimental NMR testing of the obtained results.
It was found that multiple-spin correlations are created faster in such
experiments than in the usual MQ NMR experiments and can be used for the
investigation of many-spin dynamics of nuclear spins in solids
