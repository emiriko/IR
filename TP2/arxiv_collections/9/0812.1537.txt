The volume operator plays a pivotal role for the quantum dynamics of Loop
Quantum Gravity (LQG), both in the full theory and in truncated models adapted
to cosmological situations coined Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). It is therefore
crucial to check whether its semiclassical limit coincides with the classical
volume operator plus quantum corrections. In the present article we investigate
this question by generalizing and employing previously defined coherent states
for LQG which derive from a cylindrically consistently defined complexifier
operator which is the quantization of a known classical function. These
coherent states are not normalizable due to the non separability of the LQG
Hilbert space but they define uniquely define cut off states depending on a
finite graph. The result of our analysis is that the expectation value of the
volume operator with respect to coherent states depending on a graph with only
n valent verticies reproduces its classical value at the phase space point at
which the coherent state is peaked only if n = 6. In other words, the
semiclassical sector of LQG defined by those states is described by graphs with
cubic topology! This has some bearing on current spin foam models which are all
based on four valent boundary spin networks.
