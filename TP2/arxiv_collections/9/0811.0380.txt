Using the density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA), the structural and electronic properties of wurtzite AlN,
GaN, InN, and their related alloys, Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N and In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N,
were calculated. We have performed accurate {\it ab initio} total energy
calculations using the full--potential linearized augmented plane wave
(FP--LAPW) method to investigate the structural and electronic properties. In
both alloys we found that the fundamental parameters do not follow Vegard's
law. The lattice parameters, $a, c,$ and $u$, for the Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloy
are found to exhibit downward bowing, while for In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N there is an
upward bowing for the $a$ and $c$ parameters and a downward bowing for the
internal parameter, $u$. Furthermore, we found that for both alloys, the band
gap value does not follow Vegard's law. As a by--product of our electronic band
structure calculations, the effective masses of the binary compounds as well as
their related alloys were calculated. We show that the calculated properties
for the binary compounds, as well as for the studied alloys, show good
agreement with most of the previously reported results. Finally, using the
frozen phonon approach, the A$_1(TO)$ mode for the different systems studied in
this work was calculated. Our calculations show good agreement with
experimental values reported for the binary compounds. For the ternary alloys,
our calculations reproduce experimental values for Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N as well as
theoretical predictions for In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N.
