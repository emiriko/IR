We have developed two computer algebra systems, meditor [Jolly:2007] and JAS
[Kredel:2006]. These CAS systems are available as Java libraries. For the
use-case of interactively entering and manipulating mathematical expressions,
there is a need of a scripting front-end for our libraries. Most other CAS
invent and implement their own scripting interface for this purpose. We,
however, do not want to reinvent the wheel and propose to use a contemporary
scripting language with access to Java code. In this paper we discuss the
requirements for a scripting language in computer algebra and check whether the
languages Python, Ruby, Groovy and Scala meet these requirements. We conclude
that, with minor problems, any of these languages is suitable for our purpose.
