We construct an extension of the Kontsevich integral of knots to knotted
trivalent graphs, which commutes with orientation switches, edge deletions,
edge unzips, and connected sums. In 1997 Murakami and Ohtsuki [MO] first
constructed such an extension, building on Drinfel'd's theory of associators.
We construct a step by step definition, using elementary Kontsevich integral
methods, to get a one-parameter family of corrections that all yield invariants
well behaved under the graph operations above.
