We reexamine the constrained version of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model with semi universal parameters at the GUT scale (CNMSSM). We
include constraints from collider searches for Higgs and SUSY particles, upper
bound on the relic density of dark matter, measurements of the muon anomalous
magnetic moment and of B-physics observables as well as direct searches for
dark matter. We then study the prospects for direct detection of dark matter in
large scale detectors and comment on the prospects for discovery of heavy Higgs
states at the LHC.
