We report a comprehensive investigation of a model for peeling of an adhesive
tape along with a nonlinear time series analysis of experimental acoustic
emission signals in an effort to understand the origin of intermittent peeling
of an adhesive tape and its connection to acoustic emission. The model
represents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation
functional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of
the peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,
rugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,
the ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the
dissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations
are reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We
show that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force
function, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the
peel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a
fully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter
values suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.
To verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of
experimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction
velocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics
within a subinterval of pull speeds within the intermittent regime. Time series
analysis of the model acoustic energy signals is also found to be chaotic
within a subinterval of pull speeds.
