Self organizing anisotropic nematic liquid crystals (LCs) induce
self-assembly on quantum dots (QDs) to form one-dimensional chains along the
nematic director. Spatial ordering of QDs, achieved in the nematic LC matrix,
can be controlled in a preferred direction on application of electric fields,
gaining better self-assembly. Once the field goes off, the LC+QD system relaxes
back to the original state, revealing the intrinsic dynamics. Due to the
dielectric anisotropy of the system, this dynamic response can be captured by
studying dielectric relaxation. The studied dynamic response reveals insights
on the field-induced self-assembly mechanism and the stability of the LC+QD
system.
