We formulate the expectation value of the Bell-Zukowski operator acting on
qubit states of a two-particle Bell experiment. By using the equivalence
between a set of N copies of a two-qubit experiment and a standard two-setting
Bell experiment in an entangled 2N-particle state, we obtain an inequality,
which we may call the Bell-Zukowski inequality. It determines whether the
measured correlation functions of two-particle states can be modeled locally
and realistically. In this Bell experiment of two particles, the conflict
between local realism and quantum mechanics is discussed in conjunction with
the violation of the Bell-Zukowski inequality. The main point of the result is
that the Bell-Zukowski operator can be represented by the Bell-Mermin operator.
The threshold visibility of two-particle interference analyzed in this scheme
shows good agreement with the value to cause a violation of the Bell-Zukowski
inequality.
