The recent proposal (M Planat and M Kibler, Preprint 0807.3650 [quantph]) of
representing Clifford quantum gates in terms of unitary reflections is
revisited. In this essay, the geometry of a Clifford group G is expressed as a
BN-pair, i.e. a pair of subgroups B and N that generate G, is such that
intersection H = B \cap N is normal in G, the group W = N/H is a Coxeter group
and two extra axioms are satisfied by the double cosets acting on B. The
BN-pair used in this decomposition relies on the swap and match gates already
introduced for classically simulating quantum circuits (R Jozsa and A Miyake,
Preprint arXiv:0804.4050 [quant-ph]). The two- and three-qubit steps are
related to the configuration with 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface.
