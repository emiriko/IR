The transverse distribution of gluon and quark-antiquark pairs produced from
a strong constant chromo-electric field depends on two gauge invariant
quantities, $C_1=E^aE^a$ and $C_2=[d_{abc}E^aE^bE^c]^2$, as shown earlier in
[G.C. Nayak and P. van Nieuwenhuizen, Phys. Rev. D 71, 125001 (2005)] for
gluons and in [G.C. Nayak, Phys. Rev. D 72, 125010 (2005)] for quarks. Here, we
discuss the explicit dependence of the distribution on the second Casimir
invariant, C_2, and show the dependence is at most a 15% effect.
