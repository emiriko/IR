We examine five-dimensional $\mathcal N=2$ gauged supergravity including
terms up to four derivatives. These additional terms correspond to the
supersymmetric completion of $R^2$, and were originally obtained in
hep-th/0611329 using conformal supergravity techniques. Here we integrate out
the auxiliary fields and obtain the on-shell action for minimal supergravity
with such corrections. We then construct $R$-charged AdS black holes to linear
order in the four derivative terms and investigate the effect of these
corrections on their thermodynamical properties. Finally, we relate the
geometrical coefficients governing the four-derivative corrections to gauge
theory data using holographic anomaly matching. This enables us to obtain a
microscopic expression for the entropy of the solutions.
