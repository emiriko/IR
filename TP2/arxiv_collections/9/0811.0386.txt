Measurements of macroscopic properties have indicated that the
bond-disordered spin-gap system (CH3)2CHNH3-Cu(ClxBr1-x)3 is gapless when x is
between 0.44 and 0.87. Using muon spin relaxation to investigate microscopic
properties of sample with x=0.35, we observed a dynamical spin fluctuation,
whose characteristic frequency decreases with decreasing temperature,
indicating a magnetic ground state.
