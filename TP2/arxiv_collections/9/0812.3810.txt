The local and manifestly covariant Lagrangian interactions in four spacetime
dimensions that can be added to a free model that describes a massless
Rarita-Schwinger theory and an Abelian BF theory are constructed by means of
deforming the solution to the master equation on behalf of specific
cohomological techniques.
