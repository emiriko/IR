A novel, non-invasive method of measuring the beam energy at the
International Linear Collider is proposed. Laser light collides head-on with
beam particles and either the energy of the Compton scattered electrons near
the kinematic end-point is measured or the positions of the Compton
backscattered $\gamma$-rays, the edge electrons and the unscattered beam
particles are recorded. A compact layout for the Compton spectrometer is
suggested. It consists of a bending magnet and position sensitive detectors
operating in a large radiation environment. Several options for high spatial
resolution detectors are discussed. Simulation studies support the use of an
infrared or green laser and quartz fiber detectors to monitor the backscattered
photons and edge electrons. Employing a cavity monitor, the beam particle
position downstream of the magnet can be recorded with submicrometer precision.
Such a scheme provides a feasible and promising method to access the incident
beam energy with precisions of $10^{-4}$ or better on a bunch-to-bunch basis
while the electron and positron beams are in collision.
