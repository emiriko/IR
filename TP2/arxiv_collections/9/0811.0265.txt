A large variety of problems in statistical physics use a Gaussian
distribution as a starting point. For the problem of intermittency in fluid
turbulence, the Gaussian approximation is not a useful beginning. We find that
the Cramer's rate function in the theory of large deviations as used in a
simple coin toss is a promising starting point for giving an account of
intermittency. In addition, it offers another view of Jarzynski equality.
