We present selected results from a calculation of meson and nucleon
observables in a Green-function approach. A rainbow-ladder truncation of QCD's
Dyson-Schwinger equations is used to solve the respective meson, diquark and
quark-diquark Bethe-Salpeter equations. It allows for a simultaneous
description of meson and nucleon masses and electromagnetic properties from an
effective quark-gluon interaction. The results describe a hadronic quark core
which agrees with lattice data for heavy quarks whereas pion-cloud effects are
missing towards the chiral limit. The neutron's Dirac form factor is negative
due to the presence of axial-vector diquark correlations.
