We study coherent and incoherent diffractive hadron production in high energy
quarkonium--heavy nucleus collisions as a probe of the gluon saturation regime
of QCD. Taking this process as a model for pA collisions, we argue that the
coherent diffractive gluon production, in which the target nucleus states
intact, exhibits a remarkable sensitivity to the energy, rapidity and atomic
number dependence. The incoherent diffractive gluon production is less
sensitive to the details of the low-x dynamics but can serve as a probe of
fluctuations in the color glass condensate. As a quantitative measure of the
nuclear effects on diffractive hadron production we introduce a new observable
-- the diffractive nuclear modification factor. We discuss possible signatures
of gluon saturation in diffractive gluon production at RHIC, LHC and EIC.
