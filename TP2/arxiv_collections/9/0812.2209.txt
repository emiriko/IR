The Casimir force is calculated between Au thin films that are described by a
Drude model with a frequency dependent damping function. The model parameters
are obtained from available experimental data for Au thin films. Two cases are
considered; annealed and nonannealed films that have a different damping
function. Compared with the calculations using a Drude model with a constant
damping parameter, we observe changes in the Casimir force of a few percent.
This behavior is only observed in films of no more than 300 $\AA$ thick.
