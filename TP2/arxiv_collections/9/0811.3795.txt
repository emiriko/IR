By rotating two-component fermionic atom gases in uniform magnetic field, a
similar physical situation with de Haas-van Alphen effect is constructed. We
calculate magnetic moment of the system and find that owing to an existence of
effective magnetic field coming from the rotation, the magnetic moment also
shows the oscillatory behavior about magnetic field, but it is completely
different from the famous oscillation of de Haas-van Alphen effect. This
distinction is due to that in the atomic gases the orbital motion of atom only
couples to rotation and does not contribute to magnetic moment in the light of
atomic charge neutrality.
