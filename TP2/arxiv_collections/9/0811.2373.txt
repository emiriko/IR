Asymmetry of the velocity distributions of projectile like fragments produced
in heavy-ion collisions is discussed. The calculations made in transport model
approach (the solution of Vlasov kinetic equation with the collisions term) are
compared with experimental data for the reactions $^{22}Ne$ ($40 A\cdot$MeV) +
$^{9}$Be and $^{18}$O ($35 A\cdot$MeV) + $^9$Be ($^{181}$Ta) at forward angles.
It is found that the velocity distributions appear to be composed of two
contributions: a direct component centered at beam velocity and a dissipative
component at lower energies, leading to an asymmetry of the velocity
distributions. The direct component is interpreted empirically in the Goldhaber
model, and the widths and centroids of the distributions are extracted. The
remaining dissipative (also called deep-inelastic) contributions are then well
described by the transport calculations. It is shown that the ratio of yields
of direct and dissipative contributions, which determines the asymmetry of
velocity distribution, depends on the shape of the deflection function.
