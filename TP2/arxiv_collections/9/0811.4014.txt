A simple scheme capable of treating transport in molecular junctions in the
language of many-body states is presented. An ansatz in Liouville space similar
to generalized Kadanoff-Baym approximation is introduced in order to reduce
exact equation-of-motion for Hubbard operator to quantum master equation
(QME)-like expression. A dressing with effective Liouville space propagation
similar to standard diagrammatic dressing approach is proposed. The scheme is
compared to standard QME approach, and its applicability to transport
calculations is discussed within numerical examples.
