We examine ground state correlations for repulsive, quasi one-dimensional
bosons in a harmonic trap. In particular, we focus on the few particle limit
N=2,3,4,..., where exact numerical solutions of the many particle Schroedinger
equation are available employing the Multi-Configuration Time-dependent Hartree
method. Our numerical results for the inhomogeneous system are modeled with the
analytical solution of the homogeneous problem using the Bethe ansatz and the
local density approximation. Tuning the interaction strength from the weakly
correlated Gross-Pitaevskii- to the strongly correlated Tonks-Girardeau regime
reveals finite particle number effects in the second order correlation function
beyond the local density approximation.
