We study the leading electroweak corrections in the precision measurement of
the strange form factors. Specifically, we calculate the two-boson-exchange
(TBE), two-photon-exchange (TPE) plus $\gamma Z$-exchange ($\gamma Z$E),
corrections with $\Delta(1232)$ excitation to the parity-violating asymmetry of
the elastic electron-proton scattering. The interplay between nucleon and
$\Delta$ contributions is found to depend strongly on the kinematics, as
$\delta_\Delta$ begins as negligible at backward angles but becomes very large
and negative and dominant at forward angles, while $\delta_N$ always stays
positive and decreases monotonically with increasing $\epsilon$. The total TBE
corrections to the extracted values of $G^{s}_{E}+\beta G^{s}_{M}$ in recent
experiments of HAPPEX and G0 are, depending on kinematics, found to be large
and range between 13% to -75% but small in the case of A4 experiments.
