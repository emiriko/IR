An oscillating universe model is discussed, in which the singularity of the
initial state of the universe is avoided by postulating an upper limit on
spacetime curvature. This also results in the devising of the simplest possible
structure - a primitive particle (usually called preon), which can be
considered as the basic constituent of matter that have no properties except
for the property of carrying a unit chromoelectric charge. The
SU(3)xU(1)-symmetry of its field results in the emergence of a unique set of
structures reproducing exactly the observed variety of the fundamental fermions
and gauge bosons. The discussed scheme allows finding answers to many
fundamental questions of the standard particle physics and cosmology based on a
very few primary constituents.
