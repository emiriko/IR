We study photon bunching phenomena associated with biexciton-exciton cascade
in single GaAs self-assembled quantum dots. Experiments carried out with a
pulsed excitation source show that significant bunching is only detectable at
very low excitation, where the typical intensity of photon streams is less than
the half of their saturation value. Our findings are qualitatively understood
with a model which accounts for Poissonian statistics in the number of
excitons, predicting the height of a bunching peak being determined by the
inverse of probability of finding more than one exciton.
