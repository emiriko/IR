The Liquid Drop Models (LDM) and the Independent Particle Models (IPM) have
been known to provide two conflicting pictures of the nucleus. The IPM being
quantum mechanical, is believed to provide a fundamental picture of the nucleus
and hence has been focus of the still elusive unified theory of the nucleus. It
is believed that the LDM at best is an effective and limited model of the
nucleus. Here, through a comprehensive study of one nucleon separation energy,
we give convincing evidence that actually the LDM is as fundamental and as
basic for the description of the nucleus as the IPM is. As such the LDM and the
IPM provide simultaneously co-exiting complementary duality of the nuclear
phenomena. This fundamental duality also provides solution to the decades old
Coester Band problem in the nucleus. Similarity and differences with respect to
the well known wave-particle duality, as envisaged in Bohr's Complementarity
Principle, is pointed out. Thereafter implications of this new Duality in the
nucleus for quantum mechanics is discussed.
