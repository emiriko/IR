In the context of a warped extra-dimension with Standard Model fields in the
bulk, we obtain the general flavor structure of the Radion couplings to
fermions and show that the result is independent on the particular nature of
the Higgs mechanism (bulk or brane localized). These couplings will be
generically misaligned with respect to the fermion mass matrix when the fermion
bulk mass parameters are not all degenerate. When the Radion is light enough,
the generic size of these tree-level flavor changing couplings will be strongly
constrained by the experimental bounds on $\Delta F=2$ processes. At the LHC
the possibility of a heavier Radion decaying into top and charm quarks is then
considered as a promising signal to probe the flavor structure of both the
Radion sector and the whole scenario.
