The electron and muon number violating muonium-antimuonium oscillation
process in an extended Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is investigated.
The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is modified by the inclusion of three
right-handed neutrino superfields. While the model allows the neutrino mass
terms to mix among the different generations, the sneutrino and slepton mass
terms have only intra-generation lepton number violation but not
inter-generation lepton number mixing. So doing, the muonium-antimuonium
conversion can then be used to constrain those model parameters which avoid
further constraint from the $\mu\to e\gamma$ decay bounds. For a wide range of
parameter values, the contributions to the muonium-antimuonium oscillation time
scale are at least two orders of magnitude below the sensivity of current
experiments. However, if the ratio of the two Higgs field VEVs, $\tan\beta$, is
very small, there is a limited possibility that the contributions are large
enough for the present experimental limit to provide an inequality relating
$\tan\beta$ with the light neutrino mass scale $m_\nu$ which is generated by
see-saw mechanism. The resultant lower bound on $\tan\beta$ as a function of
$m_\nu$ is more stringent than the analogous bounds arising from the muon and
electron anomalous magnetic moments as computed using this model.
