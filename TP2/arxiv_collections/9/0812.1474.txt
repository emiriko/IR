We investigate the uncertainty associated with a joint quantum measurement of
two components of spin of a spin-1/2 particle and quantify this in terms of
entropy. We consider two entropic quantities: the joint entropy and the sum of
the marginal entropies, and obtain lower bounds for each of these quantities.
For the case of joint measurements where we measure each spin observable
equally well, these lower bounds are tight.
