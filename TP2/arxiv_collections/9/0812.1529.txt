Various measurements of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets decay channel
of top quark pair production are presented. The measurements are performed on
data samples of up to 2.7 fb-1 of integrated luminosity acquired by the CDF and
D0 experiments in Run-II of the Tevatron proton-anti-proton collider at a
center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. The new Tevatron combination using
up to 2.8 fb-1 of data results in a preliminary world average mass of the top
quark of m_top = 172.4 +- 1.2 GeV. This corresponds to a relative precision of
0.7%.
