Very soon the LHC will provide beams for heavy ion collisions at 5.52
TeV/nucleon. This center-of-mass energy results in a large cross-section for
producing high-$E_T$ ($>$ 50 GeV) jets that are distinct from the soft,
underlying event. This brings with it the possibility of performing full jet
reconstruction to directly study jet energy loss in the medium produced in
heavy ion collisions. In this note, we present the current state of jet
reconstruction performance studies in heavy ion events using the ATLAS
detector. We also discuss the possibilities of energy loss measurements
available with full jet reconstruction: single jet $R_{AA}$ and di-jet and
$\gamma$-jet correlations.
