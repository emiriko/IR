Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high
energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial
resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying
short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI)
collaboration is developing Column-Parallel CCDs (CPCCDs) for the vertex
detector of a future Linear Collider. The CPCCDs can be read out many times
faster than standard CCDs, significantly increasing their operating speed. A
test stand for measuring the charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of a prototype
CPCCD has been set up. Studies of the CTI have been performed at a range of
readout frequencies and operating temperatures.
