The objective of this paper is all-angle artificial magnetic conductor, i.e.
artificial magnetic conductor that has stable magnetic-wall effect with respect
to the incidence angle. Furthermore, we seek for a design that would be easy
for manufacturing. In order to achieve this we use grounded uniaxial material
slabs and we do not constrict ourselves to naturally available materials.
Instead, we assume that the desired parameters can be synthesized using the
emerging artificial electromagnetic materials. It is found that it is possible
to have an all-angle magnetic-wall effect for both TE and TM polarization.
Especially for the TM fields the structure would be easily manufacturable. The
proposed structure has similar appearance as more well-known artificial
impedance surfaces, but the design parameters and the physical properties
behind the magnetic wall effect are novel. The performance of the proposed
artificial magnetic conductor is verified with numerical simulations. This
paper introduces a new approach how to obtain a magnetic-wall effect. It is
possible to use this this approach also together with other ways of obtaining
the magnetic-wall effect for dual-band operation.
