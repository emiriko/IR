This paper presents the design and test results of a prototype monolithic
pixel sensor manufactured in deep-submicron fully-depleted Silicon-On-Insulator
(SOI) CMOS technology. In the SOI technology, a thin layer of integrated
electronics is insulated from a (high-resistivity) silicon substrate by a
buried oxide. Vias etched through the oxide allow to contact the substrate from
the electronics layer, so that pixel implants can be created and a reverse bias
can be applied. The prototype chip, manufactured in OKI 0.15 micron SOI
process, features both analog and digital pixels on a 10 micron pitch. Results
of tests performed with infrared laser and 1.35 GeV electrons and a first
assessment of the effect of ionising and non-ionising doses are discussed.
