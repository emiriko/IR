We introduce the concept of Conversion/Preference Games, or CP games for
short. CP games generalize the standard notion of strategic games. First we
exemplify the use of CP games. Second we formally introduce and define the
CP-games formalism. Then we sketch two `real-life' applications, namely a
connection between CP games and gene regulation networks, and the use of CP
games to formalize implied information in Chinese Wall security. We end with a
study of a particular fixed-point construction over CP games and of the
resulting existence of equilibria in possibly infinite games.
