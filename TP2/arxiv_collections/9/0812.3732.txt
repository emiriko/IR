We observe charge-order fluctuations in the quasi-two-dimensional organic
superconductor $\beta^{\prime\prime}$-(BEDT-TTF)2 SF5 CH2 CF2 SO3 both by means
of vibrational spectroscopy, locally probing the fluctuating charge order, and
investigating the in-plane dynamical response by infrared reflectance
spectroscopy. The decrease of effective electronic interaction in an
isostructural metal suppresses both charge-order fluctuations and
superconductivity, pointing on their interplay. We compare the results of our
experiments with calculations on the extended Hubbard model.
