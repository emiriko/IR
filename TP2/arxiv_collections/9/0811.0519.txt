We discuss continuity of the twisted convolution on (weighted) Fourier
modulation spaces. We use these results to establish continuity results for the
twisted convolution on Lebesgue spaces. For example we prove that if $\omega$
is an appropriate weight and $1\le p\le 2$, then $L^p_{(\omega)}$ is an algebra
under the twisted convolution.
