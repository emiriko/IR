Using numerical renormalization group we study thermodynamic properties of a
magnetic impurity described by the Anderson impurity model in a superconducting
host material described by the BCS Hamiltonian. When the Kondo temperature in
the normal state, T_K, is comparable to the critical temperature of the
superconducting transition, T_c, the magnetic doublet state may become
degenerate with the Kondo singlet state, leading to a ln3 peak in the
temperature dependence of the impurity contribution to the entropy. This
entropy increase translates into an anomalous feature in the heat capacity
which might have already been experimentally observed.
