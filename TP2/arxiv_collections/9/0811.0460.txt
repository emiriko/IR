The substrate lattice structure may have a considerable influence on the
formation of quantum well states in a metal overlayer material. Here we study
three model systems using angle resolved photoemission and low energy electron
diffraction: indium films on Si(111) and indium and lead on Si(100). Data are
compared with theoretical predictions based on density functional theory. We
find that the interaction between the substrate and the overlayer strongly
influences the formation of quantum well states; indium layers only exhibit
well defined quantum well states when the layer relaxes from an initial
face-centered cubic to the bulk body-centered tetragonal lattice structure. For
Pb layers on Si(100) a change in growth orientation inhibits the formations of
quantum well states in films thicker than 2 ML.
