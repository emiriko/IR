Using micro fabrication techniques, we extracted individual channels of
3-Kelvin (3-K) phase superconductivity in Sr2RuO4-Ru eutectic systems and
confirmed odd-parity superconductivity in the 3-K phase, similar to pure
Sr2RuO4. Unusual hysteresis in the differential resistance-current and
voltage-current characteristics observed below 2 K indicates the internal
degrees of freedom of the superconducting state. A possible origin of the
hysteresis is current-induced chiral-domain-wall motion due to the chiral
p-wave state.
