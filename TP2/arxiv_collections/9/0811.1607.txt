A $k$-free like group is a $k$-generated group $G$ with a sequence of
$k$-element generating sets $Z_n$ such that the girth of $G$ relative to $Z_n$
is unbounded and the Cheeger constant of $G$ relative to $Z_n$ is bounded away
from 0. By a recent result of Benjamini-Nachmias-Peres, this implies that the
critical bond percolation probability of the Cayley graph of $G$ relative to
$Z_n$ tends to $1/(2k-1)$ as $n\to \infty$. Answering a question of Benjamini,
we construct many non-free groups that are $k$-free like for all sufficiently
large $k$.
