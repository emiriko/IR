In an informal way, a number of thoughts on the financial crisis 2008 are
presented from a physicist's viewpoint, considering the problem as a
nonergodicity transition of a spin-glass type of system. Some tentative
suggestions concerning the way out of the crisis are also discussed, concerning
Keynesian "deficit spending" methods, tax reductions, and finally the method
"ruin and recreate" known from optimization theory. Also the de
Almeida-Thouless instability line of spin-glass theory is given a financial
interpretation.
