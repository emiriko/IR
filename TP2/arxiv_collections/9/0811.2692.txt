Separating the mixture of the $ K_{1}(1270)$ and $K_{1}(1400) $ states, the
$B\to K_{1}(1270, 1400)\nu\bar{\nu}$ transition form factors are calculated in
the three-point QCD sum rules approach. The longitudinal, transverse and total
decay widths as well as the asymmetry parameter, characterizing the
polarization of the axial $K_{1}(1270, 1400)$ and the branching ratio for these
decays are evaluated.
