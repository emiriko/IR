We construct new monomorphisms between mapping class groups of surfaces. The
first family of examples injects the mapping class group of a closed surface
into that of a different closed surface. The second family of examples are
defined on mapping class groups of once-punctured surfaces and have quite
curious behaviour. For instance, some pseudo-Anosov elements are mapped to
multi-twists. Neither of these two types of phenomena were previously known to
be possible although the constructions are elementary.
