The issues, raised in arXiv:0809.011, concerning the relevance of the von
Neumann theorem for the single-system's quantumness test proposed in
arXiv:0704.1962 and performed for the case of single photon polarization in
arXiv:0804.1646, and the usefulness of Bell's inequality for testing the idea
of macroscopic quantum systems are discussed in some details. Finally, the
proper quantum mechanical description of the experiment with polarized photon
beams is presented.
