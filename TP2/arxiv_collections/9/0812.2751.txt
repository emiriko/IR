The aim of this paper is to initiate a study of the jet bundles on the
grassmannian $X$ over a field of characteristic zero using higher direct images
of $G$-linearized sheaves, Lie theoretic methods, enveloping algebra theoretic
methods and generalized Verma modules. We calculate the $P$-module of the dual
jet bundle $J^l(L)^*$ and prove it equals the $l$'th piece of the canonical
filtration for $H^0(X,L)^*$. We use the results obtained to prove the
discriminant of any linear system on any grassmannian is irreducible.
