The present paper deals with the study of spectral properties of the helical
mode of uniform isotropic turbulence in the presence and in the absence of mean
helicity. It is shown that even in the absence of mean helicity, the helicity
of individual helical modes affects the spectral behavior of turbulence.
Besides, it is shown that both in the presence and in the absence of mean
helicity, intermediate characteristic scales connected with the presence of
helicity in helical modes should exist. The existence of these scales makes it
possible to solve the problem of helicity dissipation divergence for individual
helical modes.
