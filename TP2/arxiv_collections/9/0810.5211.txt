On the basis of exact numerical simulations and analytical calculations, we
describe qualitatively and quantitatively the interference processes at the
origin of the photonic Hall effect for resonant Rayleigh (point-dipole)
scatterers in a magnetic field. For resonant incoming light, the induced giant
magneto-optical effects result in relative Hall currents in the percent range,
three orders of magnitude larger than with classical scatterers. This suggests
that the observation of the photonic Hall effect in cold atomic vapors is
within experimental reach.
