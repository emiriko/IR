For the positive solutions of the competitive Gross-Pitaevskii system of two
equations, we prove that L^\infty boundedness implies uniform H\"older
boundedness as the competition parameter goes to infinity. Moreover we prove
that the limiting profile is Lipschitz continuous. The proof relies upon the
blow-up technique and the monotonicity formulae by Almgren and
Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman. This system arises in the Hartree-Fock approximation
theory for binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates in different hyperfine
states. Extensions to systems with more than two densities are given.
