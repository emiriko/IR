Parton distribution functions (pdfs) are an important ingredient for LHC
phenomenology. Recent progress in determining pdfs from global analyses is
reviewed, and some of the most important outstanding issues are highlighted.
Particular attention is paid to the precision with which predictions for LHC
`standard-candle' cross sections can be made, and also to new information that
LHC can provide on pdfs.
