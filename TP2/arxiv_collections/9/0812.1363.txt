Motivated by structured parasite populations in aquaculture we consider a
class of size-structured population models, where individuals may be recruited
into the population with distributed states at birth. The mathematical model
which describes the evolution of such a population is a first-order nonlinear
partial integro-differential equation of hyperbolic type. First, we use
positive perturbation arguments and utilise results from the spectral theory of
semigroups to establish conditions for the existence of a positive equilibrium
solution of our model. Then, we formulate conditions that guarantee that the
linearised system is governed by a positive quasicontraction semigroup on the
biologically relevant state space. We also show that the governing linear
semigroup is eventually compact, hence growth properties of the semigroup are
determined by the spectrum of its generator. In the case of a separable
fertility function, we deduce a characteristic equation, and investigate the
stability of equilibrium solutions in the general case using positive
perturbation arguments.
