A many-flavor electron gas (MFEG) in a semiconductor with a valley degeneracy
ranging between 6 and 24 was analyzed using diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
calculations. The DMC results compare well with an analytic expression derived
by one of us [Phys. Rev. B 78, 035111 (2008)] for the total energy to within 1%
over an order of magnitude range of density, which increases with valley
degeneracy. For Bi2Te3 (six-fold valley degeneracy) the applicable charge
carrier densities are between 7*10^19cm^{-3} and 2*10^20cm^{-3}. DMC
calculations distinguished between an exact and a useful approximate expression
for the 24-fold degenerate MFEG polarizability for wave numbers 2p_F<q<7p_F.
The analytical result for the MFEG is generalized to inhomogeneous systems by
means of a gradient correction, the validity range of this approach is
obtained. Employed within a density functional theory calculation this
approximation compares well with DMC results for a quantum dot.
