Within a theoretical framework that accounts for all open-charm mesons,
including the $D_0^*(2308)$, the $D_{sJ}^*(2317)$ and the $D_{sJ}(2460)$, we
analyze the structure and explore possible quantum number assignments for the
$D_{sJ}(2860)$ and the $D_{sJ}(2700)$ mesons reported by BABAR and Belle
Collaborations. The open-charm sector is properly described if considered as a
combination of conventional quark-antiquark states and four--quark components.
All negative parity and $2^+$ states can be understood in terms only of $q\bar
q$ components, however the description of the $0^+$ and $1^+$ mesons is
improved whenever the mixing between two-- and four--quarks configurations is
included. We analyze all possible quantum number assignments for the
$D_{sJ}(2860)$ in terms of both $c\bar s$ and $cn\bar s\bar n$ configurations.
We discuss the role played by the electromagnetic and strong decay widths as
basic tools to distinguish among them. The broad structure reported by BABAR
near 2.7 GeV is also analyzed.
