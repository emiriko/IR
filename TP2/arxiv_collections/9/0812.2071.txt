Charge carrier injection performed in Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (PCMO) hetero-structure
junctions exhibits stable without electric fields and dramatic changes in both
resistances and interface barriers, which are entirely different from behaviors
of semiconductor devices. Disappearance and reversion of interface barriers
suggest that the adjustable resistance switching of such hetero-structure oxide
devices should associate with motion of charge carriers across interfaces. The
results suggested that injected carriers should be still staying in devices and
resulted in changes in properties, which guided to a carrier self-trapping and
releasing picture in strongly correlated electronic framework. Observations in
PCMO and oxygen deficient CeO2 devices show that oxides as functional materials
could be used in microelectronics with some novel properties, in which
interface is very important.
