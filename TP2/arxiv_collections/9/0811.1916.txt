The Hamiltonian formulation of the Holst action is reviewed and it is
provided a solution of second-class constraints corresponding to a generic
local Lorentz frame. Within this scheme the form of rotation constraints can be
reduced to a Gauss-like one by a proper generalization of
Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connections. This result emphasizes that the Loop
Quantum Gravity quantization procedure can be applied when the time-gauge
condition does not stand.
