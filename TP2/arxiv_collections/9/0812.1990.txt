We calculate the Casimir interaction between two short range scatterers
embedded in a background of one dimensional massless Dirac fermions using a
force operator approach. We obtain the force between two finite width square
barriers, and take the limit of zero width and infinite potential strength to
study the Casimir force mediated by the fermions. For the case of identical
scatterers we recover the conventional attractive one dimensional Casimir
force. For the general problem with inequivalent scatterers we find that the
magnitude and sign of this force depend on the relative spinor polarizations of
the two scattering potentials which can be tuned to give an attractive, a
repulsive, or a compensated null Casimir interaction.
