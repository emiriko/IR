Here we demonstrate that MnTe epitaxial films with zinc-blend structure and
MnTe/ZnTe multilayers should show ferroelectric polarization in
antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered state and thus belong to multiferroics.
Spontaneous ferroelectric polarization results from the bending of highly ionic
Mn-Te-Mn bonds induced by magnetostrictive shear strain. Orientation of
ferroelectric polarization is coupled with orientation of AFM vector and thus
can be controlled by application of the external magnetic field. Due to the
clamping of electric and magnetic order parameters, domain structure in MnTe is
governed by two mechanisms: depolarizing field produced by electric dipoles and
destressing field produced by magnetoelastic dipoles. The values of
monodomainization electric and magnetic fields depend upon the sample shape and
diminish with the film thickness. Magnetoelectric nature of the domains make it
possible to visualize the domain structure by linear and nonlinear optical
methods (Kerr effect, second harmonic generation technique).
