The problem of information extraction from discrete stochastic time series,
produced with some finite sampling frequency, using flicker-noise spectroscopy,
a general framework for information extraction based on the analysis of the
correlation links between signal irregularities and formulated for continuous
signals, is discussed. It is shown that the mathematical notions of Dirac and
Heaviside functions used in the analysis of continuous signals may be
interpreted as high-frequency and low-frequency stochastic components,
respectively, in the case of discrete series. The analysis of
electroencephalogram measurements for a teenager with schizophrenic symptoms at
two different sampling frequencies demonstrates that the "power spectrum" and
difference moment contain different information in the case of discrete
signals, which was formally proven for continuous signals. The sampling
interval itself is suggested as an additional parameter that should be included
in general parameterization procedures for real signals.
