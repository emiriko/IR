We propose a superlens formed by an ultra-dense array of crossed metallic
wires. It is demonstrated that due to the anomalous interaction between crossed
wires, the structured substrate is characterized by an anomalously high index
of refraction and supports strongly confined guided modes with very short
propagation wavelengths. It is theoretically proven that a planar slab of such
structured material makes a superlens that may compensate for the attenuation
introduced by free-space propagation and restore the subwavelength details of
the source. The bandwidth of the proposed device can be quite significant since
the response of the structured substrate is non-resonant. The theoretical
results are fully supported by numerical simulations.
