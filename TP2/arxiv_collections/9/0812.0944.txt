This survey article is about algebraic dynamics. It is mainly concerned by
the arithmetic equidistribution theorems featured by dynamical systems. The
contents are: - heights - algebraic dynamics, conjectures - equidistribution
theorem on the projective line (after Bilu and Baker). It was written for the
sesion 2006 of \'Etats de la recherche, Syst\`emes dynamiques polynomiaux.
