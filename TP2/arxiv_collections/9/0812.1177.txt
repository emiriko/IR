We compute the O(g^2) contribution to the thermodynamic pressure for Wilson
fermions in the standard, the twisted mass, and clover improved formulation in
lattice perturbation theory, including finite mass effects. We compare the
continuum approaches of these discretizations for the massive ideal and
interacting gas. In all cases, for N_t \geq 8 cutoff effects of Wilson type
fermions are comparable to those of staggered fermions, but asymptotic scaling
requires $N_\tau>10$.
