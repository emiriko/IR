Starting from the idea of Tsallis on non-extensive statistical mechanics and
the {\it q-entropy} notion, we recall the Theil index $Th$ and transform it
into the $Th_q$ index. Both indices can be used to map onto themselves any time
series in a non linear way. We develop an application of the $Th_q$ to the GDP
evolution of 20 rich countries in the time interval [1950 - 2003] and search
for a proof of globalization of their economies. First we calculate the
distances between the "new" time series and to their mean, from which such data
simple networks are constructed. We emphasize that it is useful to, and we do,
take into account different time "parameters": (i) the moving average time
window for the raw time series to calculate the $Th_q$ index; (ii) the moving
average time window for calculating the time series distances; (iii) a
correlation time lag. This allows us to deduce optimal conditions to measure
the features of the network, i.e. the appearance in 1970 of a globalization
process in the economy of such countries and the present beginning of
deviations. The $q$ value hereby used is that which measures the overall data
distribution and is equal to 1.8125.
