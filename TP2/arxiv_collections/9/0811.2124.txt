Labor productivity in developed countries is analyzed and modeled. Modeling
is based on our previous finding that the rate of labor force participation is
a unique function of GDP per capita. Therefore, labor productivity is fully
determined by the rate of economic growth, and thus, is a secondary economic
variable. Initially, we assess a model for the U.S. and then test it using data
for Japan, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada. Results obtained for these
countries validate those for the U.S. The evolution of labor force productivity
is predictable at least at an 11-year horizon
