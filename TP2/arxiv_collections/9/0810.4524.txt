As a means to better understanding manifolds with positive curvature, there
has been much recent interest in the study of non-negatively curved manifolds
which contain points at which all 2-planes have positive curvature. We show
that there are generalisations of the well-known Eschenburg spaces and
quotients of $\sph^7 \x \sph^7$ which admit metrics with this property.
