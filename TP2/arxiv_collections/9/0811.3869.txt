An infinite family of new exact solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations
for static and axially symmetric spacetimes is presented. All the metric
functions of the solutions are explicitly computed and the obtained expressions
are simply written in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates. Furthermore, the
solutions are asymptotically flat and regular everywhere, as it is shown by
computing all the curvature scalars. These solutions describe an infinite
family of thin dust disks with a central inner edge, whose energy densities are
everywhere positive and well behaved, in such a way that their energy-momentum
tensor are in fully agreement with all the energy conditions. Now, although the
disks are of infinite extension, all of them have finite mass. The
superposition of the first member of this family with a Schwarzschild black
hole was presented previously [G. A. Gonz\'alez and A. C.
Guti\'errez-Pi\~neres, arXiv: 0811.3002v1 (2008)], whereas that in a subsequent
paper a detailed analysis of the corresponding superposition for the full
family will be presented.
