We present results of the search for the super-symmetric partner of the top
quark, the stop quark, decaying to a b-quark and chargino with the subsequent
chargino decay into a neutralino, lepton and neutrino. Using the data sample
corresponding to 2.7 inv fb of integrated luminosity, collected with the CDF
Detector of the Tevatron collider, we reconstruct the stop mass of candidate
events and set 95% C. L. upper limits on masses of the stop quark, chargino and
neutralino and the branching ratio of chargino to neutralino+lepton+neutrino.
