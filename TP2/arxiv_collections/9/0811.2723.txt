We develop a description of diffusion limited growth in solid-solid
transformations, which are strongly influenced by elastic effects. Density
differences and structural transformations provoke stresses at interfaces,
which affect the phase equilibrium conditions. We formulate equations for the
interface kinetics similar to dendritic growth and study the growth of a stable
phase from a metastable solid in both a channel geometry and in free space. We
perform sharp interface calculations based on Green's function methods and
phase field simulations, supplemented by analytical investigations. For pure
dilatational transformations we find a single growing finger with symmetry
breaking at higher driving forces, whereas for shear transformations the
emergence of twin structures can be favorable. We predict the steady state
shapes and propagation velocities, which can be higher than in conventional
dendritic growth.
