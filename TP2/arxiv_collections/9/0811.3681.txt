The character Mr. Palomar, the alter-ego of the Italian author Italo Calvino,
appeared for the first time in 1975 on the pages of the "Il Corriere della
Sera", and then more or less regularly till its debut as a book in 1983.
Through illuminating thoughts and reflections based on observations, for
instance, of sea waves, Mr. Palomar discovers that they induce a peaceful and
inspirational state of mind that prevents coronary and mental illnesses, and
also holds the key to capturing the complexity of the world reducing it into
its most elementary mechanisms. In this contribution I will survey some of Mr.
Palomar's thoughts while he observes the sky and speculate on others that he
might have explored if he shared our contemporary knowledge of the cosmos. I
will also discuss the thoughts of other authors on how, cosmological thinking
affects the human condition.
