First-principles quasi-harmonic calculations play a very important role in
mineral physics because they can accurately predict the structure and
thermodynamic properties of materials at pressure and temperature conditions
that are still challenging for experiments. It also enables calculations of
thermoelastic properties by obtaining the second-order derivatives of the free
energies with respect to strain. However, these are exceedingly demanding
computations requiring thousands of large jobs running on 101 processors each.
Here we introduce a simpler approach that requires only calculations of static
elastic constants and phonon density of states for unstrained configurations.
This approach decreases the computational time by more than one order of
magnitude. We show results on MgO and forsterite that are in very good
agreement with previous first-principles results and experimental data.
