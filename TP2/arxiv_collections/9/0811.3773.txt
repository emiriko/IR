In the framework of the local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model the radiative decay
widths of the scalar mesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ into $\rho\gamma$ and
$\omega \gamma$ are calculated. The contributions of the quark loops and the
meson loops are taken into account. For the radiative decays of the scalar
meson $f_0(980)$ the contribution of the meson loops plays the dominant role.
On the other side for the radiative decays of the scalar meson $a_0(980)$ the
main contribution is given by the quark loops.
