The paper presents sufficient conditions of predictability for continuous
time processes in deterministic setting. We found that processes with
exponential decay on energy for higher frequencies are predictable in some weak
sense on some finite time horizon defined by the rate of decay. Moreover, this
predictability can be achieved uniformly over classes of processes. Some
explicit formulas for predictors are suggested.
