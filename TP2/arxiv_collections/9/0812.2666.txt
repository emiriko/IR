Meson correlation functions are studied in the model with four-fermion
interaction Lagrangian. We demonstrate that despite the singular character of
system mean energy and corresponding quark condensate found out the meson
observables are finite, quite well identified and compatible with experimental
energy scale. It allows one to use the similar model Hamiltonians for
describing the nonequilibrium features of quark/hadron systems which reveal
themselves in studying ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The analytical
results for meson correlation functions in the Keldysh model are given.
