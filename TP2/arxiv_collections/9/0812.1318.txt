Aiming at a complete classification of unitary N=2 minimal models (where the
assumption of space-time supersymmetry has been dropped), it is shown that each
modular invariant candidate of a partition function for such a theory is indeed
the partition function of a minimal model. A family of models constructed via
orbifoldings of either the diagonal model or of the space-time supersymmetric
exceptional models demonstrates that there exists a unitary N=2 minimal model
for every one of the allowed partition functions in the list obtained from
Gannon's work.
  Kreuzer and Schellekens' conjecture that all simple current invariants can be
obtained as orbifolds of the diagonal model, even when the extra assumption of
higher-genus modular invariance is dropped, is confirmed in the case of the
unitary N=2 minimal models by simple counting arguments.
