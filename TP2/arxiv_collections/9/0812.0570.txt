We discuss the lattice formulation of gauge theories with fermions in
arbitrary representations of the color group, and present the implementation of
the RHMC algorithm for simulating dynamical Wilson fermions. A first dataset is
presented for the SU(2) gauge theory with two fermions in the adjoint
representation, which has been proposed as a possible technicolor candidate.
Simulations are performed on 8^3x16 lattices, at fixed lattice spacing. The
PCAC mass, the pseudoscalar, vector and axial meson masses, the pseudoscalar
meson decay constant are computed. The extrapolation to the chiral limit is
discussed. However more extensive investigations are needed in order to control
the systematic errors in the numerical results, and then understand in detail
the phase structure of these theories.
