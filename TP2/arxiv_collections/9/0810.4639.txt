In this paper, I propose a theoretical information-geometric framework
suitable to characterize chaotic dynamical behavior of arbitrary complex
systems on curved statistical manifolds. Specifically, I present an
information-geometric analogue of the Zurek-Paz quantum chaos criterion of
linear entropy growth and an information-geometric characterization of regular
and chaotic quantum energy level statistics.
