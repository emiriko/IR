We test recent results for the four-point correlation numbers in Minimal
Liouville Gravity against calculations in the one-Matrix Models, and find full
agreement. In the process, we construct the resonance transformation which
relates coupling parameters of the Liouville Gravity with the couplings of the
Matrix Models, up to the terms of the order 4. We also conjecture the general
form of this transformation.
