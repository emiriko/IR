We perform a numerical study of the three-dimensional Random Field
  Ising Model at T=0. We compare work distributions along metastable
trajectories obtained with the single-spin flip dynamics with the distribution
of the internal energy change along equilibrium trajectories. The goal is to
investigate the possibility of extending the Crooks fluctuation theorem to zero
temperature when, instead of the standard ensemble statistics, one considers
the ensemble generated by the quenched disorder. We show that a simple
extension of Crooks fails close to the disordered induced equilibrium phase
transition due to the fact that work and internal energy distributions are very
asymmetric.
