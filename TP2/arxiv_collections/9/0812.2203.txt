The viscosity over entropy density ratio, or KSS number, can help isolate the
critical point in the hadron phase-diagram in Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collisions. We argue that this quantity does have a minimum at a phase
transition or crossover. Although indications from conventional
non-relativistic gases point out to even a divergence in eta/s when the
phase-transition is first-order, since the critical exponent is rather low,
this will be more difficult to ascertain in RHIC or FAIR. The experimental data
are more likely to reveal a discontinuity for a first order phase transition or
a smooth minimum at a crossover.
