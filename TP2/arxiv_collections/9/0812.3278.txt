If R, S, T are irreducible SL_3-representations, we give an easy and explicit
description of a basis of the space of equivariant maps from R tensor S to T.
We apply this method to the rationality problem for invariant function fields.
In particular, we prove the rationality of the moduli space of plane curves of
degree 34. This uses a criterion which ensures the stable rationality of some
quotients of Grassmannians by an SL-action.
