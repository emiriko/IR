Quantum recurrence theorem holds for quantum systems with discrete energy
eigenvalues and fails to hold in general for systems with continuous energy. We
show that during quantum walk process dominated by interference of amplitude
corresponding to different paths fail to satisfy the complete quantum
recurrence theorem. Due to the revival of the fractional wave packet, a
fractional recurrence characterized using quantum P\'olya number can be seen.
