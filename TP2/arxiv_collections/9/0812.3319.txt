We report single layer resistivities of 2-dimensional electron and hole gases
in an electron-hole bilayer with a 10nm barrier. In a regime where the
interlayer interaction is stronger than the intralayer interaction, we find
that an insulating state ($d\rho/dT < 0$) emerges at $T\sim1.5{\rm K}$ or
lower, when both the layers are simultaneously present. This happens deep in
the $"$metallic" regime, even in layers with $k_{F}l>500$, thus making
conventional mechanisms of localisation due to disorder improbable. We suggest
that this insulating state may be due to a charge density wave phase, as has
been expected in electron-hole bilayers from the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander
approximation based calculations of L. Liu {\it et al} [{\em Phys. Rev. B},
{\bf 53}, 7923 (1996)]. Our results are also in qualitative agreement with
recent Path-Integral-Monte-Carlo simulations of a two component plasma in the
low temperature regime [ P. Ludwig {\it et al}. {\em Contrib. Plasma Physics}
