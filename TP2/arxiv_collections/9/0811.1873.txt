On the basis of the phase diagram of the uniform system we calculate the
density profiles of a trapped polarized Fermi gas at zero temperature using the
local density approximation. By varying the overall polarization and the
interaction strength we analyze the appearance of a discontinuity in the
profile, signalling a first order phase transition from a superfluid inner core
to a normal outer shell. The local population imbalance between the two
components and the size of the various regions of the cloud corresponding to
different phases are also discussed. The calculated profiles are quantitatively
compared with the ones recently measured by Shin {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.
