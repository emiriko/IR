The dynamics of hard-core interacting Brownian particles in an external
potential field is studied in one dimension. Using the Jepsen line we find a
very general and simple formula relating the motion of the tagged center
particle, with the classical, time dependent single particle reflection ${\cal
R}$ and transmission ${\cal T}$ coefficients. Our formula describes rich
physical behaviors both in equilibrium and the approach to equilibrium of this
many body problem.
