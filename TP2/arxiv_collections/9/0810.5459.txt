We have simulated energy relaxation and equilibrium dynamics in Coulomb
Glasses using the random energy lattice model. We show that in a temperature
range where the Coulomb Gap is already well developed, (T=0.03-0.1) the system
still relaxes to an equilibrium behavior within the simulation time scale. For
all temperatures T, the relaxation is slower than exponential. Analyzing the
energy correlations of the system at equilibrium, we find a stretched
exponential behavior. We define a time \tau_\gamma from these stretched
exponential correlations, and show that this time corresponds well with the
time required to reach equilibrium. From our data it is not possible to
determine whether \tau_\gamma diverges at any finite temperature, indicating a
glass transition, or whether this divergence happens at zero temperature. While
the time dependence of the system energy can be well fitted by a random walker
in a harmonic potential for high temperatures (T=10), this simple model fails
to describe the long time scales observed at lower temperatures. Instead we
present an interpretation of the configuration space as a structure with
fractal properties, and the time evolution as a random walk on this
fractal-like structure.
