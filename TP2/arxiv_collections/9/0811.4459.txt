Nuclear pairing properties are studied within an approach that includes the
quasiparticle-number fluctuation (QNF) and coupling to the quasiparticle-pair
vibrations at finite temperature and angular momentum. The formalism is
developed to describe non-collective rotations about the symmetry axis. The
numerical calculations are performed within a doubly-folded equidistant
multilevel model as well as several realistic nuclei. The results obtained for
the pairing gap, total energy and heat capacity show that the QNF smoothes out
the sharp SN phase transition and leads to the appearance of a thermally
assisted pairing gap in rotating nuclei at finite temperature. The corrections
due to the dynamic coupling to SCQRPA vibrations and particle-number projection
are analyzed. The effect of backbending of the momentum of inertia as a
function of squared angular velocity is also discussed.
