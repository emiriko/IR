We demonstrate time resolved driving of two-photon blue sideband transitions
between superconducting qubits and a transmission line resonator. Using the
sidebands, we implement a pulse sequence that first entangles one qubit with
the resonator, and subsequently distributes the entanglement between two
qubits. We show generation of 75% fidelity Bell states by this method. The full
density matrix of the two qubit system is extracted using joint measurement and
quantum state tomography, and shows close agreement with numerical simulation.
The scheme is potentially extendable to a scalable universal gate for quantum
computation.
