A two-dimensional model of interacting plaquettes is studied by means of the
real space renormalization group approach. Interactions between the plaquettes
are mediated solely by spin excitations on the plaquettes. Depending on the
plaquette-plaquette coupling $J$, we find two regimes:
  "confinement" $J_c< J\leq 1$, where the singlet ground state forms an
infinite ("confined") cluster in the thermodynamical limit. Here the
singlet-triplet gap vanishes, which is the signature for long range spin-spin
correlators.
  "deconfinement" $0\leq J< J_c$, where the singlet ground state "deconfines" -
i.e. factorizes - into finite $n$-clusters of size $2^n\times 2^n$, with $n\leq
n_c(J)$. Here the singlet-triplet gap is finite.
  The critical value turns out to be $J_c=0.473528..$.
