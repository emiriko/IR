Monolithic CMOS pixel sensors offer unprecedented opportunities for fast
nano-imaging through direct electron detection in transmission electron
microscopy. We present the design and a full characterisation of a CMOS pixel
test structure able to withstand doses in excess of 1 MRad. Data collected with
electron beams at various energies of interest in electron microscopy are
compared to predictions of simulation and to 1.5 GeV electron data to
disentagle the effect of multiple scattering. The point spread function
measured with 300 keV electrons is (8.1 +/- 1.6) micron for 10 micron pixel and
(10.9 +/- 2.3) micron for 20 micron pixels, respectively, which agrees well
with the values of 8.4 micron and 10.5 micron predicted by our simulation.
