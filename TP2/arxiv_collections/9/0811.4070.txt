The plasmon oscillations of a metallic triaxial ellipsoid nanoparticle have
been studied within the framework of the quasistatic approximation. A general
method has been proposed for finding the analytical expressions describing the
potential and frequencies of the plasmon oscillations of an arbitrary
multipolarity order. The analytical expressions have been derived for an
electric potential and plasmon oscillation frequencies of the first 24 modes.
Other higher orders plasmon modes are investigated numerically.
