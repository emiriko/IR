This paper is partly a survey of certain kinds of results and proofs in
additive combinatorics, and partly a discussion of how useful the
finite-dimensional Hahn-Banach theorem can be. The most interesting single
result is probably a simpler proof of a key step in the proof of the Green-Tao
theorem, but several other applications of the method are given. A similarly
simplified proof of the Green-Tao transference principle was obtained
independently (and expressed in a rather different language) by Reingold,
Trevisan, Tulsiani and Vadhan.
