A linear and lagged relationship between inflation and labor force change
rate, p(t)= A1dLF(t-t1)/LF(t-t1)+A2 was found for developed economies. For the
USA, A1=4.0, A2=-0.03075, and t1=2 years. It provides a RMS forecasting error
(RMFSE) of 0.8% at a two-year horizon for the period between 1965 and 2002 (the
best among other inflation forecasting models). This relationship is tested for
cointegration. Both variables are integrated of order one according to the
presence of a unit root in the series and its absence in their first
differences. Two methods of cointegration testing are applied: the
Engle-Granger one based on the unit root test of the residuals including a
variety of specification tests and the Johansen cointegration rank test based
on the VAR representation. Both approaches demonstrate that the variables are
cointegrated and the long-run equilibrium relation revealed in previous study
holds. According to the Granger causality test, the labor force change is
proved to be a weakly exogenous variable - a natural result considering the
time lead and the existence of a cointegrating relation. VAR and VECM
representations do not provide any significant improvement in RMSFE. There are
numerous applications of the equation: from purely theoretical - a robust
fundamental relation between macroeconomic and population variables, to a
practical one - an accurate out-of-sample inflation forecasting at a two-year
horizon and a long-term prediction based on labor force projections. The
predictive power of the relationship is inversely proportional to the
uncertainty of labor force estimates. Therefore, future inflation research
programs should start from a significant improvement in the accuracy of labor
force estimations.
