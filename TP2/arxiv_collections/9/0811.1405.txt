There exist new polarized structure functions in a spin-one hadron. In deep
inelastic electron scattering from a spin-one hadron, there are eight structure
functions F_1, F_2, g_1, g_2, b_1, b_2, b_3, and b_4. We derive projections to
these eight functions from the hadron tensor W^{mu nu} by combinations of the
hadron momentum and its polarization vectors.
