Torsion models constitute a well known class of extended quantum gravity
models. In this paper we study some phenomenological consequences of a torsion
field interacting with fermions at LHC. A torsion field could appear as a new
heavy state characterized by its mass and couplings to fermions. These new
states will form a resonance decaying into difermions, as occurs in many
extensions of the Standard Model, such as models predicting the existence of
additional neutral gauge bosons, usually named $Z^\prime$. Using the dielectron
channel we evaluate the integrated luminosity needed for a $5\sigma$ discovery
as a function of the torsion mass, for different coupling values. We also
calculate the luminosity needed for discriminate, with 95% C.L., the two
possible different torsion natures. Finally, we show that the observed signal
coming from the torsion field could be distinguished from a signal coming from
a new neutral gauge boson, provided there is enough luminosity.
