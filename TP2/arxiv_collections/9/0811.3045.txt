Disorder plays an important role in two dimensions, and is responsible for
striking phenomena such as metal insulator transition and the integral and
fractional quantum Hall effects. In this paper, we investigate the role of
disorder in the context of the recently discovered topological insulator, which
possesses a pair of helical edge states with opposing spins moving in opposite
directions and exhibits the phenomenon of quantum spin Hall effect. We predict
an unexpected and nontrivial quantum phase termed "topological Anderson
insulator," which is obtained by introducing impurities in a two-dimensional
metal; here disorder not only causes metal insulator transition, as
anticipated, but is fundamentally responsible for creating extended edge
states. We determine the phase diagram of the topological Anderson insulator
and outline its experimental consequences.
