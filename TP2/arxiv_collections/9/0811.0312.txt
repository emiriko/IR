In this note we discuss a toy model in which the value of the effective
cosmological constant is associated with a symmetry properties of the vacuum
background solution and defined by the model parameter associated with a scalar
field non-minimally coupled to gravity. Although the parameters in the model
seem to have unrealistic values to account for the present value of the
cosmological constant, the model demonstrates a possible alternative way it can
arise.
