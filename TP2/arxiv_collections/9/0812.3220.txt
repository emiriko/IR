Transverse momentum spectra of charmed and beauty mesons produced in
proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions at high energies are analyzed
within the modified quark-gluon string model (QGSM) including the internal
motion of quarks in colliding hadrons. It is shown that this approach can
describe rather satisfactorily the experimental data at not large values of the
transverse momentum where the NLO QCD calculation has a big uncertainty. We
also show that using both the QGSM and the NLO QCD one can describe these data
in a wide region of transverse momenta and give some predictions for the future
LHC experiments.
