We demonstrate that the phase response curve (PRC) can be reconstructed using
a weighted spike-triggered average of an injected fluctuating input. The key
idea is to choose the weight to be proportional to the magnitude of the
fluctuation of the oscillatory period. Particularly, when a neuron exhibits
random switching behavior between two bursting modes, two corresponding PRCs
can be simultaneously reconstructed, even from the data of a single trial. This
method offers an efficient alternative to the experimental investigation of
oscillatory systems, without the need for detailed modeling.
