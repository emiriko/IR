We compare the dynamics of maximal three-dimensional gauged supergravity in
appropriate truncations with the equations of motion that follow from a
one-dimensional E10/K(E10) coset model at the first few levels. The constant
embedding tensor, which describes gauge deformations and also constitutes an
M-theoretic degree of freedom beyond eleven-dimensional supergravity, arises
naturally as an integration constant of the geodesic model. In a detailed
analysis, we find complete agreement at the lowest levels. At higher levels
there appear mismatches, as in previous studies. We discuss the origin of these
mismatches.
