Substrate defects crucially influence the onset of sliding drop motion under
lateral driving. A finite force is necessary to overcome the pinning influence
even of microscale heterogeneities. The depinning dynamics of three-dimensional
drops is studied for hydrophilic and hydrophobic wettability defects using a
long-wave evolution equation for the film thickness profile. It is found that
the nature of the depinning transition explains the experimentally observed
stick-slip motion.
