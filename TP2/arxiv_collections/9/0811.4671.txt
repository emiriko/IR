We present evidence for a new supersymmetric quartet in the A=190 region of
the nuclear mass table. New experimental information on transfer and neutron
capture reactions to the odd-odd nucleaus 194 Ir strongly suggests the
existence of a new supersymmetric quartet, consisting of the 192,193 Os and
193,194 Ir nuclei. We make explicit predictions for the odd-neutron nucleus 193
Os, and suggest that its spectroscopic properties be measured in dedicated
experiments.
