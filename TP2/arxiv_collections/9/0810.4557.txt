Progress in extracting excited-state baryon masses in lattice QCD using large
sets of spatially-extended operators is presented. The use of stochastic
estimates of all-to-all quark propagators with variance reduction techniques is
described. Such techniques are crucial for incorporating multi-hadron operators
into the correlation matrices of the hadron operators.
