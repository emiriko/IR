We demonstrate a simple and robust methodology for measuring and analyzing
the polarization impedance appearing at interface between electrodes and ionic
solutions, in the frequency range from 1 to $10^6$ Hz. The method assumes no
particular behavior of the electrode polarization impedance and it only makes
use of the fact that the polarization effect dies out with frequency. The
method allows a direct and un-biased measurement of the polarization impedance,
whose behavior with the applied voltages and ionic concentration is
methodically investigated. Furthermore, based on the previous findings, we
propose a protocol for correcting the polarization effect in low frequency
Dielectric Spectroscopy measurements of colloids. This could potentially lead
to the quantitative resolution of the $\alpha$-dispersion regime of live cells
in suspension.
