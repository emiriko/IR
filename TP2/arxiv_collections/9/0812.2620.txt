We investigate the possible classification of zero-temperature spin-gapped
phases of multicomponent electronic systems in one spatial dimension. At the
heart of our analysis is the existence of non-perturbative duality symmetries
which emerge within a low-energy description. These dualities fall into a
finite number of classes that can be listed and depend only on the algebraic
properties of the symmetries of the system: its physical symmetry group and the
maximal continuous symmetry group of the interaction. We further characterize
possible competing orders associated to the dualities and discuss the nature of
the quantum phase transitions between them. Finally, as an illustration, the
duality approach is applied to the description of the phases of two-leg
electronic ladders for incommensurate filling.
