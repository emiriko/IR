We describe an educational simulation of some effects within the gas of hard
spheres. The focus of the presented simulation is on the comprehension of
random character of the velocity of molecules in the gas and of the energy at
fixed temperature. It allows to point out the connection between the
temperature, the energy, and the velocity of the molecules.
