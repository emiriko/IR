Monte Carlo methods can provide accurate p-value estimates of word counting
test statistics and are easy to implement. They are especially attractive when
an asymptotic theory is absent or when either the search sequence or the word
pattern is too short for the application of asymptotic formulae. Naive direct
Monte Carlo is undesirable for the estimation of small probabilities because
the associated rare events of interest are seldom generated. We propose instead
efficient importance sampling algorithms that use controlled insertion of the
desired word patterns on randomly generated sequences. The implementation is
illustrated on word patterns of biological interest: Palindromes and inverted
repeats, patterns arising from position specific weight matrices and
co-occurrences of pairs of motifs.
