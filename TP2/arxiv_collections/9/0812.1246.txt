We propose and analyze a physical implementation of two-qubit parity
measurements as required for continuous error correction, assuming a setup in
which the individual qubits are strongly coupled to separate optical cavities.
A single optical probe beam scatters sequentially from the two cavities and the
continuous parity measurement is realized via fixed quadrature homodyne
photo-detection. We present models based on quantum stochastic differential
equations (QSDE's) for both an ideal continuous parity measurement and our
proposed cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) implementation; a recent
adiabatic elimination theorem for QSDE's is used to assert strong convergence
of the latter to the former in an appropriate limit of physical parameters.
Performance of the cavity QED scheme is studied via numerical simulation with
experimentally realistic parameters.
