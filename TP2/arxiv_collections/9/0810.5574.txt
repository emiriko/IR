The origin of neutrino mass is usually attributed to a seesaw mechanism,
either through a heavy Majorana fermion singlet (version 1) or a heavy scalar
triplet (version 2). Recently, the idea of using a heavy Majorana fermion
triplet (version 3) has gained some attention. This is a review of the basic
idea involved, its U(1) gauge extension, and some recent developments.
