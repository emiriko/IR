Ultrathin films of the itinerant ferromagnet SrRuO$_3$ were studied using
transport and magnto-optic polar Kerr effect. We find that below 4 monolayers
the films become insulating and their magnetic character changes as they loose
their simple ferromagnetic behavior. We observe a strong reduction in the
magnetic moment which for 3 monolayers and below lies in the plane of the film.
Exchange-bias behavior is observed below the critical thickness, and may point
to induced antiferromagnetism in contact with ferromagnetic regions.
