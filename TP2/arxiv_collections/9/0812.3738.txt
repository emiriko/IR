We propose the method of statistical description of broad class of dynamic
systems (DS) whose equations of motion are determined by two state depending
functions: 1) "energy" - the quantity which conserves in time and 2) "entropy"
- the quantity which does not decrease in time. It is demonstrated that the
behavior of such systems in the equilibrium state reduces to the thermodynamic
lows in particular the Le Chatelier principle is satisfed and so on. Taking
into account the interaction system of interest with ergometer - the device
which continuously measures its energy one can possible to find the system
distribution function in arbitrary non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS).
Some general relations for mean values of certain quantities in NESS which can
be compared with experimental data are obtained.
