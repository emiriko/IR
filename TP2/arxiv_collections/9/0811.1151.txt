In this paper, we present a probabilistic adaptation of an Assume/Guarantee
contract formalism. For the sake of generality, we assume that the extended
state machines used in the contracts and implementations define sets of runs on
a given set of variables, that compose by intersection over the common
variables. In order to enable probabilistic reasoning, we consider that the
contracts dictate how certain input variables will behave, being either
non-deterministic, or probabilistic; the introduction of probabilistic
variables leading us to tune the notions of implementation, refinement and
composition. As shown in the report, this probabilistic adaptation of the
Assume/Guarantee contract theory preserves compositionality and therefore
allows modular reliability analysis, either with a top-down or a bottom-up
approach.
