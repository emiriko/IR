We show that the Euclidean Snyder non-commutative space implies infinitely
many different physical predictions. The distinct frameworks are specified by
generalized uncertainty relations underlying deformed Heisenberg algebras.
Considering the one-dimensional case in the minisuperspace arena, the bouncing
Universe dynamics of loop quantum cosmology can be recovered.
