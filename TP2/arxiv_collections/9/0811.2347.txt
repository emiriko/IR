Low-temperature magnetic properties of epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films grown on
(111)-SrTiO3 substrates have been studied. ZFC and FC magnetization curves show
a large discrepency beginning at a characteristic temperature Tf that is
dependent on the magnetic-field strengh. Tf(H) varies according to the well
known de Aleimda-Thouless line (varies in Hexp(2/3)) suggesting an acentric
long rnage spin-glass behavior and mean field system.
