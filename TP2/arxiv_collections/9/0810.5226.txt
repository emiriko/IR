This review summarizes the program in the physics of the top quark being
pursued at Fermilab's Tevatron proton-antiproton collider at a center of mass
energy of 1.96 TeV. More than a decade after the discovery of the top quark at
the two collider detectors CDF and D0, the Tevatron has been the only
accelerator to produce top quarks and to study them directly.
  The Tevatron's increased luminosity and center of mass energy offer the
possibility to scrutinize the properties of this heaviest fundamental particle
through new measurements that were not feasible before, such as the first
evidence for electroweak production of top quarks and the resulting direct
constraints on the involved couplings. Better measurements of top quark
properties provide more stringent tests of predictions from the standard model
of elementary particle physics. In particular, the improvement in measurements
of the mass of the top quark, with the latest uncertainty of 0.7% marking the
most precisely measured quark mass to date, further constrains the prediction
of the mass of the still to be discovered Higgs boson.
