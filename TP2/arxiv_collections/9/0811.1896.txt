We show that the shortfall risk of binomial approximations of game (Israeli)
options converges to the shortfall risk in the corresponding Black--Scholes
market considering Lipschitz continuous path-dependent payoffs for both
discrete- and continuous-time cases. These results are new also for usual
American style options. The paper continues and extends the study of Kifer
[Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 984--1033] where estimates for binomial
approximations of prices of game options were obtained. Our arguments rely, in
particular, on strong invariance principle type approximations via the
Skorokhod embedding, estimates from Kifer [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006)
984--1033] and the existence of optimal shortfall hedging in the discrete time
established by Dolinsky and Kifer [Stochastics 79 (2007) 169--195].
