We have fabricated c-axis Josephson junctions on single crystals of
(Ba,K)Fe2As2 by using Pb as the counter electrode in two geometries, planar and
point contact. Junctions in both geometries show resistively shunted junction
I-V curves below the Tc of the counter electrode. Microwave induced steps were
observed in the I-V curves, and the critical currents are suppressed with an
in-plane magnetic field in a manner consistent with the small junction limit.
ICRN products of up to 0.3 mV have been observed in these junctions at 4.2 K.
The observation of Josephson coupling along the c-axis between (Ba,K)Fe2As2 and
a conventional superconductor suggests the existence of a s-wave
superconducting order parameter in this class of iron pnictide superconductors.
