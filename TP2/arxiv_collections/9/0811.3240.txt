We show that a semi-classical polymerization of the interior of Schwarzschild
black holes gives rise to a tantalizing candidate for a non-singular, single
horizon black hole spacetime. The exterior has non-zero quantum stress energy
but closely approximates the classical spacetime for macroscopic black holes.
The interior exhibits a bounce at a microscopic scale and then expands
indefinitely to a Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. Polymerization therefore removes
the singularity and produces a scenario reminiscent of past proposals for
universe creation via quantum effects inside a black hole.
