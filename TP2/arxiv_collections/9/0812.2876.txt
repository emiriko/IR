We describe a detector that measures the mutual coherence of two optical
fields directly using quantum interference, free from photon noise of the
individual irradiances. Our approach utilizes Raman transition in an atomic
system where the state evolution is driven by the mutual coherence of the
fields interacting with the atoms. Feedback control is used to balance the
interaction of the fields being characterized, providing a measure of the
mutual coherence. We show that the sensitivity of the coherence measurement can
be enhanced significantly above that of conventional interferometric methods
when the mutual coherence of the two fields is weak.
