We propose a realistic protocol to generate entanglement between quantum
memories at neighboring nodes in hybrid quantum repeaters. Generated
entanglement includes only one type of error, which enables efficient
entanglement distillation. In contrast to the known protocols with such a
property, our protocol with ideal detectors achieves the theoretical limit of
the success probability and the fidelity to a Bell state, promising higher
efficiencies in the repeaters. We also show that the advantage of our protocol
remains even with realistic threshold detectors.
