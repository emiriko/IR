We extend Voiculescu's approach to analytic subordination through the
coalgebra of the free difference quotient to non-coassociative
derivation-comultiplications appearing in free probability theory. We obtain
new proofs of Voiculescu's analytic subordination results for freely Markovian
triples, and for multiplication of unitaries which are free with amalgamation.
