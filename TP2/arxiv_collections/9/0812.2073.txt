We analyze parity-violating nucleon-nucleon scattering at energies
E<m_\pi^2/M using the effective field theory appropriate for this regime. The
minimal Lagrangian for short-range parity-violating NN interactions is written
in an operator basis that encodes the five partial-wave transitions that
dominate at these energies. We calculate the leading-order relationships
between parity-violating NN asymmetries and the coefficients in the Lagrangian
and also discuss the size of sub-leading corrections. We conclude with a
discussion of further observables needed to completely determine the
leading-order Lagrangian.
