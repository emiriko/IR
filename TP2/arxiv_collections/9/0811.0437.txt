We estimate the energy density and the gluon distribution associated with the
classical fields describing the early-time dynamics of the heavy-ion
collisions. We first decompose the energy density into the momentum components
exactly in the McLerran-Venugopalan model, with the use of the Wilson line
correlators. Then we evolve the energy density with the free-field equation,
which is justified by the dominance of the ultraviolet modes near the collision
point. We also discuss the improvement with inclusion of nonlinear terms into
the time evolution. Our numerical results at RHIC energy are fairly consistent
with the empirical values.
