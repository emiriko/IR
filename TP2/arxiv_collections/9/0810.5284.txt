This article focuses on the simulation of soil-structure interaction during a
sinkhole development by the use of a coupling numerical modelling approach. The
2D model uses a Finite Difference computer code associated with a Distinct
Elements code to optimize the performances of both softwares. This allows an
important decrease of computation time and the results computed are close of
the experimental observations made before.
