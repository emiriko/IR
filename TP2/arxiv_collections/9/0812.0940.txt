The inference of gene regulatory networks from high throughput gene
expression data is one of the major challenges in systems biology. This paper
aims at analysing and comparing two different algorithmic approaches. The first
approach uses pairwise correlations between regulated and regulating genes; the
second one uses message-passing techniques for inferring activating and
inhibiting regulatory interactions. The performance of these two algorithms can
be analysed theoretically on well-defined test sets, using tools from the
statistical physics of disordered systems like the replica method. We find that
the second algorithm outperforms the first one since it takes into account
collective effects of multiple regulators.
