In the framework of the kt-factorization approach, we study the production of
prompt photons and electroweak gauge bosons in high energy proton-(anti)proton
collisions at modern colliders. Our consideration is based on the amplitude for
the production of a single photon or W/Z boson associated with a quark pair in
the fusion of two off-shell gluons. The quark component is taken into account
separately using the quark-gluon scaterring and quark-antiquark annihilation
QCD subprocesses. Special attention is put on the contributions from the quarks
involved into the earlier steps of the evolution cascade. Using the
Kimber-Martin-Ryskin formalism, we simulate this component and demonstrate that
it plays an important role at both the Tevatron and LHC energies. Our
theoretical results are compared with recent experimental data taken by the D0
and CDF collaborations at the Tevatron.
