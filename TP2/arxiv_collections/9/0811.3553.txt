AdS/QCD correspondence allows to compute the quark-antiquark potential in the
static limit. We use this piece of information together with the Salpeter
equation (Schroedinger equation with relativistic kinematics) and a short range
hyperfine splitting potential to describe the bound states of quark-antiquark.
Comparison with experiment permits to fit the parameters of the model, namely
the quark masses and the quark potential parameters. A discussion of heavy
tetraquark masses, prompted by the hypothesis of a diquark-antidiquark
structure for the puzzling state X(3872), is also presented.
