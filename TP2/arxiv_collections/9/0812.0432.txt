We point out that when the decay of one electroweak scale super-WIMP state to
another occurs at second order in a super-weak coupling constant, this can
naturally lead to decay lifetimes that are much larger than the age of the
Universe, and create observable consequences for the indirect detection of dark
matter. We demonstrate this in a supersymmetric model with Dirac neutrinos,
where the right-handed scalar neutrinos are the lightest and next-to-lightest
supersymmetric partners. We show that this model produces a super-WIMP decay
rate scaling as m_nu^4/(weak scale)^3, and may significantly enhance the
fraction of energetic electrons and positrons over anti-protons in the decay
products. Such a signature is consistent with the observations recently
reported by the PAMELA experiment.
