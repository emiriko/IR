The leading nonadiabatic corrections to rovibrational levels of a diatomic
molecule are expressed in terms of three functions of internuclear distance:
corrections to the adiabatic potential, the effective nuclear mass, and the
effective moment of inertia. The resulting radial Schr\"odinger equation for
nuclear motion is solved numerically yielding accurate nonadiabatic energies
for all rovibrational levels of H$_2$ molecule in excellent agreement with
previous calculations by Wolniewicz.
