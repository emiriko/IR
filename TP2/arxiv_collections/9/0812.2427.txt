The heavy quark effects in deep--inelastic scattering in the asymptotic
regime $Q^2 \gg m^2$ can be described by heavy flavor operator matrix elements.
Complete analytic expressions for these objects are currently known to ${\sf
NLO}$. We present first results for fixed moments at ${\sf NNLO}$. This
involves a recalculation of fixed moments of the corresponding ${\sf NNLO}$
anomalous dimensions, which we thereby confirm.
