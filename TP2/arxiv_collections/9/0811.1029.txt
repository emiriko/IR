It is well known that stable weak scale particles are viable dark matter
candidates since the annihilation cross section is naturally about the right
magnitude to leave the correct thermal residual abundance. Many dark matter
searches have focused on relatively light dark matter consistent with weak
couplings to the Standard Model. However, in a strongly coupled theory, or even
if the coupling is just a few times bigger than the Standard Model couplings,
dark matter can have TeV-scale mass with the correct thermal relic abundance.
Here we consider neutral TeV-mass scalar dark matter, its necessary
interactions, and potential signals. We consider signals both with and without
higher-dimension operators generated by strong coupling at the TeV scale, as
might happen for example in an RS scenario. We find some potential for
detection in high energy photons that depends on the dark matter distribution.
Detection in positrons at lower energies, such as those PAMELA probes, would be
difficult though a higher energy positron signal could in principle be
detectable over background. However, a light dark matter particle with
higher-dimensional interactions consistent with a TeV cutoff can in principle
match PAMELA data.
