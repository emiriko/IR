We shall investigate the properties of a congruence of geodesics in the
framework of Palatini f(R) theories. We shall evaluate the modified geodesic
deviation equation and the Raychaudhuri's equation and show that f(R) Palatini
theories do not necessarily lead to attractive forces. Also we shall study
energy condition for f(R) Palatini gravity via a perturbative analysis of the
Raychaudhuri's equation.
