Using the coupled cluster method we study the zero-temperature phase diagram
of a spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF), the so-called
$J_{1}$--$J_{2}'$ model, defined on an anisotropic 2D lattice. With respect to
an underlying square-lattice geometry the model contains antiferromagnetic
($J_{1} > 0$) bonds between nearest neighbors and competing ($J_{2}'>0$) bonds
between next-nearest neighbors across only one of the diagonals of each square
plaquette, the same diagonal in every square. Considered on an equivalent
triangular-lattice geometry the model may be regarded as having two sorts of
nearest-neighbor bonds, with $J_{2}' \equiv \kappa J_{1}$ bonds along parallel
chains and $J_{1}$ bonds providing an interchain coupling. Hence, the model
interpolates between a spin-half HAF on the square lattice at one extreme
($\kappa = 0$) and a set of decoupled spin-half chains at the other ($\kappa
\to \infty$), with the spin-half HAF on the triangular lattice in between at
$\kappa = 1$. We find strong evidence that quantum fluctuations favor a
first-order transition from quasiclassical N\'{e}el order to a quantum helical
state at a first critical point at $\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.80 \pm 0.01$, by
contrast with the corresponding second-order transition between the equivalent
classical states at $\kappa_{{\rm cl}} = 0.5$. We also find strong evidence for
a second critical point at $\kappa_{c_{2}} = 1.8 \pm 0.4$ where another
first-order transition occurs, this time from the quantum helical phase to a
collinear stripe-ordered phase. This latter result provides quantitative
verification of a recent qualitative prediction of Starykh and Balents [Phys.\
Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 077205 (2007)] for the $J_{1}$--$J_{2}'$ model that did
not, however, evaluate the corresponding critical point.
