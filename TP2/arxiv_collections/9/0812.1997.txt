We report on the experimental observation of dynamic localization of a
Bose-Einstein condensate in a shaken optical lattice, both for sinusoidal and
square-wave forcing. The formulation of this effect in terms of a quasienergy
band collapse, backed by the excellent agreement of the observed collapse
points with the theoretical predictions, suggests the feasibility of systematic
quasienergy band engineering.
