In this paper, we propose a scheme for the controlled teleportation of an
arbitrary two-atom entangled state
$|\phi>_{12}=a|gg>_{12}+b|ge>_{12}+c|eg>_{12}+d|ee>_{12}$ in driven cavity QED.
An arbitrary two-atom entangled state can be teleported perfectly with the help
of the cooperation of the third side by constructing a three-atom GHZ entangled
state as the controlled channel. This scheme does not involve apparent (or
direct) Bell-state measurement and is insensitive to the cavity decay and the
thermal field. The probability of the success in our scheme is 1.0.
