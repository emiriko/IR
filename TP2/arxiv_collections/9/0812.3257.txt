One way to obtain Quantized Universal Enveloping Algebras (QUEAs) of
non-semisimple Lie algebras is by contracting QUEAs of semisimple Lie algebras.
We prove that every contracted QUEA in a certain class is a cochain twist of
the corresponding undeformed universal envelope. Consequently, these contracted
QUEAs possess a triangular quasi-Hopf algebra structure. As examples, we
consider kappa-Poincare in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions.
