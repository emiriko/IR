Since the initial investigation by Matsui and Satz heavy quark bound states
at finite temperature have been subject to numerous studies. The derivation of
a finite-temperature potential from first principles was attempted only
recently however, by generalising the Schroedinger equation which is
successfully employed for the description of quarkonia at zero temperature to a
thermal setting. In this note the finite-temperature static potential is
derived to leading order using resummed perturbation theory. The modification
of the heavy quarkonium spectral function by an imaginary part of the potential
appearing at finite temperature is discussed. Additionally, the extent of
possible corrections due to non-perturbative processes is assessed by employing
real-time lattice techniques based on kinetic theory.
