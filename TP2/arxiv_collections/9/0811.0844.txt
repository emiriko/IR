We consider a model of one dimensional spin-1 bosons with repulsive
density-density interactions and antiferromagnetic exchange. We show that the
low energy effective field theory is given by a spin-charge separated theory of
a Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian and the O(3) nonlinear sigma model describing
collective charge and spin excitations respectively. At a particular ratio of
the density-density to spin-spin interaction the model is integrable, and we
use the exact solutions to provide an independent derivation of the low energy
effective theory. The system is in a superfluid phase made of singlet pairs of
bosons, and we calculate the long-distance asymptotics of certain correlation
functions.
