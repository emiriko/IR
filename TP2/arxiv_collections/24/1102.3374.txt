We show that the forward-backward asymmetry in top quark pair production can
be enhanced by fields that transform nontrivially under the flavour group and
satisfy Minimal Flavour Violation, while at the same time the constraints from
associated effects on the d \sigma(t anti-t)/d M_{t anti-t} distribution, dijet
resonance searches, same sign top pair production and other phenomenology are
satisfied. We work out two examples in detail, one where a scalar colour
anti-sextet field, that is also an anti-sextet of SU(3)_U, enhances the
forward-backward asymmetry, and one where the enhancement arises from a vector
colour octet field that is also an octet of SU(3)_U.
