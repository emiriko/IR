We review the basic features of some recently found consistent Kaluza-Klein
truncations including massive modes. We emphasize the general ideas underlying
the reduction procedure, then we focus on type IIB supergravity on
5-dimensional manifolds admitting a Sasaki-Einstein structure, which leads to
half-maximal gauged supergravity in five dimensions. Finally, we comment on the
holographic picture of consistency.
