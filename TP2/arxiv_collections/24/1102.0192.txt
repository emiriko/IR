The radiative counterpart of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic
center (GC), Sgr A*, is subject to frequent flares visible simultaneously in
X-rays and near-infrared (NIR). Often, enhanced radio variability from
centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths is observed to follow these X-ray/NIR
eruptions. We present here a multi-wavelength campaign carried out in April
2009, with the aim of characterizing this broadband flaring activity.
Concurrent data from the XMM-Newton/EPIC (2-10 keV), VLT/NACO (2.1 microns, 3.8
microns), APEX/LABOCA (870 microns), and Fermi/LAT (0.1-200 GeV) instruments
are employed to derive light curves and spectral energy distributions of new
flares from Sgr A*. We detected two relatively bright NIR flares both
associated with weak X-ray activity, one of which was followed by a strong
sub-mm outburst 200 min later. Photometric spectral information on a NIR flare
was obtained for the first time with NACO giving a power-law photon index
alpha=-0.4\pm0.3. The first attempt to detect flaring activity from the Fermi
GC source 1FGL J1745.6-2900 is also reported. NIR, X-ray, and sub-mm flares are
finally modeled in the context of non-thermal emission processes. It is found
that the simplest scenario involving a single expanding plasmoid releasing
synchrotron NIR/sub-mm and synchrotron self-Compton X-ray radiation is
inadequate to reproduce the data, but suggestions to reconcile the basic
elements of the theory and the observations are proposed.
