We propose a mechanism to have a smooth transition from a pre-Big Bang phase
to a standard cosmological phase. Such transition is driven by gravitational
production of heavy massive string states that backreact on the geometry to
stop the growth of the curvature. Close to the string scale, particle creation
can become effective because the string phase space compensate the exponential
suppression of the particle production. Numerical solutions for the evolution
of the Universe with this source are presented.
