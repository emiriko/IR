We determine the phase diagram of QCD on the \mu-T plane for small to
moderate chemical potentials. Two transition lines are defined with two
quantities, the chiral condensate and the strange quark number susceptibility.
The calculations are carried out on N_t =6,8 and 10 lattices generated with a
Symanzik improved gauge and stout-link improved 2+1 flavor staggered fermion
action using physical quark masses. After carrying out the continuum
extrapolation we find that both quantities result in a similar curvature of the
transition line. Furthermore, our results indicate that in leading order the
width of the transition region remains essentially the same as the chemical
potential is increased.
