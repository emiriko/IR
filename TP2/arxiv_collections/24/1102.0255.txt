The equilibrium electric double layer (EDL) that surrounds the colloidal
particles is determinant for the response of a suspension under a variety of
static or alternating external fields. An ideal salt-free suspension is
composed by the charged colloidal particles and the ionic countercharge
released by the charging mechanism. The existing macroscopic theoretical models
can be improved by incorporating different ionic effects usually neglected in
previous mean-field approaches, which are based on the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation (PB). The influence of the finite size of the ions seems to be quite
promising because it has been shown to predict phenomena like charge reversal,
which has been out of the scope of classical PB approximations. In this work we
numerically obtain the surface electric potential and the counterions
concentration profiles around a charged particle in a concentrated salt-free
suspension corrected by the finite size of the counterions. The results show
the large importance of such corrections for moderate to high particle charges
at every particle volume fraction, specially, when a region of closest approach
of the counterions to the particle surface is considered. We conclude that
finite ion size considerations are obeyed for the development of new
theoretical models to study nonequilibrium properties in concentrated colloidal
suspensions, particularly the salt-free ones with small and highly charged
particles.
