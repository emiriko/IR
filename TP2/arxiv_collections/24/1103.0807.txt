As an example of dynamically generated resonances we mention the interaction
of vector mesons with baryons within the local hidden gauge formalism which
gives rise to a large amount of such states, many of which can be associated to
known resonances, while others represent predictions for new resonances. The
width of these states coming from decay into pseudoscalar baryon is also
addressed. We also mention recent states coming from $\Delta \rho \pi$
interaction obtained with Faddeev equations.
