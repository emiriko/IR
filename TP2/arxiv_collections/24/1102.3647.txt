GW Notes was born from the need for a journal where the distinct communities
involved in gravitation wave research might gather. While these three
communities - astrophysics, general relativity and data analysis - have made
significant collaborative progress over recent years, we believe that it is
indispensable to future advancement that they draw closer, and that they speak
a common idiom. In this 6th GW Note (since we started numbering with #0), we
present the work of Jonathan Thornburg, who has been fully-refereed, on the
Capra research programme for capture of small compact objects by massive black
holes.
