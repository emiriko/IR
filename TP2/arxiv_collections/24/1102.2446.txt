Measuring the resistance fluctuations of gas sensors provides new
opportunities to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor. Taking
advantage of this possibility requires special low-noise measurement hardware
and software to acquire data and perform analysis. In this paper we will
present a small, USB-powered device capable of doing precise measurement of the
resistance fluctuations of different kinds of gas sensors. We have developed a
graphical user interface software to control the parameters of the measurement,
to collect data and perform real time analysis on the measured data. The
analysis is based on a PCA algorithm, which is proven to be a high performance
tool to support fluctuation enhanced sensing. The system has been tested on
Taguchi and carbon nanotube based gas sensors as well. The main advantages of
the system include the small form factor, low cost and the fully featured
software performing all required data analysis operations. Complemented with a
gas sensor and an optional test chamber, the setup can serve as an efficient
tool for practical fluctuation-enhanced gas sensing.
