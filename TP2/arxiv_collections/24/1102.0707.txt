In this paper, we have considered the generalized Ricci dark energy (GRDE)
and generalized holographic dark energy (GHDE) in the scenario of emergent
universe. Fractional energy density and deceleration parameters for GRDE were
derived under emergent universe scenario. Also role of GRDE on the Chameleon
field in the emergent universe scenario has been examined. Finally, the
behaviours of the Chameleon scalar field $\phi$, corresponding potential $V$
and associated function $f$ were investigated in presence of GRDE.
