We describe a novel integrated algorithm for real-time enhancement of video
acquired under challenging lighting conditions. Such conditions include low
lighting, haze, and high dynamic range situations. The algorithm automatically
detects the dominate source of impairment, then depending on whether it is low
lighting, haze or others, a corresponding pre-processing is applied to the
input video, followed by the core enhancement algorithm. Temporal and spatial
redundancies in the video input are utilized to facilitate real-time processing
and to improve temporal and spatial consistency of the output. The proposed
algorithm can be used as an independent module, or be integrated in either a
video encoder or a video decoder for further optimizations.
