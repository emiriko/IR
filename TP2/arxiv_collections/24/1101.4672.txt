We present the driven response at T=30mK of 6 GHz superconducting resonators
constructed from capacitively-shunted three dimensional (3D) aluminum
nanobridge superconducting quantum interference devices (nanoSQUIDs). We
observe flux modulation of the resonant frequency in quantitative agreement
with numerical calculation and characteristic of near-ideal short weak link
junctions. Under strong microwave excitation, we observe stable bifurcation in
devices with coupled quality factor (Q) ranging from ~30-3500. Near this bias
point, parametric amplification with > 20dB gain, 40 MHz bandwidth, and near
quantum-limited noise performance is observed. Our results indicate that 3D
nanobridge junctions are attractive circuit elements to realize quantum bits.
