A search for narrow resonances at high mass in the dimuon and dielectron
channels has been performed by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, using pp
collision data recorded at sqrt(s)=7 TeV. The event samples correspond to
integrated luminosities of 40 inverse picobarns in the dimuon channel and 35
inverse picobarns in the dielectron channel. Heavy dilepton resonances are
predicted in theoretical models with extra gauge bosons (Z') or as Kaluza-Klein
graviton excitations(G_KK) in the Randall-Sundrum model. Upper limits on the
inclusive cross section of Z'(G_KK) decaying to oppositely charged leptons
relative to Z decaying to oppositely charged leptons are presented. These
limits exclude at 95% confidence level a Z' with standard-model-like couplings
below 1140 GeV, the superstring-inspired Z_psi below 887 GeV, and, for values
of the coupling parameter k/M_Pl of 0.05 (0.1), Kaluza-Klein gravitons below
855 (1079) GeV.
