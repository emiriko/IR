We consider the magnetic flux in a quantum mechanical superposition of two
values and find that the Aharonov-Bohm effect interference pattern contains
information about the nature of the superposition, allowing information about
the state of the flux to be extracted without disturbance. The information is
obtained without transfer of energy or momentum and by accumulated nonlocal
interactions of the vector potential $\vec{A}$ with many charged particles
forming the interference pattern, rather than with a single particle. We
suggest an experimental test using already experimentally realized superposed
currents in a superconducting ring and discuss broader implications.
