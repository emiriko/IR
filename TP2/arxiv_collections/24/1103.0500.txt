The dynamics of a large number of liquids and polymers exhibit scaling
properties characteristic of a simple repulsive inverse power law (IPL)
potential, most notably the superpositioning of relaxation data as a function
of the variable TV{\gamma}, where T is temperature, V the specific volume, and
{\gamma} a material constant. A related scaling law, TmVm{\Gamma}, with the
same exponent {\Gamma}={\gamma}, links the melting temperature Tm and volume Vm
of the model IPL liquid; liquid dynamics is then invariant at the melting
point. Motivated by a similar invariance of dynamics experimentally observed at
transitions of liquid crystals, we determine dynamic and melting point scaling
exponents {\gamma} and {\Gamma} for a large number of non-associating liquids.
Rigid, spherical molecules containing no polar bonds have {\Gamma}={\gamma};
consequently, the reduced relaxation time, viscosity and diffusion coefficient
are each constant along the melting line. For other liquids {\gamma}>{\Gamma}
always; i.e., the dynamics is more sensitive to volume than is the melting
point, and for these liquids the dynamics at the melting point slows down with
increasing Tm (that is, increasing pressure).
