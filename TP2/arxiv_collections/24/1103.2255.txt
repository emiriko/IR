We report in the present talk recent results of the tensor properties of the
nucleon within the framework of the chiral quark-soliton model. The tensor and
anomalous tensor magnetic form factors are calculated for the momentum transfer
up to $Q^{2}\leq1\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$ and at a renormalization scale of
$0.36\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}$. The main results are summarized as follows: the
flavor tensor charges of the nucleon are yielded as $\delta u=1.08$, $\delta
d=-0.31$, $\delta s=-0.01$, while the up and down anomalous tensor magnetic
moments are evaluated as $\kappa_{T}^{u}=3.56$ and $\kappa_{T}^{d}=1.83$,
respectively. The strange anomalous tensor magnetic moment turns out to be
$\kappa_{T}^{s}=0.2\sim -0.2$, compatible with zero. We discuss their physical
implications, comparing them in particular with those from the lattice QCD.
