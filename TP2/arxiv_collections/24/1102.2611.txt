We present the measurement of non-photonic electron production at high
transverse momentum ($p_T > $ 2.5 GeV/$c$) in $p$ + $p$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV using data recorded during 2005 and 2008 by the STAR
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The measured
cross-sections from the two runs are consistent with each other despite a large
difference in photonic background levels due to different detector
configurations. We compare the measured non-photonic electron cross-sections
with previously published RHIC data and pQCD calculations. Using the relative
contributions of B and D mesons to non-photonic electrons, we determine the
integrated cross sections of electrons ($\frac{e^++e^-}{2}$) at 3 GeV/$c < p_T
<~$10 GeV/$c$ from bottom and charm meson decays to be ${d\sigma_{(B\to
e)+(B\to D \to e)} \over dy_e}|_{y_e=0}$ = 4.0$\pm0.5$({\rm
stat.})$\pm1.1$({\rm syst.}) nb and ${d\sigma_{D\to e} \over dy_e}|_{y_e=0}$ =
6.2$\pm0.7$({\rm stat.})$\pm1.5$({\rm syst.}) nb, respectively.
