In this study, the effect of bounded quantum memory in a primitive
information protocol has been examined using the quantum Kolmogorov complexity
as a measure of information. We employed a toy two-party protocol in which Bob
by using a bounded quantum memory and an unbounded classical memory estimates a
message that was encoded in qubits by Alice in one of the bases X or Z. Our
theorem gave a nontrivial effect of the memory boundedness. In addition, a
generalization of the uncertainty principle in the presence of quantum memory
has been obtained.
