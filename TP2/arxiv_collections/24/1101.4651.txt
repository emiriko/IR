We calculate quarkonium binding energies using a realistic complex-valued
potential for both an isotropic and anisotropic quark-gluon plasma. We
determine the disassociation temperatures of the ground and first excited
states considering both the real and imaginary parts of the binding energy. We
show that the effect of momentum-space anisotropy is smaller on the imaginary
part of the binding energy than on the real part of the binding energy. In the
case that one assumes an isotropic plasma, we find disassociation temperatures
for the J/psi, Upsilon and chi_b of 1.6 T_c, 2.8 T_c, and 1.5 T_c,
respectively. We find that a finite oblate momentum-space anisotropy increases
the disassociation temperature for all states considered and results in a
splitting of the p-wave states associated with the chi_b first excited state of
bottomonium.
