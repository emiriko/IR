Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the recently
discovered superconduc- tors in the KFe2Se2 family with critical temperatures
up to - 33K suggest that no Fermi pockets of hole character centered on the
{\Gamma} point of the Brillouin zone are present, in contrast to all other
known ferropnictide and ferrochalcogenide superconductors. Using a fluctuation
exchange approximation and a 5-orbital tight-binding description of the band
structure, we calculate the effective pairing interaction. We find that the
pairing state in this system is most likely to have d-wave symmetry due to pair
scattering between the remaining electron Fermi pockets at wave vector q -
({\pi}, {\pi}), but without any symmetry-imposed nodes for the given Fermi
surface. We propose experimental tests of this result, including the form of
the resonance spectrum probed by inelastic neutron scattering.
