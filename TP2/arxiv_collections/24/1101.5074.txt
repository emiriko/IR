We consider two heteronuclear atoms interacting with a short-range $\delta$
potential and confined in a ring trap. By taking the Bethe-ansatz-type
wavefunction and considering the periodic boundary condition properly, we
derive analytical solutions for the heteronuclear system. The eigen-energies
represented in terms of quasi-momentums can then be determined by solving a set
of coupled equations. We present a number of results, which display different
features from the case of identical atoms. Our result can be reduced to the
well-known Lieb-Liniger solution when two interacting atoms have the same
masses.
