We apply theoretically open-loop quantum optimal control techniques to
provide methods for the verification of various quantum coherent transport
mechanisms in natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes under realistic
experimental constraints. We demonstrate that optimally shaped laser pulses
allow to faithfully prepare the photosystem in specified initial states (such
as localized excitation or coherent superposition, i.e. propagating and
non-propagating states) and to probe efficiently the dynamics. These results
provide a path towards the discrimination of the different transport pathways
and to the characterization of environmental properties, enhancing our
understanding of the role that coherent processes may play in biological
complexes.
