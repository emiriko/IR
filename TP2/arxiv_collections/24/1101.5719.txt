The recent findings of gas giant planets around young A-type stars suggest
that disks surrounding Herbig Ae/Be stars will develop planetary systems. An
interesting case is HD142527, for which previous observations revealed a
complex circumstellar environment and an unusually high ratio of infrared to
stellar luminosity. Its properties differ considerably from other Herbig Ae/Be
stars. This suggests that the disk surrounding HD142527 is in an uncommon
evolutionary stage. We aim for a better understanding of the geometry and
evolutionary status of the circumstellar material around the Herbig Ae/Be star
HD142527. We map the composition and spatial distribution of the dust around
HD142527. We analyze SEST and ATCA millimeter data, VISIR N and Q-band imaging
and spectroscopy. We gather additional relevant data from the literature. We
use the radiative transfer code MCMax to construct a model of the geometry and
density structure of the circumstellar matter, which fits all of the
observables satisfactorily. We find that the disk of HD142527 has three
geometrically distinct components separated by a disk gap running from 30 to
130 AU. There is a geometrically flat inner disk running from 0.3 AU up to 30
AU; an optically thin halo-like component of dust in the inner disk regions;
and a massive self-shadowed outer disk running from 130 AU up to 200 AU. We
derived a total dust mass in small grains of 10^-3 M0 and a vertical height of
the inner wall of the outer disk of h = 60 AU. ....
