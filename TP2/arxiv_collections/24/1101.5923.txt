Based on light curves from the Swift Burst Analyser, we investigate whether a
`dip' feature commonly seen in the early-time hardness ratios of Swift-XRT data
could arise from the juxtaposition of the decaying prompt emission and rising
afterglow. We are able to model the dip as such a feature, assuming the
afterglow rises as predicted by Sari & Piran (1999). Using this model we
measure the initial bulk Lorentz factor of the fireball. For a sample of 23
GRBs we find a median value of Gamma_0=225, assuming a constant-density
circumburst medium; or Gamma_0=93 if we assume a wind-like medium.
