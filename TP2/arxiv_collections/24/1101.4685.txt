Correlations and the formation of bound states (nuclei) are essential for the
properties of nuclear matter in equilibrium as well as in nonequilibrium. In a
quantum statistical approach, quasiparticle energies are obtained for the light
elements that reflect the influence of the medium. We present analytical fits
for the quasiparticle energy shifts of light nuclei that can be used in various
applications. This is a prerequisite for the investigation of warm and dense
matter that reproduces the nuclear statistical equilibrium and virial
expansions in the low-density limit as well as relativistic mean field and
Brueckner Hartree-Fock approaches near saturation density.
