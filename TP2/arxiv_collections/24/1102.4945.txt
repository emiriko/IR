We predict the existence of a novel class of multidimensional light
localizations in out-of-equilibrium ferroelectric crystals. In two dimensions,
the non-diffracting beams form at arbitrary low power level and propagate even
when their width is well below the optical wavelength. In three dimensions, a
novel form of subwavelength light bullets is found. The effects emerge when
compositionally disordered crystals are brought to their metastable glassy
state, and can have a profound impact on super-resolved imaging and ultra-dense
optical storage, while resembling many features of the so-called metamaterials,
as the suppression of evanescent waves.
