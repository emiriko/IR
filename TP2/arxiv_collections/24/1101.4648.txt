We discuss various possibilities to constrain ICM turbulence in galaxy
clusters using bright X-ray lines. Numerical simulations are used to find the
most appropriate description of the 3D velocity field power spectrum (PDS) and
to calibrate the relation of observables to this PDS. The impact of the
velocity field on the surface brightness distribution and on the spectral shape
of strong X-ray lines, modified by the resonant scattering (RS), is evaluated
via radiative transfer calculations. We investigate the sensitivity of RS not
only to amplitudes of motions, but also to anisotropy and spatial scales. We in
particular show that the amplitude of radial motions is most important for RS,
while tangential motions only weakly affect the scattering.
