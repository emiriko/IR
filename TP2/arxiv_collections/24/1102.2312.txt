We explore a new direction in representation theory which comes from
holomorphic gerbes on complex tori. The analogue of the theta group of a
holomorphic line bundle on a (compact) complex torus is developed for gerbes in
place of line bundles. The theta group of symmetries of the gerbe has the
structure of a Picard groupoid. We calculate it explicitly as a central
extension of the group of symmetries of the gerbe by the Picard groupoid of the
underlying complex torus. We discuss obstruction to equivariance and give an
example of a group of symmetries of a gerbe with respect to which the gerbe
cannot be equivariant. We survey various types of representations of the group
of symmetries of a gerbe on the stack of sheaves of modules on the gerbe and
the associated abelian category of sheaves on the gerbe (twisted sheaves).
