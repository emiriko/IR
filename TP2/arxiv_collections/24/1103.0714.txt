In this article, a method is proposed to spatially scale up a trapped
ultracold gas while conserving the quantum correlations of the initial
many-body state. For systems supporting self-similar dynamics, this is achieved
by implementing a many-body finite-time frictionless quantum quench of the
harmonic trap which acts as a quantum dynamical microscope.
