The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has long been regarded as a key ingredient in
models attempting to explain powerful jets in AGNs, quasars, blazzars etc. In
such mechanism, energy is extracted from a rotating black hole and dissipated
at a load at far distances. In the current work we examine the behaviour of the
BZ mechanism with respect to different boundary conditions, revealing the
mechanism robustness upon variation of these conditions. Consequently, this
work closes a gap in our understanding of this important scenario.
