This paper concerns parameterized convex infinite (or semi-infinite)
inequality systems whose decision variables run over general
infinite-dimensional Banach (resp. finite-dimensional) spaces and that are
indexed by an arbitrary fixed set T . Parameter perturbations on the right-hand
side of the inequalities are measurable and bounded, and thus the natural
parameter space is $l_{\infty}(T)$. Based on advanced variational analysis, we
derive a precise formula for computing the exact Lipschitzian bound of the
feasible solution map, which involves only the system data, and then show that
this exact bound agrees with the coderivative norm of the aforementioned
mapping. On one hand, in this way we extend to the convex setting the results
of [4] developed in the linear framework under the boundedness assumption on
the system coefficients. On the other hand, in the case when the decision space
is reflexive, we succeed to remove this boundedness assumption in the general
convex case, establishing therefore results new even for linear infinite and
semi-infinite systems. The last part of the paper provides verifiable necessary
optimality conditions for infinite and semi-infinite programs with convex
inequality constraints and general nonsmooth and nonconvex objectives. In this
way we extend the corresponding results of [5] obtained for programs with
linear infinite inequality constraints.
