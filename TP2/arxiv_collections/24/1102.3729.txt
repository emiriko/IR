A flavour symmetry based on Z_4 is analysed in the context of SU(5) Grand
Unification with the standard fermionic content plus three right-handed
neutrinos. The role of Z_4 is to forbid some Yukawa couplings of up- and
down-quarks to Higgs scalars such that the quark mass matrices M_u, M_d have
Nearest-Neighbour-Interaction (NNI) structure, once they are generated through
the electroweak symmetry breaking. It turns out in this framework that Z_4 is
indeed the minimal discrete symmetry and its implementation requires the
introduction of at least two Higgs quintets, which leads to a two Higgs doublet
model at low energy scale. Due to the SU(5) unification, it is shown that the
charged lepton mass matrix develops also NNI form. However, the effective
neutrino mass matrix exhibits a non parallel pattern, in the framework of the
type-I seesaw mechanism. Analysing all possible zero textures allowed by
gauge-horizontal symmetry SU(5) x Z_4, it is seen that only two patterns are in
agreement with the leptonic experimental data and they could be further
distinguished by the light neutrino mass spectrum hierarchy. It is also
demonstrated that Z_4 freezes out the possibility of proton decay through
exchange of colour Higgs triplets at tree-level.
