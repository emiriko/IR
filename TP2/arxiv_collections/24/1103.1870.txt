We study ground states of a hybrid system consisting of a polymer and an
attractive nanowire by means of computer simulations. Depending on structural
and energetic properties of the substrate, we find different adsorbed polymer
conformations, amongst which are spherical droplets attached to the wire and
monolayer tubes surrounding it. We construct the complete conformational phase
diagram and analyze in more detail particularly interesting polymer-tube
conformations.
