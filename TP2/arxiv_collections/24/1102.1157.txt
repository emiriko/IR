The distinction between chaotic and regular behavior of orbits in galactic
models is an important issue and can help our understanding of galactic
dynamical evolution. In this paper, we deal with this issue by applying the
techniques of the Smaller (and Generalized) ALingment Indices, SALI (and GALI),
to extensive samples of orbits obtained by integrating numerically the
equations of motion in a barred galaxy potential. We estimate first the
fraction of chaotic and regular orbits for the two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) case
(where the galaxy extends only in the (x,y)-space) and show that it is a
non-monotonic function of the energy. For the three DOF extension of this model
(in the z-direction), we give similar estimates, both by exploring different
sets of initial conditions and by varying the model parameters, like the mass,
size and pattern speed of the bar. We find that regular motion is more abundant
at small radial distances from the center of the galaxy, where the relative
non-axisymmetric forcing is relatively weak, and at small distances from the
equatorial plane, where trapping around the stable periodic orbits is
important. We also find that the variation of the bar pattern speed, within a
realistic range of values, does not affect much the phase space's fraction of
regular and chaotic motions. Using different sets of initial conditions, we
show that chaotic motion is dominant in galaxy models whose bar component is
more massive, while models with a fatter or thicker bar present generally more
regular behavior. Finally, we find that the fraction of orbits that are chaotic
correlates strongly with the bar strength.
