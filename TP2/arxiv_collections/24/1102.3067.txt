Network theory provides various tools for investigating the structural or
functional topology of many complex systems found in nature, technology and
society. Nevertheless, it has recently been realised that a considerable number
of systems of interest should be treated, more appropriately, as interacting
networks or networks of networks. Here we introduce a novel graph-theoretical
framework for studying the interaction structure between subnetworks embedded
within a complex network of networks. This framework allows us to quantify the
structural role of single vertices or whole subnetworks with respect to the
interaction of a pair of subnetworks on local, mesoscopic and global
topological scales.
  Climate networks have recently been shown to be a powerful tool for the
analysis of climatological data. Applying the general framework for studying
interacting networks, we introduce coupled climate subnetworks to represent and
investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of
distinct climatological variables. Using coupled climate subnetworks to
investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height
field uncovers known as well as interesting novel features of the atmosphere's
vertical stratification and general circulation. Specifically, the new measure
"cross-betweenness" identifies regions which are particularly important for
mediating vertical wind field interactions. The promising results obtained by
following the coupled climate subnetwork approach present a first step towards
an improved understanding of the Earth system and its complex interacting
components from a network perspective.
