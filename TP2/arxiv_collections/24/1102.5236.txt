Electrotarnsport and magnetic properties of new phases in the system Cr-GaSb
were studied. The samples were prepared by high-pressure (P=6-8 GPa)
high-temperature treatment and identified by x-ray diffraction and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). One of the CrGa$_2$Sb$_2$ phases with an
orthorhombic structure $Iba2$ has a combination of ferromagnetic and
semiconductor properties and is potentially promising for spintronic
applications. Another high-temperature phase is paramagnetic and identified as
tetragonal $I4/mcm$.
