The maximal $U(1)_L$ supersymmetric inverse seesaw mechanism (M$L$SIS)
provides a natural way to relate asymmetric dark matter (ADM) with neutrino
physics. In this paper we point out that, M$L$SIS is a natural outcome if one
dynamically realizes the inverse seesaw mechanism in the next-to minimal
supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) via the dimension-five operator
$(N)^2S^2/M_*$, with $S$ the NMSSM singlet developing TeV scale VEV; it
slightly violates lepton number due to the suppression by the fundamental scale
$M_*$, thus preserving $U(1)_L$ maximally. The resulting sneutrino is a
distinguishable ADM candidate, oscillating and favored to have weak scale mass.
A fairly large annihilating cross section of such a heavy ADM is available due
to the presence of singlet.
