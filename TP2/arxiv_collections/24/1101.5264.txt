We have investigated the role of momentum dependent s-wave and higher partial
wave strong interactions to determine the ground state properties and the
column densities in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for large scattering
length (a) such that ka >>1 even for small values of momentum where the
momentum p=(h/2pi)k and k is the wave number. Since the scattering length is
large we have included the first correction (Lee-Huang-Yang correction) both
for the k-dependent (s-wave + higher partial wave) interactions and
k-independent contact interactions (s-wave). We have derived the
time-independent equations from the corresponding energy functionals and found
that the ground state properties and the column densities differ significantly
for these two types of interactions even for moderate values of scattering
length (a = 3000 a_0) in BEC of cylindrically trapped 85Rb atoms at 100 nK. The
effect of higher partial wave (d-wave) increases with increase in a and it is >
20% for peak density at a= 8700 a_0 which can be experimentally detected.
Dependence of column density on particle number density has been studied.
Column densities have been compared with experimental results.
