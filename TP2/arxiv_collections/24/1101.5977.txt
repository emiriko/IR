The LHC machine at CERN finished its first year of pp collisions at a center
of mass energy of 7 TeV. While the commissioning to exploit its full potential
is still ongoing, there are plans to upgrade its components to reach
instantaneous luminosities beyond the initial design value after 2016. A
corresponding upgrade of the innermost part of the CMS detector, the pixel
detector, is needed. A full replacement of the pixel detector is planned in
2016. It will not only address limitations of the present system at higher data
rates, but will aggressively lower the amount of material inside the fiducial
tracking volume which will lead to better tracking and b-tagging performance.
This article gives an overview of the project and illuminates the motivations
and expected improvements in the detector performance.
