The extremality of Gaussian states is exploited to show that Gaussian states
are the most robust, among all possible bipartite continuous-variable states at
fixed energy, against disentanglement due to noisy evolutions in Markovian
Gaussian channels involving dissipation and thermal hopping. This proves a
conjecture raised recently in [M. Allegra, P. Giorda, and M. G. A. Paris, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 105}, 100503 (2010)], providing a rigorous validation of the
conclusions of that work. The problem of identifying continuous variable states
with maximum resilience to entanglement damping in more general bosonic open
system dynamical evolutions, possibly including correlated noise and
non-Markovian effects, remains open.
