A previously constructed transport approach to calculate the evolution of
quarkonium yields and spectra in heavy-ion collisions is applied to
Pb-Pb($\sqrt{s}$=2.76\,ATeV) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In
this approach spectral properties of charmonia are constrained by euclidean
correlators from thermal lattice QCD and subsequently implemented into a
Boltzmann equation accounting for both suppression and regeneration reactions.
Based on a fair description of SPS and RHIC data, we provide predictions for
the centrality dependence of $J/\psi$ yields at LHC. The main uncertainty is
associated with the input charm cross section, in particular its hitherto
unknown reduction due to shadowing in nuclear collisions. Incomplete
charm-quark thermalization and non-equilibrium in charmonium chemistry entail a
marked reduction of the regeneration yield compared to the statistical
equilibrium limit.
