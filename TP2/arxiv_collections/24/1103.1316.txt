Using the SU(5) symmetry of the 4D hyperdiamond and results on the study of
4D graphene given in "Four Dimensional Graphene" (L.B Drissi, E.H Saidi, M.
Bousmina, CPM-11-01, Phys. Rev. D (2011)), we engineer a class of 4D lattice
QCD fermions whose Dirac operators have two zero modes. We show that generally
the zero modes of the Dirac operator in hyperdiamond fermions are captured by a
tensor {\Omega}_{{\mu}}^{l} with 4\times5 complex components linking the
Euclidean SO(4) vector {\mu}; and the 5-dimensional representation of SU(5).
The Bori\c{c}i-Creutz (BC) and the Karsten-Wilzeck (KW) models as well as their
Dirac zero modes are rederived as particular realizations of
{\Omega}_{{\mu}}^{l}. Other features are also given. Keywords: Lattice QCD,
Bori\c{c}i-Creutz and Karsten-Wilzeck models, 4D hyperdiamond, 4D graphene,
