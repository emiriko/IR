Kudekar et al. proved that the belief-propagation (BP) threshold for
low-density parity-check codes can be boosted up to the maximum-a-posteriori
(MAP) threshold by spatial coupling. In this paper, spatial coupling is applied
to randomly-spread code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems in order to
improve the performance of BP-based multiuser detection (MUD).
Spatially-coupled CDMA systems can be regarded as multi-code CDMA systems with
two transmission phases. The large-system analysis shows that spatial coupling
can improve the BP performance, while there is a gap between the BP performance
and the individually-optimal (IO) performance.
