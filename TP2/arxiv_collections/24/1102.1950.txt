We study existence of random elements with partially specified distributions.
The technique relies on the existence of a positive extension for linear
functionals accompanied by additional conditions that ensure the regularity of
the extension needed for interpreting it as a probability measure. It is shown
in which case the extension can be chosen to possess some invariance
properties. The results are applied to the existence of point processes with
given correlation measure and random closed sets with given two-point covering
function or contact distribution function. It is shown that the regularity
condition can be efficiently checked in many cases in order to ensure that the
obtained point processes are indeed locally finite and random sets have closed
realisations.
