Bulk water presents a large number of crystalline and amorphous ices.
Hydrophobic nanoconfinement is known to affect the tendency of water to form
ice and to reduce the melting temperature. However, a systematic study of the
ice phases in nanoconfinement is hampered by the computational cost of
simulations at very low temperatures. Here we develop a coarse-grained model
for a water monolayer in hydrophobic nanoconfinement and study the formation of
ice by Mote Carlo simulations. We find two ice phases: low-density-crystal ice
at low pressure and high-density hexatic ice at high pressure, an intermediate
phase between liquid and high-density-crystal ice.
