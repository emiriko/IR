convene economic and ecologic framework to establish a market attentive to
drastic reduction of emissions damaging our climate and landscapes in rural
areas, to the protection of biological diversity of the planet, to stop

a waste recycling economy that will provide new jobs, will create economic and
social stability and will ensure a healthier and cleaner environment. Green
Economy and its support system (planetary ecosystem) won't be in conflict
anymore. Green Economy will be able to support economic progress for future.
