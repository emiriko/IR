We revisit the question whether the running-mass inflation model allows the
formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) that are sufficiently long-lived to
serve as candidates for Dark Matter. We incorporate recent cosmological data,
including the WMAP 7-year results. Moreover, we include "the running of the
running" of the spectral index of the power spectrum, as well as the
renormalization group "running of the running" of the inflaton mass term. Our
analysis indicates that formation of sufficiently heavy, and hence long-lived,
PBHs still remains possible in this scenario. As a by-product, we show that the
additional term in the inflaton potential still does not allow significant
negative running of the spectral index.
