In this experiment we aim to look for keV-mass bosons emitted from the Sun,
by looking at a process analogous to the photoelectric/Compton effect inside
the HPGe detector. Their coupling to both electrons and nucleons is assumed.
For masses above 25 keV, the mass dependence of our limit on the
scalar-electron coupling reveals a constraint which proves stronger than that
obtained recently and based on the very good agreement between the measured and
predicted solar neutrino flux from the ^{8}B reaction. On the other hand, the
mass dependence of our limit on the scalar-proton/electron coupling together
entails a limit on a possible Yukawa addition to the gravitational inverse
square low. Such a constraint on the Yukawa interactions proves much stronger
than that derived from the latest AFM Casimir force measurement.
