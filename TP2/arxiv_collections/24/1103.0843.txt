We study the asymptotic performance of two multi-hop overlaid ad-hoc networks
that utilize the same temporal, spectral, and spatial resources based on random
access schemes. The primary network consists of Poisson distributed legacy
users with density \lambda^{(p)} and the secondary network consists of Poisson
distributed cognitive radio users with density \lambda^{(s)} =
(\lambda^{(p)})^{\beta} (\beta>0, \beta \neq 1) that utilize the spectrum
opportunistically. Both networks are decentralized and employ ALOHA medium
access protocols where the secondary nodes are additionally equipped with
range-limited perfect spectrum sensors to monitor and protect primary
transmissions. We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely \beta>1 and
0<\beta<1. We show that in both cases, the two networks can achieve their
corresponding stand-alone throughput scaling even without secondary spectrum
sensing (i.e., the sensing range set to zero); this implies the need for a more
comprehensive performance metric than just throughput scaling to evaluate the
influence of the overlaid interactions. We thus introduce a new criterion,
termed the asymptotic multiplexing gain, which captures the effect of
inter-network interferences with different spectrum sensing setups. With this
metric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve
primary network performance when \beta>1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing
turns out to be unnecessary when \beta<1 and setting the secondary network's
ALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network
performance.
