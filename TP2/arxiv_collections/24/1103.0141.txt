The first public release of long-cadence stellar photometric data collected
by the NASA Kepler mission has now been made available. In this paper we
characterise the red-giant (G-K) stars in this large sample in terms of their
solar-like oscillations. We use published methods and well-known scaling
relations in the analysis. Just over 70% of the red giants in the sample show
detectable solar-like oscillations, and from these oscillations we are able to
estimate the fundamental properties of the stars. This asteroseismic analysis
reveals different populations: low-luminosity H-shell burning red-giant branch
stars, cool high-luminosity red giants on the red-giant branch and He-core
burning clump and secondary-clump giants.
