In this paper, we study the equations of motion for non-Abelian N=(2,0)
tensor multiplets in six dimensions, which were recently proposed by Lambert
and Papageorgakis. Some equations are regarded as constraint equations. We
employ a loop extension of the Lorentzian three-algebra (3-algebra) and examine
the equations of motion around various solutions of the constraint equations.
The resultant equations take forms that allow Lagrangian descriptions. We find
various (5+d)-dimensional Lagrangians and investigate the relation between them
from the viewpoint of M-theory duality.
