The transport coefficients of the Anderson model require knowledge of both
the temperature and frequency dependence of the single--particle spectral
densities and consequently have proven difficult quantities to calculate. Here
we show how these quantities can be calculated via an extension of Wilson's
numerical renormalization group method. Accurate results are obtained in all
parameter regimes and for the full range of temperatures of interest ranging
from the high temperature perturbative regime $T>>T_{K}$, through the
cross--over region $T\approx T_{K}$, and into the low temperature strong
coupling regime $T<<T_{K}$. The Fermi liquid relations for the $T^2$
coefficient of the resistivity and the linear coefficient of the thermopower
are satisfied to a high degree of accuracy. The techniques used here provide a
new highly accurate approach to strongly correlated electrons in high
dimensions.
