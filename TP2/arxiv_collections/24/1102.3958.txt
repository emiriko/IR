In the present study, we have simulated the central reactions of nearly
symmetric and asymmetric systems over the entire periodic table for different
values of energies using QMD model as event generator. These reactions are
simulated for the different equations of state, nn cross-sections and different
widths of Gaussians. We have observed that the multiplicity of IMFs shows a
rise and fall with increase in beam energy in the center-of-mass frame as
already predicted experimentally/theoretically. We have also studied the mass
dependence of peak Ec.m. and peak <NIMF>. It has been observed that peak Ec.m.
increases linearly with system mass whereas a power law dependence has been
observed for peak IMFs with tau \approx 1.0. Our calculations using hard EoS
along with cugnon cross-section and MSTB method are in good agreement with
experimental data. Similar power law dependence is also observed for various
fragments.
