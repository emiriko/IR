A basic finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ is
isomorphic to a quotient of a tensor algebra by an admissible ideal. The
category of left modules over the algebra is isomorphic to the category of
representations of a finite quiver with relations. In this article we will
remove the assumption that $k$ is algebraically closed to look at both perfect
and non-perfect fields. We will introduce the notion of species with relations
to describe the category of left modules over such algebras. If the field is
not perfect, then the algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of a tensor algebra
by an ideal that is no longer admissible in general. This gives hereditary
algebras isomorphic to a quotient of a tensor algebra by a non-zero ideal. We
will show that these non-zero ideals correspond to cyclic subgraphs of the
graph associated to the species of the algebra. This will lead to the ideal
being zero in the case when the underlying graph of the algebra is a tree.
