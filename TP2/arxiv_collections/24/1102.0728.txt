We give a sufficient condition on nonlinearities of an SDE on a compact
connected Riemannian manifold $M$ which implies that laws of all solutions
converge weakly to the normalized Riemannian volume measure on $M$. This result
is further applied to characterize invariant and ergodic measures for various
SDEs on manifolds.
