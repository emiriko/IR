The conventional understanding that a bandstructure that produces a Dirac
delta function transport distribution (or transmission in the Landauer
framework) maximizes the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, is revisited.
Thermoelectric (TE) performance is evaluated using a simple tight binding (TB)
model for electron dispersion and three different scattering models: 1) a
constant scattering time, 2) a constant mean-free-path, and 3) a scattering
rate proportional to the density-of-states. We found that a Dirac
delta-function transmission never produces the maximum ZT. The best
bandstructure for maximizing ZT depends on the scattering physics. These
results demonstrate that the selection of bandstructure to maximize TE
performance is more complex than previously thought and that a high
density-of-states near the band edge does not necessarily improve TE
performance.
