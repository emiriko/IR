We study a subset of electroweak-precision observables consisting of $M_W$,
$\sin^2\theta_{{\tiny eff}}^{\tau}$, $BR(Z\to\tau^+\tau^-)$ and
$\Gamma(Z\to\tau^+\tau^-)/\Gamma(Z\to e^+e^-)-1$ (characterizing leptonic
$Z$-decays) in the context of the NMSSM. After a brief review of common
MSSM-NMSSM effects, e.g. for $\Gamma(Z\to\tau^+\tau^-)/\Gamma(Z\to e^+e^-)-1$,
which has been little discussed, even in the MSSM), specific NMSSM scenarios
are studied, with the result that the NMSSM, considering existing constraints
on its spectrum, is essentially consistent with available measurements, given
the current accuracy.
