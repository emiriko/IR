A solid-state organic thin-film laser with intracavity frequency doubling is
reported. Tunable ultraviolet emission from 309 to 322 nm is achieved from a
vertical external cavity surface-emitting organic laser, with 2 % efficiency (1
$\mu$J at 315 nm). The laser comprises a polymethyl(methacrylate) layer doped
with Rhodamine 640, spun-cast onto a plane mirror, a remote concave mirror, a
nonlinear crystal and a dichroic separator. The output is spectrally narrow
(<0.5 nm FWHM) and tunable through phase-matching selection of the fundamental
radiation lasing modes. These results highlight a low-cost and portable
alternative to tunable UV laser sources, useful for spectroscopic applications.
