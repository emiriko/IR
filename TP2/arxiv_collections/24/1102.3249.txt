We investigate the 70 um Far-Infrared Radio Correlation (FRC) of star-forming
galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) out to z > 2. We use
70 um data from the Far-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (FIDEL),
which comprises the most sensitive (~0.8 mJy rms) and extensive far-infrared
deep field observations using MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope, and 1.4 GHz
radio data (~8 uJy/beam rms) from the VLA. In order to quantify the evolution
of the FRC we use both survival analysis and stacking techniques which we find
give similar results. We also calculate the FRC using total infrared luminosity
and rest-frame radio luminosity, qTIR, and find that qTIR is constant (within
0.22) over the redshift range 0 - 2. We see no evidence for evolution in the
FRC at 70 um which is surprising given the many factors that are expected to
change this ratio at high redshifts.
