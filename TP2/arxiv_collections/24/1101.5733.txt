The key properties of the wave propagation theory in the magntosphere of
radio pulsars based on the Kravtsov-Orlov equation are presented. It is shown
that for radio pulsars with known circular polarization and the swing of the
linear polarization position angle one can determine which mode, ordinary or
extraordinary one, forms mainly the mean profile of the radio emission. The
comparison of the observational data with the theory predictions demonstrates
their good agreement.
