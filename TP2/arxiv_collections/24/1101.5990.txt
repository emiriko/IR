Given a compact, $m$-dimensional Riemann manifold $(M,g)$ and a large
positive constant $L$ we denote by $U_L$ the subspace of $C^\infty(M)$ spanned
by the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian corresponding to eigenvalues $\leq L$.
We equip $U_L$ with the standard Gaussian probability measure induced by the
$L^2$-metric on $U_L$, and we denote by $N_L$ the expected number of critical
points of a random function in $U_L$. We prove that $N_L\sim C_m\dim U_L$ as
$L\rightarrow \infty$, where $C_m$ is an explicit positive constant that
depends only on the dimension $m$ and satisfying the asymptotic estimate $\log
C_m\sim\frac{m}{2}\log m$ as $m\to \infty$.
