A sessile liquid drop can deform the substrate on which it rests if the solid
is sufficiently "soft". In this paper we compute the detailed spatial structure
of the capillary forces exerted by the drop on the solid substrate using a
model based on Density Functional Theory. We show that, in addition to the
normal forces, the drop exerts a previously unaccounted tangential force. The
resultant effect on the solid is a pulling force near the contact line directed
towards the interior of the drop, i.e. not along the interface. The resulting
elastic deformations of the solid are worked out and illustrate the importance
of the tangential forces.
