Contemporary use of the term 'intension' derives from the traditional logical
Frege-Russell's doctrine that an idea (logic formula) has both an extension and
an intension. From the Montague's point of view, the meaning of an idea can be
considered as particular extensions in different possible worlds. In this paper
we analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL
language, by unification of different views: Tarskian extensional semantics of
the FOL, modal interpretation of quantifiers, and a derivation of the Tarskian
theory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning
relation. We show that not all modal predicate logics are intensional, and that
an equivalent modal Kripke's interpretation of logic quantifiers in FOL results
in a particular pure extensional modal predicate logic (as is the standard
Tarskian semantics of the FOL). This minimal intensional enrichment is obtained
by adopting the theory of properties, relations and propositions (PRP) as the
universe or domain of the FOL, composed by particulars and universals (or
concepts), with the two-step interpretation of the FOL that eliminates the weak
points of the Montague's intensional semantics. Differently from the Bealer's
intensional FOL, we show that it is not necessary the introduction of the
intensional abstraction in order to obtain the full intensional properties of
the FOL. Final result of this paper is represented by the commutative
homomorphic diagram that holds in each given possible world of this new
intensional FOL, from the free algebra of the FOL syntax, toward its
intensional algebra of concepts, and, successively, to the new extensional
relational algebra (different from Cylindric algebras), and we show that it
corresponds to the Tarski's interpretation of the standard extensional FOL in
this possible world.
