A fundamental result of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel states that on flag
varieties and related spaces, a certain modified version of the category of
l-adic perverse sheaves exhibits a phenomenon known as Koszul duality. The
modification essentially consists of discarding objects whose stalks carry a
nonsemisimple action of Frobenius. In this paper, we prove that a number of
common sheaf functors (various pull-backs and push-forwards) induce
corresponding functors on the modified category or its triangulated analogue.
In particular, we show that these functors preserve semisimplicity of the
Frobenius action.
