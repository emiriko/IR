We investigate photon production in a scenario of quark-gluon plasma
formation in proton-proton scattering at 7 TeV. It is shown that thermal photon
yields increase quadratically with the charged particle multiplicity. This
gives an enhanced weight to high multiplicity events, and leads to an important
photon production even in minimum bias events, where the thermal photons
largely dominate over the prompt ones at transverse momentum values smaller
than 10 GeV/c.
