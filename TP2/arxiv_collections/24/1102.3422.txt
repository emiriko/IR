The surface pattern formation on a gelation surface is analyzed using an
effective surface roughness. The spontaneous surface deformation on
DiMethylAcrylAmide (DMAA) gelation surface is controlled by temperature,
initiator concentration, and ambient oxygen. The effective surface roughness is
defined using 2-dimensional photo data to characterize the surface deformation.
Parameter dependence of the effective surface roughness is systematically
investigated. We find that decrease of ambient oxygen, increase of initiator
concentration, and high temperature tend to suppress the surface deformation in
almost similar manner. That trend allows us to collapse all the data to a
unified master curve. As a result, we finally obtain an empirical scaling form
of the effective surface roughness. This scaling is useful to control the
degree of surface patterning. However, the actual dynamics of this pattern
formation is not still uncovered.
