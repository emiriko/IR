Few-particle dynamics in a three-well potential are investigated numerically.
It is shown that periodically shaking the potential can considerably increase
the fidelity of emerging spatial quantum superpositions. Such NOON-states are
important for quantum interferometry. If the two particles initially sit in the
middle well, the probability to return to this state can distinguish pure
quantum dynamics from statistical mixtures. The numeric implementation of
decoherence via particle losses shows clear differences from the pure quantum
behaviour. A three-well lattice could be an ideal system for experimental
realisations.
