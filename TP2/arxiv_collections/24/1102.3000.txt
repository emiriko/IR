We investigate the Josephson effect for a setup with two lattice quantum
wires featuring Majorana zero energy boundary modes at the tunnel junction. In
the weak-coupling, the exact solution reproduces the perturbative result for
the energy containing a contribution $\sim \pm\cos(\phi/2)$ relative to the
tunneling of paired Majorana fermions. As the tunnel amplitude $g$ grows
relative to the hopping amplitude $w$, the gap between the energy levels
gradually diminishes until it closes completely at the critical value
$g_c=\sqrt{2}w$. At this point the Josephson energies have the principal values
$E_{m\sigma}=2\sigma\sqrt{2}w\cos[\phi/6+2\pi (m-1)/3]$, where $m=-1,0,1$ and
$\sigma=\pm 1$, a result not following from perturbation theory. It represents
a transparent regime where three Bogoliubov states merge, leading to additional
degeneracies of the topologically nontrivial ground state with odd number of
Majorana fermions at the end of each wire. We also obtain the exact tunnel
currents for a fixed parity of the eigenstates. The Josephson current shows the
characteristic $4\pi$ periodicity expected for a topological Josephson effect.
We discuss the additional features of the current associated with a closure of
the energy gap between the energy levels.
