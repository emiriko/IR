Magnetic properties of Fe, Co, and Ni at finite temperatures have been
investigated on the basis of the first-principles dynamical CPA (Coherent
Potential Approximation) combined with the LDA (Local Density Approximation) +
$U$ Hamiltonian in the Tight-Binding Linear Muffintin Orbital (TB-LMTO)
representation. The Hamiltonian includes the transverse spin fluctuation terms.
Numerical calculations have been performed within the harmonic approximation
with 4th-order dynamical corrections. Calculated single-particle densities of
states in the ferromagnetic state indicate that the dynamical effects reduce
the exchange splitting, suppress the band width of the quasi-particle state,
and causes incoherent excitations corresponding the 6 eV satellites. Results of
the magnetization vs temperature curves, paramagnetic spin susceptibilities,
and the amplitudes of local moments are presented. Calculated Curie
temperatures ($T_{\rm C}$) are reported to be 1930K for Fe, 2550K for Co, and
620K for Ni; $T_{\rm C}$ for Fe and Co are overestimated by a factor of 1.8,
while $T_{\rm C}$ in Ni agrees with the experimental result. Effective Bohr
magneton numbers calculated from the inverse susceptibilities are 3.0 $\mu_{\rm
B}$ (Fe), 3.0 $\mu_{\rm B}$ (Co), and 1.6 $\mu_{\rm B}$ (Ni), being in
agreement with the experimental ones. Overestimate of $T_{\rm C}$ in Fe and Co
is attributed to the neglects of the higher-order dynamical effects as well as
the magnetic short range order.
