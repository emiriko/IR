In this paper we define and study a ring associated to a graph that we call
the cographic toric face ring, or simply the cographic ring. The cographic ring
is the toric face ring defined by the following equivalent combinatorial
structures of a graph: the cographic arrangement of hyperplanes, the Voronoi
polytope, and the poset of totally cyclic orientations. We describe the
properties of the cographic ring and, in particular, relate the invariants of
the ring to the invariants of the corresponding graph. Our study of the
cographic ring fits into a body of work on describing rings constructed from
graphs. Among the rings that can be constructed from a graph, cographic rings
are particularly interesting because they appear in the study of compactified
Jacobians of nodal curves.
