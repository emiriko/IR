Near-field electromagnetic heat transfer holds great potential for the
advancement of nanotechnology. Whereas far-field electromagnetic heat transfer
is constrained by Planck's blackbody limit, the increased density of states in
the near-field enhances heat transfer rates by orders of magnitude relative to
the conventional limit. Such enhancement opens new possibilities in numerous
applications, including thermal-photo-voltaics, nano-patterning, and imaging.
The advancement in this area, however, has been hampered by the lack of
rigorous theoretical treatment, especially for geometries that are of direct
experimental relevance. Here we introduce an efficient computational strategy,
and present the first rigorous calculation of electromagnetic heat transfer in
a sphere-plate geometry, the only geometry where transfer rate beyond blackbody
limit has been quantitatively probed at room temperature. Our approach results
in a definitive picture unifying various approximations previously used to
treat this problem, and provides new physical insights for designing
experiments aiming to explore enhanced thermal transfer.
