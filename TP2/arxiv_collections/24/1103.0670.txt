Under certain conditions an electron bound in a fast projectile-ion,
colliding with a molecule, interacts mainly with the nuclei and inner shell
electrons of atoms forming the molecule. Due to their compact localization in
space and distinct separation from each other these molecular centers play in
such collisions a role similar to that of optical slits in light scattering
leading to pronounced interference in the spectra of the electron emitted from
the projectile.
