The matter density is an important knowledge for today cosmology as many
phenomena are linked to matter fluctuations. However, this density is not
directly available, but estimated through lensing maps or galaxy surveys. In
this article, we focus on galaxy surveys which are incomplete and noisy
observations of the galaxy density. Incomplete, as part of the sky is
unobserved or unreliable. Noisy as they are count maps degraded by Poisson
noise. Using a data augmentation method, we propose a two-step method for
recovering the density map, one step for inferring missing data and one for
estimating of the density. The results show that the missing areas are
efficiently inferred and the statistical properties of the maps are very well
preserved.
