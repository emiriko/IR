The weak-field approximation is one of the simplest models that allows us to
relate the observed polarization induced by the Zeeman effect with the magnetic
field vector present on the plasma of interest. It is usually applied for
diagnosing magnetic fields in the solar and stellar atmospheres. A fully
Bayesian approach to the inference of magnetic properties in unresolved
structures is presented. The analytical expression for the marginal posterior
distribution is obtained, from which we can obtain statistically relevant
information about the model parameters. The role of a-priori information is
discussed and a hierarchical procedure is presented that gives robust results
that are almost insensitive to the precise election of the prior. The strength
of the formalism is demonstrated through an application to IMaX data. Bayesian
methods can optimally exploit data from filter-polarimeters given the scarcity
of spectral information as compared with spectro-polarimeters. The effect of
noise and how it degrades our ability to extract information from the Stokes
profiles is analyzed in detail.
