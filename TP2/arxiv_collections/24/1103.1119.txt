The intention of this course is to provide guidance and tools necessary to
carry out an analytical design of a simple accelerator magnet. Basic concepts
and magnet types will be explained as well as important aspects which should be
considered before starting the actual design phase. The central part of this
course is dedicated to describing how to develop a basic magnet design.
Subjects like the layout of the magnetic circuit, the excitation coils, and the
cooling circuits will be discussed. A short introduction to materials for the
yoke and coil construction and a brief summary about cost estimates for magnets
will complete this topic.
