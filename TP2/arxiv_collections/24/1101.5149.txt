We investigate the emission properties that a large-scale helical magnetic
field imprints on AGN jet synchrotron radiation. A cylindrically symmetric
relativistic jet and large-scale helical magnetic field produce significant
asymmetrical features in transverse profiles of fractional linear polarization,
intensity, Faraday rotation, and spectral index. The asymmetrical features of
these transverse profiles correlate with one another in ways specified by the
handedness of the helical field, the jet viewing angle (theta_ob), and the bulk
Lorentz factor of the flow (Gamma). Thus, these correlations may be used to
determine the structure of the magnetic field in the jet. In the case of radio
galaxies (theta_ob~1 radian) and a subclass of blazars with particularly small
viewing angles (theta_ob << 1/Gamma), we find an edge-brightened intensity
profile that is similar to that observed in the radio galaxy M87. We present
observations of the AGNs 3C 78 and NRAO 140 that display the type of transverse
asymmetries that may be produced by large-scale helical magnetic fields.
