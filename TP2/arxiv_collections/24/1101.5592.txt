Loop quantum gravity and cosmology are reviewed with an emphasis on
evaluating the dynamics, rather than constructing it. The three crucial parts
of such an analysis are (i) deriving effective equations, (ii) controlling the
theory's microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to its spatial discreteness
and refinement, and (iii) ensuring consistency and anomaly-freedom. All three
issues are crucial for making the theory testable by conceptual and
observational means, and they remain challenging. Throughout this review, the
Hamiltonian nature of the theory will play a large role for properties of
space-time structure within the framework discussed.
