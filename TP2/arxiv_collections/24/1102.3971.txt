The immune system is a highly parallel and distributed intelligent system
which has learning, memory, and associative capabilities. Artificial Immune
System is an evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the
immune system of mammals. The immune system can inspire to form new algorithms
learning from its course of action. The human immune system has motivated
scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms
that has solved complex engineering problems. This work is the result of an
attempt to explore a different perspective of the immune system namely the
Immune Privileged Site (IPS) which has the ability to make an exception to
different parts of the body by not triggering immune response to some of the
foreign agent in these parts of the body. While the complete system is secured
by an Immune System at certain times it may be required that the system allows
certain activities which may be harmful to other system which is useful to it
and learns over a period of time through the immune privilege model as done in
case of Immune Privilege Sites in Natural Immune System.
