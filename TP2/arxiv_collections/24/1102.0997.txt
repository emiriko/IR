We address recent spin transport experiments in ultracold unitary Fermi
gases. We provide a theoretical understanding for how the measured temperature
dependence of the spin diffusivity at low $T$ can disagree with the expected
behavior of a Fermi liquid (FL) while the spin susceptiblity(following the
experimental protocols) is consistent with a Fermi liquid picture. We show that
the experimental protocols for extracting $\chi_s$ are based on a FL
presumption; relaxing this leads to consistency within (but not proof of) a
pseudogap-based approach. Our tranport calculations yield insight into the
measured strong suppression of the spin diffusion constant at lower $T$.
