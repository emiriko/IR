We are interested in the intersection cohomology of the minimal
compactification of Siegel modular varieties at some places of bad reduction.
We compute the semi-simple trace of the Frobenius morphism on the fibers of the
nearby cycles of the intersection complex. We obtain a common generalization of
results of Morel and Haines and Ngo.
