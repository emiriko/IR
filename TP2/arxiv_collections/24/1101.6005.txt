Spontaneous Raman emission in atomic gases provides an attractive source of
photon pairs with a controllable delay. We show how this technique can be
implemented in solid state systems by appropriately shaping the inhomogeneous
broadening. Our proposal is eminently feasible with current technology and
provides a realistic solution to entangle remote rare-earth doped solids in a
heralded way.
