The usefulness of a `total-evidence' approach to human population genetics
was assessed through a clustering analysis of combined genome-wide SNP
datasets. The combination contained only 3146 SNPs. Detailed examination of the
results nonetheless enables the extraction of relevant clues about the history
of human populations, some pertaining to events as ancient as the first
migration out of Africa. The results are mostly coherent with what is known
from history, linguistics, and previous genetic analyses. These promising
results suggest that cross-studies data confrontation have the potential to
yield interesting new hypotheses about human population history.
