Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of odd characteristic $p$, and let
$D_n$ be the dihedral group of order $2n$ such that $p\mid 2n$. Let $D(kD_n)$
denote the quantum double of the group algebra $kD_n$. In this paper, we
describe the structures of all finite dimensional indecomposable left
$D(kD_n)$-modules, equivalently, of all finite dimensional indecomposable
Yetter-Drinfeld $kD_n$-modules, and classify them.
