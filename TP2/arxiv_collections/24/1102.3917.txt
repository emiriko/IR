We perform a global fit to the CKM unitarity triangle using the latest
experimental and theoretical constraints. We present results for three
different sets of constraints: the standard inputs used by CKMfitter and UTFit,
the standard inputs minus |Vub|, and the standard inputs minus both |Vub| and
|Vcb|. For the required nonperturbative weak matrix elements, we use
three-flavor lattice QCD averages from www.latticeaverages.org; these have been
updated to reflect all available lattice calculations as of the "End of 2010".
Given current theoretical and experimental inputs, we observe an approximately
3{\sigma} tension in the CKM unitarity triangle that can be interpreted as sign
of physics beyond the standard model in the flavor sector. Using a
model-independent parameterization of new physics effects, we test the
compatibility of new physics in kaon mixing, in B-mixing, or in B \rightarrow
{\tau} {\nu} decay with the current data. Although the tension could be
accommodated with each hypothesis, the scenarios with new physics in B-mixing
or, to a lesser extent, in B \rightarrow {\tau} {\nu} decay are strongly
preferred. Finally, we interpret these results in terms contributions to \Delta
S = 2 and \Delta B = 2 four-fermion operators. We find that the preferred scale
of new physics (with Standard Model like couplings) is in the few hundred GeV
range.
