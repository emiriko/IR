Social media generates a prodigious wealth of real-time content at an
incessant rate. From all the content that people create and share, only a few
topics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become
temporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors
cause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not
been answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending
topics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation,
persistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors
such as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to
trend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the
content with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing
trends.
