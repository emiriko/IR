The Tevatron collaborations have searched for associated production of
charginos and neutralinos via trilepton final states. No events above the
Standard Model prediction were observed. We employ these results to put
stringent bounds on R-parity violating models with a right-handed scalar
electron as the lightest supersymmetric particle. We work in the framework of
lepton number violating minimal supergravity. We find that within these models
the complete parameter space consistent with the anomalous magnetic moment of
the muon can be excluded at 90% confidence level. We also give prospects for
Tevatron trilepton searches assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 fb^{-1}. We
find that Tevatron will be able to test selectron LSP masses up to 170 GeV.
