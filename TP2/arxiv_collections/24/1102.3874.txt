We discuss the spectral lineshapes of N quantum dots in strong coupling with
the single mode of a microcavity. Nontrivial features are brought by detuning
the emitters or probing the direct exciton emission spectrum. We describe dark
states, quantum nonlinearities, emission dips and interferences and show how
these various effects may coexist, giving rise to highly peculiar lineshapes.
