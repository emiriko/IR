The influence of the uncertainties in the rate coefficient data for
electron-impact excitation and ionization on non-LTE Li line formation in cool
stellar atmospheres is investigated. We examine the electron collision data
used in previous non-LTE calculations and compare them to recent calculations
that use convergent close-coupling (CCC) techniques and to our own calculations
using the R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS) method. We find excellent agreement
between rate coefficients from the CCC and RMPS calculations, and reasonable
agreement between these data and the semi-empirical data used in non-LTE
calculations up to now. The results of non-LTE calculations using the old and
new data sets are compared and only small differences found: about 0.01 dex (~
2%) or less in the abundance corrections. We therefore conclude that the
influence on non-LTE calculations of uncertainties in the electron collision
data is negligible. Indeed, together with the collision data for the charge
exchange process Li(3s) + H <-> Li^+ + H^- now available, and barring the
existence of an unknown important collisional process, the collisional data in
general is not a source of significant uncertainty in non-LTE Li line formation
calculations.
