The solar abundance controversy inspires renewed investigations of the basic
physics used to develop solar models. Here we examine the correction to the
proton-proton reaction rate due to dynamic screening effects. Starting with the
dynamic screening energy from the molecular-dynamics simulations of Mao et al.,
we compute a reaction-rate correction for dynamic screening. We find that,
contrary to static screening theory, this dynamic screening does not
significantly change the reaction rate from that of the bare Coulomb potential.
