Studies of electroweak boson production at LHCb are detailed and discussed.
Proposed signal selection schemes and background suppression strategies are
described and the projected performance is estimated using Monte Carlo data.
Due to the unique pseudorapidity coverage and triggering capabilities of LHCb,
these studies will probe an unexplored region of x, Q^2 space.
