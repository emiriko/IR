We explore in this paper certain phenomenological consequences - to be tested
at the LHC - regarding the scalar sector of a SU(3)xSU(3)xU(1) gauge model with
right-handed neutrinos. Our analysis is performed in a particular theoretical
approach of treating gauge models with spontaneous symmetry breaking in which a
single free parameter 'a' finally remains to be tuned, once all the Standard
Model phenomenology is recovered. It is also proved that this particular method
is flexible enough as to accommodate the traditional approach in which three
VEVs supply masses for gauge bosons and fermions, while three accompanying
neutral scalars survive the SSB and take part in various interactions. Two of
them exhibit a hierarchy m(H3) = 2m(H2) with masses below the SM scale 246 GeV
(independently of the parameter 'a') and the third one coming out very heavy
(depending on 'a'), at a mass comparable to the overall breaking scale <phi>. A
plausible scenario implying <phi> in 1 - 10 TeV is then exploited.
