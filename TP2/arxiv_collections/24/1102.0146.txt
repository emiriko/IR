We review a dynamical approach to non-equilibrium MD (D-NEMD). We show how,
using a proper simulation setup, is possible to treat interesting cases in
which the initial condition is a stationary non-equilibrium state produced by a
suitable dynamical system. We then extend the class of non-equilibrium
phenomena that can be studied by atomistic simulations to the case of complex
initial conditions consisting in assigning a macroscopic value of a scalar or
vector observable or a field. We illustrate the functioning of this method by
applying it to the relaxation of an interface between two immiscible liquids.
We have shown that our method generate unbiased results while this might not be
the case for the often used short time average approach.
