The thermodynamic properties of Davydov-Scott monomer contacting with thermal
bath is investigated using Lindblad open quantum system formalism. The Lindblad
equation is investigated through path integral method. It is found that the
environmental effects contribute destructively to the specific heat, and large
interaction between amide-I and amide-site is not preferred for a stable
Davydov-Scott monomer.
