We consider the standard model without the Higgs boson, where the Goldstone
modes are described by a nonlinear sigma model. We study the renormalization
group flow of the sigma model coupling f and of the electroweak parameters S
and T. The condition that the couplings reach a fixed point at high energy
leaves the low energy values of f and T arbitrary (to be determined
experimentally) and fixes S to a value compatible with electroweak precision
data.
