The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations have recently published the results of
initial direct LHC searches for supersymmetry analyzing ~ 35/pb of data taken
at 7 TeV in the centre of mass. We incorporate these results into a frequentist
analysis of the probable ranges of parameters of simple versions of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), namely the constrained
MSSM (CMSSM), a model with common non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM1), the very
constrained MSSM (VCMSSM) and minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). We present updated
predictions for the gluino mass, m_gl, the light Higgs boson mass, M_h, BR(B_s
to mu mu) and the spin-independent dark matter scattering cross section,
sigma_SI. The CMS and ATLAS data make inroads into the CMSSM, NUHM1 and VCMSSM
(but not mSUGRA) parameter spaces, thereby strengthening previous lower limits
on sparticle masses and upper limits on sigma_SI in the CMSSM and VCMSSM. The
favoured ranges of BR(B_s to mu mu) in the CMSSM, VCMSSM and mSUGRA are close
to the Standard Model, but considerably larger values of BR(B_s to mu mu) are
possible in the NUHM1. Applying the CMS and ATLAS constraints improves the
consistency of the model predictions for M_h with the LEP exclusion limits.
