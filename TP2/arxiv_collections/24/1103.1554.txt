We argue that jittering jets, i.e., jets that have their launching direction
rapidly change, launched by the newly formed neutron star in a core collapse
supernova can explode the star. We show that under a wide range of parameters
the fast narrow jets deposit their energy inside the star via shock waves, and
form two hot bubbles, that eventually merge, accelerate the rest of the star
and lead to the explosion. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the
collapsing stellar core and escape with their energy, instead of forming the
hot bubbles, the jets should be prevented from drilling a hole through the
star. This condition can be met if the jets' axis rapidly changes its
direction. This process of depositing jets' energy into the ambient medium is
termed the it penetrating jet feedback mechanism. The feedback exists in that
the neutron star (or a black hole) at the center of the core collapse supernova
shuts off its own growth by exploding the star. The jets deposit their energy
at a distance of 1000 km from the center and expel the mass above that radius.
In our model, the material near the stalled shock at several hundreds
kilometers from the center is not expelled, but it is rather accreted and feed
the accretion disk that blows the jets. The neutrinos might influence the
accretion flow, but in the proposed model their role in exploding the star is
small.
