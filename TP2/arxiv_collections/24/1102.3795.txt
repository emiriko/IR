New fundamental particles, charged under new gauge groups and only weakly
coupled to the standard sector, could exist at fairly low energy scales. In
this article we study a selection of such models, where the secluded group
either contains a softly broken U(1) or an unbroken SU(N). In the Abelian case
new {\gamma}v gauge bosons can be radiated off and decay back into visible
particles. In the non-Abelian case there will not only be a cascade in the
hidden sector, but also hadronization into new {\pi}v and {\rho}v mesons that
can decay back. This framework is developed to be applicable both for e+e- and
pp collisions, but for these first studies we concentrate on the former process
type. For each Abelian and non-Abelian group we study three different scenarios
for the communication between the standard sector and the secluded one. We
illustrate how to distinguish the various characteristics of the models and
especially study to what extent the underlying gauge structure can be
determined experimentally.
