The effect of helical Dirac states on surface phonons in a topological
insulators is investigated. Their coupling is derived in the continuum limit by
assuming displacement dependent Dirac cones. The resulting renormalisation of
sound velocity and attenuation and its dependence on chemical potential and
wave vector is calculated. At finite wave vectors a Kohn anomaly in the
renormalized phonon frequency is caused by intraband-transitions. It appears at
wave vectors q<2k_F due to a lack of backscattering for helical Dirac
electrons. The wave vector and chemical potential dependence of this anomaly is
calculated.
