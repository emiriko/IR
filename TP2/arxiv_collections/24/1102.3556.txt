We investigate the consistency of coherent state (or
Berezin-Klauder-Toeplitz, or anti-Wick) quantization in regard to physical
observations in the non- relativistic (or Galilean) regime. We compare this
procedure with the canonical quantization (on both mathematical and physical
levels) and examine whether they are or not equivalent in their predictions: is
it possible to dif- ferentiate them on a strictly physical level? As far as
only usual dynamical observables (position, momentum, energy, ...) are
concerned, the quantization through coherent states is proved to be a perfectly
valid alternative. We successfully put to the test the validity of CS
quantization in the case of data obtained from vibrational spectroscopy (data
that allowed to validate canonical quantization in the early period of Quantum
Mechanics).
