We investigate mapping properties for the Bargmann transform on modulation
spaces whose weights and their reciprocals are allowed to grow faster than
exponentials. We prove that this transform is isometric and bijective from
modulation spaces to convenient Lebesgue spaces of analytic functions. We use
this to prove that such modulation spaces fulfill most of the continuity
properties which are well-known when the weights are moderated. Finally we use
the results to establish continuity properties of Toeplitz and
pseudo-differential operators in the context of these modulation spaces.
