We present an IDL graphical user interface-driven software package designed
for the analysis of extrasolar planet transit light curves. The Transit
Analysis Package (TAP) software uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques
to fit light curves using the analytic model of Mandel and Agol (2002). The
package incorporates a wavelet based likelihood function developed by Carter
and Winn (2009) which allows the MCMC to assess parameter uncertainties more
robustly than classic chi-squared methods by parameterizing uncorrelated
"white" and correlated "red" noise. The software is able to simultaneously
analyze multiple transits observed in different conditions (instrument, filter,
weather, etc). The graphical interface allows for the simple execution and
interpretation of Bayesian MCMC analysis tailored to a user's specific data set
and has been thoroughly tested on ground-based and Kepler photometry. AutoKep
provides a similar GUI for the preparation of Kepler MAST archive data for
analysis by TAP or any other analysis software. This paper describes the
software release and provides instructions for its use.
