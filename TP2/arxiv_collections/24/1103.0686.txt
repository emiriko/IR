Many works have focused, for over twenty five years, on the integration of
the time dimension in databases (DB). However, the standard SQL3 does not yet
allow easy definition, manipulation and querying of temporal DBs. In this
paper, we study how we can simplify querying and manipulating temporal facts in
SQL3, using a model that integrates time in a native manner. To do this, we
propose new keywords and syntax to define different temporal versions for many
relational operators and functions used in SQL. It then becomes possible to
perform various queries and updates appropriate to temporal facts. We
illustrate the use of these proposals on many examples from a real application.
