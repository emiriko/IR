The transport of magnetic flux to outside of collapsing molecular clouds is a
required step to allow the formation of stars. Although ambipolar diffusion is
often regarded as a key mechanism for that, it has been recently argued that it
may not be efficient enough. In this review, we discuss the role that MHD
turbulence plays in the transport of magnetic flux in star forming flows. In
particular, based on recent advances in the theory of fast magnetic
reconnection in turbulent flows, we will show results of three-dimensional
numerical simulations that indicate that the diffusion of magnetic field
induced by turbulent reconnection can be a very efficient mechanism, especially
in the early stages of cloud collapse and star formation. To conclude, we will
also briefly discuss the turbulence-star formation connection and feedback in
different astrophysical environments: from galactic to cluster of galaxy
scales.
