In this paper, we extend timing analysis of Baykal et al. (2010) of \src
using RXTE-PCA observations between MJD 53724 and MJD 55113 together with a
Chandra-ACIS observation on MJD 54897 with a 20 ks exposure. We also present
X-ray spectral analysis of these RXTE and Chandra observations. We find that
the spin-up rate of the source is correlated with the X-ray flux. Using this
correlation, we estimate the distance and surface magnetic field of the source
as $\sim 15$kpc and $\sim 9\times 10^{11}$Gauss respectively. From the spectral
analysis, we found that power law index increases and Hydrogen column density
decreases with decreasing flux.
