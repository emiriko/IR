To set the stage for viewing Consciousness in terms of brain phase space
dynamics and criticality, I will first review currently prominent theoretical
conceptualizations and, where appropriate, identify ill-advised and flawed
notions in Theoretical Neuroscience that may impede viewing Consciousness as a
phenomenon in Physics. I will furthermore introduce relevant facts that tend
not to receive adequate attention in much of the current Consciousness
discourse. As a new approach to conceptualizing Consciousness, I propose
considering it as a collective achievement of the brain' s complex neural
dynamics that is amenable to study in the framework of state space dynamics and
criticality. In Physics, concepts of phase space transitions and the
Renormalization Group are powerful tools for interpreting phenomena involving
many scales of length and time in complex systems. The significance of these
concepts lies in their accounting for the emergence of different levels of new
collective behaviors in complex systems, each level with its distinct ontology,
organization and laws, as a new pattern of reality. The presumption of this
proposal is that the subjectivity of Consciousness is the epistemic
interpretation of a level of reality that originates in phase transitions of
the brain-body-environment system.
