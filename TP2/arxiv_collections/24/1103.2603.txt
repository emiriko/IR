We report the discovery of a new transiting planet in the Southern
Hemisphere. It has been found by the WASP-south transit survey and confirmed
photometrically and spectroscopically by the 1.2m Swiss Euler telescope, LCOGT
2m Faulkes South Telescope, the 60 cm TRAPPIST telescope and the ESO 3.6m
telescope. The orbital period of the planet is 2.94 days. We find it is a gas
giant with a mass of 0.88 \pm 0.10 Mj and a radius estimated at 0.96 \pm 0.05
Rj . We have also obtained spectra during transit with the HARPS spectrograph
and detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect despite its small amplitude. Because
of the low signal to noise of the effect and of a small impact parameter we
cannot place a constraint on the projected spin-orbit angle. We find two
confiicting values for the stellar rotation. Our determination, via spectral
line broadening gives v sin I = 2.2 \pm 0.3 km/s, while another method, based
on the activity level using the index log R'HK, gives an equatorial rotation
velocity of only v = 1.35 \pm 0.20 km/s. Using these as priors in our analysis,
the planet could either be misaligned or aligned. This should send strong
warnings regarding the use of such priors. There is no evidence for
eccentricity nor of any radial velocity drift with time.
