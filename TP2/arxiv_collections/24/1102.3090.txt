About 25% of all post-AGB stars are hydrogen-deficient, e.g. the PG1159 stars
with a typical abundance pattern He:C:O = 33:50:17 (by mass). Only four of
about 40 known PG1159 stars exhibit H in their spectra. The exciting star of
the planetary nebula A43 is one of these so-called hybrid PG1159 stars. We
present preliminary results of an on-going spectral analysis by means of NLTE
model-atmosphere techniques based on UV spectra obtained with FUSE, HST/GHRS,
and IUE as well as on optical observations.
