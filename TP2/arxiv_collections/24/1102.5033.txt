We analysed 337 multi-epoch optical spectra of 38 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars
to gain insights into the variability behaviour of the circumstellar (CS)
atomic gas. Equivalent widths (EWs) and line fluxes of the Halpha, [OI]6300,
HeI5876 and NaID lines were obtained for each spectrum; the Halpha line width
at 10% of peak intensity (W10) and profile shapes were also measured and
classified. The mean line strengths and relative variabilities were quantified
for each star. Simultaneous optical photometry was used to estimate the line
fluxes.
  We present a homogeneous spectroscopic database of HAeBe stars. The lines are
variable in practically all stars and timescales, although 30 % of the objects
show a constant EW in [OI]6300, which is also the only line that shows no
variability on timescales of hours. The HeI5876 and NaID EW relative
variabilities are typically the largest, followed by those in [OI]6300 and
Halpha. The EW changes can be larger than one order of magnitude for the
HeI5876 line, and up to a factor 4 for Halpha. The [OI]6300 and Halpha EW
relative variabilities are correlated for most stars in the sample. The Halpha
mean EW and W10 are uncorrelated, as are their relative variabilities. The
Halpha profile changes in 70 % of the objects. The massive stars in the sample
usually show more stable Halpha profiles with blueshifted self-absorptions and
less variable 10% widths.
  Our data suggest multiple causes for the different line variations, but the
[OI]6300 and Halpha variability must share a similar origin in many objects.
The physical mechanism responsible for the Halpha line broadening does not
depend on the amount of emission; unlike in lower-mass stars, physical
properties based on the Halpha luminosity and W10 would significantly differ.
Our results provide additional support to previous works that reported
different physical mechanisms in Herbig Ae and Herbig Be stars.
