In our Spitzer 24 \mu m survey of hot white dwarfs (WDs) and archival Spitzer
study of pre-WDs, i.e., central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs), we found
mid-IR excesses for -15 WDs/pre-WDs. These mid-IR excesses are indicative of
the presence of circumstellar dust that could be produced by sub-planetary
objects. To further assess the nature of these IR-excesses, we have obtained
Spitzer IRS, Gemini NIRI and Michelle, and KPNO 4m echelle spectra of these
objects. In this paper we present the analysis of these spectroscopic
observations and discuss the nature of these IR excesses.
