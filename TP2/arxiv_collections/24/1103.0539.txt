In an optical superlattice of triple wells, containing two mutually
interacting atom species in adjacent wells, we show that one species can be
transported through the positions of the other species, yet avoiding
significant overlap and direct interaction. The transfer protocol is optimized
to be robust against missing atoms of either species in any lattice site, as
well as against lattice fluctuations. The degree and the duration of the
inter-species overlap during passage can be tuned, making possible controlled
large-scale interaction-induced change of internal states.
