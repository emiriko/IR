Quantum discord provides a measure for quantifying quantum correlations
beyond entanglement and is very hard to compute even for two-qubit states
because of the minimization over all possible measurements. Recently a simple
algorithm to evaluate the quantum discord for two-qubit X-states is proposed by
Ali, Rau and Alber [Phys. Rev. A 81, 042105 (2010)] with minimization taken
over only a few cases. Here we shall at first identify a class of X-states,
whose quantum discord can be evaluated analytically without any minimization,
for which their algorithm is valid, and also identify a family of X-states for
which their algorithm fails. And then we demonstrate that this special family
of X-states provides furthermore an explicit example for the inequivalence
between the minimization over positive operator-valued measures and that over
von Neumann measurements.
