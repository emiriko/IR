Two well-studied white dwarfs with helium-dominated atmospheres (DBs) each
possess less hydrogen than carried by a single average-mass comet. Plausibly,
the wind rates from these stars are low enough that most accreted hydrogen
remains with the star. If so, and presuming their nominal effective
temperatures, then these DBs have been minimally impacted by interstellar
comets during their 50 Myr cooling age; interstellar iceballs with radii
between 10 m and 2 km contain less than 1% of all interstellar oxygen. This
analysis suggests that most stars do not produce comets at the rate predicted
by "optimistic" scenarios for the formation of the Oort cloud.
