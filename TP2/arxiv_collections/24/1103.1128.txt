Transport properties in the Kondo regime of a nanosystem displaying uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy (such as a magnetic molecule, magnetic adatom or quantum
dot coupled to a localized magnetic moment) are analyzed theoretically. In
particular, the influence of spin-polarized transport through a local orbital
of the system and exchange coupling of conduction electrons to the system's
magnetic core on the Kondo effect is discussed. The numerical renormalization
group method is applied to calculate the spectral functions and linear
conductance in the case of the parallel and antiparallel configurations of the
electrodes' magnetic moments. It is shown that both the magnetic anisotropy as
well as the exchange coupling between electrons tunneling through the
conducting orbital and magnetic core play an important role in formation of the
Kondo resonance, leading generally to its suppression. Specific transport
properties of such a system appear also as a nontrivial behavior of tunnel
magnetoresistance. It is also shown that the Kondo effect can be restored by an
external magnetic field in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetic
configurations.
