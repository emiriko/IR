We consider a single layer graphene nanoribbon with armchair edges in a
longitudinally constant external potential and point out that its transport
properties can be described by means of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
We show that this system has some features typical of dissipative systems,
namely the presence of exceptional points and of PT-symmetry breaking, although
it is not dissipative.
