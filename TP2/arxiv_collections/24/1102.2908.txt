We consider a chemical freeze-out mechanism which is based on a strong medium
dependence of the rates for inelastic flavor-equilibrating collisions based on
the delocalization of hadronic wave functions and growing hadronic radii when
approaching the chiral restoration. We investigate the role of mesonic (pion)
and baryonic (nucleon) fluctuations for melting the chiral condensate in the
phase diagram in the (T,mu)-plane. We apply the PNJL model beyond mean-field
and present an effective generalization of the chiral perturbation theory
result which accounts for the medium dependence of the pion decay constant
while preserving the GMOR relation. We demonstrate within a schematic resonance
gas model consisting of a variable number of pionic and nucleonic degrees of
freedom that within the above model a quantitative explanation of the hadonic
freeze-out curve and its phenomenological conditions can be given.
