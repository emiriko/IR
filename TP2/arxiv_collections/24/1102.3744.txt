Based on the developed quantum microscopic theory, the interaction of weak
electromagnetic radiation with dense ultracold atomic clouds is described in
detail. The differential and total cooperative scattering cross sections are
calculated for monochromatic radiation as particular examples of application of
the general theory. The angular, spectral, and polarization properties of
scattered light are determined. The dependence of these quantities on the
sample size and concentration of atoms is studied and the influence of
collective effects is analyzed.
