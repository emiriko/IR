The standard thin disk model predicts that when the accretion rate is over a
small fraction of the Eddington rate, which corresponds to $L \ga 0.06
L_{Edd}$, the inner region of the disk is radiation-pressure-dominated and
thermally unstable. However, observations of the high/soft state of black hole
X-ray binaries with luminosity well within this regime ($0.01L_{Edd} \la L \la
0.5L_{Edd}$) indicate that the disk has very little variability, i.e., quite
stable. Recent radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a vertically
stratified shearing box have confirmed the absence of the thermal instability.
In this paper, we revisit the thermal stability by linear analysis, taking into
account the role of magnetic field in the accretion flow. By assuming that the
field responses negatively to a positive temperature perturbation, we find that
the threshold of accretion rate above which the disk becomes thermally unstable
increases significantly compared with the case of not considering the role of
magnetic field. This accounts for the stability of the observed sources with
high luminosities. Our model also presents a possible explanation as to why
only GRS 1915+105 seems to show thermally unstable behavior. This peculiar
source holds the highest accretion rate (or luminosity) among the known high
state sources, which is well above the accretion rate threshold of the
instability.
