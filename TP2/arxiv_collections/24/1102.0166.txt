We show how a Hopfield network with modifiable recurrent connections
undergoing slow Hebbian learning can extract the underlying geometry of an
input space. First, we use a slow/fast analysis to derive an averaged system
whose dynamics derives from an energy function and therefore always converges
to equilibrium points. The equilibria reflect the correlation structure of the
inputs, a global object extracted through local recurrent interactions only.
Second, we use numerical methods to illustrate how learning extracts the hidden
geometrical structure of the inputs. Indeed, multidimensional scaling methods
make it possible to project the final connectivity matrix on to a distance
matrix in a high-dimensional space, with the neurons labelled by spatial
position within this space. The resulting network structure turns out to be
roughly convolutional. The residual of the projection defines the
non-convolutional part of the connectivity which is minimized in the process.
Finally, we show how restricting the dimension of the space where the neurons
live gives rise to patterns similar to cortical maps. We motivate this using an
energy efficiency argument based on wire length minimization. Finally, we show
how this approach leads to the emergence of ocular dominance or orientation
columns in primary visual cortex. In addition, we establish that the
non-convolutional (or long-range) connectivity is patchy, and is co-aligned in
the case of orientation learning.
