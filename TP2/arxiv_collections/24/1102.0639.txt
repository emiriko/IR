The study of ultra high energy cosmic rays is a very important scientific
problem. It is likely to have a huge impact in our understanding of the
universe. Very high energy particles have been observed to hit the Earth whose
origin is likely to be outside our Galaxy. Infact, particles with energies
exceeding 10^ (20) electron volts which only hit the earth once in a century
have been observed recently. The source of these high energy particles remains
a deep and fascinating mystery yet to be resolved. Recently, a huge detector 30
times the size of the city of Paris is built by Pierre Auger Observatory to
study these high energy particles. These detectors use the properties of
Cherenkov radiation to identify the particles.
  Firstly, the paper will briefly explain the scientific motivation behind
studying ultra high energy cosmic rays. Secondly, this paper will try to
explain the reasons behind using water Cherenkov detectors. Thirdly, the paper
within its limited scope, will try to give an overview of the exact process by
which ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are detected using surface and water
Cherenkov detectors.
