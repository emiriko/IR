Some motivations for Lorentz-symmetry tests in the context of quantum-gravity
phenomenology are reiterated. The description of the emergent low-energy
effects with the Standard-Model Extension (SME) is reviewed. The possibility of
constraining such effects with dispersion-relation analyses of collider data is
established.
