The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints
on models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of
orbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified
1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit
timing variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary
systems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit
timing analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of
planet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive
of TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span
of observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet
masses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple
transiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We
find that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does
not vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per
star, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a
single transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We
anticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with
multiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a
powerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital
dynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least
six years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the
dynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive
to planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type
stars.
