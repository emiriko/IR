The boosting effect of Cr on the growth of the protective alumina scale on
Fe-Al alloys is investigated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using low
oxygen pressure the surface chemistry of the alloys is monitored starting from
the first moments of oxidation. Chromium effect on the Fe-Al surface-bulk
exchange is clearly detected by analyzing the measured surface concentrations
within the atomic concentration models. Previous ab initio calculations agree
well with the present experiments.
