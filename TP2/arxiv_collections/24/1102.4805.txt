SiGe alloy scattering is of significant importance with the introduction of
strained layers and SiGe channels into CMOS technology. However, alloy
scattering has till now been treated in an empirical fashion with a fitting
parameter. We present a theoretical model within the atomistic tight-binding
representation for treating alloy scattering in SiGe. This approach puts the
scattering model on a solid atomistic footing with physical insights. The
approach is shown to inherently capture the bulk alloy scattering potential
parameters for both n-type and p-type carriers and matches experimental
mobility data.
