We present the complete computation of the tree-level and the next-to-leading
order electroweak contributions to bottom-squark pair production at the LHC.
The computation is performed within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model. We discuss the numerical impact of these contributions in
several supersymmetric scenarios.
