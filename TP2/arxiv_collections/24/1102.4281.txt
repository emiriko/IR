We prove that if the fundamental group of an orientable finite volume
hyperbolic 3-manifold has finite index in the reflection group of a
right-angled ideal polyhedra in $\mathbb{H}^3$ then it has a co-final tower of
finite sheeted covers with positive rank gradient. The manifolds we provide are
also known to have co-final towers of covers with zero rank gradient.
