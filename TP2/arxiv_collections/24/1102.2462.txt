We construct an example of a smooth map $\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}^2$ which
vanishes to infinite order at the origin, and such that the ratio of the norm
of the $\bar z$ derivative to the norm of the $z$ derivative also vanishes to
infinite order. This gives a counterexample to strong unique continuation for a
vector valued analogue of the Beltrami equation.
