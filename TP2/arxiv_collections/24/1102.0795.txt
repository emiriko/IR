We present spectroscopic observations confirming the identification of hot
white dwarfs among UV-bright sources from the Sandage Two-color Survey of the
Galactic plane and listed in the Lanning (Lan) catalog of such sources. A
subsample of 213 UV bright Lan sources have been identified as candidate white
dwarfs based on the detection of a significant proper motion. Spectroscopic
observations of 46 candidates with the KPNO 2.1m telescope confirm 30 sources
to be hydrogen white dwarfs with subtypes in the DA1-DA6 range, and with one of
the stars (Lan 161) having an unresolved M dwarf as a companion. Five more
sources are confirmed to be helium white dwarfs, with subtypes from DB3 to DB6.
One source (Lan 364) is identified as a DZ 3 white dwarf, with strong lines of
calcium. Three more stars are found to have featureless spectra (to within
detection limits), and are thus classified as DC white dwarfs. In addition,
three sources are found to be hot subdwarfs: Lan 20 and Lan 480 are classified
as sdOB, and Lan 432 is classified sdB. The remaining four objects are found to
be field F star interlopers. Physical parameters of the DA and DB white dwarfs
are derived from model fits.
