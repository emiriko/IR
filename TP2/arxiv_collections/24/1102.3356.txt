We have directly observed spin-dependent transport of single cesium atoms in
a 1D optical lattice. A superposition of two circularly polarized standing
waves is generated from two counter propagating, linearly polarized laser
beams. Rotation of one of the polarizations by $\pi$ causes displacement of the
$\sigma^{+}$- and $\sigma^{-}$-lattices by one lattice site. Unidirectional
transport over several lattice sites is achieved by rotating the polarization
back and forth and flipping the spin after each transport step. We have
analyzed the transport efficiency over 10 and more lattice sites, and discussed
and quantified relevant error sources.
