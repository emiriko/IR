We study transport in undoped graphene in the presence of a superlattice
potential both within a simple continuum model and using numerical
tight-binding calculations. The continuum model demonstrates that the
conductivity of the system is primarily impacted by the velocity anisotropy
that the Dirac points of graphene develop due to the potential. For
one-dimensional superlattice potentials, new Dirac points may be generated, and
the resulting conductivities can be approximately described by the anisotropic
conductivities associated with each Dirac point. Tight-binding calculations
demonstrate that this simple model is quantitatively correct for a single Dirac
point, and that it works qualitatively when there are multiple Dirac points.
Remarkably, for a two dimensional potential which may be very strong but
introduces no anisotropy in the Dirac point, the conductivity of the system
remains essentially the same as when no external potential is present.
