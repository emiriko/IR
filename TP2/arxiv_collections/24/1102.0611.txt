Astrometric observations of the radio source occultations by solar system
bodies may be of large interest for testing gravity theories, dynamical
astronomy, and planetary physics. In this paper, we present an updated list of
the occultations of astrometric radio sources by planets expected in the
nearest years. Such events, like the solar eclipses, generally speaking, can be
only observed in a limited region. The map of the shadow path is provided for
the events occurred in regions with several VLBI stations and hence the most
interesting for radio astronomy experiments.
