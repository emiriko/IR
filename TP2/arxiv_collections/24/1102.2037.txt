Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new support for the
discretisation of \pde{}s and other microscale systems. Here we explore the
methodology applied to the gap-tooth scheme in the equation-free approach of
Kevrekidis in two spatial dimensions. The algebraic detail is enormous so we
detail computer algebra procedures to handle the enormity. However, modelling
the dynamics on 2D spatial patches appears to require a mixed numerical and
algebraic approach that is detailed in this report. Being based upon the
computation of residuals, the procedures here may be simply adapted to a wide
class of reaction-diffusion equations.
