We report the first direct observation of a disordered vortex matter phase
existing near the edge of a bulk type-II superconductor Nb using a novel
position-sensitive neutron diffraction technique. This "edge-contaminated"
vortex state was implicated in previous studies using transport techniques and
was postulated to have played a significant role in the behavior of vortex
dynamics in a wide range of type-II superconductors. It is found that upon
thermal annealing, the vortex matter in the bulk undergoes re-ordering,
suggesting that the edge-contaminated bulk vortex state is metastable. The edge
vortex state remains disordered after repeated thermal annealing, indicating
spatial coexistence of a vortex glass with a Bragg glass. This observation
resolves many outstanding issues concerning the peak effect in type-II
superconductors.
