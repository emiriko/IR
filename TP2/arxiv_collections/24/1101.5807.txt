We present here a new robotic telescope called TRAPPIST (TRAnsiting Planets
and PlanetesImals Small Telescope). Equipped with a high-quality CCD camera
mounted on a 0.6 meter light weight optical tube, TRAPPIST has been installed
in April 2010 at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile), and is now beginning its
scientific program. The science goal of TRAPPIST is the study of planetary
systems through two approaches: the detection and study of exoplanets, and the
study of comets. We describe here the objectives of the project, the hardware,
and we present some of the first results obtained during the commissioning
phase.
