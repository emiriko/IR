We report the results of a numerical study of staggered overlap fermions,
following the construction of Adams which reduces the number of tastes from 4
to 2 without fine-tuning. We study the sensitivity of the operator to the
topology of the gauge field, its locality and its robustness to fluctuations of
the gauge field. We make a first estimate of the computing cost of a quark
propagator calculation, and compare with Neuberger's overlap.
