In this paper we provide a definition of pattern of outliers in contingency
tables within a model-based framework. In particular, we make use of log-linear
models and exact goodness-of-fit tests to specify the notions of outlier and
pattern of outliers. The language and some techniques from Algebraic Statistics
are essential tools to make the definition clear and easily applicable. Some
numerical examples show how to use our definitions.
