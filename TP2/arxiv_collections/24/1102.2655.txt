We offer a simple graphical representation for proofs of intuitionistic
logic, which is inspired by proof nets and interaction nets (two formalisms
originating in linear logic). This graphical calculus of proofs inherits good
features from each, but is not constrained by them. By the Curry-Howard
isomorphism, the representation applies equally to the lambda calculus,
offering an alternative diagrammatic representation of functional computations.
