This paper focuses on some simple models of limit order book dynamics which
simulate market trading mechanisms. We start with a discrete time/space Markov
process and then perform a re-scaling procedure leading to a deterministic
dynamical system controlled by non-linear ODEs. This allows us to introduce
approximants for the equilibrium distribution of the process represented by
fixed points of deterministic dynamics.
