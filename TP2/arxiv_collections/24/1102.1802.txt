The fragmentation of projectile and spectator is studied at the different
incident energies using isospin dependent QMD model with reduced isospin
dependent cross-section. Different systems have been used for the analysis of
fragment production(IMF). We have used enhanced constant isospin dependent
cross-section to explain the experimental findings which is valid for soft
equation of state. In addition to that we have tried to study the influence of
density dependent symmetry energy on fragment production.
