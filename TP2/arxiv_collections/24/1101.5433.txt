We report room temperature ferromagnetism in Ni doped CeO2 nanoparticles
using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM), and dc magnetization measurements. Nanoparticles of Ce1-xNixO2 (0.0
\leq x \leq 0.10) were prepared by using a co-precipitation method. XRD
measurements indicate that all samples exhibit single phase nature with cubic
structure and ruled out the presence of any secondary phase. Lattice
parameters, strain and particle size calculated from XRD data have been found
to decrease with increase in Ni doping. Inter-planner distance measured from
HR-TEM images for different Ni doped samples indicate that Ni ions are
substituting Ce ions in CeO2 matrix. Magnetization measurements performed at
room temperature display weak ferromagnetic behavior of Ce1-xNixO2 (0.0 \leq x
\leq 0.10) nanoparticles. Magnetic moment calculated from magnetic hysteresis
loop was found to increases with Ni doping up to 7% and then start decreasing
with further doping.
