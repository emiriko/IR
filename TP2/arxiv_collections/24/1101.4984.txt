We outline a model for a cognitive epigenetic system based on elements of the
Shannon theory of information and the statistical physics of the generalized
Onsager relations. Particular attention is paid to the concept of the rate
distortion function and from another direction as motivated by the
thermodynamics of computing, the fundamental homology with the free energy
density of a physical system. A unifying aspect of the dynamic framework
involves the concept of a groupoid and of a groupoid atlas. From a stochastic
differential equation we postulate a multidimensional Ito process for an
epigenetic system from which a stochastic flow may permeate through components
of this atlas.
