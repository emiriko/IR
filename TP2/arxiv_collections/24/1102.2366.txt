We study the process theoretic notion of stuttering equivalence in the
setting of parity games. We demonstrate that stuttering equivalent vertices
have the same winner in the parity game. This means that solving a parity game
can be accelerated by minimising the game graph with respect to stuttering
equivalence. While, at the outset, it might not be clear that this strategy
should pay off, our experiments using typical verification problems illustrate
that stuttering equivalence speeds up solving parity games in many cases.
