We study phonon Hall effect (PHE) for ionic crystals in the presence of
static magnetic field. Using Green-Kubo formula, we present an exact
calculation of thermal conductivity tensor by considering both positive and
negative frequency phonons. Numerical results are shown for some lattices such
as hexagonal lattices, triangular lattices, and square lattices. We find that
the PHE occurs on the nonmagnetic ionic crystal NaCl, although the magnitude is
very small which is due to the tiny charge-to-mass ratio of the ions. The
off-diagonal thermal conductivity is finite for nonzero magnetic field and
changes sign for high value of magnetic field at high temperature. We also
found that the off-diagonal thermal conductivity diverges as $\pm{1/T}$ at low
temperature.
