The problem of an electron-hole system interacting through a contact
potential and moving in a one-dimensional quantum ring threaded by an
Aharonov-Bohm flux is considered, both with respect to the system's energetics
as well as its optical properties. An exact analytical expression for the
energy spectrum is derived using a straightforward method based on boundary
conditions for wavefunctions and their derivatives along the ring. The optical
properties of this exciton system, namely the linear dynamic polarizability and
absorption spectrum are investigated demonstrating certain unusual features. It
is shown, for example, that for special values of the magnetic flux there are
energies in the spectrum that correspond to the dark excitonic states.
