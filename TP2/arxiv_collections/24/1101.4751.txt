The nature of the ground states for a system composed of two coupled cavities
with each containing a pair of dipole-coupled two-level atoms are studied over
a wide range of detunings and dipole coupling strengths. The cases for three
limits of exact resonance, large positive and negative detunings are discussed,
and four types of the ground states are revealed. Then the phase diagrams of
the ground state are plotted by choosing three different "order parameters". We
find that the phase space, determined by the combinative action of detuning and
the dipole coupling strength, is divided into four regions. This is different
from the general Bose-Hubbard model and more richer physics are presented in
the two-site coupled cavities system. That is, the insulator region may be
polaritonic or atomic and the superfluid region may be polaritonic or photonic
in nature.
