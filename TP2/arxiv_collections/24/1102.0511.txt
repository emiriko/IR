The origin of subdwarf B (sdB) stars is not fully understood yet since it
requires high mass loss at the red giant stage. SdBs in close binary systems
are formed via common envelope ejection, but the origin of apparently single
sdB stars remains unclear. Substellar companions may be able to trigger common
envelope ejection and help forming sdBs that appear to be single. Using a
sample of high resolution spectra we aim at detecting small radial velocity
(RV) shifts caused by such low mass (sub-)stellar companions. The RVs are
measured with high accuracy using sharp metal lines. Our goal is to test the
theoretical predictions and put constraints on the population of the lowest
mass companions to sdB stars.
