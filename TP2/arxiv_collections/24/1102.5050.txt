We survey some results on scalar curvature and properties of solutions to the
Einstein constraint equations. Topics include an extended discussion of
asymptotically flat solutions to the constraint equations, including recent
results on the geometry of the center of mass of such solutions. We also review
methods to construct solutions to the constraint equations, including the
conformal method, as well as gluing techniques for which it is important to
understand both conformal and non-conformal deformations of the scalar
curvature.
