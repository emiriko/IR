These are the proceedings of the PrimeNet Workshop, held in September 16-18,
2010, at the campus of Instituto Superior T\'ecnico in Lisbon, Portugal. This
workshop is part of the activities in the project "Study of Strongly
Interacting Matter" (acronym HadronPhysics2), which is an integrating activity
of the Seventh Framework Program of EU. This HP2 project contains several
activities, one of them being the network PrimeNet having the focus on Meson
Physics in Low-Energy QCD. This network is created to exchange information on
experimental and theoretical ongoing activities on mainly eta and eta-prime
physics at different European accelerator facilities and institutes.
