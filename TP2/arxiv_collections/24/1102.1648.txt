By analyzing the longitudinal conductivity in a quantizing magnetic field
directed perpendicularly to the crystal lattice layers, it has been
demonstrated that the layered-structure effects can be observed not only in
crystals with highly open Fermi surfaces, as was conventionally believed
earlier, but also in crystals with closed ones. The calculations were carried
out in the constant-relaxation-time approximation. In weak magnetic fields,
layered-structure effects manifest themselves as a phase retardation of
Shubnikov--de Haas oscillations and a certain increase of the relative
contribution made by the latter. In the range of high magnetic fields, there
exists an optimal interval, in which the layered-structure effects reveal
themselves in the form of a sharp non-monotonous dependence of conductivity on
the magnetic field. In addition, it has been shown that the layered-structure
effects result in a decrease of the proportionality factor between the
magnetoresistance and the magnetic induction in the longitudinal Kapitsa
effect. The longitudinal conductivity of layered crystals in ultra-quantum
magnetic fields has also been analyzed. It is shown that the following
dependences of the magnetoresistance on the magnetic field can be obtained,
depending on the model used for the filling of the single Landau subband and on
whether the longitudinal conductivity is considered to be of either the drift
or diffusion type: $\rho_{zz}\propto TB^{2}$,\ $\rho_{zz}\propto B^{3}$, and
$\rho_{zz}\propto B^{4}$.
