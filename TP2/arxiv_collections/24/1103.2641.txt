We study symmetric sleepy random walkers, a model exhibiting an
absorbing-state phase transition in the conserved directed percolation (CDP)
universality class. Unlike most examples of this class studied previously, this
model possesses a continuously variable control parameter, facilitating
analysis of critical properties. We study the model using two complementary
approaches: analysis of the numerically exact quasistationary (QS) probability
distribution on rings of up to 22 sites, and Monte Carlo simulation of systems
of up to 32000 sites. The resulting estimates for critical exponents beta,
beta/nu_perp, and z, and the moment ratio m_{211} = < rho^2 >/< rho >^2 (rho is
the activity density), based on finite-size scaling at the critical point, are
in agreement with previous results for the CDP universality class. We find,
however, that the approach to the QS regime is characterized by a different
value of the dynamic exponent z than found in the QS regime.
