The InterFerence Channel with a Cognitive Relay (IFC-CR) consists of a
classical two-user interference channel in which the two independent messages
are also non-causally known at a cognitive relay node. In this work a special
class of IFC-CRs in which the sources do not create interference at the
non-intended destinations is analyzed. This special model results in a channel
with two non-interfering point-to-point channels whose transmission is aided by
an in-band cognitive relay, which is thus referred to as the Parallel Channel
with a Cognitive Relay (PC-CR). We determine the capacity of the PC-CR channel
to within 3 bits/s/Hz for all channel parameters. In particular, we present
several new outer bounds which we achieve to within a constant gap by proper
selection of Gaussian input distributions in a simple rate-splitting and
superposition coding-based inner bound. The inner and outer bounds are
numerically evaluated to show that the actual gap can be far less than 3
bits/s/Hz.
