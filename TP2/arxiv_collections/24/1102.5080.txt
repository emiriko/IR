We present a multi-wavelength study of the energetic interaction between the
central active galactic nucleus (AGN), the intra-cluster medium, and the
optical emission line nebula in the galaxy cluster Sersic 159-03. We use X-ray
data from Chandra, high resolution X-ray spectra and UV images from XMM-Newton,
Halpha images from the SOAR telescope, HST optical imaging, and VLA and GMRT
radio data. The cluster center displays signs of powerful AGN feedback, which
has cleared the central regions (r<7.5 kpc) of dense, X-ray emitting ICM. X-ray
spectral maps reveal a high pressure ring surrounding the central AGN at a
radius of r~15 kpc, indicating an AGN driven weak shock. The cluster harbors a
bright, 44 kpc long Halpha+[NII] filament extending from the centre of the cD
galaxy to the north. Along the filament, we see low entropy, high metallicity,
cooling X-ray gas. The gas in the filament has most likely been uplifted by
`radio mode' AGN activity and subsequently stripped from the galaxy due to its
relative southward motion. Because this X-ray gas has been removed from the
direct influence of the AGN jets, part of it cools and forms stars as indicated
by the observed dust lanes, molecular and ionized emission line nebulae, and
the excess UV emission.
