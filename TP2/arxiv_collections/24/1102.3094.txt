Phase separation in a complex fluid with lamellar order has been studied in
the case of cold thermal fronts propagating diffusively from external walls.
The velocity hydrodynamic modes are taken into account by coupling the
convection-diffusion equation for the order parameter to a generalised
Navier-Stokes equation. The dynamical equations are simulated by implementing a
hybrid method based on a lattice Boltzmann algorithm coupled to finite
difference schemes. Simulations show that the ordering process occurs with
morphologies depending on the speed of the thermal fronts or, equivalently, on
the value of the thermal conductivity {\xi}. At large value of {\xi}, as in
instantaneous quenching, the system is frozen in entangled configurations at
high viscosity while consists of grains with well ordered lamellae at low
viscosity. By decreasing the value of {\xi}, a regime with very ordered
lamellae parallel to the thermal fronts is found. At very low values of {\xi}
the preferred orientation is perpendicular to the walls in d = 2, while
perpendicular order is lost moving far from the walls in d = 3.
