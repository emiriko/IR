We show how the AGBS model, originally developed for deep inelastic
scattering applied to HERA data on the proton structure function, can also
describe the RHIC data on single inclusive hadron yield for $d+Au$ and $p+p$
collisions through a new simultaneous fit. The single inclusive hadron
production is modeled through the color glass condensate, which uses the
quark(and gluon)--condensate amplitudes in momentum space. The AGBS model is
also a momentum space model based on the asymptotic solutions of the BK
equation, although a different definition of the Fourier transform is used.
This aspect is overcome and a description entirely in transverse momentum of
both processes arises for the first time. The small difference between the
simultaneous fit and the one for HERA data alone suggests that the AGBS model
describes very well both kind of processes and thus emerges as a good tool to
investigate the inclusive hadron production data. We use this model for
predictions at LHC energies, which agree very well with available experimental
data.
