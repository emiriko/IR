The recent availability of data describing social networks is changing our
understanding of the "microscopic structure" of a social tie. A social tie
indeed is an aggregated outcome of many social interactions such as
face-to-face conversations or phone-calls. Analysis of data on face-to-face
interactions shows that such events, as many other human activities, are
bursty, with very heterogeneous durations. In this paper we present a model for
social interactions at short time scales, aimed at describing contexts such as
conference venues in which individuals interact in small groups. We present a
detailed anayltical and numerical study of the model's dynamical properties,
and show that it reproduces important features of empirical data. The model
allows for many generalizations toward an increasingly realistic description of
social interactions. In particular in this paper we investigate the case where
the agents have intrinsic heterogeneities in their social behavior, or where
dynamic variations of the local number of individuals are included. Finally we
propose this model as a very flexible framework to investigate how dynamical
processes unfold in social networks.
