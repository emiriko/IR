We discuss one important aspect of Waldmeier effect which says that the
stronger cycles rise rapidly than weaker cycles. We studied four different data
set of solar activity indices, and find strong linear correlation between rise
rates and amplitudes of solar activity. We study this effect theoretically by
introducing suitable stochastic fluctuations in our regular solar dynamo model.
