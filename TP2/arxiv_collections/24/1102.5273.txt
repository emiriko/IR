We investigate the interaction between two cracks propagating in a thin
sheet. Two different experimental geometries allow us to tear sheets by
imposing an out-of-plane shear loading. We find that two tears converge along
self-similar paths and annihilate each other. These finite-distance
singularities display geometry-dependent similarity exponents, which we
retrieve using scaling arguments based on a balance between the stretching and
the bending of the sheet close to the tips of the cracks.
