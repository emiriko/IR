Performance evolution of a number of complex scientific and technical systems
demonstrate exponential progress with time exp(+t/C) . The speed of progress C
- a measure of difficulty and complexity - is analyzed for high energy
elementary particle colliders, astrophysical searches for galaxies and
exoplanets, protein structure determination and compared with computers and
thermonuclear fusion reactors. An explanation of the characteristic exponential
progress is offered.
