In this paper, we consider the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function
as the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on a fractal manifold. From the heat
kernel expansion, we figure out that the fractal dimension of the manifold is
about 1.1-1.2. Also we compare this result to the random matrix theory and the
quantum chaos theory.
