The synchronized bit communication model, defined recently by Impagliazzo and
Williams in \emph{Communication complexity with synchronized clocks}, CCC '10,
is a communication model which allows the participants to share a common clock.
The main open problem posed in this paper was the following: does the
synchronized bit model allow a logarithmic speed-up for all functions over the
standard deterministic model of communication? We resolve this question in the
negative by showing that the Median function, whose communication complexity is
$O(\log n)$, does not admit polytime synchronized bit protocol with
communication complexity $O\left(\log^{1-\epsilon} n\right)$ for any $\epsilon
> 0$. Our results follow by a new round-communication trade-off for the Median
function in the standard model, which easily translates to its hardness in the
synchronized bit model.
