We study the crossover between thermal and shot-noise power in a chaotic
quantum dot in the presence of non-ideal contacts at finite temperature. The
result explicitly demonstrates that the temperature affect the
suppression-amplification effect present in the main quantum noise. In
particular, the weak localization contribution to the noise has an anomalous
thermal behavior when one let the barriers vary, indicating the presence of a
critical point related to specific value of the tunneling barriers. We also
show how to get to the opaque limit of the quantum dot at finite temperature.
