Flat electrical charged black holes in 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter space
have been applied to the study of the phase diagram of quark matter via AdS/CFT
correspondence. In such application it is argued that since the temperature of
the quark gluon plasma is bounded away from zero, the dual black hole cannot be
arbitrarily cold, but becomes unstable due to stringy instability once it
reaches sufficiently low temperature. We study the stringy stability of flat
dilaton black holes with dilaton coupling $\alpha=1$ in asymptotically anti-de
Sitter space and show that unlike the purely electrically charged black hole,
these dilaton black holes do not suffer from stringy instability.
