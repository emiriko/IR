We discuss a set of recently discovered quadratic relations between gauge
theory amplitudes. Such relations give additional structural simplifications
for amplitudes in QCD. Remarkably, their origin lie in an analogous set of
relations that involve also gravitons. When certain gluon helicities are
flipped we obtain relations that do not involve gravitons, but which refer only
to QCD.
