Social networks tend to disproportionally favor connections between
individuals with either similar or dissimilar characteristics. This propensity,
referred to as assortative mixing or homophily, is expressed as the correlation
between attribute values of nearest neighbour vertices in a graph. Recent
results indicate that beyond demographic features such as age, sex and race,
even psychological states such as "loneliness" can be assortative in a social
network. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social
networks it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes
place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking
services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that general
happiness or Subjective Well-Being (SWB) of Twitter users, as measured from a 6
month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the
Twitter social network. To our knowledge this is the first result that shows
assortative mixing in online networks at the level of SWB. Our results imply
that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms
that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative
mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of
online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels
of SWB may be an important instrument in better understanding how both positive
and negative sentiments spread through online social ties. Future research may
focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user
behavior in "real life".
