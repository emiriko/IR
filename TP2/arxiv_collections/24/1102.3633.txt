We study the survival probability and the corresponding first passage time
density of fractional Brownian motion confined to a two-dimensional open wedge
domain with absorbing boundaries. By analytical arguments and numerical
simulation we show that in the long time limit the first passage time density
scales as t**{-1+pi*(2H-2)/(2*Theta)} in terms of the Hurst exponent H and the
wedge angle Theta. We discuss this scaling behaviour in connection with the
reaction kinetics of FBM particles in a one-dimensional domain.
