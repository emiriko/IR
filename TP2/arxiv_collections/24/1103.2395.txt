We put forward and discuss in detail a scheme to achieve Bose-Einstein
condensation of stationary-light dark-state polaritons with dipolar
interaction. To this end we have introduced a diamond-like coupling scheme in a
vapor of Rydberg atoms under the frozen gas approximation. To determine the
system's dynamics we employ normal modes and identify the dark-state polariton
corresponding to one of the modes. We show that in contrast to atomic dipolar
ultra-cold vapors dark-state polariton Bose-Einstein condensates proposed here
can be stable for a negative dipolar interaction constant.
