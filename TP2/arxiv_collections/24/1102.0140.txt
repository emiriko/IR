Channel conductance measurements can be used as a tool to study thermally
activated electron transport in the sub-threshold region of state-of-art
FinFETs. Together with theoretical Tight-Binding (TB) calculations, this
technique can be used to understand the evolution of source-to-channel barrier
height (Eb) and of active channel area (S) with gate bias (Vgs). The
quantitative difference between experimental and theoretical values that we
observe can be attributed to the interface traps present in these FinFETs.
Therefore, based on the difference between measured and calculated values of
(i) S and (ii) |dEb/dVgs| (channel to gate coupling), two new methods of
interface trap density (Dit) metrology are outlined. These two methods are
shown to be very consistent and reliable, thereby opening new ways of analyzing
in situ state-of-the-art multi-gate FETs down to the few nm width limit.
Furthermore, theoretical investigation of the spatial current density reveal
volume inversion in thinner FinFETs near the threshold voltage.
