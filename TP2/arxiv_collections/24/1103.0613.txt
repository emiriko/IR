When the parameters of electron - extreme power laser interaction enter the
regime of dominated radiation reaction, the electron dynamics changes
qualitatively. The adequate theoretical description of this regime becomes
crutially important with the use of the radiation friction force either in the
Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac form, which possess unphysical runaway solutions, or in
the Landau-Lifshitz form, which is a perturbation valid for relatively low
electromagnetic wave amplitude. The goal of the present paper is to find the
limits of the Landau-Lifshitz radiation force applicability in terms of the
electromagnetic wave amplitude and frequency. For this a class of the exact
solutions to the nonlinear problems of charged particle motion in the
time-varying electromagnetic field is used.
