We present results for a large number of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow
light curve calculations, done by combining high resolution two-dimensional
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using RAM with a synchrotron radiation
code. Results were obtained for jet energies, circumburst medium densities and
jet angles typical for short and underluminous GRBs, different observer angles
and observer frequencies from low radio (75 MHz) to X-ray (1.5 keV). We
summarize the light curves through smooth power law fits with up to three
breaks, covering jet breaks for small observer angles, the rising phase for
large observer angles and the rise and decay of the counterjet. All light curve
data are publicly available via http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary . The
data can be used for model fits to observational data and as an aid for
predicting observations by future telescopes such as LOFAR or SKA and will
benefit the study of neutron star mergers using different channels, such as
gravitational wave observations with LIGO or Virgo.
  For small observer angles, we find jet break times that vary significantly
between frequencies, with the break time in the radio substantially postponed.
Increasing the observer angle also postpones the measured jet break time. The
rising phase of the light curve for large observer angle has a complex shape
that can not always be summarized by a simple power law. Except for very large
observer angles, the counter jet is a distinct feature in the light curve,
although in practice the signal will be exceedingly difficult to observe by
then.
