We report structurally tuned superconductivity in KxFe2-ySe2-zSz (0<=z<=2)
phase diagram. Superconducting Tc is suppressed as S is incorporated into the
lattice, eventually vanishing at 80% of S. The magnetic and conductivity
properties can be related to stoichiometry on poorly occupied Fe1 site and the
local environment of nearly fully occupied Fe2 site. The decreasing Tc
coincides with the increasing Fe1 occupancy and the overall increase in Fe
stoichiometry from z = 0 to z = 2. Our results indicate that the irregularity
of Fe2-Se/S tetrahedron is an important controlling parameter that can be used
to tune the ground state in the new superconductor family.
