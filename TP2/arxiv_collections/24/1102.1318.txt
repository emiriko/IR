Motivated by potential realizations in cold-atom or cold-molecule systems, we
have performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations of two-component gases of
fermions in two dimensions with hard-core interactions. We have determined the
gross features of the zero-temperature phase diagram, by investigating the
relative stabilities of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic fluids and crystals. We
have also examined the effect of including a pairwise, long-range r^(-3)
potential between the particles. Our most important conclusion is that there is
no region of stability for a ferromagnetic fluid phase, even if the long-range
interaction is present. We also present results for the pair-correlation
function, static structure factor, and momentum density of two-dimensional
hard-core fluids.
