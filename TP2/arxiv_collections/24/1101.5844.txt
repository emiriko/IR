Ideal axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere is calculated from the standard
stationary force-free equation but with a new boundary condition at the
equator. The new solution predicts Ohmic heating. About 50% of the Poynting
power is dissipated in the equatorial current layer outside the light cylinder,
with about 10% dissipated between 1 and 1.5 light cylinder radii. The Ohmic
heat presumably goes into radiation, pair production, and acceleration of
charges -- in an unknown proportion.
