The presence of energy shells in metallic clusters and atomic nuclei leads to
a peculiar relation between the number of particles N and the structure, and
this leads to a strong correlation between the energy spectrum and N. An
analysis of experimental data leads to the conclusion that, in addition to the
static Jahn-Teller effect, the dynamic effect leading to the quantum
coexistence of different configurations (quantum oscillations) plays an
important role. Such suggested coexistence is an essential feature of clusters
as well as nuclei, both finite Fermi systems.
