Like entanglement, quantum discord quantifies the quantum correlations.
Unlike entanglement, whose detection is extremely difficult, the quantum
discord of an arbitrary bipartite state allows itself to be detected perfectly
by a single observable, the quantum discord witness. In particular, we report a
single observable whose expectation value provides a necessary and sufficient
condition for the vanishing quantum discord of an arbitrary bipartite unknown
state with four copies. A quantum circuit is designed to measure the quantum
discord witness by using only local qubit-measurements.
