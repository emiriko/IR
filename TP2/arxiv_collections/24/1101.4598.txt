We performed three dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations to
study the magnetic reconnection using an initially shearing magnetic field
configuration (force free field with a current sheet in the middle of the
computational box). It is shown that there are two types of reconnection jets:
the ordinary reconnection jets and fan-shaped jets, which are formed along the
guide magnetic field. The fan-shaped jets are much different from the ordinary
reconnection jets which are ejected by magnetic tension force. There are two
driving forces for accelerating the fan-shaped jets. The one is the Lorentz
force which dominates the motion of fluid elements at first and then the gas
pressure gradient force accelerates the fluid elements in the later stage. The
dependence on magnetic reconnection angle and resistivity value has also been
studied. The formation and evolution of these jets provide a new understanding
of dynamic magnetohydrodynamic jets.
