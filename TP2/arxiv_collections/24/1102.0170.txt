In cuprate superconductors, tunneling between planes makes possible
three-dimensional coherent transport. However, the interlayer tunnelling
amplitude is reduced when an order-parameter phase gradient between planes is
established. As such, c-axis superconductivity can be weakened if a strong
electric field is applied along the c axis. We use high-field single-cycle
terahertz pulses to gate interlayer coupling in La1.84Sr0.16CuO4. We induce
ultrafast oscillations between superconducting and resistive states and switch
the plasmon response on and off, without reducing the density of Cooper pairs.
Indeed, in-plane superconductivity remains unperturbed throughout, revealing a
non-equilibrium state in which the dimensionality of the superconductor is time
dependent. The gating frequency is determined by the electric field strength,
in the spirit of the ac Josephson effect. Non-dissipative, bi-directional
gating of superconductive coupling is of interest for device applications in
ultrafast nanoelectronics. It is also a new example of nonlinear terahertz
physics, applicable to nanoplasmonics and active metamaterials.
