Sensible Quantum Mechanics or Mindless Sensationalism is a framework for
relating consciousness to a quantum universe. It states that each conscious
perception has a measure that is given by the expectation value of a
corresponding quantum "awareness operator" in a fixed quantum state of the
universe. The measures can be interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for a
large set of perceptions that all actually exist with varying degrees of
reality, so detailed theories within this framework are testable. The measures
are not propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is nothing
indeterministic in this framework, and no free will in the incompatibilistic
sense. As conscious perceptions are determined by the awareness operators and
the quantum state, they are epiphenomena. No fundamental relation is postulated
between different perceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious
experience and thus not in direct contact with any other), so SQM or MS, a
variant of Everett's "many-worlds" framework, is a "many-perceptions" framework
but not a "many-minds" framework.
