For each type of number, structures that differ by arbitrary scaling factors
and are isomorphic to one another are described. The scaling of number values
in one structure, relative to the values in another structure, must be
compensated for by scaling of the basic operations and relations (if any) in
the structure. The scaling must be such that one structure satisfies the
relevant number type axioms if and only if the other structure does.
