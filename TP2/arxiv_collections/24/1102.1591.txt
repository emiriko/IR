After summarizing the important commonalities between neutrino factories and
muon colliders, the key differences are discussed. These include a much larger
needed cooling factor (~10^6 in six-dimensional emittance), a smaller number of
muon bunches (perhaps only one of each charge), and acceleration to much higher
energy, implying significantly different technical choices for some of the
cooling and acceleration subsystems. The final storage rings are also quite
different. Nevertheless, a neutrino factory could serve as a key stepping stone
on the path to a muon collider.
