Photoproduction of neutral pseudoscalar mesons $\pi^0,\eta(547)$ and
$\eta'(958)$ in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus is studied using a model
which describes the Primakoff and nuclear parts of the production amplitude. At
high energies the nuclear background is dominated by the exchange of $C$-parity
odd Regge trajectories. In the coherent production the isospin filtering makes
the $\omega(782)$ a dominant trajectory. The calculations are in agreement with
$\pi^0$ data from JLAB provided the photon shadowing and final state
interactions of mesons are taken into account. The kinematic conditions which
allow to study the Primakoff effect in $\eta$ and $\eta'$ photoproduction off
nuclei are further discussed. We also give predictions for the higher energies
available at the JLAB upgrade.
