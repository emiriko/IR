Ultra-strong laser pulses can be so intense that an electron in the focused
beam loses significant energy due to gamma-photon emission while its motion
deviates via the radiation back-reaction. Numerical methods and tools designed
to simulate radiation-dominated and QED-strong laser-plasma interactions are
summarized here.
