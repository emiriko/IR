The discovery of cuprate high Tc superconductors has inspired searching for
unconventional su- perconductors in magnetic materials. A successful recipe has
been to suppress long-range order in a magnetic parent compound by doping or
high pressure to drive the material towards a quantum critical point, which is
replicated in recent discovery of iron-based high TC superconductors. The
long-range magnetic order coexisting with superconductivity has either a small
magnetic moment or low ordering temperature in all previously established
examples. Here we report an exception to this rule in the recently discovered
potassium iron selenide. The superconducting composition is identified as the
iron vacancy ordered K0.8Fe1.6Se2 with Tc above 30 K. A novel large moment 3.31
{\mu}B/Fe antiferromagnetic order which conforms to the tetragonal crystal
symmetry has the unprecedentedly high an ordering temperature TN = 559 K for a
bulk superconductor. Staggeredly polarized electronic density of states thus is
suspected, which would stimulate further investigation into superconductivity
in a strong spin-exchange field under new circumstance.
