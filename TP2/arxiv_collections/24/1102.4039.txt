Two species of Endangered Leaf frogs, Agalychnis moreletii and Agalychnis
annae, belonging to the tree frog Subfamily Phyllomedusinae, Genus Agalychnis,
were hybridized for the first time whilst being maintained in captivity.
Previous to this, these allopatric Central American species were considered as
being distinctly separate. Crossbreeding following genetic analysis reveals
that the two species are extremely closely related, and the hybrid of A.
moreletii and A. annae is presented for the first time. The importance of
identifying degrees of genetic variation between species and different
populations of the same species, for conservation purposes, is highlighted and
discussed.
