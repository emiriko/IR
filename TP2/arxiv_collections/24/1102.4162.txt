Most of legacy systems use nowadays were modeled and documented using
structured approach. Expansion of these systems in terms of functionality and
maintainability requires shift towards object-oriented documentation and
design, which has been widely accepted by the industry. In this paper, we
present a survey of the existing Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to Unified Modeling
language (UML) transformation techniques. We analyze transformation techniques
using a set of parameters, identified in the survey. Based on identified
parameters, we present an analysis matrix, which describes the strengths and
weaknesses of transformation techniques. It is observed that most of the
transformation approaches are rule based, which are incomplete and defined at
abstract level that does not cover in depth transformation and automation
issues. Transformation approaches are data centric, which focuses on data-store
for class diagram generation. Very few of the transformation techniques have
been applied on case study as a proof of concept, which are not comprehensive
and majority of them are partially automated.
