We have developed and characterized the structure and composition of
nanometers-thick solid-solution epitaxial layers of (V,Nb) on sapphire (1120),
displaying a continuous lateral gradient of composition from one to another
pure element. Further covered with an ultrathin pseudomorphic layer of W, these
provide a template for the fast combinatorial investigation of any growth or
physical property depending of strain.
