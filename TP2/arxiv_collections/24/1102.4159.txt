In the previous work [35], the second and third authors established a Bochner
type formula on Alexandrov spaces. The purpose of this paper is to give some
applications of the Bochner type formula. Firstly, we extend the sharp lower
bound estimates of spectral gap, due to Chen-Wang [9, 10] and Bakry-Qian [6],
from smooth Riemannian manifolds to Alexandrov spaces. As an application, we
get an Obata type theorem for Alexandrov spaces. Secondly, we obtain (sharp)
Li-Yau's estimate for positve solutions of heat equations on Alexandrov spaces.
