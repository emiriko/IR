Past and future dynamical evolution of all 64 long period comets having
1/aori< 1\times10-4 au-1 and qosc > 3.0 au and discovered after 1970 is
studied. For all of them we obtained a new, homogeneous set of osculating
orbits, including 15 orbits with detected non-gravitational parameters. The
non-gravitational effects for eleven of these 15 comets have been determined
for the first time. These were propagated numerically back and forth up to the
250 au heliocentric distance, constituting sets of original and future orbits
together with their uncertainties. Next we followed the dynamical evolution
under the Galactic tides for one orbital revolution to the past and future,
obtaining orbital elements at previous/next perihelion passages. We obtained a
clear dependence of the last revolution change in perihelion distance with
respect to the 1/aori, what confirmed theoretical expectations. We show that
about 50 per cent of all investigated comets have their previous perihelion
distance below the 15 au limit. This resulted in classifying 31 comets as
dynamically new, 26 as dynamically old and 7 having unclear status. We also
present several examples of cometary motion through the Jupiter-Saturn barrier,
some of them with the previous perihelion distance smaller than the observed
one. New interpretations of the long period comets source pathways are also
discussed in the light of suggestions of Kaib & Quinn (2009).
