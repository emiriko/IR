We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC)
suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of
stellar spheroids of Milky Way-mass disc galaxies. The simulations contain
accurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation,
supernova feedback, and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have been
simulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of ~400 simulated L_* disc
galaxies. The simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low-surface
brightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. The diffuse
stellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed around
the Milky Way, M31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surface
brightness, and metallicity profiles. We show that in situ star formation
typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r < 30 kpc,
whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origin
induces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,
which is also present in the observational data. The system-to-system scatter
in the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans over
a factor of 4. Consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shape
and normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r < 30 kpc (e.g., when
fit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). We
show that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formation
epoch of the system. Dynamically older systems have, on average, larger
contributions from in situ star formation, although there is significant
system-to-system scatter in this relationship. Thus, in situ star formation
likely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pure
accretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the inner
spheroid.
