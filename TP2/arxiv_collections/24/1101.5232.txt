On 2010 April 28 and 29, the Solar TErrestrial Relations Observatory
B/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager observed four homologous large-scale coronal
waves, the so-called EIT-waves, within 8 hr. All waves emerged from the same
source active region, were accompanied by weak flares and faint coronal mass
ejections, and propagated into the same direction at constant velocities in the
range of ~220-340 km s-1. The last of these four coronal wave events was the
strongest and fastest, with a velocity of 337 +/- 31 km s-1 and a peak
perturbation amplitude of ~1.24, corresponding to a magnetosonic Mach number of
Mms ~ 1.09. The magnetosonic Mach numbers and velocities of the four waves are
distinctly correlated, suggestive of the nonlinear fast-mode magnetosonic wave
nature of the events. We also found a correlation between the magnetic energy
buildup times and the velocity and magnetosonic Mach number.
