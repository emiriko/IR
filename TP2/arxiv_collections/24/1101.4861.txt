We analyze the dynamics of evolutionary games in which fitness is defined as
an affine function of the expected payoff and a constant contribution. The
resulting inhomogeneous replicator equation has an homogeneous equivalent with
modified payoffs. The affine terms also influence the stochastic dynamics of a
two-strategy Moran model of a finite population. We then apply the affine
fitness function in a model for tumor-normal cell interactions to determine
which are the most successful tumor strategies. In order to analyze the
dynamics of concurrent strategies within a tumor population, we extend the
model to a three-strategy game involving distinct tumor cell types as well as
normal cells. In this model, interaction with normal cells, in combination with
an increased constant fitness, is the most effective way of establishing a
population of tumor cells in normal tissue.
