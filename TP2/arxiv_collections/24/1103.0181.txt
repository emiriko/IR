The concept of energy balance is a key one in climate science. Yet, students
may find it counterintuitive: while it is obvious that some energy comes in
from the sun, the part coming out is more elusive. Asking them why the earth is
not burning after billions of years of exposure to the sun, takes them to the
question "where does the energy goes?" A series of Fermi like calculations then
convinces them that storage capabilities are negligible compared to the amount
of energy coming in: the earth necessarily re-emits what it receives.
