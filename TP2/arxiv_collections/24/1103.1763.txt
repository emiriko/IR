V838 Mon erupted at the beginning of 2002. In the course of the outburst the
object evolved to low effective temperatures and declined as a very late M-type
supergiant. Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the
outburst, the most promising is a stellar merger event. We aim at studying the
structure and evolution of the object in the decline from the 2002 eruption. We
obtained spectroscopic observations of V838 Mon in January--March 2009 with
UVES/VLT. The results are analysed and compared with similar observations
obtained in October 2005 with HIRES/Keck. The most striking difference between
2009 and 2005 is a complete absence of the B3V component and of the [FeII]
emission lines in 2009. The present spectrum displays only the spectrum of the
2002 eruption remnant. It resembles that of an M6 giant, although the molecular
bands in V838 Mon are deeper than those in standard stellar spectra of a
similar spectral class. Several atomic lines, which displayed P-Cyg profiles in
2005, are now dominated by pure absorptions. Some of these lines, however, show
a narrow emission component, which, as we argue, measures the radial velocity
of V838 Mon. The resulting heliocentric velocity is 71 km/s, which very well
agrees with the velocity obtained from SiO maser observations. The atomic lines
and the molecular bands show very complex kinematics. In some atomic lines and
high-excitation molecular bands we observe matter infalling in the object
atmosphere. The infall components were already observed in 2005, but were less
pronounced and present in fewer lines than in 2009. We argue that the most
negative radial velocity components seen in the resonance atomic lines and in
the low-excitation molecular bands were formed in the ejecta of the 2002
eruption. The B3V companion most probably became engulfed in an opaque dusty
matter of the 2002 V838 Mon ejecta.
