The 43m telescope at the NRAO site in Green Bank, WV has recently been
outfitted with a clone of the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument
(GUPPI \cite{Ransom:2009}) backend, making it very useful for a number of
pulsar related studies in frequency ranges 800-1600 MHz and 220-440 MHz. Some
of the recent science being done with it include: monitoring of the Crab
pulsar, a blind search for transient sources, pulsar searches of targets of
opportunity, and an all-sky mapping project. For the Crab monitoring project,
regular observations are searched for giant pulses (GPs), which are then
correlated with $\gamma$-ray photons from the \emph{Fermi} spacecraft. Data
from the all-sky mapping project are first run through a pipeline that does a
blind transient search, looking for single pulses over a DM range of 0-500
pc~cm$^{-3}$. These projects are made possible by MIT Lincoln Labs.
