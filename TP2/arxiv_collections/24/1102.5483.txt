In this article, we assume that there exists a pseudoscalar $D_s{\bar
D}_{s0}(2317)$ molecular state and study its mass with the molecule-type
interpolating current in details using the QCD sum rules. The numerical result
disfavors identifying the charmonium-like state Y(4274) as the $D_s{\bar
D}_{s0}(2317)$ molecule.
