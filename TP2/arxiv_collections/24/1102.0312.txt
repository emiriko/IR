Agents buy and sell services. All services are of equal quality. Buyers
choose sellers at random. Monetary and fiscal policies are imposed by a central
bank and a central government. Credit is supplied by a commercial banking
system. Propensities to buy, sell, and lend depend on account balances,
interest rates, tax rates and loan default rates. Computer simulations track
weekly sales, loans, account balances, commercial bank profits, solvency and
compliance with reserve requirements, and government debt.
  The model of this economy is fully specified by a computer program. The
program allows the user to explore the effects of parameter changes. Monetary
and fiscal policies are implemented by choices of parameters such as interest
rates and reserve requirements, and government tax and spending rates. Credit
supply, consumer confidence, and loan default rates strongly affect the
behavior of the economy in terms of sales.
