The ages and masses of neutron stars (NSs) are two fundamental threads that
make pulsars accessible to other sub-disciplines of astronomy and physics. A
realistic and accurate determination of these two derived parameters play an
important role in understanding of advanced stages of stellar evolution and the
physics that govern relevant processes. Here I summarize new constraints on the
ages and masses of NSs with an evolutionary perspective. I show that the
observed P-Pdot demographics is more diverse than what is theoretically
predicted for the standard evolutionary channel. In particular, standard
recycling followed by dipole spin-down fails to reproduce the population of
millisecond pulsars with higher magnetic fields (B > 4 x 10^{8} G) at rates
deduced from observations. A proper inclusion of constraints arising from
binary evolution and mass accretion offers a more realistic insight into the
age distribution. By analytically implementing these constraints, I propose a
"modified" spin-down age for millisecond pulsars that gives estimates closer to
the true age. Finally, I independently analyze the peak, skewness and cutoff
values of the underlying mass distribution from a comprehensive list of radio
pulsars for which secure mass measurements are available. The inferred mass
distribution shows clear peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun for NSs in double
neutron star (DNS) and neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) systems respectively. I
find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for NSs with WD companions, which establishes a
firm lower bound for the maximum mass of NSs.
