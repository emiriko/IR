We analyze dilepton emission from hot and dense matter using a hybrid
approach based on the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD)
transport model with an intermediate hydrodynamic stage for the description of
heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. During the hydrodynamic stage,
the production of lepton pairs is described by radiation rates for a strongly
interacting medium in thermal equilibrium. In the low mass region, hadronic
thermal emission is evaluated assuming vector meson dominance including
in-medium modifications of the rho meson spectral function through scattering
from nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the
hadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes.
Emission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken
into account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic
description breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed.
In this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport
models. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from
long-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass
region of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different
thermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is investigated. We find
that three separated regions can be identified in the invariant mass spectra.
Whereas the very low and the intermediate mass regions mostly receive
contribution from the thermal dilepton emission, the region around the vector
meson peak is dominated by the cascade emission. Above the rho-peak region the
spectrum is driven by QGP radiation. Analysis of the dimuon transverse mass
spectra reveals that the thermal hadronic emission shows an evident mass
ordering not present in the emission from the QGP.
