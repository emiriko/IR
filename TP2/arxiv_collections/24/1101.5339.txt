In this paper we report on the two-year-long Fermi-LAT observation of the
peculiar blazar 4C +21.35 (PKS 1222+216). This source was in a quiescent state
from the start of science operations of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope in
2008 August until 2009 September, and then became more active, with gradually
increasing flux and some moderately-bright flares. In 2010 April and June, 4C
+21.35 underwent a very strong GeV outburst composed of several major flares
characterized by rise and decay timescales of the order of a day. During the
outburst, the GeV spectra of 4C +21.35 displayed a broken power-law form with
spectral breaks observed near 1-3 GeV photon energies. We demonstrate that, at
least during the major flares, the jet in 4C +21.35 carried a total kinetic
luminosity comparable to the total accretion power available to feed the
outflow. We also discuss the origin of the break observed in the flaring
spectra of 4C +21.35. We show that, in principle, a model involving
annihilation of the GeV photons on the He II Lyman recombination continuum and
line emission of "broad line region" clouds may account for such. However, we
also discuss the additional constraint provided by the detection of 4C +21.35
at 0.07-0.4 TeV energies by the MAGIC telescope, which coincided with one of
the GeV flares of the source. We argue that there are reasons to believe that
the $lesssim$,TeV emission of 4C +21.35 (as well as the GeV emission of the
source, if co-spatial), is not likely to be produced inside the broad line
region zone of highest ionization ($sim 10^{17}$,cm from the nucleus), but
instead originates further away from the active center, namely around the
characteristic scale of the hot dusty torus surrounding the 4C +21.35 nucleus
($sim 10^{19}$,cm).
