We prove change of variables formulas [It\^o formulas] for functions of both
arithmetic and geometric averages of geometric fractional Brownian motion. They
are valid for all convex functions, not only for smooth ones. These change of
variables formulas provide us integral representations of functions of average
in the sense of generalized Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral.
