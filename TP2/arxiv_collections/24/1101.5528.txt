Reduction of coating thermal noise is a key issue in precise measurements
with an optical interferometer. A good example of such a measurement device is
a gravitational-wave detector, where each mirror is coated by a few tens of
quarter-wavelength dielectric layers to achieve high reflectivity while the
thermal-noise level increases with the number of layers. One way to realize the
reduction of coating thermal noise, recently proposed by Khalili, is the
mechanical separation of the first few layers from the rest so that a major
part of the fluctuations contributes only little to the phase shift of the
reflected light. Using an etalon, a Fabry-Perot optical resonator of a
monolithic cavity, with a few coating layers on the front and significantly
more on the back surface is a way to realize such a system without too much
complexity, and in this paper we perform a thermal-noise analysis of an etalon
using the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem with probes on both sides of a
finite-size cylindrical mirror.
