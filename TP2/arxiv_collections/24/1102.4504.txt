Phase evolution in (Ag1-xLix)NbO3 (ALN) solid solution was investigated by
X-ray diffraction technique, dielectric and polarization measurements. It is
shown that small substitution of Ag with Li gives rise to an
orthorhombic-rhombohedral structural transformation in ABO3-perovskite silver
niobate at room temperature. Structural refinements indicate that both A- and
B-site displacements contribute to the spontaneous polarization of the
ferroelectric phase with symmetry R3c. Increasing Li-concentration enhances the
ferroelectric rhombohedral distortion, resulting in the increase of the
para-ferroelectric phase transition temperature and the polarization of the
solid solutions.
