We present a method for phase and number squeezing in two-mode Bose systems
using dissipation. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by
considering cold Bose gases trapped in a double-well potential. The extension
of our formalism to an optical lattice gives control of the phase boundaries of
the steady-state phase diagram, and we discover a new phase characterized by a
non-zero condensate fraction and thermal-like particle-number statistics. We
also show how to perform amplitude squeezing in a single-mode system using
dissipation.
