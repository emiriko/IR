In this paper, we reexamine the results of isotope effect experiments of the
conventional monoatomic superconductor (Hg). It is shown clearly that the
isotopic coefficients of mercury can be largely deviated from $\alpha=0.5$, the
standard value suggested by the phonon-mediated BCS pairing theory. According
to the reported experimental results of various mercury isotopes, a giant
isotope effect ($\alpha=2.896$) is numerically found in the data. This study
indicates that the validity of the conventional BCS theory cannot be verified
by the isotope effect.
