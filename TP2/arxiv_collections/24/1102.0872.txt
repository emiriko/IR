We present an extensive analytical study of persistent current in a weakly
disordered two-chain cylindrical ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux $0 <
\phi <\phi_0/2$ (with $\phi_0$ the flux quantum) and described by the Anderson
model. The effect of the disorder reveals a strong reduction of the persistent
current for flux values near $\phi_0/4$.
  In conjunction with the pure system (zeroth order) current profile averaged
over numbers of electrons and earlier results for the effect of disorder in
one-dimensional rings, our two-channel results provide a simple interpretation
of salient features of numerical results of Bouchiat and Montambaux (BM) for
persistent current in an assembly of many-channel disordered rings.
Single-channel (one-dimensional) effects are responsible for the dip in the
persistent obtained by BM near $\phi=0$ and the corresponding peak near
$\phi_0/2$, while the effect of disorder in independent channel pairs accounts
for abrupt decreases of current superimposed to a continuous linear decay as
the flux value $\phi_0/4$ is approached from above and from below,
respectively. The persistent current in the two-channel ring involves a free
particle current averaged over electron numbers of periodicity $\phi_0/2$, and
a dominant disorder effect which has periodicity $\phi_0$.
