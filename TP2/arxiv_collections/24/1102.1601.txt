In the context of a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model in which Minimal Flavour
Violation (MFV) is imposed, one can allow the presence of flavour-blind
CP-violating phases without obtaining electric dipole moments that overcome the
experimental bounds. This choice permits to accommodate the hinted large phase
in the $B_s$ mixing and, at the same time, to soften the observed anomaly in
the relation between $\epsilon_K$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$.
