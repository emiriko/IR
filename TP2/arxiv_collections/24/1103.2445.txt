It is shown that in a simple coupler where one of the waveguides is subject
to controlled losses of the electric field, it is possible to observe optical
analog of the linear and nonlinear quantum Zeno effects. The phenomenon
consists in a counter-intuitive enhancement of transparency of the coupler with
the increase of the dissipation and represents an optical analogue of the
quantum Zeno effect. Experimental realization of the phenomenon based on the
use of the chalcogenide glasses is proposed. The system allows for observation
of the cross-over between the linear and nonlinear Zeno effects, as well as
effective manipulation of light transmission through the coupler.
