Central interactions of 208Pb nuclei at 158 A GeV/c and 32S at 200 A GeV/c
taken with emulsion track detector have been studied using the horizontal
factorial moment method. An evidence for the presence of intermittent behaviour
has been shown. The values of slopes for experimental data are higher than
values from cascade and FRITIOF models. The comparison for other primary nuclei
(28Si) at momenta of 4.5 - 200 A GeV/c has been done.
