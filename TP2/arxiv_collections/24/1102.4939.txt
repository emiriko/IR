An asymptotic solution of the system of Schwinger-Dyson equations for
four-dimensional Euclidean scalar field theory with interaction
$\frac{\lambda}{2}(\phi^*\phi)^2$ is obtained. For
$\lambda>\lambda_{cr}=16\pi^2$ the two-particle amplitude has the
pathology-free asymptotic behavior at large momenta. For $\lambda<\lambda_{cr}$
the amplitude possesses Landau-type singularity.
