In the present survey we present some of the recent results concerning the
geometry of nodal lines of random Gaussian eigenfunctions (in case of spectral
degeneracies) or wavepackets and related issues. The most fundamental example,
where the spectral degeneracy allows us to consider random eigenfunctions (i.e.
endow the eigenspace with Gaussian probability measure), is the sphere, and the
corresponding eigenspaces are the spaces of spherical harmonics; this model is
the primary focus of the present survey. The list of results presented is, by
no means, complete.
