We present a spintronic single photon source which emits circularly polarized
light, where the helicity is determined by an applied magnetic field. Photons
are emitted from an InGaAs quantum dot inside an electrically operated spin
light-emitting diode, which comprises the diluted magnetic semiconductor
ZnMnSe. The circular polarization degree of the emitted light is high, reaching
83% at an applied magnetic field of 2T and 96% at 6 T. Autocorrelation traces
recorded in pulsed operation mode prove the emitted light to be antibunched.
The two circular polarization states could be used for representing quantum
states |0> and |1> in quantum cryptography implementations.
