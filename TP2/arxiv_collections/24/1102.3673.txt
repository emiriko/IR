We show that, under mild conditions on the underlying metric, duals of
appropriately defined anisotropic Voronoi diagrams are embedded triangulations.
Furthermore, they always triangulate the convex hull of the vertices, and have
other properties that parallel those of ordinary Delaunay triangulations. These
results apply to the duals of anisotropic Voronoi diagrams of any set of
vertices, so long as the diagram is orphan-free.
