Global sensitivity analysis is often impracticable for complex and time
demanding numerical models, as it requires a large number of runs. The
reduced-basis approach provides a way to replace the original model by a much
faster to run code. In this paper, we are interested in the information loss
induced by the approximation on the estimation of sensitivity indices. We
present a method to provide a robust error assessment, hence enabling
significant time savings without sacrifice on precision and rigourousness. We
illustrate our method with an experiment where computation time is divided by a
factor of nearly 6. We also give directions on tuning some of the parameters
used in our estimation algorithms.
