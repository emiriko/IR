We introduce a general mechanism for amplitude death in coupled
synchronizable dynamical systems. It is known that when two systems are coupled
directly, they can synchronize under suitable conditions. When an indirect
feedback coupling through an environment or an external system is introduced in
them, it is found to induce a tendency for anti-synchronization. We show that,
for sufficient strengths, these two competing effects can lead to amplitude
death. We provide a general stability analysis that gives the threshold values
for onset of amplitude death. We study in detail the nature of the transition
to death in several specific cases and find that the transitions can be of two
types - continuous and discontinuous. By choosing a variety of dynamics for
example, periodic, chaotic, hyper chaotic, and time-delay systems, we
illustrate that this mechanism is quite general and works for different types
of direct coupling, such as diffusive, replacement, and synaptic couplings and
for different damped dynamics of the environment.
