We publish the survey for galaxies in 20 fields containing ultraviolet bright
quasars (with z_em 0.1 to 0.5) that can be used to study the association
between galaxies and absorption systems from the low-z intergalactic medium
(IGM). The survey is magnitude limited (R~19.5 mag) and highly complete out to
10' from the quasar in each field. It was designed to detect dwarf galaxies (L
~ 0.1 L*) at an impact parameter rho 1Mpc (z=0.1) from a quasar. The complete
sample (all 20 fields) includes R-band photometry for 84718 sources and
confirmed redshifts for 2800 sources. This includes 1198 galaxies with 0.005 <
z < (z_em - 0.01) at a median redshift of 0.18, which may associated with IGM
absorption lines. All of the imaging was acquired with cameras on the Swope 40"
telescope and the spectra were obtained via slitmask observations using the
WFCCD spectrograph on the Dupont 100" telescope at Las Campanas Observatory
(LCO). This paper describes the data reduction, imaging analysis, photometry,
and spectral analysis of the survey. We tabulate the principal measurements for
all sources in each field and provide the spectroscopic dataset online.
