We examine the physical implementation of a discrete time quantum walk with a
four-dimensional coin. Our quantum walker is a photon moving repeatedly through
a time delay loop, with time being our position space. The quantum coin is
implemented using the internal states of the photon: the polarization and two
of the orbital angular momentum states. We demonstrate how to implement this
physically and what components would be needed. We then illustrate some of the
results that could be obtained by performing the experiment.
