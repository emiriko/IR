We demonstrate a technique for achieving spectral resonance between a
polarization-degenerate micropillar cavity mode and an embedded quantum dot
transition. Our approach is based on a combination of isotropic and anisotropic
tensile strain effected by laser-induced surface defects, thereby providing
permanent tuning. Such a technique is a prerequisite for the implementation of
scalable quantum information schemes based on solid-state cavity quantum
electrodynamics.
