We propose a scheme for the creation of stable three dimensional bright
solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates, i.e., the matter-wave analog of
so-called spatio-temporal "light bullets". Off-resonant dressing to Rydberg
$nD$-states is shown to provide nonlocal attractive interactions, leading to
self-trapping of mesoscopic atomic clouds by a collective excitation of a
Rydberg atom pair. We present detailed potential calculations, and demonstrate
the existence of stable solitons under realistic experimental conditions by
means of numerical simulations.
