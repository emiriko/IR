An approximation scheme for model disordered solids is proposed that leads to
the fully analytical evaluation of the elastic constants under explicit account
of the inhomogeneity (nonaffinity) of the atomic displacements. The theory is
in quantitative agreement with simulations for central-force systems and
predicts the vanishing of the shear modulus at the isostatic point with the
linear law {\mu} ~ (z - 2d), where z is the coordination number. The vanishing
of rigidity at the isostatic point is shown to be a consequence of the
canceling out of positive affine and negative nonaffine terms.
