Using the tilted-pulse-intensity-front scheme, we generate single-cycle
terahertz (THz) pulses by optical rectification of femtosecond laser pulses in
LiNbO3. In the THz generation setup, the condition that the image of the
grating coincides with the tilted-optical-pulse front is fulfilled to obtain
optimal THz beam characteristics and pump-to-THz conversion efficiency. The
designed focusing geometry enables tight focus of the collimated THz beam with
a spot size close to the diffraction limit, and the maximum THz electric field
of 1.2 MV/cm is obtained.
