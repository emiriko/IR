We present an improved geometric-distortion solution for the Hubble Space
Telescope UVIS channel of Wide Field Camera 3 for ten broad-band filters. The
solution is made up of three parts: (1) a 3rd-order polynomial to deal with the
general optical distortion, (2) a table of residuals that accounts for both
chip-related anomalies and fine-structure introduced by the filter, and (3) a
linear transformation to put the two chips into a convenient master frame. The
final correction is better than 0.008 pixel (~0.3 mas) in each coordinate. We
provide the solution in two different forms: a FORTRAN subroutine and a set of
fits files, one for each filter/chip/coordinate.
