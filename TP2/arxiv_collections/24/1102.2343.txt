We review the latest progress in understanding the fundamental noise
properties of a coherent single electron emitter known as the mesoscopic
capacitor. The system consists of a sub-micron cavity connected to a
two-dimensional electron gas via a quantum point contact. When subject to
periodic gate voltage modulations, the mesoscopic capacitor absorbs and
re-emits single electrons at giga-hertz frequencies as it has been demonstrated
experimentally. Recent high-frequency noise measurements have moreover allowed
for a precise characterization of the device in different operating regimes.
Here we discuss a simple model of the basic charge transfer processes in the
mesoscopic capacitor and show how the model is capable of fully reproducing the
measured high-frequency noise spectrum. We extend our analysis to the counting
statistics of emitted electrons during a large number of periods which we use
to discuss the accuracy of the mesoscopic capacitor as a single electron
source. Finally, we consider possible applications of the mesoscopic capacitor
in future experiments and identify novel pathways for further theoretical
research.
