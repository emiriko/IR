Lead Selenide (PbSe) is an attractive `IV-VI' semiconductor material to
design optical sensors, lasers and thermoelectric devices. Improved fabrication
of PbSe nanowires (NWs) enables the utilization of low dimensional quantum
effects. The effect of cross-section size (W) and channel orientation on the
bandstructure of PbSe NWs is studied using an 18 band $sp^3d^5$ tight-binding
theory. The bandgap increases almost with the inverse of the W for all the
orientations indicating a weak symmetry dependence. [111] and [110] NWs show
higher ballistic conductance for the conduction and valence band compared to
[100] NWs due to the significant splitting of the projected L-valleys in [100]
NWs.
