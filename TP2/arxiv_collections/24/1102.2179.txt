The Zn-paratacamite family, Zn$_{x}$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$ for $x \,
\geq$ 0.33, is an ideal system for studying spin-1/2 frustrated magnetism in
the form of antiferromagnetic Cu$^{2+}$ kagome planes. Here we report a new
synthesis method by which high quality millimeter-sized single crystals of
Zn-paratacamite have been produced. These crystals have been characterized by
metal analysis, x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and thermodynamic
measurements. The $x$ = 1 member of the series displays a magnetic
susceptibility that is slightly anisotropic at high temperatures with $\chi_{c}
\, > \, \chi_{ab}$. Neutron and synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments
confirm the quality of these $x$ = 1 single crystals and indicate no obvious
structural transition down to temperatures of T=2 K.
