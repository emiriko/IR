Jets are produced from hard scatterings in the early stages of heavy-ion
collisions. It is expected that these high-p$_T$ partons travel through the hot
and dense medium before fragmenting. Therefore they are expected to suffer
energy loss in the QGP via gluon radiation or elastic collisions along their
path. Measurements from full jet reconstruction help in the understanding of
energy loss and its effect{\ss} on the jet structure and energy profile. A
data-driven characterization of the background in Au+Au is needed in order to
compare the results to p+p. The large coverage of the STAR detector along with
an online trigger also allows for reconstructing di-jets. Suitable selection of
trigger jets allows for studying a subset of jets on the recoil side which are
biased towards higher energy loss because of a larger, on average, in-medium
path length traversed. Trigger jets are also used to study jet-hadron
correlations as an independent measurement to assess the effect of energy loss
on the recoil side. We present measurements of di-jets and jet-hadron
correlations in the presence of reconstructed di-jets in Au+Au and p+p at 200
GeV in the STAR experiment.
