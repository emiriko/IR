Robust advances in interactome analysis demand comprehensive, non-redundant
and consistently annotated datasets. By non-redundant, we mean that the
accounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each
independent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less.
While many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them
contains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition,
the annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often
disagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while
consolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including
interactions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein
nomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in
comprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all
information/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform
additional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals.
  To address issues with iRefIndex and to achieve our goals, we have developed
ppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant,
consistently annotated datasets of physical interactions. Our script proceeds
in three stages: mapping all interactants to gene identifiers and removing all
undesired raw interactions, deflating potentially expanded complexes, and
reconciling for each interaction the annotation labels among different source
databases. As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal
datasets: yeast, human and fruitfly. While ppiTrim can resolve most apparent
conflicts between different labelings, we also discovered some unresolvable
disagreements mostly resulting from different annotation policies among
repositories.
