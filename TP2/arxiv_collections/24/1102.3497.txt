It is pointed out that the unmagnetized inhomogeneous plasmas can support a
low frequency electromagnetic ion wave as a normal mode like Alfven wave of
magnetized plasmas. But this is a coupled mode produced by the mixing of
longitudinal and transverse components of perturbed electric field due to
density inhomogeneity. The ion acoustic wave does not remain electrostatic in
non-uniform plasmas. On the other hand, a low frequency electrostatic wave can
also exist in the pure electron plasmas. But the magnetic field fluctuations in
both electron as well as in electron-ion plasmas are coupled with the
electrostatic perturbations in unmagnetized case. The main instability
condition for these low frequency electrostatic and electromagnetic modes is
the same ${2/3}\kappa_n < \kappa_T$ (where $\kappa_n$ and $\kappa_T$ are
inverse of the scale lengths of density and electron temperature,
respectively).
