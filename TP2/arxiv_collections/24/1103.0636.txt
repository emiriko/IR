The analysis of the recent experimental data on charged-current
neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections measured at MiniBooNE requires fully
relativistic theoretical descriptions also accounting for the role of final
state interactions. In this work we evaluate inclusive quasielastic
differential neutrino cross sections within the framework of the relativistic
impulse approximation. Results based on the relativistic mean field potential
are compared with the ones corresponding to the relativistic Green function
approach. An analysis of scaling and superscaling properties provided by both
models is also presented.
