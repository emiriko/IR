The regional contribution to the geo-neutrino signal at Gran Sasso National
Laboratory (LNGS) was determined based on a detailed geological, geochemical
and geophysical study of the region. U and Th abundances of more than 50
samples representative of the main lithotypes belonging to the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic sedimentary cover were analyzed. Sedimentary rocks were grouped into
four main "Reservoirs" based on similar paleogeographic conditions and
mineralogy. Basement rocks do not outcrop in the area. Thus U and Th in the
Upper and Lower Crust of Valsugana and Ivrea-Verbano areas were analyzed. Based
on geological and geophysical properties, relative abundances of the various
reservoirs were calculated and used to obtain the weighted U and Th abundances
for each of the three geological layers (Sedimentary Cover, Upper and Lower
Crust). Using the available seismic profile as well as the stratigraphic
records from a number of exploration wells, a 3D modelling was developed over
an area of 2^{\circ}x2^{\circ} down to the Moho depth, for a total volume of
about 1.2x10^6 km^3. This model allowed us to determine the volume of the
various geological layers and eventually integrate the Th and U contents of the
whole crust beneath LNGS. On this base the local contribution to the
geo-neutrino flux (S) was calculated and added to the contribution given by the
rest of the world, yielding a Refined Reference Model prediction for the
geo-neutrino signal in the Borexino detector at LNGS: S(U) = (28.7 \pm 3.9) TNU
and S(Th) = (7.5 \pm 1.0) TNU. An excess over the total flux of about 4 TNU was
previously obtained by Mantovani et al. (2004) who calculated, based on general
worldwide assumptions, a signal of 40.5 TNU. The considerable thickness of the
sedimentary rocks, almost predominantly represented by U- and Th- poor
carbonatic rocks in the area near LNGS, is responsible for this difference.
