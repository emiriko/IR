We investigate the low-field phonon-limited mobility in armchair graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs) using full-band electron and phonon dispersion relations. We
show that lateral confinement suppresses the intrinsic mobility of GNRs to
values typical of common bulk semiconductors, and very far from the impressive
experiments on 2D graphene. Suspended GNRs with a width of 1 nm exhibit a
mobility close to 500 cm^2/Vs at room temperature, whereas if the same GNRs are
deposited on HfO2 mobility is further reduced to about 60 cm^2/Vs due to
surface phonons. We also show the occurrence of polaron formation, leading to
band gap renormalization of ~118 meV for 1 nm-wide armchair GNRs.
