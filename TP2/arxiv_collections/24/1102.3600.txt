In this paper we show the consequences of a principle, according to which the
dynamics of the Universe must not depend on the number of the particles of
which it is composed. The validity of such a principle lead us to the
conclusion that inertia and intrinsic angular momenta are deeply interrelated
between them. In particular, assuming the principles outlined in the paper,
matter must be composed by fermions, all stable bosons must be vectors and
massless and no scalar particles can exist in the Universe. We also apply the
results to the holographic principle and found established results more
naturally with respect to previous approaches as well as new predictions about
the Unruh effect.
