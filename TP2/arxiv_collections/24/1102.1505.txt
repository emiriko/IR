The $K K\bar K$ system is investigated with a coupled channel approach based
on solving the Faddeev equations considering the $KK\bar K$, $K\pi\pi$ and
$K\pi\eta$ channels and using as input two-body $t$-matrices that generate
dynamically the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ resonances. In the present
calculation, a quasibound state around 1420 MeV with total isospin $I=1/2$ and
spin-parity $J^\pi=0^-$ is found below the three kaon threshold. This state can
be identified with the K(1460) resonance listed by the Particle Data Group. We
also study the $KK\bar K$ system in a single channel three-body potential model
with two-body effective $KK$ and $K\bar K$ interactions, in which the $K\bar K$
interaction is adjusted to reproduce the properties of the $f_0(980)$ and
$a_0(980)$ resonances as $K\bar K$ bound states, obtaining a very similar
result to the one found in the Faddeev approach.
