We study the possibility to analyse the data on inclusive prompt photon
production at first LHC runs in the framework of the kt-factorization QCD
approach. Our consideration is based on the amplitude for the production of a
single photon associated with a quark pair in the fusion of two off-shell
gluons. The quark component is taken into account separately using the
quark-gluon Compton scatterring and quark-antiquark annihilation QCD
subprocesses. The unintegrated parton densities in a proton are determined
using the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR) prescription as well as the CCFM evolution
equation.
