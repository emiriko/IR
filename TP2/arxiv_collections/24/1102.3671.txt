Traditional numerical techniques for solving time-dependent
partial-differential-equation (PDE) initial-value problems (IVPs) store a
truncated representation of the function values and some number of their time
derivatives at each time step. Although redundant in the dx->0 limit, what if
spatial derivatives were also stored? This paper presents an iterated,
multipoint differential transform method (IMDTM) for numerically evolving PDE
IVPs. Using this scheme, it is demonstrated that stored spatial derivatives can
be propagated in an efficient and self-consistent manner; and can effectively
contribute to the evolution procedure in a way which can confer several
advantages, including aiding solution verification. Lastly, in order to
efficiently implement the IMDTM scheme, a generalized finite-difference stencil
formula is derived which can take advantage of multiple higher-order spatial
derivatives when computing even-higher-order derivatives. As is demonstrated,
the performance of these techniques compares favorably to other explicit
evolution schemes in terms of speed, memory footprint and accuracy.
