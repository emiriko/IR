We present a generalisation of the Brill-type proof of positivity of mass for
axisymmetric initial data to initial data sets with black hole boundaries. The
argument leads to a strictly positive lower bound for the mass of simply
connected, connected axisymmetric black hole data sets in terms of the mass of
a reference Schwarzschild metric.
