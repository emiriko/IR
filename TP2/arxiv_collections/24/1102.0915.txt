We propose a new law for the deceleration parameter that varies linearly with
time and covers Berman's law where it is constant. Our law not only allows one
to generalize many exact solutions that were obtained assuming constant
deceleration parameter, but also gives a better fit with data (from SNIa, BAO
and CMB), particularly concerning the late time behavior of the universe.
According to our law only the spatially closed and flat universes are allowed;
in both cases the cosmological fluid we obtain exhibits quintom like behavior
and the universe ends with a big-rip. This is a result consistent with recent
cosmological observations.
