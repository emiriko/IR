Effect of magnetic field on chiral symmetry breaking in a 3-flavor Nambu Jona
Lasinio (NJL) model at finite temperature and densities is considered here
using an explicit structure of ground state in terms of quark and antiquark
condensates. While at zero chemical potential and finite temperature, magnetic
field enhances the condensates, at zero temperature, the critical chemical
potential decreases with increasing magnetic field.
