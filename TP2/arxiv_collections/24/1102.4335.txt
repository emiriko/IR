Based on the ultraviolet to far-infrared photometry already compiled and
presented in a companion paper (Barro et al. 2011a, Paper I), we present a
detailed SED analysis of nearly 80,000 IRAC 3.6+4.5 micron selected galaxies in
the Extended Groth Strip. We estimate photometric redshifts, stellar masses,
and star formation rates separately for each galaxy in this large sample. The
catalog includes 76,936 sources with [3.6] < 23.75 (85% completeness level of
the IRAC survey) over 0.48 square degrees. The typical photometric redshift
accuracy is Delta z/(1+z)=0.034, with a catastrophic outlier fraction of just
2%. We quantify the systematics introduced by the use of different stellar
population synthesis libraries and IMFs in the calculation of stellar masses.
We find systematic offsets ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 dex, with a typical scatter
of 0.3 dex. We also provide UV- and IR-based SFRs for all sample galaxies,
based on several sets of dust emission templates and SFR indicators. We
evaluate the systematic differences and goodness of the different SFR
estimations using the deep FIDEL 70 micron data available in the EGS. Typical
random uncertainties of the IR-bases SFRs are a factor of two, with
non-negligible systematic effects at z$\gtrsim$1.5 observed when only MIPS 24
micron data is available. All data products (SEDs, postage stamps from imaging
data, and different estimations of the photometric redshifts, stellar masses,
and SFRs of each galaxy) described in this and the companion paper are publicly
available, and they can be accessed through our the web-interface utility
