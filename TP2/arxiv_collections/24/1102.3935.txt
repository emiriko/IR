Bi2Se3 is a topological insulator with metallic surface states residing in a
large bulk bandgap. It is believed that Bi2Se3 gets additional n-type doping
after exposure to atmosphere, thereby reducing the relative contribution of
surface states in total conductivity. In this letter, transport measurements on
Bi2Se3 nanoribbons provide additional evidence of such environmental doping
process. Systematic surface composition analyses by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy reveal fast formation and continuous growth of native oxide on
Bi2Se3 under ambient conditions. In addition to n-type doping at the surface,
such surface oxidation is likely the material origin of the degradation of
topological surface states. Appropriate surface passivation or encapsulation
may be required to probe topological surface states of Bi2Se3 by transport
measurements.
