We study Drell-Yan production at the LHC in low-scale quantum gravity models
with extra dimensions. Asymptotic safety implies that the ultra-violet behavior
of gravity is dictated by a fixed point. We show how the energy dependence of
Newton's coupling regularizes the gravitational amplitude using a
renormalization group improvement. We study LHC predictions and find that
Kaluza-Klein graviton signals are well above Standard Model backgrounds. This
leaves a significant sensitivity to the energy scale Lambda_T where the
gravitational couplings cross over from classical to fixed point scaling.
