Many new physics models predict the existence of TeV-scale charged gauge
boson $W^\prime$ together with Higgs boson(s). We study the $W^\prime WH$
interaction and explore the angular distribution of charged lepton to
distinguish $W_R^\prime WH$ from $W_L^\prime WH$ in $pp\to HW\to b \bar b l
\nu$ process at the LHC. It is found that a new type forward-backward
asymmetry($A_{FB}$) relating to the angle between the direction of the charged
lepton in $W$ rest frame and that of the reconstructed $W^\prime$ in laboratory
frame is useful to investigate the properties of $W^\prime W H$ interaction. We
analyze the Standard Model backgrounds and develop a set of cuts to highlight
the signal and suppress the backgrounds at LHC. We find that $A_{FB}$ can reach
0.03(-0.07) for $W_R^\prime$($W_L^\prime$) production at $\sqrt{S}=14$ TeV.
