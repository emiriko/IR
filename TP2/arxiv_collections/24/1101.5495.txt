Impact of EEG biofeedback on event-related potentials (ERPs) in
attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) children. Introduction: ADHD is one of
the most widely spread condition of school aged children affecting 5% of
children of this age.The core clinical signs of ADHD are inattention,
restlessness and impulsivity. According to various authors direct measures of
attention are of two types: 1. Recording the alpha rhythm on the EEG and
event-related potentials (ERP); 2. Tests of reaction time, continuous
performance tests, paired associated learning, and tests of memorization; The
second one is evidence-based. As for the first one it is known that ERPs
especially of those with later response reflect the process of mental
effortfullness to select the appropriate behavior and accomplish decision
making during the action of target stimulus. Thus selection of action as well
as decision making is the most important points affected in ADHD children.
Besides in recent years EEG biofeedback (Neurofeedback) have become the
evidence-based in the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately the effectiveness of
this approach on ERPs parameters is still unknown. Thus we aimed to study the
changes of ERPs after neurofeedback therapy. Methods: We have examined 16
children with ADHD before- and after 3- sessions of neurofeedback therapy and
23 without treatment. Results: We have observed statistically significant
improvement of parameters of later response like P300 in treated children
compared with untreated ones whereas the treatment was non effective for
earlier components of ERPs. Conclusions: Neurofeedback can affect on the
process of selection of action and decision making by means of changing of P300
parameters in ADHDchildren.
