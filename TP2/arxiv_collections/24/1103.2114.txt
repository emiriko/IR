This paper proves that if $E$ is a field, such that the Galois group
$\mathcal{G}(E(p)/E)$ of the maximal $p$-extension $E(p)/E$ is a Demushkin
group of finite rank $r(p)_{E} \ge 3$, for some prime number $p$, then
$\mathcal{G}(E(p)/E)$ does not possess nontrivial proper decomposition groups.
When $r(p)_{E} = 2$, it describes the decomposition groups of
$\mathcal{G}(E(p)/E)$. The paper shows that if $(K, v)$ is a $p$-Henselian
valued field with $r(p)_{K} \in \mathbb N$ and a residue field of
characteristic $p$, then $P \cong \widetilde P$ or $P$ is presentable as a
semidirect product $\mathbb Z_{p}^{\tau} \rtimes \widetilde P$, for some $\tau
\in \mathbb N$, where $\widetilde P$ is a Demushkin group of rank $\ge 3$ or a
free pro-$p$-group. It also proves that when $\widetilde P$ is of the former
type, it is continuously isomorphic to $\mathcal{G}(K ^{\prime}(p)/K
^{\prime})$, for some local field $K ^{\prime}$ containing a primitive $p$-th
root of unity.
