Nonlocality and quantum entanglement constitute two special aspects of the
quantum correlations existing in quantum systems, which are of paramount
importance in quantum-information theory. Traditionally, they have been
regarded as identical (equivalent, in fact, for pure two qubit states, that is,
{\it Gisin's Theorem}), yet they constitute different resources. Describing
nonlocality by means of the violation of several Bell inequalities, we obtain
by direct optimization those states of two qubits that maximally violate a Bell
inequality, in terms of their degree of mixture as measured by either their
participation ratio $R=1/Tr(\rho^2)$ or their maximum eigenvalue
$\lambda_{max}$. This optimum value is obtained as well, which coincides with
previous results. Comparison with entanglement is performed too. An example of
an application is given in the XY model. In this novel approximation, we also
concentrate on the nonlocality for linear combinations of pure states of two
qubits, providing a closed form for their maximal nonlocality measure. The case
of Bell diagonal mixed states of two qubits is also extensively studied.
Special attention concerning the connection between nonlocality and
entanglement for mixed states of two qubits is paid to the so called maximally
entangled mixed states. Additional aspects for the case of two qubits are also
described in detail. Since we deal with qubit systems, we will perform an
analogous study for three qubits, employing similar tools. Relation between
distillability and nonlocality is explored quantitatively for the whole space
of states of three qubits. We finally extend our analysis to four qubit
systems, where nonlocality for generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states
of arbitrary number of parties is computed.
