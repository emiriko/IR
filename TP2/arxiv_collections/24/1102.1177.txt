Observations with the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes H.E.S.S.,
MAGIC, CANGAROO III and VERITAS have shown that the Universe is more
transparent than expected to gamma rays above 100GeV. As a natural explanation,
the DARMA scenario has previously been proposed, wherein photons can oscillate
into a new very light axionlike particle and vice-versa in the presence of
cosmic magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that the most recent observations
further support the DARMA scenario, thereby making the existence of a very
light axion-like particle more likely.
