The standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description of the plasma in the hot,
magnetized gas of the intra-cluster (ICM) medium is not adequate because it is
weakly collisional. In such collisionless magnetized gas, the microscopic
velocity distribution of the particles is not isotropic, giving rise to kinetic
effects on the dynamical scales. These kinetic effects could be important in
understanding the turbulence, as so as the amplification and maintenance of the
magnetic fields in the ICM. It is possible to formulate fluid models for
collisonless or weakly collisional gas by introducing modifications in the MHD
equations. These models are often referred as kinetic MHD (KMHD). Using a KMHD
model based on the CGL-closure, which allows the adiabatic evolution of the two
components of the pressure tensor (the parallel and perpendicular components
with respect to the local magnetic field), we performed 3D numerical
simulations of forced turbulence in order to study the amplification of an
initially weak seed magnetic field. We found that the growth rate of the
magnetic energy is comparable to that of the ordinary MHD turbulent dynamo, but
the magnetic energy saturates in a level smaller than of the MHD case. We also
found that a necessary condition for the dynamo works is to impose limits to
the anisotropy of the pressure.
