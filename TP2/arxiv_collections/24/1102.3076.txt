We consider the stochastic transport linear equation and we prove existence
and uniqueness of weak $L^{p}-$solutions. Moreover, we obtain a representation
of the general solution and a Wong-Zakai principle for this equation. We make
only minimal assumptions, similar to the deterministic problem. The proof is
supported on the generalized It\^o-Ventzel-Kunita formula (see 15) and the
theory of Lions-DiPerna on transport linear equation (see 9).
