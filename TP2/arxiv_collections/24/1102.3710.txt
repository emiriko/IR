We study the boundedness of Toeplitz-type operators defined in the context of
the Calder\'on reproducing formula considering the specific wavelets whose
Fourier transforms are related to Laguerre polynomials. Some sufficient
conditions for simultaneous boundedness of these Calder\'on-Toeplitz operators
on each wavelet subspace for unbounded symbols are given, where investigating
the behavior of certain sequence of iterated integrals of symbols is helpful. A
number of examples and counterexamples is given.
