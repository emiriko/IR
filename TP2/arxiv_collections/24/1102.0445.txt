We compute the channel capacity of non-binary fingerprinting under the
Marking Assumption, in the limit of large coalition size c. The solution for
the binary case was found by Huang and Moulin. They showed that asymptotically,
the capacity is $1/(c^2 2\ln 2)$, the interleaving attack is optimal and the
arcsine distribution is the optimal bias distribution. In this paper we prove
that the asymptotic capacity for general alphabet size q is $(q-1)/(c^2 2\ln
q)$. Our proof technique does not reveal the optimal attack or bias
distribution. The fact that the capacity is an increasing function of q shows
that there is a real gain in going to non-binary alphabets.
