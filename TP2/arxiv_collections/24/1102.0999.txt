To better understand the allowed range of black hole geometries, we study
Weyl-distorted Schwarzschild solutions. They always contain trapped surfaces, a
singularity and an isolated horizon and so should be understood to be
(geometric) black holes. However we show that for large distortions the
isolated horizon is neither a future outer trapping horizon (FOTH) nor even a
marginally trapped surface: slices of the horizon cannot be infinitesimally
deformed into (outer) trapped surfaces. We consider the implications of this
result for popular quasilocal definitions of black holes.
