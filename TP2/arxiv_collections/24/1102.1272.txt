The problem of persistence of four-frequency tori is considered in models
represented by the coupled periodically driven self-oscillators. We show that
the adding the third oscillator gives rise to destruction of the
three-frequency tori, with appearance of regions of either chaotic attractors
or four-frequency tori. As the coupling strength decreases, the four-frequency
tori dominate, and the amplitude threshold of their occurrence vanishes. Also,
for three oscillators, a domain of complete synchronization of the system by
the external driving can disappear.
