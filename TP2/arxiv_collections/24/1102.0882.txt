The compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the future FAIR
accelerator facility near Darmstadt, Germany, aims at the investigation of
baryonic matter at highest net baryon densities but moderate temperatures, by
colliding heavy-ions at beam energies from 10 to 45 A GeV. The research program
comprises the exploration of some basic landmarks of the QCD phase diagram like
transitions from hadronic to partonic phase, the region of first order
de-confinement as well as chiral phase transition, and the critical end point.
The proposed key observables include the measurement of low mass vector mesons
and charmonia, which can be detected via their decay into the di-lepton
channel. As the decayed leptons leave the hot and dense fireball without
further interactions, hence they provide almost unscathed information about the
interior of the collision zone where they are being created. In this paper, we
discuss the physics motivation, detector concepts, and the feasibility studies
in the di-muon measurements for central Au + Au collisions, with a special
reference to the detailed simulation activities performed by the CBM muon
group.We also discuss the R&D activities of detector in brief.
