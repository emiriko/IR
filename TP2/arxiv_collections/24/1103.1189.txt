In the present work we examined the hypothesis that, a core mass function
(CMF), such as the one deduced for cores in the Orion molecular cloud (OMC),
could possibly be the primogenitor of the stellar initial mass function (IMF).
Using the rate of accretion of a protostar from its natal core as a free
parameter, we demonstrate its quintessential role in determining the shape of
the IMF. By varying the rate of accretion, we show that a stellar mass
distribution similar to the universal IMF could possibly be generated starting
from either a typical CMF such as the one for the OMC, or a uniform
distribution of prestellar core masses which leads us to suggest, the apparent
similarity in shapes of the CMF and the IMF is perhaps, only incidental. The
apodosis of the argument being, complex physical processes leading to stellar
birth are crucial in determining the final stellar masses, and consequently,
the shape of stellar mass distribution. This work entails partial Monte-Carlo
treatment of the problem, and starting with a randomly picked sample of cores,
and on the basis of classical arguments which include protostellar feedback and
cooling due to emission from warm dust, a theoretical distribution of stellar
masses is derived for five realisations of the problem; the magnetic field,
though, has been left out of this exercise.
