We present the results of a ground-based, high spatial resolution infrared 18
micron imaging study of nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), using the
Subaru 8.2-m and Gemini South 8.1-m telescopes. The diffraction-limited images
routinely achieved with these telescopes in the Q-band (17-23 micron) allow us
to investigate the detailed spatial distribution of infrared emission in these
LIRGs. We then investigate whether the emission surface brightnesses are
modest, as observed in starbursts, or are so high that luminous active galactic
nuclei (AGNs; high emission surface brightness energy sources) are indicated.
The sample consists of 18 luminous buried AGN candidates and
starburst-classified LIRGs identified in earlier infrared spectroscopy. We find
that the infrared 18 micron emission from the buried AGN candidates is
generally compact, and the estimated emission surface brightnesses are high,
sometimes exceeding the maximum value observed in and theoretically predicted
for a starburst phenomenon. The starburst-classified LIRGs usually display
spatially extended 18 micron emission and the estimated emission surface
brightnesses are modest, within the range sustained by a starburst phenomenon.
The general agreement between infrared spectroscopic and imaging energy
diagnostic methods suggests that both are useful tools for understanding the
hidden energy sources of the dusty LIRG population.
