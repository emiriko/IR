Compelling evidence has recently emerged from lattice simulations in favor of
the massive solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of Landau-gauge QCD. The
main objections to these lattice results are based on possible Gribov-copy
effects. We recently installed at IFSC-USP a new GPU cluster dedicated to the
study of Green's functions. We present here our point of view on the Saga and
the status of our project. We also show data for the 2D case on a 2560^2
lattice.
