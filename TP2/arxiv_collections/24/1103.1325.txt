Studies of transiting extrasolar planets offer an unique opportunity to get
to know the internal structure of those worlds. The transiting exoplanet XO-5 b
was found to have an anomalously high Safronov number and surface gravity. Our
aim was to refine parameters of this intriguing system and search for signs of
transit timing variations. We gathered high-precision light curves of two
transits of XO-5 b. Assuming three different limb darkening laws, we found the
best-fitting model and redetermined parameters of the system, including
planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter and central time of transits.
Error estimates were derived by the prayer bead method and Monte Carlo
simulations. Although system's parameters obtained by us were found to agree
with previous studies within one sigma, the planet was found to be notable
smaller with the radius of 1.03+0.06-0.05 Jupiter radii. Our results confirm
the high Safronov number and surface gravity of the planet. With two new
mid-transit times, the ephemeris was refined to BJD(TDB)=(2454485.66842 \pm
0.00028) + (4.1877537 \pm 0.000017) E. No significant transit timing variation
was detected.
