In this paper we present an econophysic model for the description of shares
transactions in a capital market. For introducing the fundamentals of this
model we used an analogy between the electrical field produced by a system of
charges and the overall of economic and financial information of the shares
transactions from the stock-markets. An energetic approach of the rate
variation for the shares traded on the financial markets was proposed and
studied.
