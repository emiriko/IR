We introduce a general framework to study dipole-dipole energy transfer
between an emitter and an absorber in a nanostructured environment. The theory
allows us to address F\"orster Resonant Energy Transfer (FRET) between a donor
and an acceptor in the presence of a nanoparticle with an anisotropic
electromagnetic response. In the particular case of a magneto-optical
anisotropy, we compute the generalized FRET rate and discuss the orders of
magnitude. The distance dependence, the FRET efficiency and the sensitivity to
the orientation of the transition dipoles orientation differ from standard FRET
and can be controlled using the static magnetic field as an external parameter.
