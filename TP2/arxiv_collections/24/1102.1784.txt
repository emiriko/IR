Extensive efforts are currently being devoted to developing a new electronic
technology, called spintronics, where the spin of electrons is explored to
carry information. [1,2] Several techniques have been developed to generate
pure spin currents in many materials and structures. [3-10] However, there is
still no method available that can be used to directly detect pure spin
currents, which carry no net charge current and no net magnetization.
Currently, studies of pure spin currents rely on measuring the induced spin
accumulation with optical techniques [5, 11-13] or spin-valve configurations.
[14-17] However, the spin accumulation does not directly reflect the spatial
distribution or temporal dynamics of the pure spin current, and therefore
cannot monitor the pure spin current in a real-time and real-space fashion.
This imposes severe constraints on research in this field. Here we demonstrate
a second-order nonlinear optical effect of the pure spin current. We show that
such a nonlinear optical effect, which has never been explored before, can be
used for the non-invasive, non-destructive, and real-time imaging of pure spin
currents. Since this detection scheme does not rely on optical resonances, it
can be generally applied in a wide range of materials with different electronic
bandstructures. Furthermore, the control of nonlinear optical properties of
materials with pure spin currents may have potential applications in photonics
integrated with spintronics.
