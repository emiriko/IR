We study different notions of quasiconvexity for a subgroup $H$ of a
relatively hyperbolic group $G.$ The first result establishes equivalent
conditions for $H$ to be relatively quasiconvex. As a corollary we obtain that
the relative quasiconvexity is equivalent to the dynamical quasiconvexity. This
answers to a question posed by D. Osin \cite{Os06}. In the second part of the
paper we prove that a subgroup $H$ of a finitely generated relatively
hyperbolic group $G$ acts cocompactly outside its limit set if and only if it
is (absolutely) quasiconvex and every its infinite intersection with a
parabolic subgroup of $G$ has finite index in the parabolic subgroup.
Consequently we obtain a list of different subgroup properties and establish
relations between them.
