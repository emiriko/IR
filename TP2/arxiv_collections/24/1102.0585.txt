Motivated by an equation arising in magnetohydrodynamics, we prove that
Holder continuous weak solutions of a nonlinear parabolic equation with
singular drift velocity are classical solutions. The result is proved using the
space-time Besov spaces introduced by Chemin and Lerner, combined with energy
estimates, without any minimality assumption on the Holder exponent of the weak
solutions.
