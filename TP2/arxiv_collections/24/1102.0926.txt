We investigate adiabatic quantum pumping through a normal
metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junction in a monolayer of graphene. The
pumped current is generated by periodic modulation of two gate voltages,
applied to the insulating and superconducting regions respectively. In the
bilinear response regime and in the limit of a thin high insulating barrier, we
find that the presence of the superconductor enhances the pumped current per
mode by a factor of 4 at resonance. Compared to the pumped current in an
analogous semiconductor NIS junction, the resonances have a $\pi/2$ phase
difference. We also predict experimentally distinguishable differences between
the pumped current and the tunneling conductance in graphene NIS junctions.
