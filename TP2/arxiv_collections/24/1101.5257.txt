When there are multiple node failures in a distributed storage system,
regenerating the failed storage nodes individually in a one-by-one manner is
suboptimal as far as repair-bandwidth minimization is concerned. If data
exchange among the newcomers is enabled, we can get a better tradeoff between
repair bandwidth and the storage per node. An explicit and optimal construction
of cooperative regenerating code is illustrated.
