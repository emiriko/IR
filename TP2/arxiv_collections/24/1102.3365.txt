An update of B(E2) evaluation for even-even Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn nuclei has been
presented. Current update is a continuation of S. Raman work on B(E2) values
and was motivated by large numbers of new measurements. It extends the previous
evaluation from 20 to 38 nuclei and includes comprehensive shell model
analysis. Evaluation policies for analysis of experimental data have been
discussed. Future plans for complete B(E2;0+1 -> 2+1) evaluation of even-even
nuclei are outlined.
