We compute E1 transitions and electric radii in the Beryllium-11 nucleus
using an effective field theory that exploits the separation of scales in this
halo system. We fix the leading-order parameters of the EFT from measured data
on the 1/2+ and 1/2- levels in Be-11 and the B(E1) strength for the transition
between them. We then obtain predictions for the B(E1) strength for Coulomb
dissociation of the Be-11 nucleus to the continuum. We also compute the charge
radii of the 1/2+ and 1/2- states. Agreement with experiment within the
expected accuracy of a leading-order computation in this EFT is obtained. We
also discuss how next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections involving both s-wave
and p-wave neutron-Be-10 interactions affect our results, and display the NLO
predictions for quantities which are free of additional short-distance
operators at this order. Information on neutron-Be-10 scattering in the
relevant channels is inferred.
