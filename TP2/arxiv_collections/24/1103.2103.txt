Using the density matrix renormalization group, we investigate the Renyi
entropy of the anisotropic spin-s Heisenberg chains in a z-magnetic field. We
considered the half-odd integer spin-s chains, with s=1/2,3/2 and 5/2, and
periodic and open boundary conditions. In the case of the spin-1/2 chain we
were able to obtain accurate estimates of the new parity exponents
$p_{\alpha}^{(p)}$ and $p_{\alpha}^{(o)}$ that gives the power-law decay of the
oscillations of the $\alpha-$Renyi entropy for periodic and open boundary
conditions, respectively. We confirm the relations of these exponents with the
Luttinger parameter $K$, as proposed by Calabrese et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,
095701 (2010)]. Moreover, the predicted periodicity of the oscillating term was
also observed for some non-zero values of the magnetization $m$. We show that
for $s>1/2$ the amplitudes of the oscillations are quite small, and get
accurate estimates of $p_{\alpha}^{(p)}$ and $p_{\alpha}^{(o)}$ become a
challenge. Although our estimates of the new universal exponents
$p_{\alpha}^{(p)}$ and $p_{\alpha}^{(o)}$ for the spin-3/2 chain are not so
accurate, they are consistent with the theoretical predictions.
