We have used Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE)-based delta doping technology to
demonstrate near 100% internal quantum efficiency (QE) on silicon
electron-multiplied Charge Coupled Devices (EMCCDs) for single photon counting
detection applications. Furthermore, we have used precision techniques for
depositing antireflection (AR) coatings by employing Atomic Layer Deposition
(ALD) and demonstrated over 50% external QE in the far and near-ultraviolet in
megapixel arrays. We have demonstrated that other device parameters such as
dark current are unchanged after these processes. In this paper, we report on
these results and briefly discuss the techniques and processes employed.
