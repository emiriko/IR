Asteroseismology of solar-type stars has an important part to play in the
exoplanet program of the NASA Kepler Mission. Precise and accurate inferences
on the stellar properties that are made possible by the seismic data allow very
tight constraints to be placed on the exoplanetary systems. Here, we outline
how to make an estimate of the detectability of solar-like oscillations in any
given Kepler target, using rough estimates of the temperature and radius, and
the Kepler apparent magnitude.
