The Spiegelungssatz is an inequality between the (4)-ranks of the narrow
ideal class groups of the quadratic fields (\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})) and
(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})). We provide a combinatorial proof of this inequality.
Our interpretation gives an affine system of equations that allows to describe
precisely some equality cases.
