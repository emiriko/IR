The detection of galactic supernova (SN) neutrinos represents one of the
future frontiers of low-energy neutrino physics and astrophysics. The neutron
coherence of neutral currents (NC) allows quite large cross sections in the
case of neutron rich targets, which can be exploited in detecting earth and sky
neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoils. A core-collapse supernova represents
one of the most powerful source of (anti)neutrinos in the Universe. These (NC)
cross sections are not dependent on flavor conversions and, thus, their
measurement will provide useful information about the neutrino source. In
particular the case of SN they will yield information about the primary
neutrino fluxes, i.e. before flavor conversions in neutrino sphere. The
advantages of large gaseous low threshold and high resolution time projection
counters (TPC) detectors TPC detectors will be discussed. These are especially
promising since they are expected to be relatively cheap and easy to maintain.
The information thus obtained can also be useful to other flavor sensitive
detectors, e.g. the large liquid scintillation detectors like LENA. All
together such detectors will provide invaluable information on the astrophysics
of core-collapse explosion and on the neutrino mixing parameters. In
particular, neutrino flavor transitions in SN envelope might be sensitive to
the value of theta-{13} and to the unknown neutrino mass hierarchy. Till a real
SN explosion is detected, one can use available earth neutrino sources with
similar energy spectra to test the behavior of these detectors. Among them, the
ORNL Neutron Spallation source (SNS) and boosted radioactive neutrino beams are
good candidates.
