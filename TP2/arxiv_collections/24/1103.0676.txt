The probability theory is a well-studied branch of mathematics, in order to
carry out formal reasoning about probability. Thus, it is important to have a
logic, both for computation of probabilities and for reasoning about
probabilities, with a well-defined syntax and semantics. Both current
approaches, based on Nilsson's probability structures/logics, and on linear
inequalities in order to reason about probabilities, have some weak points. In
this paper we have presented the complete revision of both approaches. We have
shown that the full embedding of Nilsson'probabilistic structure into
propositional logic results in a truth-functional many-valued logic,
differently from Nilsson's intuition and current considerations about
propositional probabilistic logic. Than we have shown that the logic for
reasoning about probabilities can be naturally embedded into a 2-valued
intensional FOL with intensional abstraction, by avoiding current ad-hoc system
composed of two different 2-valued logics: one for the classical propositional
logic at lower-level, and a new one at higher-level for probabilistic
constraints with probabilistic variables. The obtained theoretical results are
applied to Probabilistic Logic Programming.
