Model dependence of multipole analysis has been explored through
energy-dependent and single-energy fits to pion photoproduction data. The MAID
energy-dependent solution has been used as input for an event generator
producing realistic pseudo data. These were fitted using the SAID
parametrization approach to determine single-energy and energy-dependent
solutions over a range of lab photon energies from 200 to 1200 MeV. The
resulting solutions were found to be consistent with the input amplitudes from
MAID. Fits with a $\chi$-squared per datum of unity or less were generally
achieved. We discuss energy regions where consistent results are expected, and
explore the sensitivity of fits to the number of included single- and
double-polarization observables. The influence of Watson's theorem is examined
in detail.
