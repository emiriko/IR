We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius (R_p),
orbital period (P), and stellar effective temperature (Teff) for P < 50 day
orbits around GK stars. These results are based on the 1,235 planets (formally
"planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set
of detected planets as small as 2 Earth radii (Re). For each of the 156,000
target stars we assess the detectability of planets as a function of R_p and P.
We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R*/a. We consider
first stars within the "solar subset" having Teff = 4100-6100 K, logg =
4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp < 15 mag. We include only those stars having
noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 Re. We count planets
in small domains of R_p and P and divide by the included target stars to
calculate planet occurrence in each domain. Occurrence of planets varies by
more than three orders of magnitude and increases substantially down to the
smallest radius (2 Re) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days, ~0.25
AU) in our study. For P < 50 days, the radius distribution is given by a power
law, df/dlogR= k R^\alpha. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with
decreasing planet size agrees with core-accretion, but disagrees with
population synthesis models. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power
law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P_0. For smaller
planets, P_0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for
migrating planets moves outward with decreasing planet size. We also measured
planet occurrence over Teff = 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. The
occurrence of 2-4 Re planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing
Teff, making these small planets seven times more abundant around cool stars
than the hottest stars in our sample. [abridged]
