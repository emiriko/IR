The so-called Poghossian identities connecting the toric and spherical
blocks, the AGT relation on the torus and the Nekrasov-Shatashvili formula for
the elliptic Calogero-Moser Yang's (eCMY) functional are used to derive certain
expressions for the classical 4-point block on the sphere. The main motivation
for this line of research is the longstanding open problem of uniformization of
the 4-punctured Riemann sphere, where the 4-point classical block plays a
crucial role. It is found that the obtained representation for certain 4-point
classical blocks implies the relation between the accessory parameter of the
Fuchsian uniformization of the 4-punctured sphere and the eCMY functional.
Additionally, a relation between the 4-point classical block and the $N_f=4$,
${\sf SU(2)}$ twisted superpotential is found and further used to re-derive the
instanton sector of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of the $N_f=4$, ${\sf
SU(2)}$ supersymmetric gauge theory from the classical block.
