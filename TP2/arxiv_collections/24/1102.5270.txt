The existence of states enjoying a weak form of the Reeh-Schlieder property
has been recently established on curved backgrounds and in the framework of
locally covariant quantum field theory. Since only the example of a real scalar
field has been discussed, we extend the analysis to the case of massive and
massless free fields either of spin 1/2 or of spin 1. In the process, it is
also shown that both the vector potential and the Proca field can be described
as a locally covariant quantum field theory.
