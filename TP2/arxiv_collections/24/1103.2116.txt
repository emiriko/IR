We consider long-range correlated disorder and mutual interacting particles
according to a dipole-dipole coupling as modifications to the one-dimensional
Anderson model. Technically we rely on the (numerical) exact diagonalization of
the system's Hamilitonian. From the perspective of different localization
measures we confirm and extend the picture of the emergence of delocalized
states with increasing correlations. Beside these studies a definition for
multi-particle localization is proposed. In the case of two interacting bosons
we observe a sensitivity of localization with respect to the range of the
particle-particle interaction and insensitivity to the coupling's sign, which
should stimulate new theoretical approaches and experimental investigations
with e.g. dipolar cold quantum gases.
  This revised manuscript is much more explicit compared to the initial version
of the paper. Major extensions have been applied to Sects. II and III where we
updated and added figures and we more extensively compared our results to the
literature. Furthermore, Sect. III additionally contains a phenomenological
line of reasoning that bridges from delocalization by correlation to
delocalization by interaction on the basis of the multi-particle Hamilton
matrix.
