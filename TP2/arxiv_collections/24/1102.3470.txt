We report five new transit epochs of the extrasolar planet OGLE-TR-111b,
observed in the v-HIGH and Bessell I bands with the FORS1 and FORS2 at the ESO
Very Large Telescope, between April and May 2008. The new transits have been
combined with all previously published transit data for this planet to provide
a new Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) analysis of its orbit. We discard TTVs
with amplitudes larger than 1.5 minutes over a 4-year observation time
baseline, in agreement with the recent result by Adams et al.(2010a). Dynamical
simulations fully exclude the presence of additional planets in the system with
masses greater than 1.3, 0.4 and 0.5 M_earth at the 3:2, 1:2, 2:1 resonances,
respectively. We also place an upper limit of about 30 M_earth on the mass of
potential second planets in the region between the 3:2 and 1:2 mean-motion
resonances.
