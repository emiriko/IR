In this work we study the Casimir effect with three-dimensional topological
insulators including the effects of temperature and uniaxial anisotropy.
Although precise experimental values for the optical properties of these
materials are yet to be established, qualitative analysis is still possible. We
find qualitatively that the reported repulsive behavior and the equilibrium
point are robust features of the system, and are favored by low temperatures
and the enhancement of the optical response parallel to the optical axis. The
dependence of the equilibrium point with temperature and with the topological
magnetoelectric polarizability characteristic of three-dimensional topological
insulators is also discussed.
