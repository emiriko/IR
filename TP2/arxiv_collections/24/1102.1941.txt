Intrinsic quantum correlations of weak coherent states are observed between
two parties through a novel detection scheme, which can be used as a supplement
to the existence decoy-state BB84 and differential phase-shift quantum key
distribution (DPS-QKD) protocols. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we
generate bi-partite correlations of weak coherent states using weak local
oscillator fields in two spatially separated balanced homodyne detections. We
employ nonlinearity of post-measurement method to obtain the bi-partite
correlations from two single-field interferences at individual homodyne
measurement.
  This scheme is then used to demonstrate bits correlations between two parties
over a distance of 10 km through a transmission fiber. We believe that the
scheme can add another physical layer of security to these protocols for
quantum key distribution.
