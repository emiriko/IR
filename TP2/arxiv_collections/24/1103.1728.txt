We show in detail that the entropic force of the static spherically symmetric
spacetimes with unusual asymptotics can be calculated through the Verlinde's
arguments. We introduce three different holographic screen candidates, which
are first employed thoroughly by Myung and Kim [Phys. Rev. D 81, 105012 (2010)]
for Schwarzschild black hole solutions, in order to identify the entropic force
arising between a charged dilaton black hole and a test particle. The
significance of the dilaton parameter on the entropic force is highlighted, and
shown graphically.
