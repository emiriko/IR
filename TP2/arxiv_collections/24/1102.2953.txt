The structure of a simple liquid may be characterised in terms of ground
state clusters of small numbers of atoms of that same liquid. Here we use this
sensitive structural probe to consider the effect of a liquid-vapour interface
upon the liquid structure. At higher temperatures (above around half the
critical temperature) we find that the predominant effect of the interface is
to reduce the local density, which significantly suppresses the local cluster
populations. At lower temperatures, however, pronounced interfacial layering is
found. This appears to be connected with significant orientational ordering of
clusters based on 3- and 5-membered rings, with the rings aligning
perpendicular and parallel to the interface respectively. At all temperatures,
we find that the population of five-fold symmetric structures is suppressed,
rather than enhanced, close to the interface.
