With the aim of studying AR fan loops using Hinode/EIS and SDO/AIA, we
investigate a number of inconsistencies in modeling the absolute intensities of
Fe VIII and Si VII lines, and address why their images look very similar
despite the fact that they have significantly different formation temperatures
in ionization equilibrium: log T/K = 5.6 and 5.8. These issues are important to
resolve because confidence has been undermined in their use for DEM analysis,
and Fe VIII is the main contributor to the AIA 131A channel at low
temperatures. Furthermore, they are the best EIS lines to use for velocity
studies, and for assigning the correct temperature to velocity measurements in
the fans. We find that the Fe VIII 185.213A line is particularly sensitive to
the slope of the DEM, leading to disproportionate changes in its effective
formation temperature. If the DEM has a steep gradient in the log T/K = 5.6 to
5.8 range, or is strongly peaked, Fe VIII 185.213A and Si VII 275.368A will be
formed at the same temperature. We show that this effect explains the
similarity of these images in the fans. Furthermore, we show that the most
recent ionization balance compilations resolve the discrepancies in absolute
intensities. We then combine EIS and AIA to determine the temperature structure
of a number of fan loops and find that they have peak temperatures of
0.8--1.2MK. The EIS data indicate that the temperature distribution has a
finite (but narrow) width < log sigma/K = 5.5 which, in one case, is found to
broaden substantially towards the loop base. AIA and EIS yield similar results
on the temperature, emission measure, and thermal distribution in the fans,
though sometimes the AIA data suggest a relatively larger thermal width. The
result is that both the Fe VIII 185.213A and Si VII 275.368A lines are formed
at log T/K ~ 5.9 in the fans, and the AIA 131A response also shifts to this
temperature.
