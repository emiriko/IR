Utilizing the high stability of calcium and rare earth hydrides, CaFeAsF1-xHx
(x = 0.0-1.0) and SmFeAsO1-xHx (x = 0.0-0.47) have been first synthesized using
high pressure to form hydrogen-substituted 1111 type iron-arsenide
superconductors. Neutron diffraction and density functional calculations have
demonstrated that the hydrogens are incorporated as H- ions occupying F- sites
in the blocking layer of CaFeAsF. The resulting CaFeAsF1-xHx is
non-superconducting, whereas SmFeAsO1-xHx is a superconductor, with an optimal
Tc = 55 K at x 0.2. It was found that up to 40% of the O2- ions can be replaced
by H- ions, with electrons being supplied into the FeAs-layer to maintain
neutrality (O2- = H-+ e-). When x exceeded 0.2, Tc was reduced corresponding to
an electron over-doped region.
