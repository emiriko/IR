The nearby universe remains the best laboratory to understand physical
properties of galaxies and is a reference for any comparison with high redshift
observations. The all sky (or very large) surveys performed from the
ultraviolet (UV) to the far-infrared (far-IR) gives us large datasets with a
very large wavelength coverage to perform a reference study. We want to
investigate dust attenuation characteristics as well as star formation rate
(SFR) calibrations on a sample of nearby galaxies observed over 13 bands from
0.15 to 160 microns. A sample of 363 galaxies is built from the AKARI /FIS all
sky survey cross-correlated with SDSS and GALEX surveys. Broad band spectral
energy distributions are fitted with the CIGALE code optimized to analyze
variations in dust attenuation curves and SFR measurements and based on an
energetic budget between the stellar and dust emission. Our galaxy sample is
primarily selected in far-IR and mostly constituted of massive, actively star
forming galaxies. There is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightly
steeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrain
the presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. We confirm that a time dependent dust
attenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. Various calibrations of the
dust attenuation in the UV as a function of UV-optical colours are discussed. A
calibration of the current star formation rate combining UV and total IR
emissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars:
for the whole sample 17 % of the total dust luminosity is not related to the
recent star formation
