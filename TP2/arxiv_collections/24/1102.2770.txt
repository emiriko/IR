We show that coherent flavor neutrino states are produced (and detected) due
to the momentum-coordinate Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The Mandelstam-Tamm
time-energy uncertainty relation requires non-stationary neutrino states for
oscillations to happen and determines the time interval (propagation length)
which is necessary for that. We compare different approaches to neutrino
oscillations which are based on different physical assumptions but lead to the
same expression for the neutrino transition probability in standard neutrino
oscillation experiments. We show that a Moessbauer neutrino experiment could
allow to distinguish different approaches and we present arguments in favor of
the 163Ho-163Dy system for such an experiment.
