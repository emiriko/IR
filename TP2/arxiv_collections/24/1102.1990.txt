It is demonstrated that a thin-film Fabry-Perot superconducting resonator can
be used to reveal the Little-Parks (LP) effect even at temperatures much lower
than the critical temperature. A pair of parallel nanowires is incorporated
into the resonator at the point of a supercurrent antinode. As magnetic field
is ramped, the Meissner current develops, changing the kinetic inductance of
the wires and, correspondingly, the resonance frequency of the resonator, which
can be detected. The LP oscillation are revealed as a periodic set of distorted
parabolas observed in the transmission of the resonator and corresponding to
the states of the wire loop having different vorticities. We also report a
direct observation of single and double phase slip events and their statistical
analysis.
