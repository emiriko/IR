We investigate the construction of non-supersymmetric vacua in
compactifications of heterotic string theory with intrinsic torsion and
background fluxes. We do this by using the technique of domain-wall
supersymmetry breaking (DWSB) that was developed in the context of type II
compactifications. By means of a scalar potential we derive conditions on the
compactification manifold that must hold in order to satisfy the equations of
motion up to order alpha'.
