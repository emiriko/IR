A theorem of Maurer-Cartan type for Lie algebroids is presented. Suppose that
any vector subbundle of a Lie algebroid is called interior differential system
(IDS) for that Lie algebroid. A theorem of Cartan type is obtained. Extending
the classical notion of exterior differential system (EDS) to Lie algebroids, a
theorem of Cartan type is obtained.
