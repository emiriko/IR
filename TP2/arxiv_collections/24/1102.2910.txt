Local operators in the bulk of AdS can be represented as smeared operators in
the dual CFT. We show how to construct these bulk observables by requiring that
the bulk operators commute at spacelike separation. This extends our previous
work by taking interactions into account. Large-N factorization plays a key
role in the construction. We show diagrammatically how this procedure is
related to bulk Feynman diagrams.
