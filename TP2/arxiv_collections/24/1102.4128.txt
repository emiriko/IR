The hydrodynamic limit of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann equations is
considered for weak solutions. Using relative entropy estimate about an
absolute Maxwellian, an incompressible Electron-Magnetohydrodynamics-Fourier
limit for solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Blotzmann equations over any periodic
spatial domain in $\R^3$ is studied. It is shown that any properly scaled
sequence of renormalized solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann equations
has fluctuations that (in the weak $L^1$ topology) converge to an infinitesimal
Maxwellian with fluid variables that satisfy the incompressibility and
Boussinesq relations. It is also shown that the limits of the velocity, the
electric field, and the magnetic field are governed by a weak solution of an
incompressible electron-magnetohydrodynamics system for all time.
