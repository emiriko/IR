Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) is a project to digitize
the collection of approximately 525,000 astronomical plates held at the Harvard
College Observatory. This paper presents an overview of the DASCH data
processing pipeline, with special emphasis on the processing of
multiple-exposure plates. Such plates extended the dynamic range of photograph
emulsions and improved photometric accuracy by minimizing variations in plate
development procedures. Two approaches are explored in this paper: The
repetitive use of astrometry.net (Lang et al. 2010) and local correlation
searches. Both procedures have yielded additional quality control checks useful
to the pipeline.
