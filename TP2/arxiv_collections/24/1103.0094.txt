We report the recent results of a search for lepton-flavor-violating tau
decays and a search for CP violation in tau to nu Ks pi using a large data
sample accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^-
collider. The sensitivity to these modes is significantly improved compared to
previous experiments.
