The injection and evolution of turbulence in the intergalactic medium is
studied by means of mesh-based hydrodynamical simulations, including a subgrid
scale (SGS) model for small-scale unresolved turbulence. The simulations show
that the production of turbulence has a different redshift dependence in the
intracluster medium (ICM) and the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We show
that turbulence in the ICM is produced chiefly by merger-induced shear flows,
whereas the production in the WHIM is dominated by shock interactions.
Secondly, the effect of dynamical pressure support on the gravitational
contraction has been studied. This turbulent support is stronger in the WHIM
gas at baryon overdensities 1 < delta < 100, and less relevant for the ICM.
Although the relative mass fraction of the gas with large vorticity is
considerable (52% in the ICM), we find that for only about 10% in mass this is
dynamically relevant, namely not associated to an equally large thermal
pressure support. According to this result, a significant non-thermal pressure
support counteracting the gravitational contraction is a localised
characteristic in the cosmic flow, rather than a widespread feature.
