Optomechanical systems couple light to the motion of nanomechanical objects.
Intriguing new effects are observed in recent experiments that involve the
dynamics of more than one optical mode. There, mechanical motion can stimulate
strongly driven multi-mode photon dynamics that acts back on the mechanics via
radiation forces. We show that even for two optical modes
Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg oscillations of the light field drastically change
the nonlinear attractor diagram of the resulting phonon lasing oscillations.
Our findings illustrate the generic effects of Landau-Zener physics on
back-action induced self-oscillations.
