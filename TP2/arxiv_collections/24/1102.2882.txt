Single crystal neutron diffraction study has been performed on new
superconductor A2Fe4Se5, where A = Cs, K, (Tl,Rb) and (Tl,K), and the same Fe
vacancy ordered crystal structure and the same block checkerboard
antiferromagne tic order recently discovered in the K2Fe4Se5 superconductor are
observed. Thus, all known alkali metal and/or Tl intercalated iron selenide
superconductors share common crystalline and magnetic structure. Investigation
on electronic process in these new superconductors, for which a different
electronic structure from those in previous Fe-based high-Tc superconductors is
emerging, now has a valid structural and magnetic framework.
