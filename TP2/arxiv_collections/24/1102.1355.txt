We study the time dependency of the (average) interfacial separation between
an elastic solid with a flat surface and a rigid solid with a randomly rough
surface, squeezed together in a fluid. We use an analytical theory describing
the fluid flow factors, based on the Persson contact mechanics theory and the
Bruggeman effective medium theory, to calculate the removal of the fluid from
the contacting interface of the two solids. In order to test this approach, we
have performed simple squeeze-out experiments. The experimental results are
compared to the theory predictions.
