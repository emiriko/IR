We report the discovery of a planet with a high planet-to-star mass ratio in
the microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387, which exhibited pronounced deviations
over a 12-day interval, one of the longest for any planetary event. The host is
an M dwarf, with a mass in the range 0.07 M_sun < M_host < 0.49M_sun at 90%
confidence. The planet-star mass ratio q = 0.0132 +- 0.003 has been measured
extremely well, so at the best-estimated host mass, the planet mass is m_p =
2.6 Jupiter masses for the median host mass, M = 0.19 M_sun. The host mass is
determined from two "higher order" microlensing parameters. One of these, the
angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.31 +- 0.03 mas, is very well measured, but
the other (the microlens parallax \pi_E, which is due to the Earth's orbital
motion) is highly degenate with the orbital motion of the planet. We
statistically resolve the degeneracy between Earth and planet orbital effects
by imposing priors from a Galactic model that specifies the positions and
velocities of lenses and sources and a Kepler model of orbits. The 90%
confidence intervals for the distance, semi-major axis, and period of the
planet are 3.5 kpc < D_L < 7.9 kpc, 1.1 AU < a < 2.7AU, and 3.8 yr < P < 7.6
yr, respectively.
