We reformulate minimalist grammars as partial functions on term algebras for
strings and trees. Using filler/role bindings and tensor product
representations, we construct homomorphisms for these data structures into
geometric vector spaces. We prove that the structure-building functions as well
as simple processors for minimalist languages can be realized by piecewise
linear operators in representation space. We also propose harmony, i.e. the
distance of an intermediate processing step from the final well-formed state in
representation space, as a measure of processing complexity. Finally, we
illustrate our findings by means of two particular arithmetic and fractal
representations.
