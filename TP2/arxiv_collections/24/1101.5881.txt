The article is devoted to double J/psi-meson production at LHC. Theoretical
predictions for pp -> 2J/psi+X cross section at sqrt{s}=7 TeV for different
kinematical restrictions are presented. Special attention is payed to possible
contribution of novel particles -- tetraquarks build from four c-quarks.
According to presented in our article estimates, it is quietly possible to
observe at least one of these state (tensor meson) experimentally.
