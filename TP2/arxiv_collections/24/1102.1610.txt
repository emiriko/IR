First results of the differential cross section in dp elastic scattering at
1.25 GeV/u measured with the HADES over a large angular range are reported. The
obtained data corresponds to large transverse momenta, where a high sensitivity
to the two-nucleon and three-nucleon short-range correlations is expected.
