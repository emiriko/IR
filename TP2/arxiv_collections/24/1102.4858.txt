We have studied the sensitivity to variations in the triple alpha and
12C(alpha, gamma)16O reaction rates, of the yield of the neutrino process
isotopes 7Li,11B, 19F, 138La, and 180Ta in core collapse supernovae. Compared
to solar abundances, less than 15% of 7Li, about 25-80% of 19F, and about half
of 138La is produced in these stars. Over a range of two sigma for each
helium-burning rate, 11B is overproduced and the yield varies by an amount
larger than the variation caused by the effects of neutrino oscillations. The
total 11B yield, however, may eventually provide constraints on supernova
neutrino spectra.
