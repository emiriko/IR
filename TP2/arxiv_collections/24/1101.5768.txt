In a recent letter, several electromagnetic mass difference formulae for
baryons were presented. However, because the derivation did not include
important colormagnetic terms, the mass relations do not correctly give isospin
mass splittings for the baryons. Correct mass formulae were published some time
ago in a model independent approach that was more general and correct than the
approach in this letter. In this Comment, the errors in the letter are pointed
out and some correct formulae presented.
