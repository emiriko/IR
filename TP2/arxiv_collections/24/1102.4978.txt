We have fabricated oxide based spin filter junctions in which we demonstrate
that magnetic anisotropy can be used to tune the transport behavior of spin
filter junctions. Until recently, spin filters have been largely comprised of
polycrystalline materials where the spin filter barrier layer and one of the
electrodes are ferromagnetic. These spin filter junctions have relied on the
weak magnetic coupling between one ferromagnetic electrode and a barrier layer
or the insertion of a nonmagnetic insulating layer in between the spin filter
barrier and electrode. We have demonstrated spin filtering behavior in
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/chromite/Fe3O4 junctions without nonmagnetic spacer layers where
the interface anisotropy plays a significant role in determining transport
behavior. Detailed studies of chemical and magnetic structure at the interfaces
indicate that abrupt changes in magnetic anisotropy across the
non-isostructural interface is the cause of the significant suppression of
junction magnetoresistance in junctions with MnCr2O4 barrier layers.
