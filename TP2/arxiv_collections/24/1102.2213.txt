We show how probabilities can be treated as truth values in suitable sheaf
topoi. The scheme developed in this paper is very general and applies to both
classical and quantum physics. On the quantum side, the results are a natural
extension of our existing work on a topos approach to quantum theory. Earlier
results on the representation of arbitrary quantum states are complemented with
a purely logical perspective.
