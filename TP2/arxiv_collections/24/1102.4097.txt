We show that sparse spherical harmonic expansions can be efficiently
recovered from a small number of randomly chosen samples on the sphere. To
establish the main result, we verify the restricted isometry property of an
associated preconditioned random measurement matrix using recent estimates on
the uniform growth of Jacobi polynomials.
