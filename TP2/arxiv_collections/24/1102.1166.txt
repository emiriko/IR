Extending the holographic program of [1], we derive f(R) gravity and the
Maxwell equations from the holographic principle, using time-like holographic
screen. We find that to derive the Einstein equations and f(R) gravity in a
natural holographic approach, the quasi-static condition is necessary. We also
find the surface stress tensor and the surface electric current, surface
magnetic current on the holographic screen for f(R) gravity and Maxwell's
theory, respectively.
