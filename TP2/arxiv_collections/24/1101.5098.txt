I briefly review results obtained within the variational Hamiltonian approach
to Yang-Mills theory in Coulomb gauge and confront them with recent lattice
data. The variational approach is extended to non-Gaussian wave functionals
including three- and four-gluon kernels in the exponential of the vacuum wave
functional and used to calculate the three-gluon vertex. A new functional
renormalization group flow equation for Hamiltonian Yang--Mills theory in
Coulomb gauge is solved for the gluon and ghost propagator under the assumption
of ghost dominance. The results are compared to those obtained in the
variational approach.
