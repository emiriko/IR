We present the Forward Physics Monte Carlo (FPMC) designed to simulated
central particle production with one or two leading intact protons and some
hard scale in the event. The underlying interaction between protons or
anti-protons through singlet exchange can manifest itself in many forms. The
following production mechanisms are implemented: single diffractive
dissociation, double pomeron exchange, and exclusive production due to
two-gluon or two-photon exchanges. With increasing beam
center-of-mass-energies, the production of new final states become possible at
the LHC. The aim of FPMC is to implement these processes in one common
framework.
