We report single-crystal 2-D NMR investigation of the nearly ideal spin S=1/2
kagome lattice ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2. We successfully identify 2-D NMR signals
originating from the nearest-neighbors of Cu2+ defects occupying Zn sites. From
the 2-D Knight shift measurements, we demonstrate that weakly interacting Cu2+
spins at these defects cause the large Curie-Weiss enhancement toward T=0
commonly observed in the bulk susceptibility data. We estimate the intrinsic
spin susceptibility of the kagome planes by subtracting defect contributions,
and explore several scenarios.
