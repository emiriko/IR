A molecule consisting of two particles interacting with a delta-function
attraction, and confined to a one-dimensional volume, is studied. From the
exact solution of the system we deduce that the center-of-mass effectively
moves in a volume reduced by an inaccessible dead layer near each wall. For a
very large volume the dead-layer width equals the size of the molecule, defined
as the expectation value of the interparticle distance for the unconfined
molecule. For finite volumes the dead-layer width is smaller than this. For
unequal particle masses, perturbation in the mass difference up to third order
yields the same result, and we conjecture that for this system the dead-layer
width is independent of the mass values.
