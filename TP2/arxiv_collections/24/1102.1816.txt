We obtain bounds on fluctuations of two entropy estimators for a class of
one-dimensional Gibbs measures on the full shift. They are the consequence of a
general exponential inequality for Lipschitz functions of n variables. The
first estimator is based on empirical frequencies of blocks scaling
logarithmically with the sample length. The second one is based on the first
appearance of blocks within typical samples.
