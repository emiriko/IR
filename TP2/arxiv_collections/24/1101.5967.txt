We investigate the two-photon corrections to the process $p\bar{p} \to
e^+e^-$ at large momentum transfer, aimed to access the time-like nucleon form
factors. We estimate the two-photon corrections using a hard rescattering
mechanism, which has already been used to calculate the corresponding
corrections to elastic electron-proton scattering. Using different nucleon
distribution amplitudes, we find that the two-photon corrections to the
$p\bar{p} \to e^+e^-$ cross sections in the momentum transfer range 5 - 30
GeV$^2$ is below the 1 % level.
