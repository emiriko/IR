The gluon field distribution between three infinitely spaced quarks is
obtained. The field distribution between every pair is approximated by an
infinite flux tube filled with a color longitudinal electric field. The origin
of the color electric field is a nonlinear term in the field strength of
nonabelian gauge field. Such construction can be considered as a rough model of
three quarks in a nucleon.
