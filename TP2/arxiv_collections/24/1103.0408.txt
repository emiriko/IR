A spin-dependent quantum transport is investigated in a paramagnetic resonant
tunneling diode (RTD) based on a Zn$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Se/ZnBeSe heterostructure.
Using the Wigner-Poisson method and assuming the two-current model we have
calculated the current-voltage characteristics, potential energy profiles and
electron density distributions for spin-up and spin-down electron current in an
external magnetic field. We have found that -- for both the spin-polarized
currents -- two types of the current hysteresis appear on the current-voltage
characteristics. The current hysteresis of the first type occurs at the bias
voltage below the resonant current peak and results from the accumulation of
electrons in the quantum well layer. The current hysteresis of the second type
appears at the bias voltage above the resonant current peak and is caused by
the creation of the quasi-bound state in the left contact region and the
resonant tunneling through this quasi-bound state. The physical interpretation
of both the types of the current hysteresis is further supported by the
analysis of the calculated self-consistent potential profiles and electron
density distributions. Based on these results we have shown that -- in certain
bias voltage and magnetic field ranges -- the spin polarization of the current
exhibits the plateau behavior with the nearly full spin polarization. This
property is very promising for possible applications in spintronics.
