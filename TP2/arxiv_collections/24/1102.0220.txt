We present a method for entanglement detection in steady state systems using
a thermodynamic witness. To illustrate, we consider an example and find that
for an XX spin chain, the presence of an energy current increases the region of
entanglement detected by the steady state witness. Further, we find that
entanglement exists even at a high steady state temperature. We also discuss
concurrence in the steady state system and find that the amount of entanglement
can be increased by the current.
