In 1927 Philomena Mader derived elegant inversion formulas for the hyperplane
Radon transform on $\bbr^n$. These formulas differ from the original ones by
Radon and seem to be forgotten. We generalize Mader's formulas to totally
geodesic Radon transforms in any dimension on arbitrary constant curvature
space. Another new interesting inversion formula for the $k$-plane transform
was presented in the recent book "Integral geometry and Radon transform" by S.
Helgason. We extend this formula to arbitrary constant curvature space. The
paper combines tools of integral geometry and complex analysis.
