The purpose of this paper is to take that first step in helping archivists
understand the video game industry by examining the documents and assets
created by game companies. This paper is intended as a survey of the records
generated during video game production, and an overview of why and how those
records are created. It is not intended to be a statement on archiving best
practices, but rather a tool for archivists to use when assessing and
processing video game collections. It is an overview of how a video game is
made and the paper trail left behind that an archivist might encounter.
