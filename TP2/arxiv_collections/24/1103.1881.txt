The kink signature of charged tracks is predicted in some SUSY models, and it
is very characteristic signal at collider experiments. We study the kink
signature at LHC using two models, SUSY models with a gravitino LSP and a stau
NLSP, and R-parity violating SUSY models with a stau (N)LSP. We find that a
large number of kink events can be discovered in a wide range of the SUSY
parameters, when the decay length is O(10-10^5)mm. Model discrimination by
identifying the daughter particles of the kink tracks is also discussed.
