Topological properties of a periodic condensed matter system are global
features of its Brillouin zone (BZ). In contrast, the validity of effective low
energy theories is usually limited to the vicinity of a high symmetry point in
the BZ. We derive a general criterion under which the control parameter of a
topological phase transition localizes the topological defect in an arbitrarily
small neighbourhood of a single point in $k$-space upon approaching its
critical value. Such a local phase transition is associated with a Dirac-like
gap closing point, whereas a flat band transition is not localized in
$k$-space. This mechanism and its limitations are illustrated with the help of
experimentally relevant examples such as HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and bilayer
graphene nanostructures.
