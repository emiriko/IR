We introduce the telescopic relative entropy (TRE), which is a new
regularisation of the relative entropy related to smoothing, to overcome the
problem that the relative entropy between pure states is either zero or
infinity and therefore useless as a distance measure in this case. We study
basic properties of this quantity, and find interesting relationships between
the TRE and the trace norm distance. We then exploit the same techniques to
obtain a new and shorter proof of a lower bound on the relative Renyi entropies
in terms of the trace norm distance, $\trace\rho^{1-p}\sigma^p \ge
1-(||\rho-\sigma||_1)/2$.
