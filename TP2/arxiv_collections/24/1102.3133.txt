New physics at a high scale Lambda can affect top-related observables at
O(1/Lambda^2) via the interference of effective four quark operators with the
SM amplitude. The (\bar{u} gamma_mu gamma^5 T^a u)(\bar{t} gamma^mu gamma^5 T^a
t) operator modifies the large M_{t\bar{t}} forward-backward asymmetry, and can
account for the recent CDF measurement. The (\bar{u} gamma_mu T^a u)(\bar{t}
gamma^mu T^a t) operator modifies the differential cross section, but cannot
enhance the cross section of ultra-massive boosted jets by more than 60%. The
hint for a larger enhancement from a recent CDF measurement may not persist
future experimental improvements, or may be a QCD effect that is not accounted
for by leading order and matched Monte Carlo tools or naive factorization. If
it comes from new physics, it may stem from new light states or an
O(1/Lambda^4) new physics effect.
