We study the elliptic spin-1/2 Kondo model (spin-1/2 fermions in one
dimension with fully anisotropic contact interactions with a magnetic impurity)
in the light of mappings to bosonic systems using the fermion-boson
correspondence and associated unitary transformations. We show that for fixed
fermion number, the bosonic system describes a two-level quantum dissipative
system with two noninteracting copies of infinitely-degenerate upper and lower
levels. In addition to the standard tunnelling transitions, and the transitions
driven by the dissipative coupling, there are also bath-mediated transitions
between the upper and lower states which simultaneously effect shifts in the
horizontal degeneracy label. We speculate that these systems could provide new
examples of continuous time quantum random walks, which are exactly solvable.
