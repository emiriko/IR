We apply the time-dependent variational principle of Balian-V\'en\'eroni to a
system of self-interacting trapped bosons at finite temperature. The method
leads to a set of coupled non-linear time dependent equations for the
condensate density, the thermal cloud and the anomalous density. We solve
numerically these equations in the static case for a harmonic trap. We analyze
the various densities as functions of the radial distance and the temperature.
We find an overall good qualitative agreement with recent experiments as well
as with the results of many theoretical groups. We also discuss the behavior of
the anomalous density at low temperatures owing to its importance to account
for many-body effects.
