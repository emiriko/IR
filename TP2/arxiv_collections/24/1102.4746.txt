A search for pair-produced bottom-like quarks in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7
TeV is conducted with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The decay b' to tW is
considered in this search. The b' b'-bar to tW^- t-bar W^+ process can be
identified by the distinctive signature of trileptons and same-sign dileptons.
With a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 inverse
picobarns, no excess above the standard model background predictions is
observed and a b' quark with a mass between 255 and 361 GeV/c^2 is excluded at
the 95% confidence level.
