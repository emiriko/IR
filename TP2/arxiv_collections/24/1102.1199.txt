We examine some variants of computation with closed timelike curves (CTCs),
where various restrictions are imposed on the memory of the computer, and the
information carrying capacity and range of the CTC. We give full
characterizations of the classes of languages recognized by polynomial time
probabilistic and quantum computers that can send a single classical bit to
their own past. Such narrow CTCs are demonstrated to add the power of limited
nondeterminism to deterministic computers, and lead to exponential speedup in
constant-space probabilistic and quantum computation. We show that, given a
time machine with constant negative delay, one can implement CTC-based
computations without the need to know about the runtime beforehand.
