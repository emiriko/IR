We probe the dependence of the low velocity drag force in granular materials
on the effective gravitational acceleration (geff) through studies of spherical
granular materials saturated within fluids of varying density. We vary geff by
a factor of 20, and we find that the granular drag is proportional to geff,
i.e., that the granular drag follows the expected relation Fprobe = {\eta}
{\rho}grain geff dprobe hprobe^2 for the drag force, Fprobe on a vertical
cylinder with depth of insertion, hprobe, diameter dprobe, moving through
grains of density {\rho}grain, and where {\eta} is a dimensionless constant.
This dimensionless constant shows no systematic variation over four orders of
magnitude in effective grain weight, demonstrating that the relation holds over
that entire range to within the precision of our data.
