A primary motivation for our research in digital ecosystems is the desire to
exploit the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems. Ecosystems are
thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve
complex, dynamic problems. However, the computing technologies that contribute
to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystems research.
Here, we discuss how different computing technologies can contribute to
providing the necessary self-organising features, including Multi-Agent Systems
(MASs), Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs), and distributed evolutionary
computing (DEC). The potential for exploiting these properties in digital
ecosystems is considered, suggesting how several key features of biological
ecosystems can be exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking
these features may assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising
architectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in
detail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally through
simulations, considering the self-organised diversity of its evolving agent
populations relative to the user request behaviour.
