We introduce a family of reductions for removing proper and homogeneous pairs
of cliques from a graph G. This family generalizes some routines presented in
the literature, mostly in the context of claw-free graphs. These reductions can
be embedded in a simple algorithm that in at most |E(G)| steps builds a new
graph G' without proper and homogeneous pairs of cliques, and such that G and
G' agree on the value of some relevant invariant (or property).
