We review some aspects of non commutative quantum field theory and group
field theory, in particular recent progress on the systematic study of the
scaling and renormalization properties of group field theory. We thank G.
Zoupanos and the organizers of the Corfu 2010 Workshop on Noncommutative Field
Theory and Gravity for encouraging us to write this review.
