We prove that, on a complete hyperbolic domain D\subset C^q, any Loewner PDE
associated with a Herglotz vector field of the form H(z,t)=A(z)+O(|z|^2), where
the eigenvalues of A have strictly negative real part, admits a solution given
by a family of univalent mappings (f_t: D\to C^q) such that the union of the
images f_t(D) is the whole C^q. If no real resonance occurs among the
eigenvalues of A, then the family (e^{At}\circ f_t) is uniformly bounded in a
neighborhood of the origin. We also give a generalization of Pommerenke's
univalence criterion on complete hyperbolic domains.
