We explore the question of how to probe the vacuum structure of space time by
a massive scalar field through interaction with background gravitons. Using the
$\Gamma$-regularization for the in-/out-state formalism, we find the effective
action of a scalar field in a conformally, asymptotically flat spacetime and a
four-dimensional de Sitter space, which is a gravitational analog of the
Heisenberg-Euler and Schwinger effective action for a charged scalar in a
constant electric field. The effective action is nonperturbative in that it
sums all one-loop diagrams with arbitrary number of external lines of
gravitons. The massive scalar field becomes unstable due to particle
production, the effective action has an imaginary part that determines the
decay rate of the vacuum, and the out-vacuum is unitarily inequivalent to the
in-vacuum.
