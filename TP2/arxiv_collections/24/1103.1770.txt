In the article "Limits on possible new nucleon monopole-dipole interactions
from the spin relaxation rate of polarized $^3$He gas", new limits on
short-range, Axion-like interactions are presented. In this comment it is shown
that the theoretical treatement of the data overestimates the sensitivity of
the proposed method. We provide the corrected limits.
