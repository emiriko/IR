We use the gauge-string duality to study heavy quarks in the presence of
higher derivative corrections. These corrections correspond to the finite
coupling corrections on the properties of heavy quarks in a hot plasma. In
particular, we study the effects of these corrections on the energy loss and
the dissociation length of a quark-antiquark pair. We show that the calculated
energy loss of heavy quarks through the plasma increases. We also find in
general that the dissociation length becomes shorter with the increase of
coupling parameters of higher curvature terms.
