We report the results of a new survey of massive, OB stars throughout the
Carina Nebula using the X-ray point source catalog provided by the Chandra
Carina Complex Project (CCCP) in conjunction with infrared (IR) photometry from
the Two Micron All-Sky Survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope Vela--Carina
survey. Mid-IR photometry is relatively unaffected by extinction, hence it
provides strong constraints on the luminosities of OB stars, assuming that
their association with the Carina Nebula, and hence their distance, is
confirmed. We fit model stellar atmospheres to the optical (UBV) and IR
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 182 OB stars with known spectral types
and measure the bolometric luminosity and extinction for each star. We find
that the extinction law measured toward the OB stars has two components:
Av=1--1.5 mag produced by foreground dust with a ratio of total-to-selective
absorption Rv=3.1 plus a contribution from local dust with Rv>4.0 in the Carina
molecular clouds that increases as Av increases. Using X-ray emission as a
strong indicator of association with Carina, we identify 94 candidate OB stars
with Lbol\geq10^4 Lsun by fitting their IR SEDs. If the candidate OB stars are
eventually confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic observations, the number of
cataloged OB stars in the Carina Nebula will increase by ~50%. Correcting for
incompleteness due to OB stars falling below the Lbol cutoff or the CCCP
detection limit, these results potentially double the size of the young massive
stellar population.
