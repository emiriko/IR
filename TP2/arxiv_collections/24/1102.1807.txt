The role of momentum dependent interactions is studied in nuclear stopping at
intermediate energy using an isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics
model. Present calculations are performed at incident energy between 50 and
1000 MeV/nucleon. Our findings show that nuclear stopping is sensitive towards
the impact parameter, incident energies as well as towards the mass of the
colliding system. Further, the degree of stopping is suppressed by the
inclusion of momentum dependent interactions, whereas the particle production
is not affected by the MDI.
