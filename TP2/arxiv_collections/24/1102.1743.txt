The rotation of more than 700 pulsars has been monitored using the 76-m
Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank. Here we report on a new search for glitches
in the observations, revealing 128 new glitches in the rotation of 63 pulsars.
Combining these new data with those already published we present a database
containing 315 glitches in 102 pulsars. The database was used to study the
glitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars
with a characteristic age tau_c ~ 10kyr and decreases for longer values of
tau_c, disappearing for objects with tau_c > 20Myr. The glitch activity is also
smaller in the very young pulsars (tau_c <~ 1kyr). The cumulative effect of
glitches, a collection of instantaneous spin up events, acts to reduce the
regular long term spindown rate |nudot| of the star. The percentage of |nudot|
reversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.6% for pulsars
with spindown rates |nudot| between 10^(-14) and 3.2*10^(-11) Hz/s, decreasing
to less than 0.01% at both higher and lower spindown rates. These ratios are
interpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of
glitches. In this context the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab
pulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with
low spindown rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the
decrease of their crustal superfluid.
  Through the analysis of glitch sizes it was found that the particular
glitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most
Vela-like pulsars. These objects present most of their glitches with
characteristic frequency and frequency derivative jumps, occurring at regular
intervals of time. Their behaviour is different from other glitching pulsars of
similar characteristic age.
