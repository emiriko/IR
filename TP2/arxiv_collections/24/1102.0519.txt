We found from analytical derivations and micromagnetic numerical simulations
that there exist two distinct normal modes in apparently complex vortex
gyrotropic motions in two dipolar-coupled magnetic nanodisks. The normal modes
have characteristic higher and lower single angular eigenfrequencies with their
own elliptical orbits elongated along the x (bonding axis) and y axes,
respectively. The superposition of the two normal modes results in coupled
vortex gyrations, which depend on the relative vortex-state configuration in a
pair of dipolar-coupled disks. This normal-mode representation is a simple
means of understanding the observed complex vortex gyrations in two or more
dipolar-interacting disks of various vortex-state configurations.
