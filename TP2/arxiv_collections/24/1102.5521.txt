We report studies of solid helium contained inside a torsional oscillator, at
temperatures between 1.07K and 1.87K. We grew single crystals inside the
oscillator using commercially pure $^4$He and $^3$He-$^4$He mixtures containing
100 ppm $^3$He. Crystals were grown at constant temperature and pressure on the
melting curve. At the end of the growth, the crystals were disordered,
following which they partially decoupled from the oscillator. The fraction of
the decoupled He mass was temperature and velocity dependent. Around 1K, the
decoupled mass fraction for crystals grown from the mixture reached a limiting
value of around 35%. In the case of crystals grown using commercially pure
$^4$He at temperatures below 1.3K, this fraction was much smaller. This
difference could possibly be associated with the roughening transition at the
solid-liquid interface.
