The time dependence of muon spin relaxation has been measured in high purity
aluminum and silver samples in a longitudinal 2 T magnetic field at room
temperature, using time-differential \musr. For times greater than 10 ns, the
shape fits well to a single exponential with relaxation rates of
$\lambda_{\textrm{Al}} = 1.3 \pm 0.2\,(\textrm{stat.}) \pm
0.3\,(\textrm{syst.})\,\pms$ and $\lambda_{\textrm{Ag}} = 1.0 \pm
0.2\,(\textrm{stat.}) \pm 0.2\,(\textrm{syst.})\,\pms$.
