We present results and conjectures on the van der Waerden numbers w(2;3,t)
and on the new palindromic van der Waerden numbers pdw(2;3,t). We have computed
the new number w(2;3,19) = 349, and we provide lower bounds for 20 <= t <= 39,
where for t <= 30 we conjecture these lower bounds to be exact. The lower
bounds for 24 <= t <= 30 refute the conjecture that w(2;3,t) <= t^2, and we
present an improved conjecture. We also investigate regularities in the good
partitions (certificates) to better understand the lower bounds.
  Motivated by such reglarities, we introduce *palindromic van der Waerden
numbers* pdw(k; t_0,...,t_{k-1}), defined as ordinary van der Waerden numbers
w(k; t_0,...,t_{k-1}), however only allowing palindromic solutions (good
partitions), defined as reading the same from both ends. Different from the
situation for ordinary van der Waerden numbers, these "numbers" need actually
to be pairs of numbers. We compute pdw(2;3,t) for 3 <= t <= 27, and we provide
lower bounds, which we conjecture to be exact, for t <= 35.
  All computations are based on SAT solving, and we discuss the various
relations between SAT solving and Ramsey theory. Especially we introduce a
novel (open-source) SAT solver, the tawSolver, which performs best on the SAT
instances studied here, and which is actually the original DLL-solver, but with
an efficient implementation and a modern heuristic typical for look-ahead
solvers (applying the theory developed in the SAT handbook article of the
second author).
