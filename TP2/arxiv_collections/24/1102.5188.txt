We present a scheme for non-adiabatically loading a Bose-Einstein condensate
into the ground state of a one dimensional optical lattice within a few tens of
microseconds typically, i.e. in less than half the Talbot period. This
technique of coherent control is based on sequences of pulsed perturbations and
experimental results demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness. As the
loading process is much shorter than the traditional adiabatic loading
timescale, this method may find many applications.
