We simulate the nonequilibrium dynamics of two generic many-body quantum
impurity models by employing the recently developed iterative
influence-functional path integral method [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 82}, 205323
(2010)]. This general approach is presented here in the context of quantum
transport in molecular electronic junctions. Models of particular interest
include the single impurity Anderson model and the related spinless two-state
Anderson dot. In both cases we study the time evolution of the dot occupation
and the current characteristics at finite temperature. A comparison to
mean-field results is presented, when applicable.
