We investigate an optimal scheduling problem in a discrete-time system of L
parallel queues that are served by K identical, randomly connected servers.
Each queue may be connected to a subset of the K servers during any given time
slot. This model has been widely used in studies of emerging 3G/4G wireless
systems. We introduce the class of Most Balancing (MB) policies and provide
their mathematical characterization. We prove that MB policies are optimal; we
define optimality as minimization, in stochastic ordering sense, of a range of
cost functions of the queue lengths, including the process of total number of
packets in the system. We use stochastic coupling arguments for our proof. We
introduce the Least Connected Server First/Longest Connected Queue (LCSF/LCQ)
policy as an easy-to-implement approximation of MB policies. We conduct a
simulation study to compare the performance of several policies. The simulation
results show that: (a) in all cases, LCSF/LCQ approximations to the MB policies
outperform the other policies, (b) randomized policies perform fairly close to
the optimal one, and, (c) the performance advantage of the optimal policy over
the other simulated policies increases as the channel connectivity probability
decreases and as the number of servers in the system increases.
