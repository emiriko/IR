Random changes in pulsation period occur in cool pulsating Mira variables,
Type A, B, and C semiregular variables, RV Tauri variables, and in most
classical Cepheids. The physical processes responsible for such fluctuations
are uncertain, but presumably originate in temporal modifications of the
envelope convection in such stars. Such fluctuations are seemingly random over
a few pulsation cycles of the stars, but are dominated by the regularity of the
primary pulsation over the long term. The magnitude of stochasticity in
pulsating stars appears to be linked directly to their dimensions, although not
in simple fashion. It is relatively larger in M supergiants, for example, than
in short-period Cepheids, but is common enough that it can be detected in
visual observations for many types of pulsating stars. Although chaos was
discovered in such stars 80 years ago, detection of its general presence in the
group has only been possible in recent studies.
