To evaluate the swimming performances of aquatic animals, an important
dimensionless quantity is the Strouhal number, St = fA/U, with f the tail-beat
frequency, A the peak-to-peak tail amplitude, and U the swimming velocity.
Experiments with flapping foils have exhibited maximum propulsive efficiency in
the interval 0.25 < St < 0.35 and it has been argued that animals likely
evolved to swim in the same narrow interval. Using Lighthill's elongated-body
theory to address undulatory propulsion, it is demonstrated here that the
optimal Strouhal number increases from 0.15 to 0.8 for animals spanning from
the largest cetaceans to the smallest tadpoles. To assess the validity of this
model, the swimming kinematics of 53 different species of aquatic animals have
been compiled from the literature and it shows that their Strouhal numbers are
consistently near the predicted optimum.
