We derive analytical expressions for the conductivity of bilayer graphene
(BLG) using the Boltzmann approach within the the Born approximation for a
model of Gaussian disorders describing both short- and long-range impurity
scattering. The range of validity of the Born approximation is established by
comparing the analytical results to exact tight-binding numerical calculations.
A comparison of the obtained density dependencies of the conductivity with
experimental data shows that the BLG samples investigated experimentally so far
are in the quantum scattering regime where the Fermi wavelength exceeds the
effective impurity range. In this regime both short- and long-range scattering
lead to the same linear density dependence of the conductivity. Our
calculations imply that bilayer and single layer graphene have the same
scattering mechanisms. We also provide an upper limit for the effective,
density dependent spatial extension of the scatterers present in the
experiments.
