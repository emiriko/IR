It is pointed out, that the charge transfer in the compound in paramagnetic
region has a ferron type of transport with ferrons of a small radius, predicted
by N. Mott. For some another specimen the charge transfer may be carried out by
ferrons of a large radius at very low temperatures. The results are well
confirmed by the temperature dependence of resistivity and by metal type of the
compound.
