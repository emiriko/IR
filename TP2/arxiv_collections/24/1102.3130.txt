In the spinfoam framework for quantum gravity, we investigate the conditions
to have a physical quantum state for the Barrett-Crane model for the 4d quantum
gravity path integral. More precisely, we look at the simplest case of a single
4-simplex boundary and show that the requirement of working with a physical
boundary state fixes the width of the semi-classical Gaussian wave-packet for
the boundary 3d geometry. This is directly relevant to the graviton propagator
calculations done in this framework, since the Gaussian width enters the
numerical factors in front of the graviton correlations in the large scale
asymptotical limit. Finally, we discuss the application of our computations to
the Barrett-Crane model beyond the first order (of a single 4-simplex in the
bulk) and to the more recent EPRL-FK spinfoam model.
