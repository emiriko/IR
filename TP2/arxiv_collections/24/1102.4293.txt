The comparison of computer generated protein structural models is an
important element of protein structure prediction. It has many uses including
model quality evaluation, selection of the final models from a large set of
candidates or optimisation of parameters of energy functions used in
template-free modelling and refinement. Although many protein comparison
methods are available online on numerous web servers, they are not well suited
for large scale model comparison: (1) they operate with methods designed to
compare actual proteins, not the models of the same protein, (2) majority of
them offer only a single pairwise structural comparison and are unable to scale
up to a required order of thousands of comparisons. To bridge the gap between
the protein and model structure comparison we have developed the Protein Models
Comparator (pm-cmp). To be able to deliver the scalability on demand and handle
large comparison experiments the pm-cmp was implemented "in the cloud".
  Protein Models Comparator is a scalable web application for a fast
distributed comparison of protein models with RMSD, GDT TS, TM-score and
Q-score measures. It runs on the Google App Engine (GAE) cloud platform and is
a showcase of how the emerging PaaS (Platform as a Service) technology could be
used to simplify the development of scalable bioinformatics services. The
functionality of pm-cmp is accessible through API which allows a full
automation of the experiment submission and results retrieval. Protein Models
Comparator is free software released on the Affero GNU Public Licence and is
available with its source code at: http://www.infobiotics.org/pm-cmp
  This article presents a new web application addressing the need for a
large-scale model-specific protein structure comparison and provides an insight
into the GAE (Google App Engine) platform and its usefulness in scientific
computing.
