The prevalence of blast-induced traumatic brain injury in conflicts in Iraq
and Afghanistan has motivated laboratory scale experiments on biomedical
effects of blast waves and studies of blast wave transmission properties of
various materials in hopes of improving armor design to mitigate these
injuries. This paper describes the design and performance of a table-top shock
tube that is more convenient and widely accessible than traditional compression
driven and blast driven shock tubes. The design is simple: it is an explosive
driven shock tube employing a rifle primer which explodes when impacted by the
firing pin. The firearm barrel acts as the shock tube, and the shock wave
emerges from the muzzle. The small size of this shock tube can facilitate
localized application of a blast wave to a subject, tissue, or material under
test.
