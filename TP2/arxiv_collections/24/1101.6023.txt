We discuss the deconstructed version of a topcolor-assisted technicolor model
wherein the mechanism of top quark mass generation is separated from the rest
of electroweak symmetry breaking. The minimal deconstructed version of this
scenario is a "triangle moose" model, where the top quark gets its mass from
coupling to a top-Higgs field, while the gauge boson masses are generated from
a Higgsless sector. The spectrum of the model includes scalar (top-Higgs) and
pseudoscalar (top-pion) states. In this paper, we study the properties of these
particles, discuss their production mechanisms and decay modes, and suggest how
best to search for them at the LHC.
