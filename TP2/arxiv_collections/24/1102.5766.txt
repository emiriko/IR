We present a general phenomenological model for superconducting qubits
subject to noise produced by two-state fluctuators whose couplings to the qubit
are all roughly the same. In flux qubit experiments where the working point can
be varied, it is possible to extract both the form of the noise spectrum and
the number of fluctuators. We find that the noise has a broad spectrum
consistent with 1=f noise and that the number of fluctuators with slow
switching rates is surprisingly small: less than 100. If the fluctuators are
interpreted as unpaired surface spins, then the size of their magnetic moments
is surprisingly large.
