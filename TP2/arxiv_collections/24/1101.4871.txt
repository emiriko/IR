Numerous attempts have been made to interpret Earth's dynamic processes based
upon heat transport concepts derived from ordinary experience. But, ordinary
experience can be misleading, especially when underlain by false assumptions.
Geodynamic considerations traditionally have embraced three modes of heat
transport: conduction, convection, and radiation. Recently, I introduced a
fourth, "mantle decompression thermal tsunami" that, I submit, is responsible
for emplacing heat at the base of the Earth's crust. Here, I review thermal
transport within the Earth and speculate that there might be a fifth mode:
"heat channeling", involving heat transport from the core to "hot-spots" such
as those that power the Hawaiian Islands and Iceland.
