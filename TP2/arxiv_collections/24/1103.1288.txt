A constitutive model based on the combination of damage mechanics and
plasticity is developed to analyse concrete structures subjected to dynamic
loading. The aim is to obtain a model, which requires input parameters with
clear physical meanings. The model should describe the important
characteristics of concrete subjected to multiaxial and rate-depending loading.
This is achieved by combining an effective stress based plasticity model with
an isotropic damage model based on plastic and elastic strain measures. The
model response in tension, uni-, bi- and tri-axial compression is compared to
experimental results in the literature.
