Let $G_n(z)=\xi_0+\xi_1z+...+\xi_n z^n$ be a random polynomial with i.i.d.
coefficients (real or complex). We show that the arguments of the roots of
$G_n(z)$ are uniformly distributed in $[0,2\pi]$ asymptotically as
$n\to\infty$. We also prove that the condition $\E\ln(1+|\xi_0|)<\infty$ is
necessary and sufficient for the roots to asymptotically concentrate near the
unit circumference.
