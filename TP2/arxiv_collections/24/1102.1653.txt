Omega Centauri is no longer the only globular cluster known to contain
multiple stellar populations, yet it remains the most puzzling. Due to the
extreme way in which the multiple stellar population phenomenon manifests in
this cluster, it has been suggested that it may be the remnant of a larger
stellar system. In this work, we present a spectroscopic investigation of the
stellar populations hosted in the globular cluster Omega Centauri to shed light
on its, still puzzling, chemical enrichment history. With this aim we used
FLAMES+GIRAFFE@VLT to observe 300 stars distributed along the multimodal red
giant branch of this cluster, sampling with good statistics the stellar
populations of different metallicities. We determined chemical abundances for
Fe, Na, O, and n-capture elements Ba and La. We confirm that Omega Centauri
exhibits large star-to-star variations in iron with [Fe/H] ranging from ~ -2.0
to ~ -0.7 dex. Barium and lanthanum abundances of metal poor stars are
correlated with iron, up to [Fe/H] -1.5, while they are almost constant (or at
least have only a moderate increase) in the more metal rich populations. There
is an extended Na-O anticorrelation for stars with [Fe/H]<~ -1.3 while more
metal rich stars are almost all Na-rich. Sodium was found to midly increase
with iron over all the metallicity range.
