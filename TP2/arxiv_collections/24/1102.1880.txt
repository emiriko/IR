The conductance of single molecule junctions is calculated using a Landauer
approach combined to many-body perturbation theory MBPT) to account for
electron correlation. The mere correction of the density-functional theory
eigenvalues, which is the standard procedure for quasiparticle calculations
within MBPT, is found not to affect noticeably the zero-bias conductance. To
reduce it and so improve the agreement with the experiments, the wavefunctions
also need to be updated by including the non-diagonal elements of the
self-energy operator.
