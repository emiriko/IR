Transport of point-size Brownian particles under the influence of a constant
and uniform force field through a three-dimensional channel with smoothly
varying periodic cross-section is investigated. Here, we employ an asymptotic
analysis in the ratio between the difference of the widest and the most narrow
constriction divided through the period length of the channel geometry. We
demonstrate that the leading order term is equivalent to the Fick-Jacobs
approximation. By use of the higher order corrections to the probability
density we derive an expression for the spatially dependent diffusion
coefficient D(x) which substitutes the constant diffusion coefficient present
in the common Fick-Jacobs equation. In addition, we show that in the diffusion
dominated regime the average transport velocity is obtained as the product of
the zeroth-order Fick-Jacobs result and the expectation value of the spatially
dependent diffusion coefficient <D(x)>. The analytic findings are corroborated
with the precise numerical results of a finite element calculation of the
Smoluchowski diffusive particle dynamics occurring in a reflection symmetric
sinusoidal-shaped channel.
