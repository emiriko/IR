This paper addresses the performance of space-time coding over fading
channels with impulsive noise which is known to accurately capture network
interference. We use the symmetric alpha stable noise distribution and adopt
two models which assume dependent and independent noise components across
receive antennas. We derive pairwise error probability (PEP) of orthogonal
space-time block codes (STBC) with a benchmark genie-aided receiver (GAR), or
the minimum distance receiver (MDR) which is optimal in the Gaussian case. For
general space-time codes we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver, and its
approximation at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting asymptotically
optimal receiver (AOR) does not depend on noise parameters and is
computationally simple. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to supplement our
analytical results and compare the performance of the receivers.
