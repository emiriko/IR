We report the first (to our knowledge) observation of correlated photon
emission in hydrogenated amorphous- silicon waveguides. We compare this to
photon generation in crystalline silicon waveguides with the same geome- try.
In particular, we show that amorphous silicon has a higher nonlinearity and
competes with crystalline silicon in spite of higher loss.
