Social network is a main tunnel of rumor spreading. Previous studies are
concentrated on a static rumor spreading. The content of the rumor is
invariable during the whole spreading process. Indeed, the rumor evolves
constantly in its spreading process, which grows shorter, more concise, more
easily grasped and told. In an early psychological experiment, researchers
found about 70% of details in a rumor were lost in the first 6 mouth-to-mouth
transmissions \cite{TPR}. Based on the facts, we investigate rumor spreading on
social networks, where the content of the rumor is modified by the individuals
with a certain probability. In the scenario, they have two choices, to forward
or to modify. As a forwarder, an individual disseminates the rumor directly to
its neighbors. As a modifier, conversely, an individual revises the rumor
before spreading it out. When the rumor spreads on the social networks, for
instance, scale-free networks and small-world networks, the majority of
individuals actually are infected by the multi-revised version of the rumor, if
the modifiers dominate the networks. Our observation indicates that the
original rumor may lose its influence in the spreading process. Similarly, a
true information may turn to be a rumor as well. Our result suggests the rumor
evolution should not be a negligible question, which may provide a better
understanding of the generation and destruction of a rumor.
