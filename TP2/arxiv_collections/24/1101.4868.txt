In three dimensional Fermi gases with spin imbalance, a competition exists
between Cooper pairing with zero and with finite momentum. The latter gives
rise to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase, which
only exists in a restricted area of the phase diagram as a function of chemical
potential imbalance and interaction strength. Applying an optical potential
along one direction enhances the FFLO region in this phase diagram. In this
paper, we construct the phase diagram as a function of polarization and
interaction strength in order to study the competition between the FFLO phase
and the spin balanced BCS phase. This allows to take into account the region of
phase separation, and provides a more direct connection with experiment.
Subsequently, we investigate the effects of the wavelength and the depth of the
optical potential, which is applied along one direction, on the FFLO state. It
is shown that the FFLO state can exist up to a higher level of spin imbalance
if the wavelength of the optical potential becomes smaller. Our results give
rise to an interesting effect: the maximal polarization at which the FFLO state
can exist, decreases when the interaction strength exceeds a certain critical
value. This counterintuitive phenomenon is discussed and the connection to the
optical potential is explained.
