The expression for the SEHR cross-section of symmetrical molecules within the
framework of the dipole-quadrupole theory is obtained. It is formed by
contributions, which depend on various dipole and quadrupole moments.
Estimation of the enhancement coefficients for the quadrupole enhancement
mechanism in some limited case can achieve the value . It is demonstrated that
the contributions follow some selection rules. Qualitative classification of
the contributions after the enhancement degree is given.
