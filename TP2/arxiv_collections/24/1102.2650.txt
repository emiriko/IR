We introduce a method for the theoretical analysis of exponential random
graph models. The method is based on a large-deviations approximation to the
normalizing constant shown to be consistent using theory developed by
Chatterjee and Varadhan [European J. Combin. 32 (2011) 1000-1017]. The theory
explains a host of difficulties encountered by applied workers: many distinct
models have essentially the same MLE, rendering the problems ``practically''
ill-posed. We give the first rigorous proofs of ``degeneracy'' observed in
these models. Here, almost all graphs have essentially no edges or are
essentially complete. We supplement recent work of Bhamidi, Bresler and Sly
[2008 IEEE 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS)
(2008) 803-812 IEEE] showing that for many models, the extra sufficient
statistics are useless: most realizations look like the results of a simple
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model. We also find classes of models where the limiting
graphs differ from Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs. A limitation of our approach,
inherited from the limitation of graph limit theory, is that it works only for
dense graphs.
