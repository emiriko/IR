Recently it was argued that the exact R charge for three dimensional N=2
supersymmetric field theories extremizes the partition function localized on
S^3. In this paper we check this conjecture by computing the R charge for
SU(N)_k YM CS gauge theories at large k for many representations, and we test
the agreement with the perturbative results.
