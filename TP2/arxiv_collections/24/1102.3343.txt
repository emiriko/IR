Refractive optical trapping forces can be nonconservative in the vicinity of
a stable equilibrium point even in the absence of radiation pressure. We
discuss how nonconservative 3D force fields, in the vicinity of an equilibrium
point, reduce to circular forcing in a plane; a simple model of such forcing is
the refractive trapping of a sphere by a four rays. We discuss in general the
diffusion of an anisotropically trapped, circularly forced particle and obtain
its spectrum of motion. Equipartition of potential energy holds even though the
nonconservative flow does not follow equipotentials of the trap. We find that
the dissipated nonconservative power is proportional to temperature, providing
a mechanism for a runaway heating instability in traps.
