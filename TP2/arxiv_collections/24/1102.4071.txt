This paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental study of
plasma-assisted reforming of ethanol into molecular hydrogen in a new
modification of the "tornado" type electrical discharge. Numerical modeling
clarifies the nature of the non-thermal conversion and explains the kinetic
mechanism of nonequilibrium plasma-chemical transformations in the gas-liquid
system and the evolution of hydrogen during the reforming as a function of
discharge parameters and ethanol-to-water ratio in the mixture. We also propose
a scheme of chemical reactions for plasma kinetics description. It is shown
that some characteristics of the investigated reactor are at least not inferior
to characteristics of other plasma chemical reactors.
