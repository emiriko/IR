Self-organized criticality (SOC) is a popular concept that has been the
subject of more than 3000 articles in the last 25 years. Here we show that SOC
may enable theory to connect standard Web-based (BLAST) short-range amino acid
(aa) similarities to long-range aa roughening form factors that accurately
describe evolutionary trends in water-membrane protein interactions. Our method
utilizes a hydropathic aa metric based on 5526 protein segments and thereby
encapsulates differential geometrical features of the Protein Data Bank. It
easily organizes small aa sequence differences between humans and proximate
species. For rhodopsin, the most studied transmembrane signaling protein
associated with night vision, it shows that short- and long-range aa sequence
properties correlate with 96% success for humans, monkeys, cats, mice and
rabbits. Proper application of SOC promises unprecedented simplifications of
exponentially complex protein sequence-structure-function problems, both
conceptual and practical.
