We study nondeterministic strategies in parity games with the aim of
computing a most permissive winning strategy. Following earlier work, we
measure permissiveness in terms of the average number/weight of transitions
blocked by the strategy. Using a translation into mean-payoff parity games, we
prove that the problem of computing (the permissiveness of) a most permissive
winning strategy is in NP intersected coNP. Along the way, we provide a new
study of mean-payoff parity games. In particular, we prove that the opponent
player has a memoryless optimal strategy and give a new algorithm for solving
these games.
