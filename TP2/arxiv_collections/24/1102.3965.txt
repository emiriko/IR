In the present study we find that nuclei having double width do not emit free
nucleons for a long period of time necessary to study heavy-ion collisions.
Also, the ground state properties of all the nuclei are also described well. In
the low mass region, the obtained nuclei are less bound but stable. Heavy mass
nuclei have proper binding energy and are stable
