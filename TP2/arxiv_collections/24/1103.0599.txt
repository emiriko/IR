We study superradiant scattering from a Bose-Einstein condensate using a pump
laser incident at variable angle and show the presence of asymmetrically
populated scattering modes. Experimental data reveal that the direction of the
pump laser plays a significant role in the formation of this asymmetry, result
which is in good agreement with numerical simulations based on coupled
Maxwell-Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Our study complements the gap of previous
work in which the pump laser was only applied along the short axis or the long
axis of a condensate, and extends our knowledge about cooperative scattering
processes.
