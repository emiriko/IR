It is considered an interdependence of the theory of quantum computing and
some perspective information technologies. A couple of illustrative and useful
examples are discussed. The reversible computing from very beginning had the
serious impact on the design of quantum computers and it is revisited first.
Some applications of ternary circuits are also quite instructive and it may be
useful in the quantum information theory.
