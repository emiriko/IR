Phase-pure polycrystalline Ba0.6K0.4+xFe2As2 with were prepared using a
one-step solid-state reaction method. We found that over-doping of potassium
can improve critical current density (Jc). High-field Jc for samples with x =
0.1 is three times higher than that for samples with x = 0. Over-doping of K
has minimal effect on the critical transition temperature (Tc). Less than 0.5 K
degradations in Tc was measured for samples with x = 0.1. TEM revealed high
concentration of dislocations in samples with x = 0.1, resulting in enhanced
flux pining. Further analyses on magnetization loops for powder samples confirm
that K over-doping can promote intra-grain Jc. Our results indicate that slight
excess of K in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 samples is beneficial to high-field
applications.
