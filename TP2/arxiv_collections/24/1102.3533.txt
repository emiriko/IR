This paper presents experimental checking of the model for measuring
available bandwidth in IPv6. The experiment was performed using a measuring
infrastructure RIPE test box, ensuring precision accuracy. The experimental
results showed that to increase the accuracy of available bandwidth, we need to
neutralize the effect of the variable part of the delay by increasing the
number of measurements. Finally, we made the computer simulation, which allowed
us to establish a dependence between the measurement error of the available
bandwidth and the number of measurements.
