We present an iterative scheme designed to recover calibrated I, Q, and U
maps from Planck-HFI data using the orbital dipole due to the satellite motion
with respect to the Solar System frame. It combines a map reconstruction, based
on a destriping technique, juxtaposed with an absolute calibration algorithm.
We evaluate systematic and statistical uncertainties incurred during both these
steps with the help of realistic, Planck-like simulations containing CMB,
foreground components and instrumental noise, and assess the accuracy of the
sky map reconstruction by considering the maps of the residuals and their
spectra. In particular, we discuss destriping residuals for polarization
sensitive detectors similar to those of Planck-HFI under different noise
hypotheses and show that these residuals are negligible (for intensity maps) or
smaller than the white noise level (for Q and U Stokes maps), for l > 50. We
also demonstrate that the combined level of residuals of this scheme remains
comparable to those of the destriping-only case except at very low l where
residuals from the calibration appear. For all the considered noise hypotheses,
the relative calibration precision is on the order of a few 10e-4, with a
systematic bias of the same order of magnitude.
