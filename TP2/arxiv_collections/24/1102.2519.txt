We calculate the neutrino masses, using the experimental data on the periods
of the time modulation of the K-shell electron capture (EC) decay rates of the
H-like heavy ions, measured at GSI. The corrections to neutrino masses, caused
by interaction of massive neutrinos with the strong Coulomb field of the
daughter ions, are taken into account.
