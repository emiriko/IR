We show theoretically that flexoelectricity stabilizes blue phases in chiral
liquid crystals. Induced internal polarization reduces the elastic energy cost
of splay and bend deformations surrounding singular lines in the director
field. The energy of regions of double twist is unchanged. This in turn reduces
the free energy of the blue phase with respect to that of the chiral nematic
phase, leading to stability over a wider temperature range. The theory explains
the discovery of large temperature range blue phases in highly flexoelectric
"bimesogenic" and "bent-core" materials, and predicts how this range may be
increased further.
