A collection of active photometric observations over the last half decade,
archival data from the past 120 years, radial velocity observations from 1984,
and recent monitoring through a pro-am collaboration reveal that the 9th
magnitude F9 Ib supergiant HDE 344787 is a double-mode Cepheid variable of
extremely small amplitude. It displays remarkably similar, but much more
extreme, properties to the exotic Cepheid Polaris, including a
rapidly-increasing period and sinusoidal light variations of decreasing
amplitude suggesting that pulsational stability may occur as early as 2045.
Unlike Polaris, HDE 344787 displays sinusoidal light variations at periods of
both 5.4 and 3.8 days, corresponding to canonical fundamental mode and overtone
pulsation. But it may be similar to Polaris in helping to define a small
subgroup of Cepheids that display characteristics consistent with a first
crossing of the instability strip. An update of 2010 observations of this
remarkable star is presented.
