We have studied plume formation after a Jovian comet impact using the ZEUS-MP
2 hydrodynamics code. The three-dimensional models followed objects with 500,
750, and 1000 meter diameters. Our simulations show the development of a fast,
upward-moving component of the plume in the wake of the impacting comet that
"pinches off" from the bulk of the cometary material ~50 km below the 1 bar
pressure level, ~100 km above the depth of greatest mass and energy deposition.
The fast-moving component contains about twice the mass of the initial comet,
but consists almost entirely (>99.9%) of Jovian atmosphere rather than cometary
material. The ejecta rise mainly along the impact trajectory, but an additional
vertical velocity component due to buoyancy establishes itself within seconds
of impact, leading to an asymmetry in the ejecta with respect to the entry
trajectory. The mass of the upward-moving component follows a velocity
distribution M(>v) approximately proportional to v^-1.4 (v^-1.6 for the 750 m
and 500 m cases) in the velocity range 0.1 < v < 10 km/s.
