Examination of the free-fall motion of particles of extremely high-speed in
the Schwarzschild geometry reveals that the gravitational acceleration of such
particles is reversed when measured in Schwarzschild coordinates. High-speed
particles decelerate when moving radially downward, and they accelerate when
moving upward. The onset of this abnormal behavior occurs at a speed of
1/Sqrt(3) times the local value of the speed of light. However, the
gravitational force always remains attractive. PACS numbers: 04.20.-q,
