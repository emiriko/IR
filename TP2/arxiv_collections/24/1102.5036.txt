We study spinor field theories as an origin to induce space-time evolution.
Self-interacting spinor fields with canonical and non-canonical kinetic terms
are considered in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe. The deceleration
parameter is calculated by solving the equation of motion and the Friedman
equation, simultaneously. It is shown that the spinor fields can accelerate and
decelerate the universe expansion. To construct realistic models we discuss the
contributions from the dynamical symmetry breaking.
