While standard heavy fermion metals feature a single spin-1/2 local moment
per unit cell, more complicated systems with multiple distinct local moments
have been synthesized as well, with Ce_3Pd_20(Si,Ge)_6 being one example. Here,
we discuss the physics of a Kondo lattice model with two local-moment
sublattices, coupled with different Kondo couplings to conduction electrons.
The phase diagram will be strongly modified from that of the standard Kondo
lattice if the characteristic screening temperatures of the distinct moments
are well separated. Therefore, we investigate the interplay between the two
Kondo effects using a local self-energy approximation via slave bosons. We find
that the two Kondo effects can either compete or co-operate depending on the
conduction-band filling. In the regime of competition, small differences in the
two Kondo couplings can lead to huge differences in the respective Kondo
scales, due to non-trivial many-body effects. We also study the low-temperature
properties of the collective heavy Fermi-liquid state and propose a connection
to depleted Kondo lattice systems.
