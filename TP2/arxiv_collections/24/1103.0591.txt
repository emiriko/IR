The differential conductance of In/Bi2Te3 contact under cryogenic temperature
is investigated. Anomalous zero/finite bias differential conductance has been
observed. The dependence of the observed anomalous differential conductance on
magnetic field and temperature is studied. Data analysis indicates that the
anomalous differential conductance is caused by the peculiar transport
properties of the superconducting Indium/Bi2Te3 interface where Andreev
reflection plays a key role.
