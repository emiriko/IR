We consider a toy model to analyze the consequences of dark matter
interaction with a dark energy background on the overall rotation of galaxy
clusters and the misalignment between their dark matter and baryon
distributions when compared to {\Lambda}CDM predictions. The interaction
parameters are found via a genetic algorithm search. The results obtained
suggest that interaction is a basic phenomenon whose effects are detectable
even in simple models of galactic dynamics.
