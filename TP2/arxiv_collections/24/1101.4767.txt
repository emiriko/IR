We propose a scheme to produce time bin entangled pairs of electrons and
holes based on high frequency time-resolved single electron emission from a
quantum dot coupled to 1D chiral channels. At first order in the tunneling
rate, an electron-hole pair is emitted in a coherent superposition state of
different time bins that violates a CHSH inequality. in our scheme entanglement
can be detected by means of a Franson interferometer in which the electron and
the hole are sent towards different Mach-Zehnder interferometers. An analysis
of current cross-correlations allows to detect violations of the CHSH
inequality.
