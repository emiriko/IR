In classical physics the energy density of a field is always positive.
However this does not hold true for quantum physics where the energy density of
a field can be locally negative. There are limits on the weighted average of
this negative energy density called the quantum inequalities. Recently this
author has provided a number of examples which show that the quantum
inequalities are not valid. In this paper we will examine a previously
published proof of the spatial quantum inequality for a zero mass scalar field
in 1-1 dimensional space-time. It will be shown that there is a possible
problem with this proof due to an ambiguity associated with point split
regularization and the definition of the Hadamard form for the two point
function.
