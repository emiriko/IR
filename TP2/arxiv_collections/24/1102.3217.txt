The paper presents amended basic map of states of chemical systems in
discrete thermodynamics of chemical equilibria. Uniting two previously found
basic map types in one and covering a wider range of situations, it allows us
to obtain more detailed pictures and deeper understanding of what is the
general chemical system response to the external impact. Amended in this work
general expression allows for more flexibility in the response treatment.
Graphical solutions to the map, bifurcation diagrams, contain the monostable
thermodynamic branch prior to and the bi-stable area after the bifurcation
point. On the static diagrams the first consists of two areas - true
thermodynamic equilibrium and open equilibrium; the first area is skipped on
the dynamic diagrams. In the bi-stable area, the system stresses, caused by
further increase of the external impact, discharge themselves through chaotic
oscillations, enveloped by two bifurcation sub-branches. Now bifurcation
diagrams, corresponding to the amended map, are essentially closer to some
experimental graphs, obtained, for instance, in experiments with
electrochemical systems.
