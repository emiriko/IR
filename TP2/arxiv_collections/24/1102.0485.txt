Cooperative communications is a class of techniques which seek to improve
reliability and throughput in wireless systems by pooling the resources of
distributed nodes. While cooperation can occur at different network layers and
time scales, physical layer cooperation at symbol time scales offers the
largest benefit in combating losses due to fading. However, symbol level
cooperation poses significant implementation challenges, especially in
synchronizing the behaviors and carrier frequencies of distributed nodes. We
present the implementation and characterization of a complete, real-time
cooperative physical layer transceiver built on the Rice Wireless Open-Access
Research Platform (WARP). In our implementation autonomous nodes employ
physical layer cooperation without a central synchronization source, and are
capable of selecting between non-cooperative and cooperative communication per
packet. Cooperative transmissions use a distributed Alamouti space-time block
code and employ either amplify-and-forward or decode-and-forward relaying. We
also present experimental results of our transceiver's real-time performance
under a variety of topologies and propagation conditions. Our results clearly
demonstrate significant performance gains (more than 40x improvement in PER in
some topologies) provided by physical layer cooperation, even when subject to
the constraints of a real-time implementation. We also present methodologies to
isolate and understand the sources of performance bottlenecks in our design. As
with all our work on WARP, our transceiver design and experimental framework
are available via the open-source WARP repository for use by other wireless
researchers.
