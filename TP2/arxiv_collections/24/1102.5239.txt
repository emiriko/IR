To assess the durability of structures, heat and moisture transport need to
be analyzed. To provide a reliable estimation of heat and moisture distribution
in a certain structure, one needs to include all available information about
the loading conditions and material parameters. Moreover, the information
should be accompanied by a corresponding evaluation of its credibility. Here,
the Bayesian inference is applied to combine different sources of information,
so as to provide a more accurate estimation of heat and moisture fields [1].
The procedure is demonstrated on the probabilistic description of heterogeneous
material where the uncertainties consist of a particular value of individual
material characteristic and spatial fluctuations. As for the heat and moisture
transfer, it is modelled in coupled setting [2].
