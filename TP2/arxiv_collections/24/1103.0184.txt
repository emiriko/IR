We construct an effective chiral Lagrangian for hadrons implemented by the
conformal invariance and discuss the properties of nuclear matter at high
density. The model is formulated based on two alternative assignment, "naive"
and mirror, of chirality to the nucleons. It is shown that taking the dilaton
limit, in which the mended symmetry of Weinberg is manifest, the vector-meson
Yukawa coupling becomes suppressed and the symmetry energy becomes softer as
one approaches the chiral phase transition. This leads to softer equations of
state (EoS) and could accommodate the EoS without any exotica consistent with
the recent measurement of a $1.97 \pm 0.04\,M_\odot$ neutron star.
