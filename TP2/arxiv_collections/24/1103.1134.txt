Product Data Management (PDM) desktop and web based systems maintain the
organizational technical and managerial data to increase the quality of
products by improving the processes of development, business process flows,
change management, product structure management, project tracking and resource
planning. Though PDM is heavily benefiting industry but PDM community is facing
a very serious unresolved issue in PDM system development with flexible and
user friendly graphical user interface for efficient human machine
communication. PDM systems offer different services and functionalities at a
time but the graphical user interfaces of most of the PDM systems are not
designed in a way that a user (especially a new user) can easily learn and use
them. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in field of Human
Computer Interaction; resultant data provides the information about graphical
user interface development using rich internet applications. The accomplished
goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a proposition of a
conceptual model for the implementation of a flexible web based graphical user
interface. The proposed conceptual model was successfully designed into
implementation model and a resultant prototype putting values to the field is
now available. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,
implementation designs and developed prototype is also discussed in this paper.
Moreover in the end, prototype is compared with respective functions of
existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness
against targeted challenge
