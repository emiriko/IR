A workable model for describing dislocation lines introduced into a
three-dimensional topological insulator is proposed. We show how fragile
surface Dirac cones of a weak topological insulator evolve into protected
gapless helical modes confined to the vicinity of dislocation line. It is
demonstrated that surface Dirac cones of a topological insulator (either strong
or weak) acquire a finite-size energy gap, when the surface is deformed into a
cylinder penetrating the otherwise surface-less system. We show that when a
dislocation with a non-trivial Burgers vector is introduced, the finite-size
energy gap play the role of stabilizing the one-dimensional gapless states.
