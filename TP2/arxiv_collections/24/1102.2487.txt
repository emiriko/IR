We use Ikehata's enclosure method to reconstruct penetrable unknown
inclusions in a plane elastic body in time-harmonic waves. Complex geometrical
optics solutions with complex polynomial phases are adopted as the probing
utility. In a situation similar to ours, due to the presence of a zeroth order
term in the equation, some technical assumptions need to be assumed in early
researches. In a recent work of Sini and Yoshida, they succeeded in abandoning
these assumptions by using a different idea to obtain a crucial estimate. In
particular the boundaries of the inclusions need only to be Lipschitz. In this
work we apply the same idea to our model. It's interesting that, with more
careful treatment, we find the boundaries of the inclusions can in fact be
assumed to be only continuous.
