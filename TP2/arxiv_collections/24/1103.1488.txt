Using angle-resolved heterodyne four-wave-mixing technique, we probe the low
momentum excitation spectrum of a coherent polariton gas. The experimental
results are well captured by the Bogoliubov transformation which describes the
transition from single particle excitations of a normal fluid to
sound-wave-like excitations of a superfluid. In a dense coherent polariton gas,
we find all the characteristics of a Bogoliubov transformation, i.e. the
positive and negative energy branch with respect to the polariton gas energy at
rest, sound-wave-like shapes for the excitations dispersion, intensity and
linewidth ratio between the two branches in agreement with the theory. The
influence of the non-equilibrium character of the polariton gas is shown by a
careful analysis of its dispersion.
