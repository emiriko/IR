We study a unified mechanism for spin-density-wave (SDW) and
superconductivity in a minimal model, in which itinerant electrons and local
moments coexist as previously proposed for the iron pnictides [EPL, 88, 17010
(2009)]. The phase diagram obtained at the mean field level is in qualitative
agreement with the experiment, which shows how the magnetic and superconducting
(SC) instabilities are driven by the critial coupling between the
itinerant/localized electrons. The spin and charge response functions at the
random phase approximation (RPA) level further characterize the dynamical
evolution of the system. In particular, the dynamic spin susceptibility
displays a Goldstone mode in the SDW phase, which evolves into a gapped
resonance-like mode in the superconducting phase. The latter persists all the
way into the normal state above Tc, where a strong scattering between the
itinerant electrons and local moments is restored, as an essential feature of
the model.
