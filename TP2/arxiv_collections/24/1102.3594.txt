The D0 collaboration has recently introduced new variables, a_T and phi* to
more accurately probe the low Q_T domain of Z boson production at hadron
colliders than had been previously possible through a direct study of the Q_T
distribution. The comparison of such accurate data to precise theoretical
predictions from QCD perturbation theory will yield important information on
the ability of resummed QCD predictions as well as parton shower models to
describe the low Q_T domain and should enable more stringent constraints on
non-perturbative effects. In the present paper we provide analytical
predictions for the above mentioned variables, that contain resummation of
large logarithms, including next-to-next-to leading logarithmic (NNLL) terms,
supplemented by exact next-to-leading order calculations from MCFM.
