In this paper we study the tailoring of photon spectral properties generated
by four-wave mixing in a birefringent photonic crystal fibre (PCF). The aim is
to produce intrinsically narrow-band photons and hence to achieve high
non-classical interference visibility and generate high fidelity entanglement
without any requirement for spectral filtering, leading to high effective
detection efficiencies. We show unfiltered Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
visibilities of 77% between photons from the same PCF, and 80% between separate
sources. We compare results from modelling the PCF to these experiments and
analyse photon purities.
