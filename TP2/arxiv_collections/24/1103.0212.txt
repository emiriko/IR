We present numerical studies of non-linear conduction in graphene nanoribbons
when a bias potential is applied between the source and drain electrodes. We
find that the conductance quantization plateaus show asymmetry between the
electron and hole branches if the potential in the ribbon equals the source or
drain electrode potential and strong electron (hole) scattering occurs. The
scattering may be at the ends of a uniform ballistic ribbon connecting wider
regions of graphene or may be due to defects in the ribbon. We argue that, in
ribbons with strong defect scattering, the ribbon potential is pinned to that
of the drain (source) for electron (hole) transport. In this case symmetry
between electron and hole transport is restored and our calculations explain
the upward shift of the conductance plateaus with increasing bias that was
observed experimentally by Lin et al. [Phys. Rev. B 78, 161409 (2008)].
