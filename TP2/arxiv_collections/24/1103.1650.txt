We study symmetric random walks on finitely generated groups of
orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the real line. We establish an
oscillation property for the induced Markov chain on the line that implies a
weak form of recurrence. Except for a few special cases, which can be treated
separately, we prove a property of "global stability at a finite distance":
roughly speaking, there exists a compact interval such that any two
trajectories get closer and closer whenever one of them returns to the compact
interval. The probabilistic techniques employed here lead to interesting
results for the study of group actions on the line. For instance, we show that
under a suitable change of the coordinates, the drift of every point becomes
zero provided that the action is minimal. As a byproduct, we recover the fact
that every finitely generated group of homeomorphisms of the real line is
topologically conjugate to a group of (globally) Lipschitz homeomorphisms.
Moreover, we show that such a conjugacy may be chosen in such a way that the
displacement of each element is uniformly bounded.
