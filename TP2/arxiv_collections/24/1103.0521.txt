This paper proves endpoint Strichartz estimates for the linear Schroedinger
equation in $R^3$, with a time-dependent potential that keeps a constant
profile and is subject to a rough motion, which need not be differentiable and
may be large in norm. The potential is also subjected to a time-dependent
rescaling, with a non-differentiable dilation parameter.
  We use the Strichartz estimates to prove the non-dispersion of bound states,
when the path is small in norm, as well as boundedness of energy.
  We also include a sample nonlinear application of the linear results.
