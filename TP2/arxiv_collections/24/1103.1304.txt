The Rotating RAdio Transient (RRAT) J1819-1458 exhibits ~3 ms bursts in the
radio every ~3 min, implying that it is visible for only ~1 per day. Assuming
that the optical light behaves in a similar manner, long exposures of the field
would be relatively insensitive due to the accumulation of sky photons. A much
better way of detecting optical emission from J1819-1458 would then be to
observe with a high-speed optical camera simultaneously with radio
observations, and co-add only those optical frames coincident with the
dispersion-corrected radio bursts. We present the results of such a search,
using simultaneous ULTRACAM and Lovell Telescope observations. We find no
evidence for optical bursts in J1819-1458 at magnitudes brighter than i'=19.3
(5-sigma limit). This is nearly 3 magnitudes fainter than the previous burst
limit, which had no simultaneous radio observations.
