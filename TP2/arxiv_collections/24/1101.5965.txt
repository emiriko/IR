The recent conundrum with the proton charge radius inspires reconsideration
of the corrections that enter into determinations of the proton size. We study
the two-photon proton-structure corrections, with special consideration of the
non-pole subtraction term in the dispersion relation, and using fits to modern
data to evaluate the energy contributions. We find that individual
contributions change more than the total, and present results with error
estimates.
