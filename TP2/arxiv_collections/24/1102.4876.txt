The principal eigenvalue $\lambda$ of a network's adjacency matrix often
determines dynamics on the network (e.g., in synchronization and spreading
processes) and some of its structural properties (e.g., robustness against
failure or attack) and is therefore a good indicator for how ``strongly'' a
network is connected. We study how $\lambda$ is modified by the addition of a
module, or community, which has broad applications, ranging from those
involving a single modification (e.g., introduction of a drug into a biological
process) to those involving repeated additions (e.g., power-grid and transit
development). We describe how to optimally connect the module to the network to
either maximize or minimize the shift in $\lambda$, noting several applications
of directing dynamics on networks.
