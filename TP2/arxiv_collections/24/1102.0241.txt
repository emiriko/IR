For the lagrangian L = G ln G where G is the Gauss-Bonnet curvature scalar we
deduce the field equation and solve it in closed form for 3-flat Friedman
models using a statefinder parametrization. Further we show, that among all
lagrangians F(G) this L is the only one not having the form G^r with a real
constant r but possessing a scale-invariant field equation. This turns out to
be one of its analogies to f(R)-theories in 2-dimensional space-time. In the
appendix, we systematically list several formulas for the decomposition of the
Riemann tensor in arbitrary dimensions n, which are applied in the main
deduction for n=4.
