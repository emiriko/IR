The speed of sound in air can be measured by popping a balloon next to a
microphone a measured distance away from a large flat wall, digitizing the
sound waveform, and measuring the time between the sound of popping and return
of the echo to the microphone. The round trip distance divided by the time is
the speed of sound.
