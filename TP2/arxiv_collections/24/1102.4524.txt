We study the group of almost-periodic homeomorphisms of the real line. Our
main result states that an action of a finitely generated group on the real
line without global fixed point is conjugated to an almost-periodic action
without almost fixed point. This is equivalent to saying that the action on the
real line can be compactified to an action on a 1-dimensional lamination of a
compact space, without global fixed point. As an application we give an
alternative proof of Witte's theorem: an amenable left orderable group is
locally indicable.
