In this paper author proposes a construction of a universal space of type
$K(\pi,1)$ such that any action (up to homotopy conjugation) of a given finite
group $G$ on spaces of the same homotopy type is presented on the constructed
space. Moreover, any action of $G$ on any space of type $K(\pi,1)$ is covered
by some action of $G$ on this universal space.
