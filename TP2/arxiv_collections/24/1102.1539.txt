To relax the apparent tension between nonlocal hidden variables and
relativity, we propose that the observable proper time is not the same quantity
as the usual proper-time parameter appearing in local relativistic equations.
Instead, the two proper times are related by a nonlocal rescaling parameter
proportional to |psi|^2, so that they coincide in the classical limit. In this
way particle trajectories may obey local relativistic equations of motion in a
manner consistent with the appearance of nonlocal quantum correlations. To
illustrate the main idea, we first present two simple toy models of local
particle trajectories with nonlocal time, which reproduce some nonlocal quantum
phenomena. After that, we present a realistic theory with a capacity to
reproduce all predictions of quantum theory.
