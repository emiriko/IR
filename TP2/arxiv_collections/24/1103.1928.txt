For more than 50,000 years, Indigenous Australians have incorporated
celestial events into their oral traditions and used the motions of celestial
bodies for navigation, time-keeping, food economics, and social structure. In
this paper, we explore the ways in which Aboriginal people made careful
observations of the sky, measurements of celestial bodies, and incorporated
astronomical events into complex oral traditions by searching for written
records of time-keeping using celestial bodies, the use of rising and setting
stars as indicators of special events, recorded observations of variable stars,
the solar cycle, and lunar phases (including ocean tides and eclipses) in oral
tradition, as well as astronomical measurements of the equinox, solstice, and
cardinal points.
