We present a series of numerical simulations of the quiet Sun plasma threaded
by magnetic fields that extend from the upper convection zone into the low
corona. We discuss an efficient, simplified approximation to the physics of
optically thick radiative transport through the surface layers, and investigate
the effects of convective turbulence on the magnetic structure of the Sun's
atmosphere in an initially unipolar (open field) region. We find that the net
Poynting flux below the surface is on average directed toward the interior,
while in the photosphere and chromosphere the net flow of electromagnetic
energy is outward into the solar corona. Overturning convective motions between
these layers driven by rapid radiative cooling appears to be the source of
energy for the oppositely directed fluxes of electromagnetic energy.
