The rebound indentation test consisting of the displacement-controlled and
load-controlled stages is considered for a frictionless cylindrical flat-ended
indenter. The mechanical behavior of an articular cartilage layer sample is
modeled in the framework of viscoelastic model with time-independent Poisson's
ratio. Closed-form analytical expressions for the contact force (in the
displacement controlled stage) and for the indentation displacement (in the
load-controlled stage) are presented for an arbitrary viscoelastic solid model.
The case of standard viscoelastic solid model is considered in detail. It has
been established that the rebound displacement (that is the indentation
displacement in the load-controlled stage) does not depend on the relaxed
elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio as well as on the layer's thickness.
