Single top quark production at the ILC can be used to obtain a high precision
measurements of the the Vtb CKM matrix element as well as the effective tbW
coupling. We have calculated the QCD correction for the cross section in the
context of an effective vector boson approximation. Our results show a 10%
increase due to the strong interaction.
