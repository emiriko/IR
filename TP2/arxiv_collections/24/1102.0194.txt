The complexation of micelles or charged nanoparticles with neutral-charged
block copolymers in aqueous solutions leads to the formation of colloidal
superstructures also termed 'colloidal complexes'. Their primary interest
relies in their monodispersity in size, and in their increased domain of
stability. In this review, the structural characterization by dynamic light
scattering, cryo-TEM, and small angle neutron scattering is presented. Small
angle neutron scattering results have been analyzed using numerical simulations
- Monte Carlo or reverse Monte Carlo (RMC). Such simulations are useful to show
the compatibility between different models of colloidal superstructures, and
experiment. Our results have allowed us to propose a generic structure of
complex colloids, made of a dense core of interacting colloids, bridged by
polyelectrolyte blocks, and a hydrated corona. We have shown that such
superstructures are formed systematically in these systems, with either
micelles or nanoparticles, for different copolymers, and different charges. The
