A two-component dark matter model is studied adopting the degenerate scenario
in the R-parity conserving NMSSM. The gravitino LSP and the neutralino NLSP are
extremely degenerate in mass, avoiding the BBN bounds and obtaining a high
reheating temperature for thermal leptogenesis to work. In this model both
gravitino (absolutely stable) and neutralino (quasi-stable) contribute to dark
matter, and direct detection searches for neutralino are discussed. Points that
survive all the constraints correspond to a singlino-like neutralino.
