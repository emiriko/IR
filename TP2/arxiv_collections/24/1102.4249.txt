We show that the lightest right-handed sneutrino in TeV scale supersymmetric
B-L model with inverse seesaw mechanism is a viable candidate for cold dark
matter. We find that it accounts for the observed dark matter relic abundance
in a wide range of parameter space. The spin-independent cross section of B-L
right-handed sneutrino is consistent with the recent results CDMS II and XENON
experiments and it is detectable in future direct detection experiments.
Although the B-L right-handed sneutrinos annihilate into leptons, the PAMELA
results can not be explained in this model unless a huge boost factor is
considered. Also the muon flux generated by B-L right-handed sneutrino in the
galactic center is smaller than Super-Kamiokande's upper bound.
