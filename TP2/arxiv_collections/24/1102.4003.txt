We introduce fully nonparametric two-sample tests for testing the null
hypothesis that the samples come from the same distribution if the values are
only indirectly given via current status censoring. The tests are based on the
likelihood ratio principle and allow the observation distributions to be
different for the two samples, in contrast with earlier proposals for this
situation. A bootstrap method is given for determining critical values and
asymptotic theory is developed. A simulation study, using Weibull
distributions, is presented to compare the power behavior of the tests with the
power of other nonparametric tests in this situation.
