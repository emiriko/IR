The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) plays an important role in the
description of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at the mean-field level. The
GPE belongs to the class of non-linear Schr\"odinger equations which are known
to feature dynamical instability and collapse for attractive non-linear
interactions. We show that the GPE with repulsive non-linear interactions
typical for BECs features chaotic wave dynamics. We find positive Lyapunov
exponents for BECs expanding in periodic and aperiodic smooth external
potentials as well as disorder potentials. Our analysis demonstrates that wave
chaos characterized by the exponential divergence of nearby initial
wavefunctions is to be distinguished from the notion of non-integrability of
non-linear wave equations. We discuss the implications of these observations
for the limits of applicability of the GPE, the problem of Anderson
localization, and the properties of the underlying many-body dynamics.
