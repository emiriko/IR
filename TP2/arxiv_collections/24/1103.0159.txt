The golden chain with antiferromagnetic interaction is an anyonic system of
particular interest as when all anyons are confined to the chain, it is readily
stabilised against fluctuations away from criticality. However, additional
local scaling operators have recently been identified on the disc which may
give rise to relevant fluctuations in the presence of free charges. Motivated
by these results for Fibonacci anyons, this paper presents a systematic method
of identifying all topological sectors of local scaling operators for critical
anyon rings of arbitrary winding number on surfaces of arbitrary genus,
extending the original classification scheme proposed in Feiguin et al. (2007).
Using the new scheme it is then shown that for the golden chain, additional
relevant scaling operators exist on the torus which are equivalent to those
detected on the disc, and which may disrupt the stability of the critical
system. Protection of criticality against perturbations generated by these
additional scaling operators can be achieved by suppressing the exchange of
charge between the anyon ring and the rest of the manifold.
