Two aspects of TDDFT, the linear response approach and the adiabatic local
density approximation, are examined from the perspective of lattice models. To
this end, we review the DFT formulations on the lattice and give a concise
presentation of the time-dependent Kadanoff-Baym equations, used to asses the
limitations of the adiabatic approximation in TDDFT. We present results for the
density response function of the 3D homogeneous Hubbard model, and point out a
drawback of the linear response scheme based on the linearized Sham-Schl\"uter
equation. We then suggest a prescription on how to amend it. Finally, we
analyze the time evolution of the density in a small cubic cluster, and compare
exact, adiabatic-TDDFT and Kadanoff-Baym-Equations densities. Our results show
that non-perturbative (in the interaction) adiabatic potentials can perform
quite well for slow perturbations but that, for faster external fields, memory
effects, as already present in simple many-body approximations, are clearly
required.
