We carried out high resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements on
the electronic structure and superconducting gap of K_0.68Fe_1.79Se_2 (T_c=32
K) and (Tl_0.45K_0.34)Fe_1.84Se_2 (T_c=28 K) superconductors. In addition to
the electron-like Fermi surface near M(\pi,\pi), two electron-like Fermi
pockets are revealed around the zone center \Gamma(0,0) in K0.68Fe1.79Se_2.
This observation makes the Fermi surface topology of K_0.68Fe_1.79Se_2
consistent with that of (Tl,Rb)_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 and (Tl,K)_xFe_{2-y}Se_2
compounds. A nearly isotropic superconducting gap (\Delta) is observed along
the electron-like Fermi pocket near the M point in K_0.68Fe_1.79Se_2
(\Delta\sim 9 meV) and (Tl_0.45K_0.34)Fe_1.84Se_2 (\Delta\sim 8 meV). The
establishment of a universal picture on the Fermi surface topology and
superconducting gap in the A_xFe_2-ySe_2 (A=K, Tl, Cs, Rb and etc.)
superconductors will provide important information in understanding the
superconductivity mechanism of the iron-based superconductors.
