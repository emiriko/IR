Motivated by recent developments in the field of one-dimensional topological
superconductors, we investigate the topological properties of s-matrix of
generic superconducting junctions where dimension should not play any role. We
argue that for a finite junction the s-matrix is always topologically trivial.
We resolve an apparent contradiction with the previous results by taking into
account the low-energy resonant poles of s-matrix. Thus no common topological
transition occur in a finite junction. We reveal a transition of a different
kind that concerns the configuration of the resonant poles.
