Several massive black holes exhibit flux variability on time scales that
correspond to source sizes of the order of few Schwarzschild radii. We survey
the potential of near-infrared and X-ray polarimetry to constrain physical
properties of such black hole systems, namely their spin and inclination. We
have focused on a model where an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretion
disk. A new method of searching for the time-lag between orthogonal
polarization channels is developed and applied to an ensemble of hot spot
models that samples a wide range of parameter space. We found that the hot spot
model predicts signatures in polarized light which are in the range to be
measured directly in the near future. However, our estimations are predicted
upon the assumption of a Keplerian velocity distribution inside the flow where
the dominant part of the magnetic field is toroidal. We also found that if the
right model of the accretion flow can be chosen for each source (e.g. on the
basis of magnetohydrodynamics simulations) then the black hole spin and
inclination can be constrained to a small two-dimensional area in the
spin-inclination space. The results of the application of the method to the
available near-infrared polarimetric data of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is
presented. It is shown that even with the currently available data the spin and
inclination of Sgr A* can be constrained. Next generations of near-infrared and
X-ray polarimeters should be able to exploit this tool.
