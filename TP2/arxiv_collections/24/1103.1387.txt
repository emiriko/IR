We present the results of a search for unusually rapidly rotating giant stars
in a large sample of K giants (~1300 stars) that had been spectroscopically
monitored as potential targets for the Space Interferometry Mission's
Astrometric Grid. The stars in this catalog are much fainter and typically more
metal-poor than those of other catalogs of red giant star rotational
velocities, but the spectra generally only have signal-to-noise (S/N) of
~20-60, making the measurement of the widths of individual lines difficult. To
compensate for this, we have developed a cross-correlation method to derive
rotational velocities in moderate S/N echelle spectra to efficiently probe this
sample for rapid rotator candidates. We have discovered 28 new red giant rapid
rotators as well as one extreme rapid rotator with a vsini of 86.4 km/s. Rapid
rotators comprise 2.2% of our sample, which is consistent with other surveys of
brighter, more metal-rich K giant stars. Although we find that the temperature
distribution of rapid rotators is similar to that of the slow rotators, this
may not be the case with the distributions of surface gravity and metallicity.
The rapid rotators show a slight overabundance of low gravity stars and as a
group are significantly more metal-poor than the slow rotators, which may
indicate that the rotators are tidally-locked binaries.
