We implemented a quasi time-dependent 2D stochastic model of solar modulation
describing the transport of cosmic rays (CR) in the heliosphere. Our code can
modulate the Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS) of a generic charged particle
(light cosmic ions and electrons), calculating the spectrum at 1AU. Several
measurements of CR antiparticles have been performed. Here we focused our
attention on the CR antiproton component and the antiproton over proton ratio.
We show that our model, using the same heliospheric parameters for both
particles, fit the observed anti-p/p ratio. We show a good agreement with
BESS-97 and PAMELA data and make a prediction for the AMS-02 experiment.
