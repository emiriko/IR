Landau gauge gluon propagators are studied numerically in the SU(3)
gluodynamics as well as in the full QCD with the number of flavors $n_F=2$
using efficient gauge fixing technique. We compare these propagators at
temperatures very close to the transition point in two phases : confinement and
deconfinement. The electric mass $m_E$ has been determined from the momentum
space longitudinal gluon propagator. Gribov copy effects are found to be rather
strong in the gluodynamics, while in the full QCD case they are weak ("Gribov
noise"). Also we analyse finite volume dependence of the transverse and
longitudinal propagators.
