In this paper we find asymptotic distribution for some unreliable networks.
Using Markov Additive Structure and Adan, Foley, McDonald method, we find the
exact asymptotic for the stationary distribution. With the help of MA structure
and matrix geometric approach, we also investigate the asymptotic when
breakdown intensity is small. In particular, two different asymptotic regimes
for small breakdown intensity suggest two different patterns of large
deviations, which is confirmed by simulation study.
