Sidon sequences and their generalizations have found during the years and
especially recently various applications in coding theory. One of the most
important applications of these sequences is in the connection of
synchronization patterns. A few constructions of two-dimensional
synchronization patterns are based on these sequences. In this paper we present
sufficient conditions that a two-dimensional synchronization pattern can be
transformed into a Sidon sequence. We also present a new construction for Sidon
sequences over an alphabet of size q(q-1), where q is a power of a prime.
