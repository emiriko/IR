The steady state motion of cylindrical droplets under the action of external
body force is investigated both theoretically and via lattice Boltzmann
simulation. As long as the shape-invariance of droplet is maintained, the
droplet's center-of-mass velocity linearly scales with both the force density
and the square of droplet radius. However, a non-linear behavior appears as the
droplet deformation becomes significant. This deformation is associated with
the drop elongation occurring at sufficiently high external forcing. Yet,
independent of either the force density or the droplet size, the center-of-mass
velocity is found to be linear in terms of the inverse of dynamic viscosity. In
addition, it is shown that the energy is mainly dissipated in a region near the
substrate particularly close to the three phase contact line. The total viscous
dissipation is found to be proportional to both the square of force density and
the inverse of dynamic viscosity. Moreover, the dependence of the
center-of-mass velocity on the equilibrium contact angle is investigated. A
simple analytic model is provided reproducing the observed behavior.
