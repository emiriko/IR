We have studied the nonlinear conductivity of two-dimensional Coulomb
glasses. We have used a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the dynamic of the
system under an applied electric field $E$. We found that in the nonlinear
regime the site occupancy in the Coulomb gap follows a Fermi-Dirac distribution
with an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, higher than the phonon bath
temperature $T$. The value of the effective temperature is compatible with that
obtained for slow modes from the generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
The nonlinear conductivity for a given electric field and $T$ is fairly similar
to the linear conductivity at the corresponding $T_{\rm eff}$. We found that
the dissipated power and the effective temperature are related by an expression
of the form $(T_{\rm eff}^\alpha-T^\alpha)T_{\rm eff}^{\beta-\alpha}$.
