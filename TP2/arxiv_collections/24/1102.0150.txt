We present the results of a comprehensive study of the chemically peculiar
stars HD 5797 and HD 40711. The stars have the same effective temperature, Teff
= 8900 K, and a similar chemical composition with large iron (+1.5 dex) and
chromium (+3 dex) overabundances compared to the Sun. The overabundance of
rare-earth elements typically reaches +3 dex. We have measured the magnetic
field of HD 5797. The longitudinal field component Be has been found to vary
sinusoidally between -100 and +1000 G with a period of 69 days. Our estimate of
the evolutionary status of the stars suggests that HD 5797 and HD 40711, old
objects with an age t \approx 5 \times 108 yr, are near the end of the core
hydrogen burning phase.
