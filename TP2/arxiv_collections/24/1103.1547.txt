I investigate the problem of finding a statistical description of a complex
many-body system whose invariant measure cannot be constructed stemming from
classical thermodynamics ensembles. By taking solitons as a reference system
and by employing a general formalism based on the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur
scheme, I demonstrate how to build an invariant measure and, within a one
dimensional phase space, how to develop a suitable thermodynamics. A detailed
example is provided with a universal model of wave propagation, with reference
to a transparent potential sustaining gray solitons. The system shows a rich
thermodynamic scenario, with a free energy landscape supporting phase
transitions and controllable emergent properties. I finally discuss the origin
such behavior, trying to identify common denominators in the area of complex
dynamics.
