The Chandra X-ray observatory has proven to be a vital tool for studying
high-energy emission processes in jets associated with Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN).We have compiled a sample of 27 AGN selected from the radio flux-limited
MOJAVE (Monitoring of Jets in AGN with VLBA Experiments) sample of highly
relativistically beamed jets to look for correlations between X-ray and radio
emission on kiloparsec scales. The sample consists of all MOJAVE quasars which
have over 100 mJy of extended radio emission at 1.4 GHz and a radio structure
of at least 3" in size. Previous Chandra observations have revealed X-ray jets
in 11 of 14 members of the sample, and we have carried out new observations of
the remaining 13 sources. Of the latter, 10 have Xray jets, bringing the
overall detection rate to ~ 78%. Our selection criteria, which is based on
highly compact, relativistically beamed jet emission and large extended radio
flux, thus provides an effective method of discovering new X-ray jets
associated with AGN. The detected X-ray jet morphologies are generally well
correlated with the radio emission, except for those displaying sharp bends in
the radio band. The X-ray emission mechanism for these powerful FR II
(Fanaroff-Riley type II) jets can be interpreted as inverse Compton scattering
off of cosmic microwave background (IC/CMB) photons by the electrons in the
relativistic jets. We derive viewing angles for the jets, assuming a
non-bending, non-decelerating model, by using superluminal parsec scale speeds
along with parameters derived from the inverse Compton X-ray model. We use
these angles to calculate best fit Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors for the
jets, as well as their possible ranges, which leads to extreme values for the
bulk Lorentz factor in some cases. When both the non-bending and
non-decelerating assumptions are relaxed [abridged]
