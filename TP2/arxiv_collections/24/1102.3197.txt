The exoplanetary science through direct imaging and spectroscopy will largely
expand with the forthcoming development of new instruments at the VLT (SPHERE),
Gemini (GPI), Subaru (HiCIAO), and Palomar (Project 1640) observatories. All
these ground-based adaptive optics instruments combine extremely high
performance adaptive optics (XAO) systems correcting for the atmospheric
turbulence with advanced starlight-cancellation techniques such as coronagraphy
to deliver contrast ratios of about 10-6 to 10-7. While the past fifteen years
have seen intensive research and the development of high-contrast coronagraph
concepts, very few concepts have been tested under dynamical seeing conditions
(either during sky observation or in a realistic laboratory environment). In
this paper, we discuss the results obtained with four different coronagraphs --
phase and amplitude types -- on the High-Order Testbench (HOT), the adaptive
optics facility developed at ESO. This facility emphasizes realistic conditions
encountered at a telescope (e.g., VLT), including a turbulence generator and a
high-order adaptive optics system. It enables to evaluate the performance of
high-contrast coronagraphs in the near-IR operating with an AO-corrected PSF of
90% Strehl ratio under 0.5 arcsec dynamical seeing.
