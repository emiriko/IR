We formulate an optimal stopping problem for a geometric Brownian motion
where the probability scale is distorted by a general nonlinear function. The
problem is inherently time inconsistent due to the Choquet integration
involved. We develop a new approach, based on a reformulation of the problem
where one optimally chooses the probability distribution or quantile function
of the stopped state. An optimal stopping time can then be recovered from the
obtained distribution/quantile function, either in a straightforward way for
several important cases or in general via the Skorokhod embedding. This
approach enables us to solve the problem in a fairly general manner with
different shapes of the payoff and probability distortion functions. We also
discuss economical interpretations of the results. In particular, we justify
several liquidation strategies widely adopted in stock trading, including those
of "buy and hold", "cut loss or take profit", "cut loss and let profit run" and
"sell on a percentage of historical high".
