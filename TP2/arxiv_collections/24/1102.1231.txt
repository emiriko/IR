In this paper, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for blind channel
estimation in redundant block transmission systems, a lower bound for the mean
squared error of any blind channel estimators. The derived CRB is valid for any
full-rank linear redundant precoder, including both zero-padded (ZP) and
cyclic-prefixed (CP) precoders. A simple form of CRBs for multiple complex
parameters is also derived and presented which facilitates the CRB derivation
of the problem of interest. A comparison is made between the derived CRBs and
performances of existing subspace-based blind channel estimators for both CP
and ZP systems. Numerical results show that there is still some room for
performance improvement of blind channel estimators.
