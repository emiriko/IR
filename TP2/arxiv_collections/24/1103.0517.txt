The fact that superfluid helium always leaks out of an open container is
usually explained by the phenomenon of wetting. In the present paper it is
demonstrated that this explanation is unconvincing. The fact can be readily
explained from the viewpoint of the interpretation of superfluidity proposed
earlier by the author according to which superfluidity is an equilibrium state
of liquid helium where the symmetry is spontaneously broken because of an
intrinsic superflow. Experiments on the thickness of moving helium films that
have given rise to much controversy are discussed as well. Some experiments
concerning the phenomena considered in the paper are proposed.
