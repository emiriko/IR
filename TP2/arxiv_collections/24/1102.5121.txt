We present a catalog of ~14,000 X-ray sources observed by the ACIS instrument
on the Chandra X-ray Observatory within a 1.42 square degree survey of the
Great Nebula in Carina, known as the Chandra Carina Complex Project (CCCP).
This study appears in a Special Issue of the ApJS devoted to the CCCP. Here, we
describe the data reduction and analysis procedures performed on the X-ray
observations, including calibration and cleaning of the X-ray event data, point
source detection, and source extraction. The catalog appears to be complete
across most of the field to an absorption-corrected total-band luminosity of
~10^{30.7} erg/s for a typical low-mass pre-main sequence star. Counterparts to
the X-ray sources are identified in a variety of visual, near-infrared, and
mid-infrared surveys. The X-ray and infrared source properties presented here
form the basis of many CCCP studies of the young stellar populations in Carina.
