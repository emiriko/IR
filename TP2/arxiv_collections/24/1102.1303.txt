Taming decoherence is essential in realizing quantum computation and quantum
communication. Here we experimentally demonstrate that decoherence due to
amplitude damping can be suppressed by exploiting quantum measurement reversal
in which a weak measurement and the reversing measurement are introduced before
and after the decoherence channel, respectively. We have also investigated the
trade-off relation between the degree of decoherence suppression and the
channel transmittance.
