The quantum dynamics of two entangled two-level atoms initially in extended
Werner-like (EWL) states is studied. Each of the two atoms is located within an
isolated and dissipative cavity. If the interaction time of atoms and cavities
is not very long, the amount of quantum discord and entanglement between two
atoms decreases as the system evolves. The sudden death of quantum discord and
entanglement of two atoms occurs within a short interaction time. However,
after a long interaction time, quantum discord and entanglement of two atoms
could be partially preserved due to the long-lived nature of quantum discord
and entanglement. Surprisingly, we find the amount of long-lived quantum
discord could be smaller than that of long-lived entanglement. Thus,
entanglement may be more robust than quantum discord against decoherence.
