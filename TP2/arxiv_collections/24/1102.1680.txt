The anomalously large like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic
b-hadron decays recently measured by the D0 Collaboration may be hinting at the
presence of CP-violating new physics in the mixing of B_s mesons. It has been
suggested that the effect of a nonstandard spin-1 particle lighter than the b
quark with flavor-changing couplings to b and s quarks can reproduce the D0
result within its one-sigma range. Here we explore the possibility that the new
particle also couples to charged leptons l=e,mu and thus contributes to rare b
-> s processes involving the leptons. We consider in particular constraints on
its couplings from existing experimental data on the inclusive B -> X_s l^+ l^-
and exclusive B -> K^{(*)} l^+ l^- decays, as well as the anomalous magnetic
moments of the leptons. We find that there is parameter space of the particle
that is allowed by the current data. Future measurements of these B transitions
and rare decays of the B_s meson, such as B_s -> (phi,eta,eta') l^+ l^- and B_s
-> l^+ l^-, at LHCb and next-generation B factories can probe its presence or
couplings more stringently.
