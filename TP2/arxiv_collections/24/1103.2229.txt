We experimentally show that exchange magnons can be detected using a
combination of spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect (iSHE) proving its
wavelength integrating capability down to the sub-micrometer scale. The magnons
were injected in a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet film by parametric pumping
and the iSHE-induced voltage was detected in an attached Pt layer. The role of
the density, wavelength, and spatial localization of the magnons for the spin
pumping efficiency is revealed. This study opens the field of the magnon-based
information processing to magnons with nano-scale wavelengths.
