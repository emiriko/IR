We analyze charge transport through a ballistic
ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor junction by means of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. We take into account the possibility that ferromagnetism in
the first electrode may be driven by a mass renormalization of oppositely
polarized carriers, i.e. by a spin bandwidth asymmetry, rather than by a rigid
splitting of up-and down-spin electron bands as in a standard Stoner
ferromagnet. By evaluating the averaged charge conductance for both an s- and a
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave order parameter for the S side, we show that the mass
mismatch in the ferromagnetic electrode may mimic a spin active barrier.
Indeed, in the $s$-wave case we show that under suitable conditions the spin
dependent conductance of minority carriers below the energy gap $\Delta_0$ can
be larger than for majority carriers, and lower above $\Delta_0$. On the other
hand, for a d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductor similar spin-dependent effects give
rise to an asymmetric peak splitting in the conductance. These results suggest
that the junction may work as a spin-filtering device.
