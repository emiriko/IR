Carbon nanotubes and graphene allow fabricating outstanding nanomechanical
resonators. They hold promise for various scientific and technological
applications, including sensing of mass, force, and charge, as well as the
study of quantum phenomena at the mesoscopic scale. Here, we have discovered
that the dynamics of nanotube and graphene resonators is in fact highly exotic.
We propose an unprecedented scenario where mechanical dissipation is entirely
determined by nonlinear damping. As a striking consequence, the quality factor
Q strongly depends on the amplitude of the motion. This scenario is radically
different from that of other resonators, whose dissipation is dominated by a
linear damping term. We believe that the difference stems from the reduced
dimensionality of carbon nanotubes and graphene. Besides, we exploit the
nonlinear nature of the damping to improve the figure of merit of
nanotube/graphene resonators.
