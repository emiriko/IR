This paper reviews the history and evidence related to remote wounding
effects of ballistic pressure waves imparted to tissue by the impact of a
bullet. Such remote effects are often referred to as hydraulic or hydrostatic
shock. In spite of considerable published evidence and a long history, some
medical professionals continue to regard the ability of a bullet to injure
tissue that is not directly crushed or stretched as mythical (Jandial R,
Reichwage B, Levy M, Duenas V, Sturdivan L. Ballistics for the neurosurgeon.
Neurosurgery. 2008:62:472-480.) Early references to these effects date to the
19th century; however, compelling experimental support and medical findings in
human case studies did not become available until the late 20th and early 21st
century.
