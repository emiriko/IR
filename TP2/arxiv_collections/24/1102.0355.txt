We predict by first-principles calculations that Au have strong affinity to
He in bcc Fe. The Au-Au bonding in the segregated Au layer at the He bubble
surface is stronger than Fe-Fe and Au-Fe interactions; therefore this layer
becomes an effective barrier to further He and slows down the bubble growth.
