A two-parameters family of Backlund transformations for the classical
elliptic Gaudin model is constructed. The maps are explicit, symplectic,
preserve the same integrals as for the continuous flows and are a time
discretization of each of these flows. The transformations can map real
variables into real variables, sending physical solutions of the equations of
motion into physical solutions. The starting point of the analysis is the
integrability structure of the model. It is shown how the analogue
transformations for the rational and trigonometric Gaudin model are a limiting
case of this one. An application to a particular case of the Clebsch system is
given.
