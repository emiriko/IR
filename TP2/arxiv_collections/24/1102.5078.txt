This paper considers the mean variance portfolio management problem. We
examine portfolios which contain both primary and derivative securities. The
challenge in this context is due to portfolio's nonlinearities. The delta-gamma
approximation is employed to overcome it. Thus, the optimization problem is
reduced to a well posed quadratic program. The methodology developed in this
paper can be also applied to pricing and hedging in incomplete markets.
