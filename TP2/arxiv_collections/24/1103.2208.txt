In this paper, we propose two algorithms for solving linear inverse problems
when the observations are corrupted by noise. A proper data fidelity term
(log-likelihood) is introduced to reflect the statistics of the noise (e.g.
Gaussian, Poisson). On the other hand, as a prior, the images to restore are
assumed to be positive and sparsely represented in a dictionary of waveforms.
Piecing together the data fidelity and the prior terms, the solution to the
inverse problem is cast as the minimization of a non-smooth convex functional.
We establish the well-posedness of the optimization problem, characterize the
corresponding minimizers, and solve it by means of primal and primal-dual
proximal splitting algorithms originating from the field of non-smooth convex
optimization theory. Experimental results on deconvolution, inpainting and
denoising with some comparison to prior methods are also reported.
