A novel integrated optical source capable of emitting faint pulses with
different polarization states and with different intensity levels at 100 MHz
has been developed. The source relies on a single laser diode followed by four
semiconductor optical amplifiers and thin film polarizers, connected through a
fiber network. The use of a single laser ensures high level of
indistinguishability in time and spectrum of the pulses for the four different
polarizations and three different levels of intensity. The applicability of the
source is demonstrated in the lab through a free space quantum key distribution
experiment which makes use of the decoy state BB84 protocol. We achieved a
lower bound secure key rate of the order of 3.64 Mbps and a quantum bit error
ratio as low as $1.14\times 10^{-2}$ while the lower bound secure key rate
became 187 bps for an equivalent attenuation of 35 dB. To our knowledge, this
is the fastest polarization encoded QKD system which has been reported so far.
The performance, reduced size, low power consumption and the fact that the
components used can be space qualified make the source particularly suitable
for secure satellite communication.
