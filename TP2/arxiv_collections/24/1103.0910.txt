We suggest a realization of a bistable non-volatile memory capacitor
(memcapacitor). Its design utilizes a strained elastic membrane as a plate of a
parallel-plate capacitor. The applied stress generates low and high capacitance
configurations of the system. We demonstrate that a voltage pulse of an
appropriate amplitude can be used to reliably switch the memcapacitor into the
desired capacitance state. Moreover, charged-voltage and capacitance-voltage
curves of such a system demonstrate hysteresis and transition into a chaotic
regime in a certain range of ac voltage amplitudes and frequencies. Membrane
memcapacitor connected to a voltage source comprises a single element
nonautonomous chaotic circuit.
