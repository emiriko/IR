We relate completions of infinitesimal Hecke algebras of sl2 to
noncommutative deformations of Kleinian singularities of type D of
Crawley-Boevey and Holland. As a consequence, we show an analogue of the
inequality of Bernstein and simplicity of generic maximal primitive quotients
of these algebras. We also establish Skryabin type equivalence for these
algebras.
