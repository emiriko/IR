We propose a numerical technique for parameter inference in Markov models of
biological processes. Based on time-series data of a process we estimate the
kinetic rate constants by maximizing the likelihood of the data. The
computation of the likelihood relies on a dynamic abstraction of the discrete
state space of the Markov model which successfully mitigates the problem of
state space largeness. We compare two variants of our method to
state-of-the-art, recently published methods and demonstrate their usefulness
and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology.
