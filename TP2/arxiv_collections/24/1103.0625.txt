In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive
quantum dynamical semigroups, we give a description of the continuous-variable
quantum entanglement and quantum discord for a system consisting of two
noninteracting modes embedded in a thermal environment. Entanglement and
discord are used to quantify the quantum correlations of the system. For all
values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir, an initial separable
Gaussian state remains separable for all times. We study the time evolution of
logarithmic negativity, which characterizes the degree of entanglement, and
show that in the case of an entangled initial Gaussian state, entanglement
suppression (entanglement sudden death) takes place, for non-zero temperatures
of the environment. Only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial
entangled state remains entangled for finite times. We analyze the time
evolution of the Gaussian quantum discord, which is a measure of all quantum
correlations in the bipartite state, including entanglement, and show that
quantum discord decays asymptotically in time under the effect of the thermal
bath. This is contrast with the sudden death of entanglement. Before the
suppression of the entanglement, the qualitative evolution of quantum discord
is very similar to that of the entanglement. We describe also the time
evolution of the degree of classical correlations and of quantum mutual
information, which measures the total correlations of the quantum system.
