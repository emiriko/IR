We consider the Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ) theory with appropriate horizon term
which exhibits the nilpotent BRST invariance. This infinitesimal BRST
transformation has been generalized by allowing the parameter to be finite and
field dependent (FFBRST). By constructing appropriate finite field dependent
parameter we show that the generating functional of GZ theory with horizon term
is related to that of Yang-Mills (YM) theory through FFBRST transformation.
