We investigate behavior of a noncritical model in external electric field and
explore its phase structure in the quenched approximation N_f>> N_c. We compute
the conductivity of QCD plasma in this model and compare it with the
predictions of Sakai-Sugimoto model, D3-D7 system and the lattice simulation.
We find that, while the behavior of conductivity in noncritical model as a
function of temperature and baryon density is similar to those of D3-D7 system,
the phase diagram of noncritical model resembles the phase diagram of
Sakai-Sugimoto model.
