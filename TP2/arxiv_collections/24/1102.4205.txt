Our paper presents an attempt to axiomatise signal processing. Our long-term
goal is to formulate signal processing algorithms for an ideal world of exact
computation and prove properties about them, then interpret these ideal
formulations and apply them without change to real world discrete data. We give
models of the axioms that are based on Gaussian functions, that allow for exact
computations and automated tests of signal algorithm properties.
