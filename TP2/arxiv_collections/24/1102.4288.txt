An alpha-Wiener bridge is a one-parameter generalization of the usual Wiener
bridge, where the parameter alpha>0 represents a mean reversion force to zero.
We generalize the notion of alpha-Wiener bridges to continuous functions
$\alpha:[0,T)\to R$. We show that if the limit $\lim_{t\uparrow T}\alpha(t)$
exists and is positive, then a general alpha-Wiener bridge is in fact a bridge
in the sense that it converges to 0 at time T with probability one. Further,
under the condition $\lim_{t\uparrow T}\alpha(t)\ne 1$ we show that the law of
the general alpha-Wiener bridge can not coincide with the law of any non
time-homogeneous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type bridge. In case $\lim_{t\uparrow
T}\alpha(t)=1$ we determine all the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes from
which one can derive the general alpha-Wiener bridge by conditioning the
original Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process to be in zero at time T.
