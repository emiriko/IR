Young's double slit experiment is formulated in the framework of canonical
quantum field theory in view of the modern quantum optics. We adopt quantum
scalar fields instead of quantum electromagnetic fields ignoring the vector
freedom in gauge theory. The double slit state is introduced in Fock space
corresponding to experimental setup. As observables, expectation values of
energy density and positive frequency part of current with respect to the
double slit state are calculated which give the interference term. Classical
wave states are realized by coherent double slit states in Fock space which
connect quantum particle states with classical wave states systematically. In
case of incoherent sources, the interference term vanishes by averaging random
phase angles as expected.
