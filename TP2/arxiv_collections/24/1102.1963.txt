When classical information is sent over a channel with quantum-state
modulation alphabet, such as the free-space optical (FSO) channel, attaining
the ultimate (Holevo) limit to channel capacity requires the receiver to make
joint measurements over long codeword blocks. In recent work, we showed a
receiver for a pure-state channel that can attain the ultimate capacity by
applying a single-shot optical (unitary) transformation on the received
codeword state followed by simultaneous (but separable) projective measurements
on the single-modulation-symbol state spaces. In this paper, we study the
ultimate tradeoff between photon efficiency and spectral efficiency for the FSO
channel. Based on our general results for the pure-state quantum channel, we
show some of the first concrete examples of codes and laboratory-realizable
joint-detection optical receivers that can achieve fundamentally higher
(superadditive) channel capacity than receivers that physically detect each
modulation symbol one at a time, as is done by all conventional (coherent or
direct-detection) optical receivers.
