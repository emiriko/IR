The cosmic ray interaction event generator Sibyll is widely used in extensive
air shower simulations for cosmic ray and neutrino experiments. Charmed
particle production has been added to the Monte Carlo with a phenomenological,
non-perturbative model that properly accounts for charm production in the
forward direction. As prompt decays of charm can become a significant
background for neutrino detection, proper simulation of charmed particles is
very important. We compare charmed meson and baryon production to accelerator
data.
