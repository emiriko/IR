We find that a surface soliton in nonlocal nonlinear media can be regarded as
a half of a bulk soliton with an antisymmetric amplitude distribution. The
analytical solutions for the surface solitons and breathers in strongly
nonlocal media are obtained, and the critical power and breather period are
gotten analytically and confirmed by numerical simulations. In addition, the
oscillating propagation of nonlocal surface solitons launched away from the
stationary position is considered as the interaction between the soliton and
its out-of-phase image beam. Its trajectory and oscillating period obtained by
our model are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.
