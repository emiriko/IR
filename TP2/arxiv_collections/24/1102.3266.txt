An implementation is proposed of single qubit gates, e.g., phase, NOT,
\sqrt{NOT} and Hadamard, operating on polarized photons and based on light
storage. Instead of processing photons themselves, qubit transformations are
performed on atomic excitations due to photon storage in a medium of atoms in
the tripod configuration.
