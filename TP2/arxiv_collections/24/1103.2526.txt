We propose to modify the collapse axiom of quantum measurement theory by
replacing the instantaneous with a continuous collapse of the wave function in
finite time $\tau$. We apply it to coordinate measurement of a free quantum
particle that is initially confined to a domain $D\subset\rR^d$ and is observed
continuously by illuminating $\rR^d-D$. The continuous collapse axiom (CCA)
defines the post-measurement wave function (PMWF)in $D$ after a negative
measurement as the solution of Schr\"odinger's equation at time $\tau$ with
instantaneously collapsed initial condition and homogeneous Dirichlet condition
on the boundary of $D$. The CCA applies to all cases that exhibit the Zeno
effect. It rids quantum mechanics of the unphysical artifacts caused by
instantaneous collapse and introduces no new artifacts.
