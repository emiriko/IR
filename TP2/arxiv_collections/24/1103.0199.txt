If the two planets in the HAT-P-13 system are coplanar, the orbital states
provide a probe of the internal planetary structure. Previous analyses of
radial velocity and transit timing data of the system suggested that the
observational constraints on the orbital states were rather small. We reanalyze
the available data, treating the jitter as an unknown MCMC parameter, and find
that a wide range of jitter values are plausible, hence the system parameters
are less well constrained than previously suggested. For slightly increased
levels of jitter ($\sim 4.5\,m\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet
can be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the
outer planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$
respectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\eta$, of the planets
can take essentially any value $-180^{\circ}<\eta<+180^{\circ}$. It is
therefore difficult to determine whether $e_{inner}$ and $\eta$ have evolved to
a fixed-point state or a limit cycle, or to use $e_{inner}$ to probe the
internal planetary structure. We perform various transit timing variation (TTV)
analyses, demonstrating that current constraints merely restrict
$e_{outer}<0.85$, and rule out relative planetary inclinations within $\sim
2^{\circ}$ of $i_{rel}=90^{\circ}$, but that future observations could
significantly tighten the restriction on both these parameters. We demonstrate
that TTV profiles can readily distinguish the theoretically favored
inclinations of $i_{rel}=0^{\circ}\,&\,45^{\circ}$, provided that sufficiently
precise and frequent transit timing observations of HAT-P-13b can be made close
to the pericenter passage of HAT-P-13c. We note the relatively high probability
that HAT-P-13c transits and suggest observational dates and strategies.
