A luminosity spread at a given effective temperature is ubiquitously seen in
the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams of young star forming regions and often
interpreted in terms of a prolonged period (>=10 Myr) of star formation. I
review the evidence that the observed luminosity spreads are genuine and not
caused by astrophysical sources of scatter. I then address whether the
luminosity spreads necessarily imply large age spreads, by comparing HR diagram
ages with ages from independent clocks such as stellar rotation rate, the
presence of circumstellar material and lithium depletion. I argue that whilst
there probably is a true luminosity dispersion, there is little evidence to
support age spreads larger than a few Myr. This paradox could be resolved by
brief periods of rapid accretion during the class I pre main-sequence phase.
