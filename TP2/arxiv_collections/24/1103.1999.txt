The talk is composed of two parts, both set within the AdS/CFT context. In
the first part, I discuss holographic insight into strongly coupled field
theory in a black hole background. I conjecture two new gravitational
solutions, dubbed black funnels and black droplets, which describe two distinct
deconfined phases in the field theory at finite temperature. I also briefly
mention puzzles associated with an analogous set-up in a rotating black hole
background. In the second part of the talk, I discuss time-dependent states in
a CFT on flat spacetime background, exemplified by the conformal soliton flow.
Here I focus on puzzles regarding the nature of entropy in time-evolving states
and its holographic dual.
