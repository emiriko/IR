We derive cosmological constraints on the annihilation cross section of dark
matter with velocity-dependent structure, motivated by annihilating dark matter
models through Sommerfeld or Breit-Wigner enhancement mechanisms. In models
with annihilation cross section increasing with decreasing dark matter
velocity, big-bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background give
stringent constraints.
