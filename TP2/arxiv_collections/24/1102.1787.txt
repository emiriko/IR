We present calculations of asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) for
one-nucleon removals from nuclear states of mass numbers 3 to 9. Our ANCs were
computed from variational Monte Carlo solutions to the many-body Schroedinger
equation with the combined Argonne v18 two-nucleon and Urbana IX three-nucleon
potentials. Instead of computing explicit overlap integrals, we applied a
Green's function method that is insensitive to the difficulties of constructing
and Monte Carlo sampling the long-range tails of the variational wave
functions. This method also allows computation of the ANC at the physical
separation energy, even when it differs from the separation energy for the
Hamiltonian. We compare our results, which for most nuclei are the first ab
initio calculations of ANCs, with existing experimental and theoretical results
and discuss further possible applications of the technique.
