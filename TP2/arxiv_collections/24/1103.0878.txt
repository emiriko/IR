A simple method, inspired by procedures used in physics of nuclear
multifragmentation, allows to establish order of precedence and age of pairs of
haplotypes separated by one mutation. For both haplotypes of the pair, searches
for existing haplotypes, differing by increasing number of mutations, are
carried out using a database. The resulting ratios of frequences of haplotypes,
found at given mutation distances, are compared to calculated probability
ratios. The order of precedence and age of the pair of haplotypes can be
deduced when the resulting ratios follow hyperbolic dependence. Method can be
used with relatively small and not necessarily complete samples, using publicly
accessible databases.
