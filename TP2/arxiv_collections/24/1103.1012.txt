Viewing gravitational energy-momentum as equal by observation, but different
in essence from inertial energy-momentum naturally leads to the gauge theory of
volume-preserving diffeormorphisms of an inner Minkowski space which can
describe gravitation at the classical level. This theory is quantized in the
path integral formalism starting with a non-covariant Hamiltonian formulation
with unconstrained canonical field variables and a manifestly positive
Hamiltonian. The relevant path integral measure and weight are then brought
into a Lorentz- and gauge-covariant form allowing to express correlation
functions - applying the De Witt-Faddeev-Popov approach - in any meaningful
gauge. Next the Feynman rules are developed and the quantum effective action at
one loop in a background field approach is renormalized which results in an
asymptotically free theory without presence of other fields and in a theory
without asymptotic freedom including the Standard Model (SM) fields. Finally
the BRST apparatus is developed as preparation for the renormalizability proof
to all orders and a sketch of this proof is given.
