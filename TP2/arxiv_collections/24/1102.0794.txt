We present a study of light-induced forces between two coupled plasmonic
nano-particles above various slab geometries including a metallic half-space
and a 280-nm thick negative index material (NIM) slab waveguide. We investigate
optical forces by non-perturbatively calculating the scattered electric field
via a Green function technique which includes the particle interactions to all
orders. For excitation frequencies near the surface plasmon polariton and
slow-light waveguide modes of the metal and NIM, respectively, we find rich
light-induced forces and significant dynamical back-action effects. Optical
quenching is found to be important in both metal and NIM planar geometries,
which reduces the spatial range of the achievable inter-particle forces.
However, reducing the loss in the NIM allows radiation to propagate through the
slow-light modes more efficiently, thus causing the light-induced forces to be
more pronounced between the two particles. To highlight the underlying
mechanisms by which the particles couple, we connect our Green function
calculations to various familiar quantities in quantum optics.
