In 1960, Sobolev proved that for a finite reflection group G, a G-invariant
cubature formula is of degree t if and only if it is exact for all G-invariant
polynomials of degree at most t. In this paper, we find some observations on
invariant cubature formulas and Euclidean designs in connection with the
Sobolev theorem. First, we give an alternative proof of theorems by Xu (1998)
on necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of cubature formulas
with some strong symmetry. The new proof is shorter and simpler compared to the
original one by Xu, and moreover gives a general interpretation of the
analytically-written conditions of Xu's theorems. Second, we extend a theorem
by Neumaier and Seidel (1988) on Euclidean designs to invariant Euclidean
designs, and thereby classify tight Euclidean designs obtained from unions of
the orbits of the corner vectors. This result generalizes a theorem of Bajnok
(2007) which classifies tight Euclidean designs invariant under the Weyl group
of type B to other finite reflection groups.
