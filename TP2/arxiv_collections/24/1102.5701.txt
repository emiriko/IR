The Fermi LAT collaboration has recently presented constraints on the
gamma-ray signal from annihilating dark matter using separate analyses of a
number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Since the expected annihilation signal has
the same physical properties regardless of the target (except for a
normalization scale), it is possible to enhance the constraining power using a
combined analysis, the initial results of which will be presented here.
