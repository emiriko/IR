We use a combination of conventional density functional theory (DFT) and
post-DFT methods, including the local density approximation plus Hubbard $U$
(LDA+$U$), PBE0, and self-consistent $GW$ to study the electronic properties of
Ni-substituted PbTiO$_{3}$ (Ni-PTO) solid solutions. We find that LDA
calculations yield unreasonable band structures, especially for Ni-PTO solid
solutions that contain an uninterrupted NiO$_{2}$ layer. Accurate treatment of
localized states in transition-metal oxides like Ni-PTO requires post-DFT
methods. $B$-site Ni/Ti cation ordering is also investigated. The $B$-site
cation arrangement alters the bonding between Ni and O, and therefore strongly
affects the band gap ($E_{\rm g}$) of Ni-PTO. We predict that Ni-PTO solid
solutions should have a direct band gap in the visible light energy range, with
polarization similar to the parent PbTiO$_{3}$. This combination of properties
make Ni-PTO solid solutions promising candidate materials for solar energy
conversion devices.
