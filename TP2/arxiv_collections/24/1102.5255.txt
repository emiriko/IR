Singular Darboux transformations, in contrast to the conventional ones, have
a singular matrix as a coefficient before the derivative. We incorporated such
transformations into a chain of conventional transformations and presented
determinant formulas for the resulting action of the chain. A determinant
representation of the Kohlhoff-von Geramb solution to the Marchenko equation is
given.
