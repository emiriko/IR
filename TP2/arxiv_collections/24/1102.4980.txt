In this paper, we aim to introduce the group version of edge coloring and
list edge coloring, and prove that all 2-degenerate graphs along with some
planar graphs without adjacent short cycles is group
$(\Delta(G)+1)$-edge-choosable while some planar graphs with large girth and
maximum degree is group $\Delta(G)$-edge-choosable.
