A particular class of flat Emergent Universe scenario is studied in light of
recent observational data. Observationally permissible ranges of values are
obtained for the model parameters. The class of model studied here can
accommodate different composition of matter-energy as cosmic fluid. It is found
that recent observations favour some compositions over others while some
compositions can be ruled out with some level of confidence.
