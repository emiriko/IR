Precise measurements of the top quark decay properties at hadron colliders
offer interesting new possibilities of testing the standard model. At the same
time, recent intriguing experimental results concerning CP violation in the B_d
and B_s systems have stimulated many studies of physics beyond the standard
model. We investigate anomalous t W d_j interactions as a possible source of
new effects in B_{d,s} - bar B_{d,s} oscillations within a model independent
approach based on the assumptions of Minimal Flavor Violation. After matching
our effective operators onto the low-energy effective Lagrangian describing
B_{d,s} meson mixing and evolving it down to the B-mass scale, we extract the
preferred ranges of the anomalous t W d_j interactions at the weak scale. These
values are then compared to previously considered constraints coming from the
rare radiative B --> X_s gamma decay. Finally, we reconsider the associated
effects in the t --> b W decays and find that the W helicity fractions F_{L,+}
can deviate by as much as 15%, 30% from their standard model values,
respectively. The deviations in F_L in particular, can reach the level of
expected precision measurements at the LHC.
