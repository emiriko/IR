This paper analyses the cooling of a single particle in a harmonic trap with
red-detuned laser light with fewer approximations than previously done in the
literature. We avoid the adiabatic elimination of the excited atomic state but
are still interested in Lamb-Dicke parameters $\eta \ll 1$. Our results show
that the Rabi frequency of the cooling laser can be chosen higher than
previously assumed, thereby increasing the effective cooling rate but {\em not}
affecting the final outcome of the cooling process. Since laser cooling is
already a well established experimental technique, the main aim of this paper
is to present a model which can be extended to more complex scenarios, like
cavity-mediated laser cooling.
