A homogeneous polarized dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate is considered in the
presence of weak quenched disorder within mean-field theory at zero
temperature. By first solving perturbatively the underlying Gross-Pitaevskii
equation and then performing disorder ensemble averages for physical
observables, it is shown that the anisotropy of the two-particle interaction is
passed on to both the superfluid density and the sound velocity.
