Given a smooth curve of genus 2 embedded in P^(d-2) with a complete linear
system of degree d>=6, we list all types of rational normal scrolls arising
from linear systems g^1_2 and g^1_3 on C. Furthermore, we give a description of
the ideal of such a curve of genus 2 embedded in P^(d-2) as a sum of the ideal
of the two-dimensional scroll defined by the unique g^1_2 on C and the ideal of
a three-dimensional scroll arising from a g^1_3 on C and not containing the
scroll defined by the g^1_2 on C.
