A cosmological model with anisotropic dark energy is analyzed. The amount of
deviation from isotropy of the equation of state of dark energy, the skewness
\delta, generates an anisotropization of the large-scale geometry of the
Universe, quantifiable by means of the actual shear \Sigma_0. Requiring that
the level of cosmic anisotropization at the time of decoupling is such to solve
the "quadrupole problem" of cosmic microwave background radiation, we find that
|\delta| \sim 10^{-4} and |\Sigma_0| \sim 10^{-5}, compatible with existing
limits derived from the magnitude-redshift data on type Ia supernovae.
