The aim of this paper is to study further the universal toric genus of
compact homogeneous spaces and their homogeneous fibrations. We consider the
homogeneous spaces with positive Euler characteristic. It is well known that
such spaces carry many stable complex structures equivariant under the
canonical action of the maximal torus $T^k$. As the torus action in this case
has only isolated fixed points it is possible to effectively apply localization
formula for the universal toric genus. Using this we prove that the famous
topological results related to rigidity and multiplicativity of a Hirzebruch
genus can be obtained on homogeneous spaces just using representation theory.
In that context for homogeneous $SU$-spaces we prove the well known result
about rigidity of the Krichever genus. We also prove that for a large class of
stable complex homogeneous spaces any $T^k$-equivariant Hirzebruch genus given
by an odd power series vanishes. Related to the problem of multiplicativity we
provide construction of stable complex $T^k$-fibrations for which the universal
toric genus is twistedly multiplicative. We prove that it is always twistedly
multiplicative for almost complex homogeneous fibrations and describe those
fibrations for which it is multiplicative. As a consequence for such fibrations
the strong relations between rigidity and multiplicativity for an equivariant
Hirzebruch genus is established. The universal toric genus of the fibrations
for which the base does not admit any stable complex structure is also
considered. The main examples here for which we compute the universal toric
genus are the homogeneous fibrations over quaternionic projective spaces.
