We study the scaling and coordinate transformation to physically simulate
quantum three-body collinear chemical reactions of the type A+BC $\rightarrow$
AB+C by the motion of single ultracold atoms or a weakly interacting
Bose-Einstein condensate on an $L$-shaped waveguide. As an example we show that
the parameters to model the reaction F+HH $\to$ H+HF with lithium are at reach
with current technology. This mapping provides also an inverse scattering tool
to find an unknown potential, and a way to transfer the knowledge on molecular
reaction dynamics to design beam splitters for cold atoms with control of the
channel outcome and vibrational excitation.
