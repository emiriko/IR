We analyze the advantages of a linear-collider program for testing a recent
theoretical proposal where the Higgs-boson Yukawa couplings are radiatively
generated, keeping unchanged the standard-model mechanism for
electroweak-gauge-symmetry breaking. Fermion masses arise at a large energy
scale through an unknown mechanism, and the standard model at the electroweak
scale is regarded as an effective field theory. In this scenario, Higgs boson
decays into photons and electroweak gauge-boson pairs are considerably enhanced
for a light Higgs boson, which makes a signal observation at the LHC
straightforward. On the other hand, the clean environment of a linear collider
is required to directly probe the radiative fermionic sector of the Higgs boson
couplings. Also, we show that the flavor-changing Higgs-boson decays are
dramatically enhanced with respect to the standard model. In particular, we
find a measurable branching ratio in the range (10^{-4}-10^{-3}) for the decay
H\to bs for a Higgs boson lighter than 140 GeV, depending on the high-energy
scale where Yukawa couplings vanish. We present a detailed analysis of the
Higgs boson production cross sections at linear colliders for interesting decay
signatures, as well as branching-ratio correlations for different
flavor-conserving/nonconserving fermionic decays.
