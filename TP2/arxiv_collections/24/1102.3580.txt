We investigate the electronic transport properties of unbiased and biased
bilayer graphene nanoribbon in n-p and n-n junctions subject to a perpendicular
magnetic field. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function method and the
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism, the conductance is studied for the cases of
clean, on-site, and edge disordered bilayer graphene. We show that the lowest
Hall plateau remains unchanged in the presence of disorder, whereas asymmetry
destroys both the plateaus and conductance quantization. In addition, we show
that disorder induces an enhancement of the conductance in the n-p region in
the presence of magnetic fields. Finally, we show that the equilibration of
quantum Hall edge states between distinctively doped regions causes Hall
plateaus to appear in the regime of complete mode mixing.
