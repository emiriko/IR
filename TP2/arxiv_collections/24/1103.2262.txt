In this paper we consider the cohomology of a closed arithmetic hyperbolic
3-manifold with coefficients in the local system defined by the even symmetric
powers of the standard representation of SL(2,C). The cohomology is defined
over the integers and is a finite abelian group. We show that the order of the
2nd cohomology grows exponentially as the local system grows. We also consider
the twisted Ruelle zeta function of a closed arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold
and we express the leading coefficient of its Laurent expansion at the origin
in terms of the orders of the torsion subgroups of the cohomology.
