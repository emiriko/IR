With two consecutive outbursts recorded in four months (October 2008 and
January 2009), and a possible third outburst in 2007, 1E 1547.0-5408 is one of
the most active transient anomalous X-ray pulsars known so far. Thanks to
extensive X-ray observations, obtained both in the quiescent and active states,
1E 1547.0-5408 represents a very promising laboratory to get insights into the
outburst properties and magnetar emission mechanisms. We performed a detailed
timing and spectral analysis of four Chandra, three INTEGRAL, and one XMM
observations collected over a two week interval after the outburst onset in
January 2009. Several Swift pointings, covering a 1.5 year interval, were also
analyzed in order to monitor the decay of the X-ray flux. We compare the
characteristics of the two outbursts, as well as those of the active and
quiescent states. We also discuss the long-term X-ray flux history of 1E
1547.0-5408 since its first detection in 1980, and show that the source
displays three flux levels: low, intermediate and high.
