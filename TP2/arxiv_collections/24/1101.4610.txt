We present a real-time method to determine the beam propagation ratio M2 of
laser beams. The all-optical measurement of modal amplitudes yields M2
parameters conform to the ISO standard method. The experimental technique is
simple and fast, which allows to investigate laser beams under conditions
inaccessible to other methods.
