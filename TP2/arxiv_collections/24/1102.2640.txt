The neutron star low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 started a transition from
outburst to quiescence in August 2008, after more than 24 years of continuous
accretion. The return of the source to quiescence has been monitored
extensively by several X-ray observatories. Here, we report on four XMM-Newton
observations elapsing a period of more than 19 months and starting in November
2008. The X-ray spectra show a soft thermal component which we fit with a
neutron star atmosphere model. Only in the first observation do we find a
significant second component above ~ 3 keV accounting for ~ 7 % of the total
flux, which could indicate residual accretion. The thermal bolometric flux and
the temperature of the neutron star crust decrease steadily by 40 and 10 %
respectively between the first and the fourth observation. At the time of the
last observation, June 2010, we obtain a thermal bolometric luminosity of 5.6 x
10$^{33}$ (d/7.1 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of the neutron star
crust of 109 eV. The cooling curve is consistent with a relatively hot,
medium-mass neutron star, cooling by standard mechanisms. From the spectral
fits to a neutron star atmosphere model we infer limits for the mass and the
radius of the neutron star. We find that in order to achieve self-consistency
for the NS mass between the different methods, the value of the distance is
constrained to be <~6 kpc. For this value of the distance, the derived mass and
radius contours are consistent with a number of EoSs with nucleons and
hyperons.
