We are interested in the long-time asymptotic behavior of
growth-fragmentation equations with a nonlinear growth term. We present
examples for which we can prove either the convergence to a steady state or
conversely the existence of periodic solutions. Thanks the General Relative
Entropy method applied to well chosen self-similar solutions, we show that the
equation can "asymptotically" be reduced to a system of ODEs. Then stability
results are proved by using a Lyapunov functional, and existence of periodic
solutions are proved thanks to the Poincar\'e-Bendixon theorem or by Hopf
bifurcation.
