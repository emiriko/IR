The Wigner-Weisskopf-type model describing the energy transfer between two
centers mediated by a continuum of energy levels is studied. This work is
motivated by the recent interest in transport phenomena at nanoscale in biology
and quantum engineering. The analytical estimation for the energy transfer
efficiency is derived in the weak coupling regime and the conditions for the
almost perfect transfer are discussed. The embedding of the standard
tight-binding model into Wigner-Weisskopf one which includes the environmental
noise is presented.
