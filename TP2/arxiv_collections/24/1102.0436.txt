The latest results for the measurement of the CP violating phase beta_s in
B0s -> J/psi phi decays, from 5.2 fb-1 integrated luminosity of CDF data are
presented. For the first time, this measurement includes the contribution of
B0s -> J/psi K+K- or B0s -> J/psi f0 events to the signal sample, where the f0
and non-resonant K+K- are S-wave states. Additional improvements to the
analysis include more than doubling the signal sample, improved selection and
particle ID, and fully calibrated flavour tagging for the full dataset.
Additionally, the world's most precise single measurements of the B0s lifetime,
tau_s, and width difference, DeltaGamma_s are given.
