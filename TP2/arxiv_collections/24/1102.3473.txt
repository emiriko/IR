Oxygen octahedral rotations have been measured in short-period
(LaNiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrMnO$_3$)$_m$ superlattices using synchrotron diffraction.
The in-plane and out-of-plane bond angles and lengths are found to
systematically vary with superlattice composition. Rotations are suppressed in
structures with $m>n$, producing a nearly cubic form of LaNiO$_3$. Large
rotations are present in structures with $m<n$, leading to reduced bond angles
in SrMnO$_3$. The metal-oxygen-metal bond lengths decrease as rotations are
reduced, in contrast to behavior previously observed in strained, single layer
films. This result demonstrates that superlattice structures can be used to
stabilize non-equilibrium octahedral behavior in a manner distinct from
epitaxial strain, providing a novel means to engineer the electronic and
ferroic properties of oxide heterostructures.
