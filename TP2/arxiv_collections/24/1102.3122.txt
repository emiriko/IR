New precise experimental information on $\sigma_{tot}(e^+e^- \to \pi^+
\pi^-)$ is transferred into the space-like region, by taking advantage of the
analyticity. As a result a rigorous pion electromagnetic form factor behavior
is obtained. The latter with some existing model predictions is compared.
