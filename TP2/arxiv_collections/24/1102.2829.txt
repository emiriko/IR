In this paper we describe a video-camera recording of a (probable) ball
lightning event and both the related image and signal analyses for its
photometric and dynamical characterization. The results strongly support the BL
nature of the recorded luminous ball object and allow the researchers to have
an objective and unique video document of a possible BL event for further
analyses. Some general evaluations of the obtained results considering the
proposed ball lightning models conclude the paper.
