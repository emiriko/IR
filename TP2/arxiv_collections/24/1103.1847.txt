Voltages parallel and transverse to electric current in slightly
inhomogeneous superconductors can contain components proportional to the field
and temperature derivatives of the longitudinal and Hall resistivities. We show
that these anomalous contributions can be the origin of the zero field and
even-in-field transverse voltage occasionally observed at the superconductor to
normal state transition. The same mechanism can also cause an anomaly in the
odd-in-field transverse voltage interfering the Hall effect signal.
