The night sky played an important role in the social structure, oral
traditions, and cosmology of the Arrernte and Luritja Aboriginal cultures of
Central Australia. A component of this cosmology relates to meteors,
meteorites, and impact craters. This paper discusses the role of meteoritic
phenomena in Arrernte and Luritja cosmology, showing not only that these groups
incorporated this phenomenon in their cultural traditions, but that their oral
traditions regarding the relationship between meteors, meteorites and impact
structures suggests the Arrernte and Luritja understood that they are directly
related.
