We study dielectron production in proton-proton collisions at top RHIC beam
energy within an extended statistical hadronization model. The invariant mass
spectrum of correlated dielectron pairs is evaluated in the low invariant mass
region and calculated results are compared with the PHENIX experiment. The
model is found to be able to describe the data very well up to invariant masses
of 1 GeV with few adjustable parameters.
