Spinnaker is an experimental datastore that is designed to run on a large
cluster of commodity servers in a single datacenter. It features key-based
range partitioning, 3-way replication, and a transactional get-put API with the
option to choose either strong or timeline consistency on reads. This paper
describes Spinnaker's Paxos-based replication protocol. The use of Paxos
ensures that a data partition in Spinnaker will be available for reads and
writes as long a majority of its replicas are alive. Unlike traditional
master-slave replication, this is true regardless of the failure sequence that
occurs. We show that Paxos replication can be competitive with alternatives
that provide weaker consistency guarantees. Compared to an eventually
consistent datastore, we show that Spinnaker can be as fast or even faster on
reads and only 5% to 10% slower on writes.
