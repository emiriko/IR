We present an experimental and theoretical study of phase-dependent
interference effects in multi-photon excitation under bichromatic
radio-frequency (rf) field. Using an intense rf pulse, we study the
interference between the three-photon and one-photon transition between the
Zeeman sub-levels of the ground state of $^{87}$Rb that allows us to determine
the carrier-envelope phase of the fields even for long pulses.
