I review some recent results on the Higgs sector of minimal SO(10) grand
unified theories both with and without supersymmetry. It is shown that
nonsupersymmetric SO(10) with just one adjoint triggering the first stage of
the symmetry breaking does provide a successful gauge unification when
radiative corrections are taken into account in the scalar potential, while in
the supersymmetric case it is argued that the troubles in achieving a
phenomenologically viable breaking with representations up to the adjoint are
overcome by considering the flipped SO(10) embedding of the hypercharge.
