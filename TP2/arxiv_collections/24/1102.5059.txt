We propose a simplified version of the Multi-Scale Analysis of tight-binding
Anderson models with strongly mixing random potentials which leads directly to
uniform exponential bounds on decay of eigenfunctions in arbitrarily large
finite subsets of a lattice. Naturally, these bounds imply also dynamical
localization and exponential decay of eigenfunctions on the entire lattice.
