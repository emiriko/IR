As a test-bed for future investigations of directly imaged terrestrial
exoplanets, we present the recovery of the surface components of the Earth from
multi-band diurnal light curves obtained with the EPOXI spacecraft. We find
that the presence and longitudinal distribution of ocean, soil and vegetation
are reasonably well reproduced by fitting the observed color variations with a
simplified model composed of a priori known albedo spectra of ocean, soil,
vegetation, snow and clouds. The effect of atmosphere, including clouds, on
light scattered from surface components is modeled using a radiative transfer
code. The required noise levels for future observations of exoplanets are also
determined. Our model-dependent approach allows us to infer the presence of
major elements of the planet (in the case of the Earth, clouds and ocean) with
observations having S/N $\gtrsim 10$ in most cases and with high confidence if
S/N $\gtrsim 20$. In addition, S/N $\gtrsim 100$ enables us to detect the
presence of components other than ocean and clouds in a fairly
model-independent way. Degradation of our inversion procedure produced by cloud
cover is also quantified. While cloud cover significantly dilutes the magnitude
of color variations compared to the cloudless case, the pattern of color
changes remains. Therefore, the possibility of investigating surface features
through light curve fitting remains even for exoplanets with cloud cover
similar to the Earth's.
