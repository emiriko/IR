We introduce {\em vector diffusion maps} (VDM), a new mathematical framework
for organizing and analyzing massive high dimensional data sets, images and
shapes. VDM is a mathematical and algorithmic generalization of diffusion maps
and other non-linear dimensionality reduction methods, such as LLE, ISOMAP and
Laplacian eigenmaps. While existing methods are either directly or indirectly
related to the heat kernel for functions over the data, VDM is based on the
heat kernel for vector fields. VDM provides tools for organizing complex data
sets, embedding them in a low dimensional space, and interpolating and
regressing vector fields over the data. In particular, it equips the data with
a metric, which we refer to as the {\em vector diffusion distance}. In the
manifold learning setup, where the data set is distributed on (or near) a low
dimensional manifold $\MM^d$ embedded in $\RR^{p}$, we prove the relation
between VDM and the connection-Laplacian operator for vector fields over the
manifold.
