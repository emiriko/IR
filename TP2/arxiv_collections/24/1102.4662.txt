Motivated by certain questions in physics, Atiyah defined a determinant
function which to any set of $n$ distinct points $x_1,..., x_n$ in $\mathbb
R^3$ assigns a complex number $D(x_1,..., x_n)$. In a joint work, he and
Sutcliffe stated three intriguing conjectures about this determinant. They
provided compelling numerical evidence for the conjectures and an interesting
physical interpretation of the determinant. The first conjecture asserts that
the determinant never vanishes, the second states that its absolute value is at
least one, and the third says that $|D(x_1,..., x_n)|^{n-2}\geq \prod_{i=1}^n
|D(x_1,..., x_{i-1},x_{i+1},..., x_n)|$. Despite their simple formulation,
these conjectures appear to be notoriously difficult. Let $D_n$ denote the
Atiyah determinant evaluated at the vertices of a regular $n-$gon. We prove
that $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\ln D_n}{n^2}=
\frac{7\zeta(3)}{2\pi^2}-\frac{\ln 2}{2}=0.07970479...$ and establish the
second conjecture in this case. Furthermore, we prove the second conjecture for
vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the third conjecture for vertices of an
inscribed quadrilateral.
