The multi-site photometric observations of MN Dra were made over 77 nights in
August-November, 2009. The total exposure was 433 hours. During this time the
binary underwent two superoutbursts and five normal outbursts. During the
course of first superoutburst period of positive superhumps decreased with
extremely large $\dot P = -1.5 \times 1.0^{-4}$ for SU UMa-like dwarf novae,
confirming known behavior of MN Dra [1]. Between the superoutbursts MN Dra
displayed negative superhumps. Their period changed cyclically around 0.096-day
value.
