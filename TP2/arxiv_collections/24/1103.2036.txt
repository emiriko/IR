Effects of the spin-orbit interactions on the energy spectrum, Fermi surface
and spin dynamics are studied in structural- and bulk-inversion asymmetric
quasi-two-dimensional structures with a finite thickness in the presence of a
parabolic transverse confining potential. One-particle quantum mechanical
problem in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field is solved numerically
exact. Interplay of the spin-orbit interactions, orbital- and Zeeman-effects of
the in-plane magnetic field yields a multi-valley subband structure, typical
for realization of the Gunn effect. A possible Gunn-effect-mediated spin
accumulation is discussed.
