In the present contribution the construction of particle physics models in
theories with fuzzy extra dimensions is discussed. We focus on a bottom-up
approach where the structure of a higher-dimensional theory arises within
ordinary four-dimensional field theory via an appropriate mechanism based on
spontaneous symmetry breaking. Subsequently, possible ways to obtain particle
physics models with realistic spectrum in this framework are exhibited.
