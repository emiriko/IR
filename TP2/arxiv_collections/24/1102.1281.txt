The results of a macro-scale experimental study of the effect of heating on a
fluid-saturated hardened cement paste are analysed using a multi-scale
homogenization model. The analysis of the experimental results revealed that
the thermal expansion coefficient of the cement paste pore fluid is anomalously
higher than the one of pure bulk water. The micromechanics model is calibrated
using the results of drained and undrained heating tests and permits the
extrapolation of the experimentally evaluated thermal expansion and thermal
pressurization parameters to cement pastes with different water-to-cement
ratios. It permits also to calculate the pore volume thermal expansion
coefficient f a which is difficult to evaluate experimentally. The anomalous
pore fluid thermal expansion is also analysed using the micromechanics model.
