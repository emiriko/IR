The single diffractive production of the standard model Higgs boson is
computed using the diffractive factorization formalism, taking into account a
parametrization for the Pomeron structure function provided by the H1
Collaboration. We compute the cross sections at next-to-leading order accuracy
for the gluon fusion process, which includes QCD and electroweak corrections.
The gap survival probability ($<\!|S|^2\!>$) is also introduced to account for
the rescattering corrections due to spectator particles present in the
interaction, and to this end we compare two different models for the survival
factor. The diffractive ratios are predicted for proton-proton collisions at
the Tevatron and the LHC for the Higgs boson mass of $M_H$ = 120 GeV.
Therefore, our results provide updated estimations for the diffractive ratios
of the single diffractive production of the Higgs boson in the Tevatron and LHC
kinematical regimes.
