We solve the quantum version of the $A_1$ $T$-system by use of quantum
networks. The system is interpreted as a particular set of mutations of a
suitable (infinite-rank) quantum cluster algebra, and Laurent positivity
follows from our solution. As an application we re-derive the corresponding
quantum network solution to the quantum $A_1$ $Q$-system and generalize it to
the fully non-commutative case. We give the relation between the quantum
$T$-system and the quantum lattice Liouville equation, which is the quantized
$Y$-system.
