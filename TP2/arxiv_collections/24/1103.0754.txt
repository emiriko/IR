Numerical simulations are an important tool in furthering our understanding
of turbulent dynamo action, a process that occurs in a vast range of
astrophysical bodies. It is important in all computational work that
comparisons are made between different codes and, if non-trivial differences
arise, that these are explained. Kapyla et al (2010: MNRAS 402, 1458) describe
an attempt to reproduce the results of Hughes & Proctor (2009: PRL 102, 044501)
and, by employing a different methodology, they arrive at very different
conclusions concerning the mean electromotive force and the generation of
large-scale fields. Here we describe why the simulations of Kapyla et al (2010)
are simply not suitable for a meaningful comparison, since they solve different
equations, at different parameter values and with different boundary
conditions. Furthermore we describe why the interpretation of Kapyla et al
(2010) of the calculation of the alpha-effect is inappropriate and argue that
the generation of large-scale magnetic fields by turbulent convection remains a
problematic issue.
