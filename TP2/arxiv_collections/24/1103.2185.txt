Topological defects dominate the deformation response of materials in
processes ranging from quantum turbulence to crystal plasticity. We calculate
the probability distribution function for the fluctuations in velocity $v$,
using scaling arguments and a systematic cluster expansion method to account
for density correlations. We find that the distribution has power-law tails
with an exponent that takes the value -3 for $v\rightarrow \infty$, but a value
-2 for intermediate values of $v$. We relate these regimes to the theory of
avalanches, by directly computing the known avalanche scaling exponents.
