Inspired by four dimensional (de)constructions, we use the framework of
"General gauge mediation in five dimensions" to interpolate between gaugino and
ordinary gauge mediation. In particular we emphasise that an intermediate
hybrid regime of mediation may be obtained in these higher dimensional models
as has been obtained in the quiver gauge models.
