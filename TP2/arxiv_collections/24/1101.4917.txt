We generalize the derivation of Leggett-Garg inequalities to systematically
treat a larger class of experimental situations by allowing multi-particle
correlations, invasive detection, and ambiguous detector results. Furthermore,
we show how many such inequalities may be tested simultaneously with a single
setup. As a proof of principle, we violate several such two-particle
inequalities with data obtained from a polarization-entangled biphoton state
and a semi-weak polarization measurement based on Fresnel reflection. We also
point out a non- trivial connection between specific two-party Leggett-Garg
inequality violations and convex sums of strange weak values.
