Resistivity measurements performed under pressure in the paramagnetic ground
state of CeRu2Si2 are reported. They demonstrate that the relative change of
effective mass through the pseudo metamagnetic transition is invariant under
pressure. The results are compared with the first order metamagnetic transition
due to the antiferromagnetism of Ce0.9La0.1Ru2Si2 which corresponds to the
"negative" pressure of CeRu2Si2 by volume expansion. Finally, we describe the
link between the spin-depairing of quasiparticles on CeRu2Si2 and that of
Cooper pairs on the unconventional heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5.
