We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods
used to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing
photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler Mission field of view;
it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. We derived atmospheric
extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields
within the Kepler field of view. Repeatability of absolute photometry for stars
brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2%. We estimated stellar parameters
Teff, log(g), log (Z), E_{B-V} using Bayesian posterior probability
maximization to match observed colors to Castelli stellar atmosphere models. We
applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars
in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), in log (Z)$, and in height above the
galactic plane. Comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means
indicate that in most regions of the CMD, our classifications are reliable
within about +/- 200 K and +/- 0.4 dex in log (g). It is difficult to assess
the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it
is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Of great importance for the Kepler
Mission, for Teff <= 5400 K, the distinction between main-sequence stars and
giants has proved to be reliable with better than 98% confidence. The KIC is
available through the MAST data archive.
