Prospective presentation is given for the experimental program of the KLOE-2
Collaboration, to be performed using the DA$\Phi$NE $e^+e^-$ collider upgraded
in luminosity. Data with the total luminosity of 25 fb$^{-1}$ are aimed to be
collected in 3 years. Major modifications of the accelerator and the
spectrometer are described. The KLOE-2 physics program contains: CKM unitarity
and lepton universality tests, $\gamma\gamma$ physics, search for quantum
decoherence and testing CPT conservation, low-energy QCD, rare kaon decays,
physics of $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$, structure of low-mass scalars,
contribution of vacuum polarization to $(g-2)_{\mu}$, possible search for WIMP
dark matter. In this paper only selected physics subjects are reported.
