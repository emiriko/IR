In colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar using compressive
sensing (CS), a receive node compresses its received signal via a linear
transformation, referred to as measurement matrix. The samples are subsequently
forwarded to a fusion center, where an L1-optimization problem is formulated
and solved for target information. CS-based MIMO radar exploits the target
sparsity in the angle-Doppler-range space and thus achieves the high
localization performance of traditional MIMO radar but with many fewer
measurements. The measurement matrix is vital for CS recovery performance. This
paper considers the design of measurement matrices that achieve an optimality
criterion that depends on the coherence of the sensing matrix (CSM) and/or
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). The first approach minimizes a performance
penalty that is a linear combination of CSM and the inverse SIR. The second one
imposes a structure on the measurement matrix and determines the parameters
involved so that the SIR is enhanced. Depending on the transmit waveforms, the
second approach can significantly improve SIR, while maintaining CSM comparable
to that of the Gaussian random measurement matrix (GRMM). Simulations indicate
that the proposed measurement matrices can improve detection accuracy as
compared to a GRMM.
