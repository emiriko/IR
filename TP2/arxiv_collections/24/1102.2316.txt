We describe (in a representation theoretic setting) a simple comparison of
trace formulas, which implies that the conjugate of a Hilbert modular form $f$
by an automorphism of ${\Bbb C}$ again is a Hilbert modular form of the same
level and conjugate weight as $f$. This is a Theorem of Shimura for which we
obtain a new proof (cf. Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4
