A system of nearest neighbors Kuramoto-like coupled oscillators placed in a
ring is studied above the critical synchronization transition. We find a
richness of solutions when the coupling increases, which exists only within a
solvability region (SR). We also find that they posses different
characteristics, depending on the section of the boundary of the SR where the
solutions appear. We study the birth of these solutions and how they evolve
when {K} increases, and determine the diagram of solutions in phase space.
