Using the QCD sum rules we test if the charmonium-like structure Y(4274),
observed in the $J/\psi\phi$ invariant mass spectrum, can be described with a
$D_s\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)+h.c.$ molecular current with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$. We
consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension ten and we work at
leading order in $\alpha_s$. We keep terms which are linear in the strange
quark mass $m_s$. The mass obtained for such state is $m_{D_s{D}_{s0}}=(4.80\pm
0.55)$ GeV. We also consider a molecular $0^{-+}$ $D\bar{D}_{0}(2400)+h.c.$
current and we obtain $m_{D{D}_0}=(4.61\pm 0.71)$ GeV. Our study shows that the
newly observed Y(4274) in the $J/\psi\phi$ invariant mass spectra can be,
considering the uncertainties, described using a molecular charmonium current.
