In the primary visual cortex of primates and carnivores, functional
architecture can be characterized by maps of various stimulus features such as
orientation preference (OP), ocular dominance (OD), and spatial frequency. It
is a long-standing question in theoretical neuroscience whether the observed
maps should be interpreted as optima of a specific energy functional that
summarizes the design principles of cortical functional architecture. A
rigorous evaluation of this optimization hypothesis is particularly demanded by
recent evidence that the functional architecture of OP columns precisely
follows species invariant quantitative laws. Because it would be desirable to
infer the form of such an optimization principle from the biological data, the
optimization approach to explain cortical functional architecture raises the
following questions: i) What are the genuine ground states of candidate energy
functionals and how can they be calculated with precision and rigor? ii) How do
differences in candidate optimization principles impact on the predicted map
structure and conversely what can be learned about an hypothetical underlying
optimization principle from observations on map structure? iii) Is there a way
to analyze the coordinated organization of cortical maps predicted by
optimization principles in general? To answer these questions we developed a
general dynamical systems approach to the combined optimization of visual
cortical maps of OP and another scalar feature such as OD or spatial frequency
preference.
