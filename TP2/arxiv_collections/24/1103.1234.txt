We propose a novel way to break grand unified gauge symmetries via the
Hosotani mechanism in models that can accommodate chiral fermions. Adjoint
scalar fields are realized through the so-called diagonal embedding method
which is often used in the heterotic string theory. We calculate the one-loop
effective potential of the adjoint scalar field in a five dimensional model
compactified on an S^1/Z_2 orbifold, as an illustration. It turns out that the
potential is basically the same as the one in an S^1 model, and thus the
results in literatures, in addition to the chiral fermions, can be realized
easily.
