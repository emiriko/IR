We study the propagation of wave packets for nonlinear nonlocal Schrodinger
equations in the semi-classical limit. When the kernel is smooth, we construct
approximate solutions for the wave functions in subcritical, critical and
supercritical cases (in terms of the size of the initial data). The validity of
the approximation is proved up to Ehrenfest time. For homogeneous kernels, we
establish similar results in subcritical and critical cases. Nonlinear
superposition principle for two nonlinear wave packets is also considered.
