A nonlinear differentiator being fit for rapid convergence is presented,
which is based on singular perturbation technique. The differentiator design
can not only sufficiently reduce the chattering phenomenon of derivative
estimation by introducing a continuous power function, but the dynamical
performances are also improved by adding linear correction terms to the
nonlinear ones. Moreover, strong robustness ability is obtained by integrating
nonlinear items and the linear filter. The merits of the rapid-convergent
differentiator include the excellent dynamical performances, restraining noises
sufficiently, avoiding the chattering phenomenon and being not based on system
model. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulations and an
experiment.
