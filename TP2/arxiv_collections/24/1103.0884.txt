In this paper we report what happens to a pristine oxide junction
Pr0.5Ca0.5MnO3/SrTi0.95Nb.05O3 (PCMO/Nb:STO), when it is subjected to cycling
of voltage bias of moderate value ({\pm}4V). It is found that the initial
cycling leads to formation of a permanent state of lower resistance where the
lower resistance arises predominantly due to development of a shunt across the
device film (PCMO). On successive voltage cycling with increasing magnitude,
this state transforms into states of successive lower resistance that can be
transformed back to the initial stable state on cycling to below a certain
bias. A simple model based on p-n junction with shunt has been used to obtain
information on the change of the junction on voltage cycling. It has been shown
that the observation can be explained if the voltage cycling leads to lowering
of barrier at the interface and also reduction in series resistance. It is
suggested that this lowering can be related to the migration of oxygen ions and
vacancies at the junction region. Cross-sectional imaging of the junction shows
formation of permanent filamentary bridges across the thickness of the PCMO
after the pristine p-n junction is first taken through a voltage cycle, which
would explain appearance of a finite shunt across the p-n junction.
