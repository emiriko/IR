We discuss the surface spectral function of superconductors realized from a
topological insulator, such as the copper-intercalated Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$. These
functions are calculated by projecting bulk states to the surface for two
different models proposed previously for the topological insulator. Dependence
of the surface spectra on the symmetry of the bulk pairing order parameter is
discussed with particular emphasis on the odd-parity pairing. Exotic spectra
like an Andreev bound state connected to the topological surface states are
presented.
