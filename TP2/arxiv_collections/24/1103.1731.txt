We give an expression for the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent of a wide class of
n-tuples of ideals $(I_1,..., I_n)$ in $\O_n$ using the information given by a
fixed Newton filtration. In order to obtain this expression we consider a
reformulation of {\L}ojasiewicz exponents in terms of Rees mixed
multiplicities. As a consequence, we obtain a wide class of semi-weighted
homogeneous functions $(\mathbb{C}^n,0)\to (\mathbb{C},0)$ for which the
{\L}ojasiewicz of its gradient map $\nabla f$ attains the maximum possible
value.
