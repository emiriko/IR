We have studied the $Z_2$ topological number defined by the Berry phase for
the gapped frustrated systems including the orthogonal dimer model which has a
direct product state of local quantum clusters as the exact ground state. The
$Z_2$ topological number can clarify what kind of the local quantum clusters is
formed to lift the macroscopic degeneracy due to frustration, even when the
exact ground state is unknown. As a demonstration, the dimer-singlet and
plaquette-singlet phase are identified by two kinds of Z$_2$ topological
numbers in the Shastry-Sutherland model and its generalization realized
experimentally as SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and CaV$_4$O$_9$.
