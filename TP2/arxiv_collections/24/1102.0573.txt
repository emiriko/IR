We present observations of ~7 square degrees of the North American and
Pelican Nebulae region at 24, 70, and 160 microns with the Spitzer Space
Telescope Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). We incorporate the
MIPS observations with earlier Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
observations, as well as archival near-infrared (IR) and optical data. We use
the MIPS data to identify 1286 young stellar object (YSO) candidates. IRAC data
alone can identify 806 more YSO candidates, for a total of 2076 YSO candidates.
Prior to the Spitzer observations, there were only ~200 YSOs known in this
region. Three subregions within the complex are highlighted as clusters: the
Gulf of Mexico, the Pelican, and the Pelican's Hat. The Gulf of Mexico cluster
is subject to the highest extinction (Av at least ~30) and has the widest range
of infrared colors of the three clusters, including the largest excesses and by
far the most point-source detections at 70 microns. Just 3% of the cluster
members were previously identified; we have redefined this cluster as about
10-100 times larger (in projected area) than was previously realized.
