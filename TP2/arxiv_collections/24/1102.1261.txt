The evacuation of football stadium scenarios are discussed as model realizing
ordered states, described as movements of individuals according to fields of
displacements, calculated correspondingly to given scenario. The symmetry of
the evacuation space is taken into account in calculation of displacements
field - the displacements related to every point of this space are presented in
the coordinate frame in the best way adapted to given symmetry space group,
which the set of basic vectors of irreducible representation of given group is.
The speeds of individuals at every point in the presented model have the same
quantity. As the results the times of evacuation and average forces acting on
individuals during the evacuation are given. Both parameters are compared with
the same parameters got without symmetry considerations. They are calculated in
the simulation procedure. The new program (using modified Helbing model) has
been elaborated and presented in this work for realization the simulation tasks
the.
