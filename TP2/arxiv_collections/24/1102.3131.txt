We calculate the eccentricity excitation of asteroids produced by the
sweeping $\nu_6$ secular resonance during the epoch of planetesimal-driven
giant planet migration in the early history of the solar system. We derive
analytical expressions for the magnitude of the eccentricity change and its
dependence on the sweep rate and on planetary parameters; the $\nu_6$ sweeping
leads to either an increase or a decrease of eccentricity depending on an
asteroid's initial orbit. Based on the slowest rate of $\nu_6$ sweeping that
allows a remnant asteroid belt to survive, we derive a lower limit on Saturn's
migration speed of $\sim0.15\AU\My^{-1}$ during the era that the $\nu_6$
resonance swept through the inner asteroid belt (semimajor axis range
2.1--$2.8\AU$). This rate limit is for Saturn's current eccentricity, and
scales with the square of Saturn's eccentricity; the limit on Saturn's
migration rate could be lower if Saturn's eccentricity were lower during its
migration. Applied to an ensemble of fictitious asteroids, our calculations
show that a prior single-peaked distribution of asteroid eccentricities would
be transformed into a double-peaked distribution due to the sweeping of the
$\nu_6$. Examination of the orbital data of main belt asteroids reveals that
the proper eccentricities of the known bright ($H \leq10.8$) asteroids may be
consistent with a double-peaked distribution. If so, our theoretical analysis
then yields two possible solutions for the migration rate of Saturn and for the
dynamical states of the pre-migration asteroid belt: a dynamically cold state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.05$) linked with
Saturn's migration speed $\sim 4\AU\My^{-1}$, or a dynamically hot state
(single-peaked eccentricity distribution with mean of $\sim0.3$) linked with
Saturn's migration speed $\sim 0.8\AU\My^{-1}$.
