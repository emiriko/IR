We present two methods for detecting patterns and clusters in high
dimensional time-dependent functional data. Our methods are based on
wavelet-based similarity measures, since wavelets are well suited for
identifying highly discriminant local time and scale features. The
multiresolution aspect of the wavelet transform provides a time-scale
decomposition of the signals allowing to visualize and to cluster the
functional data into homogeneous groups. For each input function, through its
empirical orthogonal wavelet transform the first method uses the distribution
of energy across scales generate a handy number of features that can be
sufficient to still make the signals well distinguishable. Our new similarity
measure combined with an efficient feature selection technique in the wavelet
domain is then used within more or less classical clustering algorithms to
effectively differentiate among high dimensional populations. The second method
uses dissimilarity measures between the whole time-scale representations and
are based on wavelet-coherence tools. The clustering is then performed using a
k-centroid algorithm starting from these dissimilarities. Practical performance
of these methods that jointly designs both the feature selection in the wavelet
domain and the classification distance is demonstrated through simulations as
well as daily profiles of the French electricity power demand.
