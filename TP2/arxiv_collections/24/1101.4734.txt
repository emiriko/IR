Over the last 20 years a large number of automata-based specification
theories have been proposed for modeling of discrete,real-time and
probabilistic systems. We have observed a lot of shared algebraic structure
between these formalisms. In this short abstract, we collect results of our
work in progress on describing and systematizing the algebraic assumptions in
specification theories.
