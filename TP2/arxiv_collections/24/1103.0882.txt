A set of once subtracted dispersion relations with imposed crossing symmetry
condition for the pipi D- and F-wave amplitudes is derived and analyzed. An
example of numerical calculations in the effective two pion mass range from the
threshold to 1.1 GeV is presented. It is shown that these new dispersion
relations impose quite strong constraints on the analyzed pipi interactions and
are very useful tools to test the pipi amplitudes. One of the goals of this
work is to provide a complete set of equations required for easy use. Full
analytical expressions are presented. Along with the well known dispersion
relations successful in testing the pipi S- and P-wave amplitudes, those
presented here for the D and F waves give a complete set of tools for analyzes
of the pipi interactions.
