The economic structure of basic science is currently socialist, funded by the
public at large through taxes for the benefit of the public at large. This
socialist system should be augmented by a capitalist system, in which basic
science is also funded by private investors who reap financial benefit from the
sale of subsequent technologies based on the knowledge obtained from the
research funded by their investments. A capitalist system will provide benefits
extending from the broad target audience of this paper -- which includes
politicians, financiers, economists, and scientists in all fields -- to the
average taxpayer and consumer. Capitalist science will better align the
incentives of scientists with taxpayer interests, channel more money into basic
science, lower your taxes, and generally improve the quality of your life.
