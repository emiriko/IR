{\alpha}-SrCr2O4 has a triangular planar lattice of d3 Cr3+ made from edge
sharing CrO6 octahedra; the plane shows a very small orthorhombic distortion
from hexagonal symmetry. With a Weiss temperature of -596 K and a
three-dimensional magnetic ordering temperature of 43 K, the magnetic system is
quasi two-dimensional and frustrated. Neutron powder diffraction shows that the
ordered state is an incommensurate helical magnet, with an in-plane propagation
vector of k = (0,0.3217(8),0). Temperature dependent synchrotron powder
diffraction characterization of the structure shows an increase in the
inter-plane spacing on cooling below 100 K and an inflection in the cell
parameters at the magnetic ordering temperature. These anomalies indicate the
presence of a moderate degree of magneto-structural coupling.
