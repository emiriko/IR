Until now, gels have been formed of multicomponent soft matter systems,
consisting of a solvent and one or more macromolecular or colloidal species.
Here we show that, for sufficient quench rates, the Girifalco model of C60 can
form gels which we identify by their slow dynamics and long-lived network
structure. These gels are stable at room temperature, at least on the
simulation timescale up to 100 ns. At moderate temperatures around 1000 K,
below the bulk glass transition temperature, C60 exhibits crystallisation and
phase separation proceeds without the dynamical arrest associated with
gelation, in contrast to many colloidal systems.
