We report an experimental demonstration of thermal tuning of resonance
frequency in a planar terahertz metamaterial consisting of a gold split-ring
resonator array fabricated on a bulk single crystal strontium titanate (SrTiO3)
substrate. Cooling the metamaterial starting from 409 K down to 150 K causes
about 50% shift in resonance frequency as compare to its room temperature
resonance, and there is very little variation in resonance strength. The
resonance shift is due to the temperature-dependent refractive index (or the
dielectric constant) of the strontium titanate. The experiment opens up avenues
for designing tunable terahertz devices by exploiting the temperature sensitive
characteristic of high dielectric constant substrates and complex metal oxide
materials.
