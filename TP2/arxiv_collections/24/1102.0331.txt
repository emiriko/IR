The Minimal Prescription procedure is applied to tame the Landau pole
singularities of resummed formulae for heavy quark decays. Effects of the final
quark mass are taken into account. Explicit expressions are obtained for the
t->b and b->c transitions for both the frozen coupling approximation and in the
QCD running coupling case.
