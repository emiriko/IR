Integrated optics provides an ideal test bed for the emulation of quantum
systems via continuous-time quantum walks. Here we study the evolution of
two-photon states in an elliptic array of waveguides. We characterise the
photonic chip via coherent-light tomography and use the results to predict
distinct differences between temporally indistinguishable and distinguishable
two-photon inputs which we then compare with experimental observations. Our
work highlights the feasibility for emulation of coherent quantum phenomena in
three-dimensional waveguide structures.
