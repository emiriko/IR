Some magnetic properties of quark matter and a microscopic origin of the
strong magnetic field in compact stars are discussed; ferromagnetic order is
discussed with the Fermi liquid theory and possible appearance of spin density
wave is suggested within the NJL model. Implications of these magnetic
properties are briefly discussed for compact stars.
