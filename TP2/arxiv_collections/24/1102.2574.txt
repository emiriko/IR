In this talk, we report our recent progresses on the Lambda(1520)
photoproduction using the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the
tree-level Born diagrams, we take into account the Regge-trajectories for the
possible strange-meson exchanges in the t channel. We compute the angular and
energy dependences of the production process, including polarization
observables, such as the photon-beam asymmetry and the polarization-transfer
coefficients, resulting in good qualitative agreement with current experimental
data. We also compute the K^- angle distribution function in the
Gottfried-Jackson frame, using the polarization-transfer coefficients in the z
direction.
