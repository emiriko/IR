This was a replacement paper. Some of the conclusions from statistical graph
theory were reiterated in the sixth section, but not fully resolved therein.
(We later found statistical errors in some of the conclusions; we are still
working on this.) Most of the redundancies in the later sections were deleted,
but there were some errors related to graceful labeling that we had added. An
important number-theoretical technique in the opening section related to one of
the main techniques in the last (sixth) section, but we found a critical error:
We assumed that $$N \Prod_{r_k \in C} (1-1/r_k)=\pi(N),$$ but later found this
to be incorrect. That is, $\pi(N) \not = N^{2/3},$ as we had concluded was
asymptotically true.
