We consider the continuous version of the Vicsek model with noise, proposed
as a model for collective behavior of individuals with a fixed speed. We
rigorously derive the kinetic mean-field partial differential equation
satisfied when the number N of particles tends to infinity, quantifying the
convergence of the law of one particle to the solution of the PDE. For this we
adapt a classical coupling argument to the present case in which both the
particle system and the PDE are defined on a surface rather than on the whole
space. As part of the study we give existence and uniqueness results for both
the particle system and the PDE.
