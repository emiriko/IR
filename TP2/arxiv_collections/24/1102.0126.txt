Precise spectroscopy of multi-strange hypernuclei provides a unique chance to
explore the hyperon-hyperon interaction. In the present work we explore the
production of excited states in double hypernuclei following the
micro-canonical break-up of an initially excited double hypernucleus which is
created by the absorption and conversion of a stopped $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon. Rather
independent on the spectrum of possible excited states in the produced double
hypernuclei the formation of excited states dominates in our model. For
different initial target nuclei which absorb the $\Xi^-$, different double
hypernuclei nuclei dominate. Thus the ability to assign the various observable
$\gamma$-transitions in a unique way to a specific double hypernuclei by
exploring various light targets as proposed by the {\Panda} collaboration seems
possible. We also confront our predictions with the correlated pion spectra
measured by the E906 collaboration.
