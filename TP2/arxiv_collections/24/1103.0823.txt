A portable NMR polarimeter system has been developed to measure the
polarization of a polarized Hydrogen-Deuteride (HD) target for hadron
photoproduction experiments at SPring-8. The polarized HD target is produced at
the Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka university and is
transported to SPring-8. The HD polarization should be monitored at both
places. We have constructed the portable NMR polarimeter system by replacing
the devices in the conventional system with the software system with PCI
eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI). The weight of the NMR system is downsized
from 80 kg to 7 kg, and the cost is reduced to 25%. We check the performance of
the portable NMR polarimeter system. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the NMR
signal for the portable system is about 50% of that for the conventional NMR
system. This performance of the portable NMR system is proved to be compatible
with the conventional NMR system for the polarization measurement.
