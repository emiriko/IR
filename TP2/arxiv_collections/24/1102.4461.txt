The critical temperature is computed for N_f = 2 dynamical flavors of
nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions. The new simulations are performed
on lattices 40^3 x 14 with lattice spacing and pion mass about 0.08 fm and 200
MeV, respectively. We find the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions to
coincide within numerical precision. Our results are in broad agreement with a
second order phase transition in the chiral limit. The critical temperature at
the physical quark mass is found to be T_c = 172(3)(6) MeV.
