We investigate the structure of the [bmim][Tf2N]/silica interface by
simulating the indentation of a thin (4 nm) [bmim][Tf2N] film by a hard
nanometric tip. The ionic liquid/silica interface is represented in atomistic
detail, while the tip is modelled by a spherical mesoscopic particle
interacting via an effective short-range potential. Plots of the normal force
(Fz) on the tip as a function of its distance from the silica surface highlight
the effect of weak layering in the ionic liquid structure, as well as the
progressive loss of fluidity in approaching the silica surface. The simulation
results for Fz are in near-quantitative agreement with new AFM data measured on
the same [bmim][Tf2N]/silica interface at comparable thermodynamic conditions.
