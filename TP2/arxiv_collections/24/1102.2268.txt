This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on
Computing with Terms and Graphs (TERMGRAPH 2011). The workshop took place in
Saarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of
the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011).
Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to
practical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common
subexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of
computations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research
areas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting
by (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical
abstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term
graphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation
systems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring
together researchers working in different domains on term and graph
transformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for
presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn
about current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six
accepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were
subject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide
spectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods,
semantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.
