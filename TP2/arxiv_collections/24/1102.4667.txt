We show that the XCO factor, which converts the CO luminosity into the column
density of molecular hydrogen has similar values for dense, fully molecular gas
and for diffuse, partially molecular gas. We discuss the reasons of this
coincidence and the consequences for the understanding of the interstellar
medium.
