Electroporation is a physical method to induce the uptake of therapeutic
drugs and DNA, by eukaryotic cells and tissues. The phenomena behind
electro-mediated membrane permeabilization to plasmid DNA have been shown to be
significantly more complex than those for small molecules. Small molecules
cross the permeabilized membrane by diffusion whereas plasmid DNA first
interacts with the electropermeabilized part of the cell surface, forming
localized aggregates. The dynamics of this process is still poorly understood
because direct observations have been limited to scales of the order of
seconds. Here, cells are electropermeabilized in the presence of plasmid DNA
and monitored with a temporal resolution of 2 ms. This allows us to show that
during the first pulse application, plasmid complexes, or aggregates, start to
form at distinct sites on the cell membrane. FRAP measurements show that the
positions of these sites are remarkably immobile during the application of
further pluses. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the appearance of
distinct interaction sites, the quantitative increase in DNA and also their
immobility leading to a tentative explanation for the success of
electro-mediated gene delivery.
