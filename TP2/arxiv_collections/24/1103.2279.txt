Optical rectification of ultrashort laser pulses in LiNbO3 by
tilted-pulse-front excitation is a powerful way to generate near single-cycle
terahertz (THz) pulses. Motivated by various applications, calculations were
carried out to optimize the THz peak electric field strength. The results
predict THz output with peak electric field strength on the MV/cm level in the
0.3-1.5 THz frequency range by using optimal pump pulse duration of about 500
fs, optimal crystal length, and cryogenic temperatures for reducing THz
absorption in LiNbO3. The THz electric field strength can be increased further
to tens of MV/cm by focusing. Using optimal conditions together with the
contact grating technique THz pulses with 100 MV/cm field strength and energies
on the tens-of-mJ scale are feasible.
