This work explores the potential reach of the 7 TeV LHC to new colored states
in the context of simplified models and addresses the issue of which search
regions are necessary to cover an extensive set of event topologies and
kinematic regimes. This article demonstrates that if searches are designed to
focus on specific regions of phase space, then new physics may be missed if it
lies in unexpected corners. Simple multiregion search strategies can be
designed to cover all of kinematic possibilities. A set of benchmark models are
created that cover the qualitatively different signatures and a benchmark
multiregion search strategy is presented that covers these models.
