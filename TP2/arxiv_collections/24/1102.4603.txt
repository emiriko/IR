Hadronic interaction models at cosmic ray (CR) energies are inherently
uncertain due to the lack of a fundamental theoretical description of soft
hadronic and nuclear interactions and the large extrapolation required from
collider energies to the range of the most energetic cosmic rays observed
($>10^{20}$ eV). Model uncertainties are evaluated within the QGSJET-II model,
by varying some of the crucial parameters in the limits allowed by collider
data, and between QGSJET-II and other models commonly used in air shower
simulations. The crucial parameters relate to hard processes, string
fragmentation, diffraction and baryon production. Results on inelastic cross
sections, on secondary particle production and on the properties of air showers
measured by ground detectors from energies of $10^{12}$ to $10^{19}$ eV are
presented.
