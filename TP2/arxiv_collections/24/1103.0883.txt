In a recent paper, we combined the technique of bosonization with the concept
of a Rayleigh dissipation function to develop a model for resistances in
one-dimensional systems of interacting spinless electrons [arXiv:1011.5058]. We
also studied the conductance of a system of three wires by using a current
splitting matrix M at the junction. In this paper we extend our earlier work in
several ways. The power dissipated in a three-wire system is calculated as a
function of M and the voltages applied in the leads. By combining two junctions
of three wires, we examine a system consisting of two parallel resistances. We
study the conductance of this system as a function of the M matrices and the
two resistances; we find that the total resistance is generally quite different
from what one expects for a classical system of parallel resistances. We will
do a sum over paths to compute the conductance of this system when one of the
two resistances is taken to be infinitely large. Finally we study the
conductance of a three-wire system of interacting spin-1/2 electrons, and show
that the charge and spin conductances can generally be different from each
other.
