Given a nonconstant holomorphic map f: X -> Y between compact Riemann
surfaces, one of the first objects we learn to construct is its ramification
divisor R_f, which describes the locus at which f fails to be locally
injective. The divisor R_f is a finite formal linear combination of points of X
that is combinatorially constrained by the Hurwitz formula. Now let k be an
algebraically closed field that is complete with respect to a nontrivial
non-Archimedean absolute value. For example, k = C_p. Here the role of a
Riemann surface is played by a projective Berkovich analytic curve. As these
curves have many points that are not algebraic over k, some new (non-algebraic)
ramification behavior appears for maps between them. For example, the
ramification locus is no longer a divisor, but rather a closed analytic
subspace. This article initiates a detailed study of the ramification locus for
self-maps f: P^1 -> P^1. This simplest first case has the benefit of being
approachable by concrete (and often combinatorial) techniques.
