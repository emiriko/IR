We describe the potential of GRIPS, a future MeV mission. The Gamma-Ray
Imaging, Polarimetry and Spectroscopy ("GRIPS") concept combines a Compton and
pair telescope, and will be a very sensitive polarimeter. GRIPS would perform a
continuously scanning all-sky survey from 200 keV to 80 MeV achieving a
sensitivity which is better by a factor of 40 compared to the previous missions
in this energy range.
