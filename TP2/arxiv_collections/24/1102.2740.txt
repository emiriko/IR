A hypothesis is put forward that in the case of low-energy QCD, the
holographic prescription for calculating the correlation functions may lead to
the dual scattering amplitudes of Veneziano type at zero momentum transfer if
the non-conformality is properly taken into account. A concrete example is
proposed that demonstrates the idea.
