In this paper a tool called RDBNorma is proposed, that uses a novel approach
to represent a relational database schema and its functional dependencies in
computer memory using only one linked list and used for semi-automating the
process of relational database schema normalization up to third normal form.
This paper addresses all the issues of representing a relational schema along
with its functional dependencies using one linked list along with the
algorithms to convert a relation into second and third normal form by using
above representation. We have compared performance of RDBNorma with existing
tool called Micro using standard relational schemas collected from various
resources. It is observed that proposed tool is at least 2.89 times faster than
the Micro and requires around half of the space than Micro to represent a
relation. Comparison is done by entering all the attributes and functional
dependencies holds on a relation in the same order and implementing both the
tools in same language and on same machine.
