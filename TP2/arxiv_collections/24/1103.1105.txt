We study the gap solitons and nonlinear Bloch waves of interacting bosons in
one-dimensional optical lattices, taking into account the interaction from the
weak to the strong limits. It is shown that composition relation between the
gap solitons and nonlinear Bloch waves exists for the whole span of the
interaction strength. The linear stability analysis indicates that the gap
solitons are stable when their energies are near the bottom of the linear Bloch
band gap. By increasing the interaction strength, the stable gap solitons can
turn into unstable. It is argued that the stable gap solitons can easily be
formed in a weakly interacting system with energies near the bottoms of the
lower-level linear Bloch band gaps.
