We analyze the procedure of lifting in classical stochastic and quantum
systems. It enables one to `lift' a state of a system into a state of
`system+reservoir'. This procedure is important both in quantum information
theory and the theory of open systems. We illustrate the general theory of
liftings by a particular class related to so called circulant states.
