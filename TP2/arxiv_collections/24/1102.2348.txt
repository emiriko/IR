Based on explicit solution of current continuity equation in the graphene
FET's channel the semi-classical diffusion-drift description of the carrier
transport and I-V characteristics model has been developed. Role of
rechargeable defects (interface traps) near or at the interface between
graphene and insulated layers has also described.
