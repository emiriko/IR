This paper describes the realization of a new Linux distribution based on
Ubuntu Linux and Xenomai Real-Time framework. This realization is motivated by
the eminent need of real-time systems in modern computer science courses. The
majority of the technical choices are made after qualitative comparison. The
main goal of this distribution is to offer standard Operating Systems (OS) that
include Xenomai infrastructure and the essential tools to begin hard real-time
application development inside a convivial desktop environment. The released
live/installable DVD can be adopted to emulate several classic RTOS Application
Program Interfaces (APIs), directly use and understand real-time Linux in
convivial desktop environment and prototyping real-time embedded applications.
