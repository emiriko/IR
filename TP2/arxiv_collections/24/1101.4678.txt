Results of measurements of free falling acceleration of a closed container
with a rotor of a mechanical gyroscope placed inside it on the frequency of the
rotor rotation are briefly described. Time of separate accelerations
measurements is 40 ms, the period of sampling is from 0.5 up to 1.0 minute. In
rotation's frequencies range of 20-400 Hz, the negative changes of free falling
container acceleration prevail. On individual frequencies the "resonant" maxima
and minima of acceleration are observed. The obtained data apparently
contradict the equivalence principle of inertial and gravitating masses. The
expediency of development of ballistic gravimetry of high time resolution with
use of rotating or oscillating test bodies is noted.
