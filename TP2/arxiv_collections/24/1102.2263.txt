We introduce an extension to Merton's famous continuous time model of optimal
consumption and investment, in the spirit of previous works by Pliska and Ye,
to allow for a wage earner to have a random lifetime and to use a portion of
the income to purchase life insurance in order to provide for his estate, while
investing his savings in a financial market comprised of one risk-free security
and an arbitrary number of risky securities driven by multi-dimensional
Brownian motion. We then provide a detailed analysis of the optimal
consumption, investment, and insurance purchase strategies for the wage earner
whose goal is to maximize the expected utility obtained from his family
consumption, from the size of the estate in the event of premature death, and
from the size of the estate at the time of retirement. We use dynamic
programming methods to obtain explicit solutions for the case of discounted
constant relative risk aversion utility functions and describe new analytical
results which are presented together with the corresponding economic
interpretations.
