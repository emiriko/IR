A kinetically stabilized axially symmetric tandem mirror (KSTM) uses the
momentum flux of low-energy, unconfined particles that sample only the outer
end-regions of the mirror plugs, where large favorable field-line curvature
exists. The window of operation is determined for achieving MHD stability with
tolerable energy drain from the kinetic stabilizer. Then MHD stable systems are
analyzed for stability of the trapped particle mode. This mode is characterized
by the detachment of the central-cell plasma from the kinetic stabilizer region
without inducing field-line bending. Stability of the trapped particle mode is
sensitive to the electron connection between the stabilizer and the end plug.
It is found that the stability condition for the trapped particle mode is more
constraining than the stability condition for the MHD mode, and it is
challenging to satisfy the required power constraint. Furthermore a severe
power drain may arise from the necessary connection of low-energy electrons in
the kinetic stabilizer to the central region.
