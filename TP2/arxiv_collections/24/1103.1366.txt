The search for new interactions of neutrinos beyond those of the Standard
Model may help to elucidate the mechanism responsible for neutrino masses. Here
we combine existing accelerator neutrino data with restrictions coming from a
recent atmospheric neutrino data analysis in order to lift parameter
degeneracies and improve limits on new interactions of muon neutrinos with
quarks. In particular we re-consider the results of the NuTeV experiment in
view of a new evaluation of its systematic uncertainties. We find that,
although constraints for muon neutrinos are better than those applicable to tau
or electron neutrinos, they lie at the few $\times 10^{-2}$ level, not as
strong as previously believed. We briefly discuss prospects for further
improvement.
