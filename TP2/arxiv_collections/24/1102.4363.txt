We discuss two striking Large Hadron Collider (LHC) signatures of the
constrained version of the exceptional supersymmetric standard model (cE6SSM),
based on a universal high energy soft scalar mass m_0, soft trilinear coupling
A_0 and soft gaugino mass M_{1/2}. The first signature we discuss is that of
light exotic colour triplet charge 1/3 fermions, which we refer to as
D-fermions. We calculate the LHC production cross section of D-fermions, and
discuss their decay patterns. Secondly we discuss the E6 type U(1)_N spin-1 Z'
gauge boson and show how it may decay into exotic states, increasing its width
and modifying the line shape of the dilepton final state. We illustrate these
features using two representative cE6SSM benchmark points, including an "early
LHC discovery" point, giving the Feynman rules and numerical values for the
relevant couplings in order to facilitate further studies.
