Based on the definition of coherent states for continuous spectra and
analogous to photon added coherent states for discrete spectra, we introduce
the excited coherent states for continuous spectra. It is shown that, the main
axioms of Gazeau-Klauder coherent states will be satisfied, properly.
Nonclassical properties and quantum statistics of coherent states, as well as
the introduced excited coherent states are discussed. In particular, through
the study of quadrature squeezing and amplitude squared squeezing, it will be
observed that both classes of the above states can be classified in the
intelligent states category.
