We analyze two-photon double ionization of helium in both the nonsequential
and sequential regime. We show that the energy spacing between the two emitted
electrons provides the key parameter that controls both the energy and the
angular distribution and reveals the universal features present in both the
nonsequential and sequential regime. This universality, i.e., independence of
photon energy, is a manifestation of the continuity across the threshold for
sequential double ionization. For all photon energies, the energy distribution
can be described by a universal shape function that contains only the spectral
and temporal information entering second-order time-dependent perturbation
theory. Angular correlations and distributions are found to be more sensitive
to the photon energy. In particular, shake-up interferences have a large effect
on the angular distribution. Energy spectra, angular distributions
parameterized by the anisotropy parameters, and total cross sections presented
in this paper are obtained by fully correlated time-dependent ab initio
calculations.
