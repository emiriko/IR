The Landau paradigm of classifying phases by broken symmetries was
demonstrated to be incomplete when it was realized that different quantum Hall
states could only be distinguished by more subtle, topological properties.
Today, the role of topology as an underlying description of order has branched
out to include topological band insulators, and certain featureless gapped Mott
insulators with a topological degeneracy in the groundstate wavefunction.
Despite intense focus, very few candidates for these topologically ordered
"spin liquids" exist. The main difficulty in finding systems that harbour spin
liquid states is the very fact that they violate the Landau paradigm, making
conventional order parameters non-existent. Here, we uncover a spin liquid
phase in a Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, and measure its
topological order directly via the topological entanglement entropy. This is
the first smoking-gun demonstration of a non-trivial spin liquid, identified
through its entanglement entropy as a gapped groundstate with emergent Z2 gauge
symmetry.
