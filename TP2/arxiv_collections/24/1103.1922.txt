Individual quantum objects display inseparable coexisting wave-like
properties and particle-like properties; such inseparable coexistence can seem
paradoxical and mind-boggling. The apparent paradox is resolved by the unified
theory of wave-particle duality developed in this paper. Based on the unified
theory of wave-particle duality, a straightforward derivation of the
Schr\"odinger equations is presented where previously no such derivation was
considered to be possible. A new theory of quantum diffraction is subsequently
developed.
