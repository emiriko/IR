We present a new cataloge of EROs from the Groth strip and study the relation
between their morphology and mass. We find 102 EROs (F814W-K=>4, K<=21.0), over
a survey area of 155 arcmin^2. The photometric data include U,B,F606W,F814W,J,K
bands. Morphologies are based on a by eye classification and we distinguish
between 3 basic classes: compact objects, targets with a disc and/or a bulge
component and irregular or merger candidates. The majority of our targets has
either a very compact morphology (33+-6%), or show more or less distinct disc
components (41+-6%). 14+-4% are merger or irregulars and 7 objects could not be
classified. We also study the dependence of structural parameters on
morphological appearance. EROs that are either compact or show a distinct bulge
component have smaller median effective radii (1.22+-0.14 kpc and 3.31+-0.53
kpc) than disc dominated (5.50+-0.51 kpc) or possible irregular galaxies or
merger candidates (4.92+-0.14 kpc). The Sersic index changes from 2.30+-0.34
and 3.24+-0.55, to 1.03+-0.24 and 1.54+-0.40 respectively.
  Most the EROs in our sample have redshifts between z=1 and z=2; however,
compact EROs in our sample are found at redshifts as low as z=0.4 and as high
as z=2.8; the latter qualify as well as DRGs. Disc-like EROs are also found up
to z=2.8; however those with a bulge-disc structure are only seen at z<1.5. For
each of these EROs we determined the stellar mass and mean population age by
fitting synthetic Bruzual (2007) spectra to the SED. Mass estimates were
obtained by assuming an exponentially declining star formation rate. Total
stellar masses are in the range 9.1<log(M/M_sun)<11.6. We cannot detect
significant differences between the stellar mass distribution of the
morphological classes. EROs with masses of log(M/M_sun)>11.0 dominantly show
compact morphologies, but also include a significant number of sources with a
disc morphology.
