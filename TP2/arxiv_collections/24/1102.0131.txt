We explore the photonic (bright) side of dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB) by
measuring the radiation emitted by a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction
embedded in a microwave resonator. In this regime Cooper pair tunneling is
inelastic and associated to the transfer of an energy 2eV into the resonator
modes. We have measured simultaneously the Cooper pair current and the photon
emission rate at the resonance frequency of the resonator. Our results show two
regimes, in which each tunneling Cooper pair emits either one or two photons
into the resonator. The spectral properties of the emitted radiation are
accounted for by an extension to DCB theory.
