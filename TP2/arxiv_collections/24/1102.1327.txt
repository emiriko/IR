In this review, we discuss the impact of the development of lasers on
ultracold atoms and molecules and their applications. After a brief historical
review of laser cooling and Bose-Einstein condensation, we present important
applications of ultra cold atoms, including time and frequency metrology, atom
interferometry and inertial sensors, atom lasers, simulation of condensed
matter systems, production and study of strongly correlated systems, and
production of ultracold molecules.
