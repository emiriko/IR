The purpose of this paper is to give a characterization for polynomials and
rational functions which admit only non-negative values on definable sets in
real closed valued fields. That is, generalizing the relative
positivstellens\"atze for sets defined also by valuation terms. For this, we
use model theoretic tools, together with existence of canonical valuations.
