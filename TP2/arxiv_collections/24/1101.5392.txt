Theories of flavor violation beyond the Standard Model typically suppose that
the new contributions must be small, for example suppressed by Yukawa
couplings, as in Minimal Flavor Violation. We show that this need not be true,
presenting a case for flavor violation which maximally mixes the first and
third generation flavors. As an example, we realize this scenario via new
right-handed gauge bosons, which couple predominantly to the combinations
(u,b)_R and (t,d)_R. We show that this new flavor violation could be
responsible for several anomalies, focusing in particular on the B_d and B_s
systems, and the Tevatron top forward-backward asymmetry.
