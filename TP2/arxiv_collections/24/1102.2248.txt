Precise centroid estimation plays a critical role in accurate astrometry
using telescope images. Conventional centroid estimation fits a template point
spread function (PSF) to the image data. Because the PSF is typically not known
to high accuracy due to wavefront aberrations and uncertainties in optical
system, a simple Gaussian function is commonly used. PSF knowledge error leads
to systematic errors in the conventional centroid estimation. In this paper, we
present an accurate centroid estimation algorithm by reconstructing the PSF
from well sampled (above Nyquist frequency) pixelated images. In the limit of
an ideal focal plane array whose pixels have identical response function (no
inter-pixel variation), this method can estimate centroid displacement between
two 32$\times$32 images to sub-micropixel accuracy. Inter-pixel response
variations exist in real detectors, {\it e.g.}~CCDs, which we can calibrate by
measuring the pixel response of each pixel in Fourier space. The Fourier
transforms of the inter-pixel variations of pixel response functions can be
conveniently expressed in terms of powers of spatial wave numbers using their
Taylor series expansions. Calibrating up to the third order terms in this
expansion, we show that our centroid displacement estimation is accurate to a
few micro-pixels using simulated data. This algorithm is applicable to the new
proposed mission concept Nearest Earth Astrometry Telescope (NEAT) to achieve
mirco-arcsecond accuracy in relative astrometry for detecting terrestrial
exoplanets. This technology is also applicable to high precision photometry
missions.
