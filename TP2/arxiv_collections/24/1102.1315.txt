Driving the analogy between the coherent excitation of a two-state quantum
system and the torque equation of motion, we present exact analytic solutions
to different models for manipulation of polarization in birefringent medium.
These models include the one-dimensional model, the Landau-Zener model, and the
Demkov-Kunike model. We also give an example for robust, broadband manipulation
of polarization by suitably tailoring the birefringence vector.
