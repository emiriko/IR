In classical estimation theory, the central limit theorem implies that the
statistical error in a measurement outcome can be reduced by an amount
proportional to n^(-1/2) by repeating the measures n times and then averaging.
Using quantum effects, such as entanglement, it is often possible to do better,
decreasing the error by an amount proportional to 1/n. Quantum metrology is the
study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely
classical approaches. In this review, we analyze some of the most promising
recent developments in this research field. Specifically, we deal with the
developments of the theory and point out some of the new experiments. Then we
look at one of the main new trends of the field, the analysis of how the theory
must take into account the presence of noise and experimental imperfections.
