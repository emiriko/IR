The detection of X-ray emission from Ap stars can be an indicator for the
presence of magnetic activity and dynamo action, provided different origins for
the emission, such as wind shocks and close late-type companions, can be
excluded. Here we report on results for gamma Equu, the only roAp star for
which an X-ray detection is reported in ROSAT catalogs. We use high resolution
imaging in X-rays with Chandra and in the near-infrared with NACO/VLT that
allow us to spatially resolve companions down to ~1" and ~0.06" separations,
respectively. The bulk of the X-ray emission is associated with a companion of
gamma Equu identified in our NACO image. Assuming coevality with the primary
roAp star (~900 Myr), the available photometry for the companion points at a
K-type star with ~0.6 M_sun. Its X-ray properties are in agreement with the
predictions for its age and mass. An excess of photons with respect to the
expected background and contribution from the nearby companion is observed near
the optical position of gamma Equu. We estimate an X-ray luminosity of log L_x
[erg/s] = 26.6 and log(L_x/L_bol) = -7.9 for this emission. A small offset
between the optical and the X-ray image leaves some doubt on its association
with the roAp star. The faint X-ray emission that we tentatively ascribe to the
roAp star is difficult to explain as a solar-like stellar corona due to its
very low L_x/L_bol level and the very long rotation period of gamma Equu. It
could be produced in magnetically confined wind shocks implying a mass loss
rate of ~10^(-14) M_sun/yr or from an additional unknown late-type companion at
separation ~0.4". If confirmed by future deeper X-ray observations this
emission could point at the origin for the presence of radioactive elements on
some roAp stars.
