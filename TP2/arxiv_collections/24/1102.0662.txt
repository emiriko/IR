For stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a superlinearly growing and
globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficient, the classical
explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly to the exact solution.
Recently, an explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the tamed
Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen & Kloeden, Ann. Appl.
Probab., 22 (2012), pp. 1611-1641.] for such SDEs. Motivated by their work, we
here introduce a tamed version of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative
noise. The proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable, but
achieves higher strong convergence order than the tamed Euler method does. In
recovering the strong convergence order one of the new method, new difficulties
arise and kind of a bootstrap argument is developed to overcome them. Finally,
an illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency of the tamed
Milstein method compared to the tamed Euler method.
