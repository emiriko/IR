To study the reflecting diffusion processes on manifolds with boundary, some
new curvature operators are introduced by using the Bakry-Emery curvature and
the second fundamental form. As applications, the gradient estimates,
log-Harnack inequality and Poincar\'e/log-Sobolev inequalities are investigated
for the Neumann semigroup on manifolds with boundary.
