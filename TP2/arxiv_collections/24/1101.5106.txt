A significant signal of neutrinoless double beta decay can be consistent with
the existence of light quasi-Dirac neutrinos. To demonstrate this possibility,
we consider a realistic model where the neutrino masses and the neutrinoless
double beta decay can be simultaneously generated after a Peccei-Quinn symmetry
breaking.
