We present a combined experimental and computational methodology for the
discovery of new materials. Density functional theory (DFT) formation energy
calculations allow us to predict the stability of various hypothetical
structures. We demonstrate this approach by computationally predicting the
Ce-Ir-In ternary phase diagram. We predict previously-unknown compounds
CeIr$_4$In and Ce$_2$Ir$_2$In to be stable. Subsequently, we successfully
synthesize CeIr$_4$In and characterize it by X-ray diffraction. Magnetization
and heat capacity measurements of CeIr$_4$In are reported. The correct
prediction and discovery of CeIr$_4$In validates this approach for discovering
new materials.
