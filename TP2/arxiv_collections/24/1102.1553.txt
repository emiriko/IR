Our series of articles is devoted to high-precision molecular dynamics
simulation of mixed actinide-oxide (MOX) fuel in the rigid ions approximation
using high-performance graphics processors (GPU). In this article we assess the
10 most relevant interatomic sets of pair potential (SPP) by reproduction of
the Bredig superionic phase transition (anion sublattice premelting) in uranium
dioxide. The measurements carried out in a wide temperature range from 300K up
to melting point with 1K accuracy allowed reliable detection of this phase
transition with each SPP. The {\lambda}-peaks obtained are smoother and wider
than it was assumed previously. In addition, for the first time a pressure
dependence of the {\lambda}-peak characteristics was measured, in a range from
-5 GPa to 5 GPa its amplitudes had parabolic plot and temperatures had linear
(that is similar to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for melting temperature).
