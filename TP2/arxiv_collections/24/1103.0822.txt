We present sub-second, continuous-coverage photometry of three flares on the
dM3.5e star, EQ Peg A, using custom continuum filters with WHT/ULTRACAM. These
data provide a new view of flare continuum emission, with each flare exhibiting
a very distinct light curve morphology. The spectral shape of flare emission
for the two large-amplitude flares is compared with synthetic ULTRACAM
measurements taken from the spectra during the large 'megaflare' event on a
similar type flare star. The white light shape during the impulsive phase of
the EQ Peg flares is consistent with the range of colors derived from the
megaflare continuum, which is known to contain a Hydrogen recombination
component and compact, blackbody-like components. Tentative evidence in the
ULTRACAM photometry is found for an anti-correlation between the emission of
these components.
