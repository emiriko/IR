A model for a Choquet integral for arbitrary finite set systems is presented.
The model includes in particular the classical model on the system of all
subsets of a finite set. The general model associates canonical non-negative
and positively homogeneous superadditive functionals with generalized belief
functions relative to an ordered system, which are then extended to arbitrary
valuations on the set system. It is shown that the general Choquet integral can
be computed by a simple Monge-type algorithm for so-called intersection
systems, which include as a special case weakly union-closed families.
Generalizing Lov\'asz' classical characterization, we give a characterization
of the superadditivity of the Choquet integral relative to a capacity on a
union-closed system in terms of an appropriate model of supermodularity of such
capacities.
