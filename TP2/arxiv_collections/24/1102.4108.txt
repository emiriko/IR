We characterize the marked bordered unpunctured oriented surfaces with the
property that all the Jacobian algebras of the quivers with potentials arising
from their triangulations are derived equivalent. These are either surfaces of
genus g with b boundary components and one marked point on each component, or
the disc with 4 or 5 points on its boundary.
  We show that for each such marked surface, all the quivers in the mutation
class have the same number of arrows, and the corresponding Jacobian algebras
constitute a complete derived equivalence class of finite-dimensional algebras
whose members are connected by sequences of Brenner-Butler tilts. In addition,
we provide explicit quivers for each of these classes.
  We consider also 10 of the 11 exceptional finite mutation classes of quivers
not arising from triangulations of marked surfaces excluding the one of the
quiver X_7, and show that all the finite-dimensional Jacobian algebras in such
class (for suitable choice of potentials) are derived equivalent only for the
classes of the quivers E_6^(1,1) and X_6.
