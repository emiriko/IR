We have analyzed $^{3}$He scattering from $^{12}$C at 34.7 and 72 MeV in a
coupled channel method with a double folding potential derived from the precise
wave functions for the ground 0$^+$ state and $0_2^+$ (7.65 MeV)
  Hoyle state, which has been suggested to be an $\alpha$ particle condensate.
It is found that strong refraction of $^3$He in the Hoyle state can be clearly
seen in the experimental angular distribution at {\it low} incident energy
region as an Airy minimum of the {\it pre-rainbow oscillations}.
