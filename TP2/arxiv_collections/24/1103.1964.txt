Dirac's idea of taking the square root of constraints is applied to the case
of extended objects concentrating on membranes in D=4 space-time dimensions.
The resulting equation is Lorentz invariant and predicts an infinite hierarchy
of positive and negative masses (tension). There are no tachyonic solutions.
