Because of their small electromagnetic corrections, the isospin-breaking
decays $\eta\to3\pi$ seem to be good candidates for extracting isospin-breaking
parameters $ (m_d-m_u)$. This task is unfortunately complicated by large chiral
corrections and the discrepancy between the experimentally measured values of
the Dalitz parameters describing the energy dependence of the amplitudes of
these decays and those predicted from chiral perturbation theory. We present
two methods based on an analytic dispersive representation that use the
information from the NNLO chiral result and the one from the measurement of the
charged $\eta\to3\pi$ decay by KLOE together in a harmonized way in order to
determine the value of the quark mass ratio $R$. Our final result is $R=37.7\pm
2.2$. This value supplemented by values of $m_s/\hat{m}$ or even $\hat{m}$ and
$m_s$ from other methods (as sum-rules or lattice) enables us to obtain further
quark mass characteristics. For instance the recent lattice value for
$m_s/\hat{m}~27.5$ leads to $Q= 23.1\pm0.7$. We also quote the corresponding
values of the current masses $m_u$ and $m_d$.
