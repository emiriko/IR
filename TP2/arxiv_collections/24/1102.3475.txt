We present photometry and spectropolarimetry of the pre-main sequence star HD
106506. A photometric rotational period of ~1.416 +/- 0.133 days has been
derived using observations at Mount Kent Observatory (MKO). Spectropolarimetric
data taken at the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) were used to derive
spot occupancy and magnetic maps of the star through the technique of Zeeman
Doppler imaging (ZDI). The resulting brightness maps indicate that HD 106506
displays photospheric spots at all latitudes including a predominant polar
spot. Azimuthal and radial magnetic images of this star have been derived, and
a significant azimuthal magnetic field is indicated, in line with other active
young stars. A solar-like differential rotation law was incorporated into the
imaging process. Using Stokes I information the equatorial rotation rate,
$\Omega_{eq}$, was found to be 4.54 +/- 0.01 rad/d, with a photospheric shear
$\delta\Omega$ of $0.21_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ rad/d. This equates to an equatorial
rotation period of ~1.39 +/- 0.01 days, with the equatorial region lapping the
poles every ~$30_{-3}^{+5}$ days. Using the magnetic features, the equatorial
rotation rate, $\Omega_{eq}$, was found to be 4.51 +/- 0.01 rad/d, with a
photospheric shear $\delta\Omega$ of 0.24 +/- 0.03 rad/d. This differential
rotation is approximately 4 times that observed on the Sun.
