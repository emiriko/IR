The purpose of this paper is to establish the theory of stochastic
pseudo-differential operators and give its applications in stochastic partial
differential equations. First, we introduce some concepts on stochastic
pseudo-differential operators and prove their fundamental properties. Also, we
present the boundedness theory, invertibility of stochastic elliptic operators
and the Garding inequality. Moreover, as an application of the theory of
stochastic pseudo-differential operators, we give a Calderon-type uniqueness
theorem on the Cauchy problem of stochastic partial differential equations. The
proof of the uniqueness theorem is based on a new Carleman-type estimate, which
is adapted to the stochastic setting.
