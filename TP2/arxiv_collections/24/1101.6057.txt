Recently, it was realized that quantum discord can be seen as the minimal
amount of correlations which are lost when some local quantum operations are
performed. Based on this formulation of quantum discord, we provide a
systematical analysis of quantum and classical correlations present in both
bipartite and multipartite quantum systems. As a natural result of this
analysis, we introduce a new measure of the overall quantum correlations which
is lower bounded by quantum discord.
