In 2003, A. Bjorner and M. de Longueville proved that the neighborhood
complex of the stable Kneser graph SG_{n,k} is homotopy equivalent to a
k-sphere. Further, for n=2 they showed that the neighborhood complex
deformation retracts to a subcomplex isomorphic to the associahedron. They went
on to ask whether or not, for all n and k, the neighborhood complex of SG_{n,k}
contains as a deformation retract the boundary complex of a simplicial
polytope.
  Our purpose is to give a positive answer to this question in the case k=2. We
also find in this case that, after partially subdividing the neighborhood
complex, the resulting complex deformation retracts onto a subcomplex arising
as a polyhedral boundary sphere that is invariant under the action induced by
the automorphism group of SG_{n,2}.
