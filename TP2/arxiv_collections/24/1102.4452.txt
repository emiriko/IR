The distribution of waiting times between elementary tunneling events is of
fundamental importance for understanding the stochastic charge transfer
processes in nanoscale conductors. Here we investigate the waiting time
distributions (WTDs) of periodically driven single-electron emitters and
evaluate them for the specific example of a mesoscopic capacitor. We show that
the WTDs provide a particularly informative characterization of periodically
driven devices and we demonstrate how the WTDs allow us to reconstruct the full
counting statistics (FCS) of charges that have been transferred after a large
number of periods. We find that the WTDs are capable of describing short-time
physics and correlations which are not accessible via the FCS alone.
