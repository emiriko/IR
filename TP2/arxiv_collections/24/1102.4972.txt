Distance function to a compact set plays a central role in several areas of
computational geometry. Methods that rely on it are robust to the perturbations
of the data by the Hausdorff noise, but fail in the presence of outliers. The
recently introduced distance to a measure offers a solution by extending the
distance function framework to reasoning about the geometry of probability
measures, while maintaining theoretical guarantees about the quality of the
inferred information. A combinatorial explosion hinders working with distance
to a measure as an ordinary (power) distance function. In this paper, we
analyze an approximation scheme that keeps the representation linear in the
size of the input, while maintaining the guarantees on the inference quality
close to those for the exact (but costly) representation.
