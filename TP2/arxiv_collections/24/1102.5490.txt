We propose a possible microscopic explanation of the exhaustion of \rho_s of
helium-II on the wall at T>T_{c} = 0.5 - 1 K and predict a possibility of the
existence in He-II of the "dry" friction at T < T_{c}. Both of the effects
connect with that the energy of the 2D-rotons is 2K less then the energy of
3D-rotons, so the wall is a potential well for the last ones.
