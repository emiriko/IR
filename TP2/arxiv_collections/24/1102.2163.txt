This paper considers competitive Lotka-Volterra population dynamics with
jumps. The contributions of this paper are as follows. (a) We show stochastic
differential equation (SDE) with jumps associated with the model has a unique
global positive solution; (b) We discuss the uniform boundedness of $p$th
moment with $p>0$ and reveal the sample Lyapunov exponents; (c) Using a
variation-of-constants formula for a class of SDEs with jumps, we provide
explicit solution for 1-dimensional competitive Lotka-Volterra population
dynamics with jumps, and investigate the sample Lyapunov exponent for each
component and the extinction of our $n$-dimensional model.
