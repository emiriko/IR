The notion of Kolmogorov complexity (=the minimal length of a program that
generates some object) is often useful as a kind of language that allows us to
reformulate some notions and therefore provide new intuition. In this survey we
provide (with minimal comments) many different examples where notions and
statements that involve Kolmogorov complexity are compared with their
counterparts not involving complexity.
