A brief introduction to the Python computing environment is given. By solving
the master equation encountered in quantum transport, we give an example of how
to solve the ODE problems in Python. The ODE solvers used are the ZVODE routine
in Scipy and the bsimp solver in GSL. For the former, the equation can be in
its complex-valued form, while for the latter, it has to be rewritten to a
real-valued form. The focus is on the detailed workflow of the implementation
process, rather than on the syntax of the python language, with the hope to
help readers simulate their own models in Python.
