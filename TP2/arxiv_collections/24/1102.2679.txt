We use multi-parton states to examine the leading order collinear
factorization of single transverse-spin asymmetries in Drell-Yan processes.
Twist-3 operators are involved in the factorization. We find that the so-called
soft-gluon-pole contribution in the factorization must exist in order to make
the factorization correct. This contribution comes from the corresponding
cross-section at one-loop, while the hard-pole contribution in the
factorization comes from the cross-section at tree-level. Although the two
contributions come from results at different orders, their perturbative
coefficient functions in the factorization are at the same order. This is in
contrast to factorizations only involving twist-2 operators. The
soft-gluon-pole contribution found in this work is in agreement with that
derived in a different way. For the hard-pole contributions we find an extra
contribution from an extra parton process contributing to the asymmetries. We
also solve a part of discrepancy in evolutions of the twist-3 operator. The
method presented here for analyzing the factorization can be generalized to
other processes and can be easily used for studying factorizations at higher
orders, because the involved calculations are of standard scattering
amplitudes.
