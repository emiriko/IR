Numerical studies of gamma-ray burst afterglow jets reveal significant
qualitative differences with simplified analytical models. We present an
on-line library of synthetic afterglow light curves and broadband spectra for
use in interpreting observational data. Light curves have been calculated for
various physics settings such as explosion energy and circumburst structure, as
well as differing jet parameters and observer angle and redshift. Calculations
gave been done for observer frequencies ranging from low radio to X-ray and for
observer times from hours to decades after the burst. The light curves have
been calculated from high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical simulations performed
with the RAM adaptive-mesh refinement code and a detailed synchrotron radiation
code.
  The library will contain both generic afterglow simulations as well as
specific case studies and will be freely accessible at
http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary . The synthetic light curves can be used
as a check on the accuracy of physical parameters derived from analytical model
fits to afterglow data, to quantitatively explore the consequences of varying
parameters such as observer angle and for accurate predictions of future
telescope data.
