Bulk metallic glass (BMG) materials are hot topics in recent years, not to
mention BMG matrix composites, which further improve the magnetic and
mechanical properties of BMG materials. BMG and BMG matrix materials are fast
developing and promising materials in modern industry due to their
extraordinary properties such as high strength, low density, excellent
resistibility to high temperature and corrosion. In this paper, I reviewed
processing and application of several recently developed BMG and BMG matrix
materials.
