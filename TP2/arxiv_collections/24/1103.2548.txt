We studied the O-bearing molecule HCOOCH3 to characterize the physical
conditions of the different molecular source components in Orion-KL. We
identify 28 methyl formate emission peaks throughout the 50" field of
observations. The two strongest peaks are in the Compact Ridge (MF1) and in the
SouthWest of the Hot Core (MF2). Spectral confusion is still prevailing as half
of the expected transitions are blended over the region. Assuming that the
transitions are thermalized, we derive the temperature at the five main
emission peaks. At the MF1 position we find a temperature of 80K in a 1.8"x0.8"
beam size and 120K on a larger scale (3.6" x2.2"), suggesting an external
source of heating, whereas the temperature is about 130K at the MF2 position on
both scales. Transitions of HCOOCH3 in vt=1 are detected as well and the good
agreement of the positions on the rotational diagrams between the vt=0 and the
vt=1 transitions suggests a similar temperature. The velocity of the gas is
between 7.5 and 8.0km/s depending on the positions and column density peaks
vary from 1.6x10^16 to 1.6x10^17cm^-2. A second velocity component is observed
around 9-10 km/s in a North-South structure stretching from the Compact Ridge
up to the BN object; this component is warmer at the MF1 peak. The two other
C2H4O2 isomers are not detected and the derived upper limit for the column
density is <3x10^14cm^-2 for glycolaldehyde and <2x10^15cm^-2 for acetic acid.
From the 223GHz continuum map, we identify several dust clumps with associated
gas masses in the range 0.8 to 5.8Msun. Assuming that the HCOOCH3 is spatially
distributed as the dust, we find relative abundances of HCOOCH3 in the range
<0.1x10^-8 to 5.2x10^-8. We suggest a relation between the methyl formate
distribution and shocks as traced by 2.12 mum H2 emission.
