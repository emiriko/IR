This is a short introduction to the subject of strategic games. We focus on
the concepts of best response, Nash equilibrium, strict and weak dominance, and
mixed strategies, and study the relation between these concepts in the context
of the iterated elimination of strategies. Also, we discuss some variants of
the original definition of a strategic game. Finally, we introduce the basics
of mechanism design and use pre-Bayesian games to explain it.
