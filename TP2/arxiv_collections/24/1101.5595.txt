We present a program for the numerical evaluation of scalar integrals and
tensor form factors entering the calculation of one-loop amplitudes which
supports the use of complex masses in the loop integrals. The program is built
on an earlier version of the golem95 library, which performs the reduction to a
certain set of basis integrals using a formalism where inverse Gram
determinants can be avoided. It can be used to calculate one-loop amplitudes
with arbitrary masses in an algebraic approach as well as in the context of a
unitarity-inspired numerical reconstruction of the integrand.
