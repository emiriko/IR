A class of exact solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell field equations are
obtained by assuming the erstwhile cosmological constant $ \Lambda $ to be a
space-variable scalar, viz., $ \Lambda =\Lambda(r) $. The source considered
here is static, spherically symmetric and anisotropic charged fluid. The
solutions obtained are matched continuously to the exterior
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution and each of the four solutions represents an
electromagnetic mass model.
