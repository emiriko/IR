The object of this work is to give the key to answer whether or not there is
another numerical method which is different from the equation proposed by
Planck to predict blackbody radiation by frequency. Firstly, Maxwell
distribution function for molecule velocities was modified, resulting in a
distribution function with three parameters for deriving monochromatic
intensity of blackbody radiation through frequency. Then this simulation
function was applied to estimate the energy density (Jm-2) of blackbody
radiation by frequency at 5500 K, 5000 K, 4500 K, 4000 K, 3500 K and 2.73 K of
temperature. The results of density simulated by means of distribution function
suggested in this paper agree well with the experimental data. All of the
correlation coefficients between actual and calculated data are 1.0; at the
same time, the mean relative errors are less than 6.65% in total.
