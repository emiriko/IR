We argue the possibility of realization of a polarization insensitive
all-optical switching in a planar metamaterial composed of a 4-fold periodic
array of two concentric metal rings placed on a substrate of nonlinear
material. It is demonstrated that a switching may be achieved between
essentially different values of transmission near the resonant frequency of the
high-quality-factor Fano-shape trapped-mode excitation.
