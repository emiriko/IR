The reduction of the energy consumptions of a Telecommunication Power System
represents one of the critical factors of the telecommunication technologies,
both to allow a sizeable saving of economic resources and to realize
"sustainable" development actions. The consumption of about one hundred base
stations for mobile phones were monitored for a total of over one thousand
days, in order to study the energy consumption in relation to the
environmental, electric and logistics parameters of the stations themselves. It
was possible to survey, then, the role of the mobile communication systems in
the general national energy framework and to plot the best areas of
intervention for saving energy and improving the environmental impact, showing
the role played by air conditioning and transmission equipments. Finally, new
transmission algorithms and the use of renewable energy based techniques have
been tested.
