The short review of theoretical aspects of ultra high energy (UHE) neutrinos.
The accelerator sources, such as Supernovae remnants, Gamma Ray Bursts, AGN etc
are discussed. The top-down sources include Topological Defects (TDs),
Superheavy Dark Matter (SHDM) and Mirror Matter. The diffuse fluxes are
considered accordingly as that of cosmogenic and top-down neutrinos. Much
attention is given to the cascade upper limit to the diffuse neutrino fluxes in
the light of Fermi-LAT data on diffuse high energy gamma radiation. This is
most general and rigorous upper limit, valid for both cosmogenic and top-down
models. At present upper limits from many detectors are close to the cascade
upper limit, and 5 yr IceCube upper limit will be well below it.
