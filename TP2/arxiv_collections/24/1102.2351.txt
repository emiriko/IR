To systematically stress a rotationally symmetric 3D magnetic null point by
advecting the opposite footpoints of the spine axis in opposite directions.
This stress eventually concentrates in the vicinity of the null point forming a
local current sheet through which magnetic reconnection takes place. The aim is
to look for a steady state evolution of the current sheet dynamics which may
provide scaling relations for various characteristic parameters of the system.
The evolution is followed by solving numerically the non-ideal MHD equations in
a Cartesian domain. The null point is embedded in an initially constant density
and temperature plasma. It is shown that a quasi-steady reconnection process
can be set up at a 3D null by continuous shear driving. It appears that a true
steady state in unlikely to be realised as the current layer tends to grow
until restricted by the geometry of the computational domain and imposed
driving profile. However, ratios between characteristic quantities clearly
settle after some time to stable values -- so that the evolution is
quasi-steady. The experiments show a number of scaling relations, but they do
not provide a clear consensus for extending to lower magnetic resistivity or
faster driving velocities. More investigations are needed to fully clarify the
properties of current sheets at magnetic null points.
