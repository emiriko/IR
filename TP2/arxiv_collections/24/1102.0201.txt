The angular power spectrum and polarization of the cosmic microwave
background radiation (CMB), the relative abundances of primordial hydrogen,
deuterium and helium isotopes, and the large-scale structure of the universe
all indicate that 4.5% of the current mass density of the universe consists of
baryons. However, only a small fraction of these baryons can be accounted for
in stars and gas inside galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters, and in
spectral-line absorbing gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Too hot to show
up in Lyman-absorption, too cool to cause detectable spectral distortions of
the cosmic microwave background radiation, and too diffused to emit detectable
X-rays, about 90% of the cosmic baryons remain missing in the local universe
(redshift z~0). Here, we report on prevalent, isotropic, source independent,
and fairly uniform soft X-ray absorption along the lines of sight to high-z
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and quasars. It has the magnitude, redshift and energy
dependence that are expected from a hot IGM that contains the missing
cosmological baryons and has a mean metallicity similar to that in the
intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters.
