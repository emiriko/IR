Proton Compton scattering is analyzed with the chiral Lagrangian.
Partial-wave amplitudes are obtained by an analytic extrapolation of
subthreshold reaction amplitudes computed in chiral perturbation theory, where
the constraints set by electromagnetic-gauge invariance, causality and
unitarity are used to stabilize the extrapolation. We present and discuss
predictions for various spin observables and polarizabilties of the proton.
While for the transition polarizabilities $\gamma_{E1M2}, \gamma_{M1E2}$ we
recover the results of strict chiral perturbation theory, for the diagonal
$\gamma_{E1E1}, \gamma_{M1M1}$ elements we find significant effects from
rescattering.
