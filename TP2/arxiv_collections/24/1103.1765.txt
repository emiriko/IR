We use the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC and Very Large Telescope FORS
cameras to observe the Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Abell 2597 and Abell 2204
in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) F150LP and optical U, B, V, R, I Bessel filters.
The FUV and U band emission is enhanced in bright, filamentary structures
surrounding the BCG nuclei. These filaments can be traced out to 20 kpc from
the nuclei in the FUV. Excess FUV and U band light is determined by removing
emission due to the underlying old stellar population and mapped with 1 arcsec
spatial resolution over the central 20 kpc regions of both galaxies. We find
the FUV and U excess emission to be spatially coincident and a stellar
interpretation requires the existence of a significant amount of 10000-50000 K
stars. Correcting for nebular continuum emission and dust intrinsic to the BCG
further increases the FUV to U band emission ratio and implies that stars alone
may not suffice to explain the observations. However, lack of detailed
information on the gas and dust distribution and extinction law in these
systems prevents us from ruling out a purely stellar origin. Non-stellar
processes, such as the central AGN, Scattering, Synchrotron and Bremsstrahlung
emission are investigated and found to not be able to explain the FUV and U
band measurements in A2597. Contributions from non-thermal processes not
treated here should be investigated. Comparing the FUV emission to the optical
H-alpha line emitting nebula shows good agreement on kpc-scales in both A2597
and A2204. In concordance with an earlier investigation by O'Dea et al. (2004)
we find that O-stars can account for the ionising photons necessary to explain
the observed H-alpha line emission.
