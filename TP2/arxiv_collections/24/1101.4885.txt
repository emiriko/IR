We report on the implementation of a quantum analog to the classical lock-in
amplifier. All the lock-in operations: modulation, detection and mixing, are
performed via the application of non-commuting quantum operators on the
electronic spin state of a single trapped Sr+ ion. We significantly increase
its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three
orders of magnitude, to more than one second. With this technique we measure
magnetic fields with sensitivity of 25 pT/sqrt(Hz) and light shifts with an
uncertainty below 140 mHz after 1320 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities
are limited by quantum projection noise and, to our knowledge, are more than
two orders of magnitude better than with other single-spin probe technologies.
In fact, our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity
non-conservation, as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single
electronic-spin one micrometer from an ion-detector with nanometer resolution.
As a first application we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical
quadruple transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique
is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor.
