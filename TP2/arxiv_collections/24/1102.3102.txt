In this paper we analyze how Transformation Optics recipes can be applied to
control the flow of surface plasmons on metal-dielectric interfaces. We study
in detail five different examples: a cylindrical cloak, a beam shifter, a
right-angle bend, a lens and a ground-plane cloak. First, we demonstrate that
only the modification of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in
the dielectric side can lead to almost perfect functionalities for surface
plasmons. We also show that, thanks to the quasi two-dimensional character of
surface plasmons and its inherent polarization, the application of conformal
and quasiconformal mapping techniques allows the design of plasmonic devices in
which only the isotropic refractive index of the dielectric film needs to be
engineered.
