This paper shows how to run some experiments of physics, using a virtual
laboratory. Such a laboratory is a website, equipped with objects to be
measured and measuring instruments, simulated by means of Java Applets. Here we
discuss in particular the case of a laboratory in which we can perform, on the
Web, some experiments on radioactivity. The proposed virtual environment can be
a viable alternative in the case of unavailability of a real laboratory.
