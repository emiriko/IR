We derive and justify a normal form reduction of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation for a general pitchfork bifurcation of the symmetric bound state that
occurs in a double-well symmetric potential. We prove persistence of normal
form dynamics for both supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations in
the time-dependent solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation over long
but finite time intervals.
