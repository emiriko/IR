Yang-Mills gravity with translational gauge group T(4) in flat space-time
implies a simple self-coupling of gravitons and a truly conserved
energy-momentum tensor. Its consistency with experiments crucially depends on
an interesting property that an `effective Riemannian metric tensor' emerges in
and only in the geometric-optics limit of the photon and particle wave
equations. We obtain Feynman rules for a coupled graviton-fermion system,
including a general graviton propagator with two gauge parameters and the
interaction of ghost particles. The equation of motion of macroscopic objects,
as an N-body system, is demonstrated as the geometric-optics limit of the
fermion wave equation. We discuss a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation with
an `effective Riemann metric tensor' for the classical particles.
