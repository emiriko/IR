We give a self-consistent theory of the scale dependent effective mass
enhancement m*/m of quasiparticles by 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin
fluctuations in the presence of disorder at an AFM quantum critical point. The
coupling of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in the critical regime is
described in terms of a critical quasiparticle theory. Using the fact that even
in the "non-Fermi liquid" regime the quasiparticle width does not exceed the
quasiparticle energy, we adopt relations from Fermi liquid theory to determine
the dependence of the spin fluctuation spectrum on m*/m, from which the self
energy and hence m*/m may be calculated. The self-consistent equation for m*/m
has a strong coupling solution provided the initial value is sufficiently
large. We argue that in YbRh2Si2, quasi-2D Gaussian fluctuations existing over
a wide range drive the system into the 3D strongly coupled fluctuation regime.
We find critical exponents of the temperature dependence of the specific heat
coefficient \gamma\propto T^{-1/4} and of the resistivity \rho(T)=\rho(0)+ A
T^{3/4} in good agreement with experiments on YbRh2Si2 in the temperature range
T < 0.3K.
