The effects of K and Co substitutions and quasi-hydrostatic applied pressure
(P<9 GPa) in the local atomic structure of BaFe2As2, Ba(Fe{0.937}Co{0.063})2As2
and Ba{0.85}K{0.15}Fe2As2 superconductors were investigated by extended x-ray
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements in the As K absorption edge. The
As-Fe bond length is found to be slightly reduced (<~ 0.01 Angstroms) by both
Co and K substitutions, without any observable increment in the corresponding
Debye Waller factor. Also, this bond is shown to be compressible (k =
3.3(3)x10^{-3} GPa^{-1}). The observed contractions of As-Fe bond under
pressure and chemical substitutions are likely related with a reduction of the
local Fe magnetic moments, and should be an important tuning parameter in the
phase diagrams of the Fe-based superconductors.
