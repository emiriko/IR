Devising a scheme for evaluating the service quality of an institutional
electronic library is a difficult and challenging task. The challenge comes
from the fact that the services provided by an institutional electronic library
depend upon the contents requested by the users and the contents housed by the
library. Different types of users might be interested in different types of
contents. In this paper, we propose a technique for evaluating the service
quality of an institutional electronic library. Our scheme is based on the
service profiles of contents requested by the users at the server side which is
hosted at the library. Further, we propose models to analyze the service
quality of an electronic library. For analyzing the service quality, we present
two analytical models. The first one is based on the number of days by which
the item to be served by the library is delayed and the penalty points per day
for the duration for which the item is delayed. The second model is based on
the credits earned by the library if the item is served in a timely fashion,
and the penalties, thereof, if the item is delayed. These models may help in
evaluating the service quality of an electronic library and taking the
corrective measures to improve it.
