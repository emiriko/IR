Feature-based approaches have recently become very popular in computer vision
and image analysis applications, and are becoming a promising direction in
shape retrieval. SHREC'11 robust feature detection and description benchmark
simulates the feature detection and description stages of feature-based shape
retrieval algorithms. The benchmark tests the performance of shape feature
detectors and descriptors under a wide variety of transformations. The
benchmark allows evaluating how algorithms cope with certain classes of
transformations and strength of the transformations that can be dealt with. The
present paper is a report of the SHREC'11 robust feature detection and
description benchmark results.
