We apply our recently developed resonance perturbation theory to describe the
dynamics of magnetization in paramagnetic spin systems interacting
simultaneously with local and collective bosonic environments. We derive
explicit expressions for the evolution of the reduced density matrix elements.
This allows us to calculate explicitly the dynamics of the macroscopic
magnetization, including characteristic relaxation and dephasing time-scales.
We demonstrate that collective effects (i) do not influence the character of
the relaxation processes but merely renormalize the relaxation times, and (ii)
significantly modify the dephasing times, leading in some cases to a
complicated (time inhomogeneous) dynamics of the transverse magnetization,
governed by an effective time-dependent magnetic field.
