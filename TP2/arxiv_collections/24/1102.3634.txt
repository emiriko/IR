In this paper we will study the existence and uniqueness of the solution for
the stochastic variational inequality with oblique subgradients of the
following form:{l} dX_{t}+H(X_{t}) \partial \phi (X_{t}) (dt) \ni f(t,X_{t})
dt+g(t,X_{t}) dB_{t},\quad t>0,\smallskip \ X_{0}=x\in \bar{\emph{Dom}(\phi)}.%
This problem is the generalization of the stochastic differential equation with
oblique reflection considered by Lions and Sznitman in `84. The existence
result is based on a deterministic approach; first, we prove the existence and
uniqueness of the solution of a differential system with singular input.
