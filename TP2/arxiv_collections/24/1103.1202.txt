With a purpose of constructing a robust evolution system against numerical
instability for integrating the Einstein equations, we propose a new
formulation by adjusting the ADM evolution equations with constraints. We apply
an adjusting method proposed by Fiske (2004) which uses the norm of the
constraints, C2. One of the advantages of this method is that the effective
signature of adjusted terms (Lagrange multipliers) for constraint-damping
evolution is pre-determined. We demonstrate this fact by showing the
eigenvalues of constraint propagation equations. We also perform numerical
tests of this adjusted evolution system using polarized Gowdy-wave propagation,
which show robust evolutions against the violation of the constraints than that
of the standard ADM formulation.
