We analyze the phenomenon of collusion for the purpose of boosting the
pagerank of a node in an interlinked environment. We investigate the optimal
attack pattern for a group of nodes (attackers) attempting to improve the
ranking of a specific node (the victim). We consider attacks where the
attackers can only manipulate their own outgoing links. We show that the
optimal attacks in this scenario are uncoordinated, i.e. the attackers link
directly to the victim and no one else. nodes do not link to each other. We
also discuss optimal attack patterns for a group that wants to hide itself by
not pointing directly to the victim. In these disguised attacks, the attackers
link to nodes $l$ hops away from the victim. We show that an optimal disguised
attack exists and how it can be computed. The optimal disguised attack also
allows us to find optimal link farm configurations. A link farm can be
considered a special case of our approach: the target page of the link farm is
the victim and the other nodes in the link farm are the attackers for the
purpose of improving the rank of the victim. The target page can however
control its own outgoing links for the purpose of improving its own rank, which
can be modeled as an optimal disguised attack of 1-hop on itself. Our results
are unique in the literature as we show optimality not only in the pagerank
score, but also in the rank based on the pagerank score. We further validate
our results with experiments on a variety of random graph models.
