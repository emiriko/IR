Recent Lattice QCD results relevant for Kaon, Charm and B Physics are
summarized. There is general agreement among calculations using a wide range of
different lattice actions. This bolsters confidence in the lattice results and
in their quoted errors. One notes considerable progress since CKM2008 in
reducing lattice errors with some quantities now being calculated at the
subpercent to a few percent level accuracy. Much work remains, however, and
further improvements can be expected in the coming years.
