This article presents a theoretical model for a dynamic system based on
sustainable development. Due to the relatively absence of theoretical studies
and practical issues in the area of sustainable development, Romania aspires to
the principles of sustainable development. Based on the concept as a process in
which economic, social, political and natural environment are combined in order
to sustain planet management, our goal is to promote an economic tool for
Romanian decision-makers in order to evaluate scenarios and planning options.
