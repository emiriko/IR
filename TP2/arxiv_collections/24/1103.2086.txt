We derive a simple rule to determine surface plasmon energies, based on the
geometrical properties of the surface of the metal. We apply this concept to
obtain the surface plasmon energies in wedges, corners and conical tips. The
results presented here provide simple and straightforward rules to design the
energy of surface plasmons in severals situations of experimental interest such
as in plasmon wave guiding and in tip-enhanced spectroscopies.
