We have determined the ground-state energies of para-H$_2$ clusters at zero
temperature using the diffusion Monte Carlo method. The liquid or solid
character of each cluster is investigated by restricting the phase through the
use of proper importance sampling. Our results show inhomogeneous
crystallization of clusters, with alternating behavior between liquid and solid
phases up to N=55. From there on, all clusters are solid. The ground-state
energies in the range N=13--75 are established and the stable phase of each
cluster is determined. In spite of the small differences observed between the
energy of liquid and solid clusters, the corresponding density profiles are
significantly different, feature that can help to solve ambiguities in the
determination of the specific phase of H$_2$ clusters.
