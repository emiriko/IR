Recent studies into the properties of quantum statistical ensembles in
high-dimensional Hilbert spaces have encountered difficulties associated with
the Monte-Carlo sampling of quantum superpositions constrained by the energy
expectation value. A straightforward Monte-Carlo routine would enclose the
energy constrained manifold within a larger manifold, which is easy to sample,
for example, a hypercube. The efficiency of such a sampling routine decreases
exponentially with the increase of the dimension of the Hilbert space, because
the volume of the enclosing manifold becomes exponentially larger than the
volume of the manifold of interest. The present paper explores the ways to
optimise the above routine by varying the shapes of the manifolds enclosing the
energy-constrained manifold. The resulting improvement in the sampling
efficiency is about a factor of five for a 14-dimensional Hilbert space. The
advantage of the above algorithm is that it does not compromise on the rigorous
statistical nature of the sampling outcome and hence can be used to test other
more sophisticated Monte-Carlo routines. The present attempts to optimise the
enclosing manifolds also bring insights into the geometrical properties of the
energy constrained manifold itself.
