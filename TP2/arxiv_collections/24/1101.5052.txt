The large data sample recorded with the Belle detector at the {\Upsilon}(5S)
energy provides a unique opportunity to study the poorly-known Bs meson.
Several analyses, made with a data sample representing an integrated luminosity
of 23.6 /fb, are presented. We report the study of the large-signal Bs {\to}
Ds- h+ (h+ = {\pi}+, {\rho}+) decays. In addition, several results on Bs decays
related to CP-violation studies are described. Beside the non-flavor specific
Bs {\to} Ds K decay, the following CP-eigenstate decays are studied: Bs {\to}
J/{\psi} {\eta}('), Bs {\to} J/{\psi} f0(980), the charmless Bs {\to} hh (h =
{\pi}+, K+, KS0) and the three Bs {\to} Ds(*) Ds(*) modes from which
{\Delta}{\Gamma}s(CP)/{\Gamma}s is extracted.
