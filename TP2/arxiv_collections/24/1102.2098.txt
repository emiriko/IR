The Renyi entropy is a generalization of the usual concept of entropy which
depends on a parameter q. In fact, Renyi entropy is closely related to free
energy. Suppose we start with a system in thermal equilibrium and then suddenly
divide the temperature by q. Then the maximum amount of work the system can do
as it moves to equilibrium at the new temperature, divided by the change in
temperature, equals the system's Renyi entropy in its original state. This
result applies to both classical and quantum systems. Mathematically, we can
express this result as follows: the Renyi entropy of a system in thermal
equilibrium is minus the "1/q-derivative" of its free energy with respect to
temperature. This shows that Renyi entropy is a q-deformation of the usual
concept of entropy.
