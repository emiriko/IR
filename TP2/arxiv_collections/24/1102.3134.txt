We investigate stopping and baryon transport in central relativistic Pb + Pb
and Au + Au collisions. At energies reached at the CERN Super Proton
Synchrotron [sqrt(s_NN) = 6.3-17.3 GeV] and at RHIC (62.4 GeV), we determine
the fragmentation-peak positions from the data. The resulting linear growth of
the peak positions with beam rapidity is in agreement with our results from a
QCD-based approach that accounts for gluon saturation. No discontinuities in
the net-proton fragmentation peak positions occur in the expected transition
region from partons to hadrons at 6-10 GeV.
