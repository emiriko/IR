In this note we give, for a spectrally negative Levy process, a compact
formula for the Parisian ruin probability, which is defined by the probability
that the process exhibits an excursion below zero, with a length that exceeds a
certain fixed period r. The formula involves only the scale function of the
spectrally negative Levy process and the distribution of the process at time r.
