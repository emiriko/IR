To constrain the recipes put forth to solve the theoretical Fe discrepancy in
the hot interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies and at the same time explain
the [alpha/Fe] ratios. In order to do so we use the latest theoretical
nucleosynthetic yields, we incorporate the dust, we explore differing SNIa
progenitor scenarios by means of a self-consistent chemical evolution model
which reproduces the properties of the stellar populations in elliptical
galaxies. Models with Fe-only dust and/or a lower effective SNIa rate achieve a
better agreement with the observed Fe abundance. However, a suitable
modification to the SNIa yield with respect to the standard W7 model is needed
to fully match the abundance ratio pattern. The 2D explosion model C-DDT by
Maeda et al. (2010) is a promising candidate for reproducing the [Fe/H] and the
[alpha/Fe] ratios. (A&A format)
