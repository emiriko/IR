On the twisted Fermat cubic, an elliptic divisibility sequence arises as the
sequence of denominators of the multiples of a single rational point. It is
shown that there are finitely many perfect powers in such a sequence whose
first term is greater than 1. Moreover, if the first term is divisible by 6 and
the generating point is triple another rational point then there are no perfect
powers in the sequence except possibly an lth power for some l dividing the
order of 2 in the first term.
