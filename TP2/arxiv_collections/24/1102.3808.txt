Despite not being specifically designed for the study of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), the INTEGRAL satellite is giving a relevant contribution to this field
with the detection of about 10 GRB per year in the IBIS field of view. The
ground-based INTEGRAL Burst Alert System (IBAS) has provided real-time
localizations with 2-3 arcmin accuracy for most of these events. The INTEGRAL
sample now comprises 81 bursts, including 4 of the short class. IBAS has also
revealed other transient events from various classes of Galactic sources, most
notably short bursts and flares from magnetar candidates. Here I present a
summary of the IBAS performances in the eight years since the INTEGRAL launch
and review some of the INTEGRAL results for GRBs and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters.
