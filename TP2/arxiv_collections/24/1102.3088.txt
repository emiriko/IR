If supersymmetry is relevant at the Fermi scale, the lack of any direct
signal so far may require going beyond the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model. In this talk I briefly summarize a simple and concrete extension of the
MSSM that takes these issues, including a way to address the flavour and the CP
problems. In its fully natural range of parameters, the expected signals for
LHC, dark matter and flavour physics are clear and generally quite different
from the ones of the MSSM. Gauge coupling unification may be only approximate.
