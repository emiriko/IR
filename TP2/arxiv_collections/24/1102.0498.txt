An oversight of some previous density functional calculations of the band
gaps of wurtzite and cubic InN and of wurtzite GaN by Rinke et al. [Appl. Phys.
Lett. 89,161919, 2006] led to an inaccurate and misleading statement relative
to limitations of density functional theory (DFT) for the description of
electronic properties of these materials. These comments address this
statement. In particular, they show that some local density approximation (LDA)
calculations have correctly described or predicted electronic and related
properties of these systems [Phys. Rev. B 60, 1563, 1999; J. Appl. Phys. 96,
4297, 2004, and 97, 123708, 2005]. These successful calculations solved
self-consistently the system of equations defining LDA, i.e., the Kohn-Sham
equation and the equation giving the ground state charge density in terms of
the wave functions of the occupied states.
