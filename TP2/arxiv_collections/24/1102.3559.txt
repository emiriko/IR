The Betti numbers of a graded module over the polynomial ring form a table of
numerical invariants that refines the Hilbert polynomial. A sequence of papers
sparked by conjectures of Boij and S\"oderberg have led to the characterization
of the possible Betti tables up to rational multiples---that is, to the
rational cone generated by the Betti tables. We will summarize this work by
describing the cone and the closely related cone of cohomology tables of vector
bundles on projective space, and we will give new, simpler proofs of some of
the main results. We also explain some of the applications of the theory,
including the one that originally motivated the conjectures of Boij and
S\"oderberg, a proof of the Multiplicity Conjecture of Herzog, Huneke and
Srinivasan.
