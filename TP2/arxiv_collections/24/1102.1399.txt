We theoretically investigate the response of a two component Fermi gas to
vector potentials which couple separately to the two spin components. Such
vector potentials may be implemented in ultracold atomic gases using optically
dressed states. Our study indicates that light-induced gauge potentials may be
used to probe the properies of the interacting ultracold Fermi gas, providing.
amongst other things, ways to measure the superfluid density and the strength
of pairing.
