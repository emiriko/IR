We present a study of $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ lepton pair production in Pb+Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV. The larger $\tau^{\pm}$ mass ($\sim$
1.77 GeV) compared to $e^{\pm}$ and $\mu^{\pm}$ leads to considerably small
hadronic contribution to the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ pair invariant mass ($M$)
distribution relative to the production from thermal partonic sources. The
quark-anti-quark annihilation processes via intermediary virtual photon, Z and
Higgs bosons have been considered for the production of $ \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$. We
observe that the contribution from Drell-Yan process dominates over thermal
yield for $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ pair mass from 4 to 20 GeV at the LHC energy. We
also present the ratio of $\tau$ lepton pair yields for nucleus-nucleus
collisions relative to yields from p+p collisions scaled by number of binary
collisions at LHC energies as a function $\tau$ pair mass. The ratio is found
to be significantly above unity for the mass range 4 to 6 GeV. This indicates
the possibility of detecting $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ pair from quark gluon plasma
(QGP) in the mass window $4\leq M$(GeV)$\leq 6$.
