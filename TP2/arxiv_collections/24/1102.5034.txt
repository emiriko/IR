The magneto-elastic mechanism of development of the first order type
instability at the phase transition to the ferromagnet state in itinerant
ferromagnet-superconductor UGe2 is discussed. The particular property of this
material is the precipitous drop of the critical temperature at pressure
increase near 14-15 kbar that drastically increases the temperature of the
first order instability in respect to the critical temperature. This effect
leading to transformation of the second order type transition to the first
order one is determined also by the specific heat increase in the temperature
interval of the development of critical fluctuations. After performing the
necessary calculations and estimations using the parameters characterizing the
properties of UGe2 we argue the effectiveness of this mechanism.
