We present deep radio continuum observations of the cores identified as
deeply embedded young stellar objects in the Perseus molecular cloud by the
Spitzer c2d programme at a wavelength of 1.8 cm with the Arcminute Microkelvin
Imager Large Array (AMI-LA). We detect 72% of Class 0 objects from this sample
and 31% of Class I objects. No starless cores are detected. We use the flux
densities measured from these data to improve constraints on the correlations
between radio luminosity and bolometric luminosity, infrared luminosity and,
where measured, outflow force. We discuss the differing behaviour of these
objects as a function of protostellar class and investigate the differences in
radio emission as a function of core mass. Two of four possible very low
luminosity objects (VeLLOs) are detected at 1.8 cm.
