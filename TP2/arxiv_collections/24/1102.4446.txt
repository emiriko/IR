Periodic in time spin-Hall current and spin polarization induced by a dc
electric bias has been calculated in a superconductor-normal
2DEG-superconductor (SNS) Josephson junction. We assumed that the band energies
of electrons in the normal system are splitted due to Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. The transport parameters have been calculated within the diffusion
approximation and using perturbation expansion over a small SN contact
transparency. We found out that in contrast to the stationary Josephson effect,
the spin-Hall current does not turn to zero. Besides a direct proximity effect
caused by Cooper pair's transition into a triplet state, the spin current and
polarization are also driven by a periodic electric field associated with the
charge imbalance.
