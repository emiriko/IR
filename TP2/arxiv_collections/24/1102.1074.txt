We present a new method that combines the results of an oscillation study
made in optical and radio observations. The optical spectral measurements in
photospheric and chromospheric lines of the line-of-sight velocity were carried
out at the Sayan Solar Observatory. The radio maps of the Sun were obtained
with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 1.76 cm. Radio sources associated with the
sunspots were analyzed to study the oscillation processes in the
chromosphere-corona transition region in the layer with magnetic field B=2000
G. A high level of instability of the oscillations in the optical and radio
data was found. We used a wavelet analysis for the spectra. The best
similarities of the spectra of oscillations obtained by the two methods were
detected in the three-minute oscillations inside the sunspot umbra for the
dates when the active regions were situated near the center of the solar disk.
A comparison of the wavelet spectra for optical and radio observations showed a
time delay of about 50 seconds of the radio results with respect to optical
ones. This implies a MHD wave traveling upward inside the umbral magnetic tube
of the sunspot. Besides three-minute and five-minute ones, oscillations with
longer periods (8 and 15 minutes) were detected in optical and radio records.
