The main source of decoherence for an electron spin confined to a quantum dot
is the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. To analyze this process
theoretically we diagonalize the central spin Hamiltonian in the high magnetic
B-field limit. Then we project the eigenstates onto an unpolarized state of the
nuclear bath and find that the resulting density of states has Gaussian tails.
The level spacing of the nuclear sublevels is exponentially small in the middle
of each of the two electron Zeeman levels but increases super-exponentially
away from the center. This suggests to select states from the wings of the
distribution when the system is projected on a single eigenstate by a
measurement to reduce the noise of the nuclear spin bath. This theory is valid
when the external magnetic field is larger than a typical Overhauser field at
high nuclear spin temperature.
