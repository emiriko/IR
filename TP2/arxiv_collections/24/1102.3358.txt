We investigate the effect of turbulence on quantum ghost imaging. We use
entangled photons and demonstrate that for a novel experimental configuration
the effect of turbulence can be greatly diminished. By decoupling the entangled
photon source from the ghost imaging central image plane, we are able to
dramatically increase the ghost image quality. When imaging a test pattern
through turbulence, this method increased the imaged pattern visibility from V
= 0.14 +/- 0.04 to V = 0.29 +/- 0.04.
