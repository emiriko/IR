We advance a hypothesis that creativity has evolved with evolution of
internal representations, possibly from amniotes to primates, and further in
human cultural evolution. Representations separated sensing from acting and
gave "internal room" for creativity. To see (or perform any sensing), creatures
with internal representations had to modify these representations to fit sensor
signals. Therefore the knowledge instinct, KI, the drive to fit representations
to the world, had to evolve along with internal representations. Until
primates, it remained simple, without language internal representations could
not evolve from perceptions to abstract representations, and abstract thoughts
were not possible. We consider creative vs. non-creative decision making, and
compare KI with Kahneman-Tversky's heuristic thinking. We identify higher,
conscious levels of KI with the drive for creativity (DC) and discuss the roles
of language and music, brain mechanisms involved, and experimental directions
for testing the advanced hypotheses.
