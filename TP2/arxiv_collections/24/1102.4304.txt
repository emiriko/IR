In this second paper, we develop an analytical theory of quasi-equatorial
lensing by Kerr black holes. In this setting we solve perturbatively our
general lens equation with displacement given in Paper I, going beyond
weak-deflection Kerr lensing to third order in our expansion parameter epsilon,
which is the ratio of the angular gravitational radius to the angular Einstein
radius. We obtain new formulas and results for the bending angle, image
positions, image magnifications, total unsigned magnification, and centroid,
all to third order in epsilon and including the displacement. New results on
the time delay between images are also given to second order in epsilon, again
including displacement. For all lensing observables we show that the
displacement begins to appear only at second order in epsilon. When there is no
spin, we obtain new results on the lensing observables for Schwarzschild
lensing with displacement.
