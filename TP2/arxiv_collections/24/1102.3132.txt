Recently, Vontobel showed the relationship between Bethe free energy and
annealed free energy for protograph factor graph ensembles. In this paper,
annealed free energy of any random regular, irregular and Poisson factor graph
ensembles are connected to Bethe free energy. The annealed free energy is
expressed as the solution of maximization problem whose stationary condition
equations coincide with equations of belief propagation since the contribution
to partition function of particular type of variable and factor nodes has
similar form of minus Bethe free energy. It gives simple derivation of replica
symmetric solution. As consequence, it is shown that on replica symmetric
ansatz, replica symmetric solution and annealed free energy are equal for
regular ensemble.
