An interpretation of the beam spin azimuthal asymmetries measured at JLAB in
deep exclusive electroproduction of charged and neutral pions is presented. The
model combines a Regge pole approach with the effect of nucleon resonances. The
$s$- and $u$-channel contributions are described using a dual Bloom-Gilman
connection between the exclusive form factors and inclusive deep inelastic
structure functions. The results are in agreement with data provided the
excitations of nucleon resonances are taken into account.
