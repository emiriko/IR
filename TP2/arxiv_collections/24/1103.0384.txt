We present a model of radiative transfer through atmospheric particles based
on Monte Carlo methods. This model can be used to analyze and remove the
contribution of aerosols in remote sensing observations. We have developed a
method to quantify the contribution of atmospheric dust in near-IR spectra of
the Martian surface obtained by the OMEGA imaging spectrometer on board Mars
Express. Using observations in the nadir pointing mode with significant
differences in solar incidence angles, we can infer the optical depth of
atmospheric dust, and we can retrieve the surface reflectance spectra free of
aerosol contribution. Martian airborne dust properties are discussed and
constrained from previous studies and OMEGA data. We have tested our method on
a region at 90{\deg}E and 77{\deg}N extensively covered by OMEGA, where
significant variations of the albedo of ice patches in the visible have been
reported. The consistency between reflectance spectra of ice-covered and
ice-free regions recovered at different incidence angles validates our
approach. The optical depth of aerosols varies by a factor 3 in this region
during the summer of Martian year 27. The observed brightening of ice patches
does not result from frost deposition but from a decrease in the dust
contamination of surface ice and (to a lower extent) from a decrease in the
optical thickness of atmospheric dust. Our Monte Carlo-based model can be
applied to recover the spectral reflectance characteristics of the surface from
OMEGA spectral imaging data when the optical thickness of aerosols can be
evaluated. It could prove useful for processing image cubes from the Compact
Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO).
