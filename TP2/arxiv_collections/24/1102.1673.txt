We show that a viscosity solution of a uniformly elliptic, fully nonlinear
equation which vanishes on an open set must be identically zero, provided that
the equation is $C^{1,1}$. We do not assume that the nonlinearity is convex or
concave, and thus \emph{a priori} $C^2$ estimates are unavailable.
Nevertheless, we use the boundary Harnack inequality and a regularity result
for solutions with small oscillations to prove that the solution must be smooth
at an appropriate point on the boundary of the set on which it is assumed to
vanish. This then permits us to conclude with an application of a classical
unique continuation result for linear equations.
