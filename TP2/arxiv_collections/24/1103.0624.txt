We present spatially resolved infrared spectra of V723 Cas (Nova Cassiopeia
1995) obtained over four years with the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS on
Keck II. Also presented are one epoch of spatially unresolved spectra from the
long slit spectrograph NIRSPEC on Keck II. The OSIRIS observations made use of
the laser guide star adaptive optics facility that produced diffraction-limited
spatial resolution of the strong coronal emission features in the nova ejecta.
We remove the point-like continuum from V723 Cas data cubes to reveal details
of the extended nebula and find that emission due to [Si VI] and [Ca VIII] has
an equatorial ring structure with polar nodules-a strikingly different
morphology than emission due to [Al IX], which appears as a prolate spheroid.
The contrast in structure may indicate separate ejection events. Using the
angular expansion and Doppler velocities observed over four epochs spaced at
one year intervals, we determine the distance to V723 Cas to be 3.85+0.23-0.21
kpc. We present the OSIRIS three-dimensional data here in many ways: as
narrowband images, one- and two-dimensional spectra, and a volume rendering
that reveals the true shape of the ejecta.
