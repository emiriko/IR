We investigate cooperative exclusion, in which the particle velocity can be
an increasing function of the density. Within a hydrodynamic theory, an initial
density upsteps and downsteps can evolve into: (a) shock waves, (b) continuous
compression or rarefaction waves, or (c) a mixture of shocks and continuous
waves. These unusual phenomena arise because of an inflection point in the
current versus density relation. This anomaly leads to a group velocity that
can either be an increasing or a decreasing function of the density on either
side of these wave singularities.
