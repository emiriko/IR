We have fabricated superconducting microwave resonators in a lumped element
geometry using single crystal silicon dielectric parallel plate capacitors with
C >2 pF. Aluminum devices with resonant frequencies between 4.0 and 6.5 GHz
exhibited an average internal quality factor Q_i of 2 x 10^5 in the single
photon excitation regime at T = 20 mK. Attributing all the observed loss to the
capacitive element, our measurements correspond to a loss tangent of intrinsic
silicon of 5 x 10^-6. This level of loss is an order of magnitude lower than is
currently observed in structures incorporating amorphous dielectric materials,
thus making single crystal silicon capacitors an attractive, robust route for
realizing long-lived quantum circuits.
