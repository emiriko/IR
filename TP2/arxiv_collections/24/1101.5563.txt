We present new spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric He I
10830 {\AA} multiplet observed in a filament during its phase of activity. The
data were recorded with the new Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP-II) at the
German Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) on 2005 May 18. We inverted the He Stokes
profiles using multiple atmospheric components. The observed He Stokes profiles
display a remarkably wide variety of shapes. Most of the profiles show very
broad Stokes I absorptions and complex and spatially variable Stokes V
signatures. The inversion of the profiles shows evidence of different
atmospheric blue- and redshifted components of the He I lines within the
resolution element (1 arcsec), with supersonic velocities of up to 100 km/s. Up
to five different atmospheric components are found in the same profile. We show
that even these complex profiles can be reliably inverted.
