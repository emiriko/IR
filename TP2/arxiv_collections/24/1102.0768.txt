A state-dependent relay channel is studied in which strictly causal channel
state information is available at the relay and no state information is
available at the source and destination. The source and the relay are connected
via two unidirectional out-of-band orthogonal links of finite capacity, and a
state-dependent memoryless channel connects the source and the relay, on one
side, and the destination, on the other. Via the orthogonal links, the source
can convey information about the message to be delivered to the destination to
the relay while the relay can forward state information to the source. This
exchange enables cooperation between the source and the relay on transmission
of message and state information to the destination. First, two achievable
schemes are proposed that exploit both message and state cooperation. It is
shown that a transmission scheme inspired by noisy network coding performs
better than a strategy based on block Markov coding and backward decoding.
Next, based on the given achievable schemes and appropriate upper bounds,
capacity results are identified for some special cases. Finally, a Gaussian
model is studied, along with corresponding numerical results that illuminate
the relative merits of state and message cooperation.
