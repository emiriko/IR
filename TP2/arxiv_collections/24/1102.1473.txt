We identify a subcategory of biracks which define counting invariants of
unoriented links, which we call involutory biracks. In particular, involutory
biracks of birack rank N=1 are biquandles, which we call bikei. We define
counting invariants of unoriented classical and virtual links using finite
involutory biracks, and we give an example of a non-involutory birack whose
counting invariant detects the non-invertibility of a virtual knot.
