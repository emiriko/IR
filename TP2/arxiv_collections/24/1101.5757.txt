Grishin proposed enriching the Lambek calculus with multiplicative
disjunction (par) and coresiduals. Applications to linguistics were discussed
by Moortgat, who spoke of the Lambek-Grishin calculus (LG). In this paper, we
adapt Girard's polarity-sensitive double negation embedding for classical logic
to extract a compositional Montagovian semantics from a display calculus for
focused proof search in LG. We seize the opportunity to illustrate our approach
alongside an analysis of extraction, providing linguistic motivation for linear
distributivity of tensor over par, thus answering a question of
Kurtonina&Moortgat. We conclude by comparing our proposal to the continuation
semantics of Bernardi&Moortgat, corresponding to call-by- name and
call-by-value evaluation strategies.
