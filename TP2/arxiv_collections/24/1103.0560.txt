We measure partial branching fractions for the inclusive charmless
semileptonic decay of $\Bxulnu$, and present determinations of the CKM matrix
element $\Vub$. This analysis is based on a sample of 467 million $\FourS$
decays into $\BB$ pairs, collected with the \babar\ detector at the PEP-II
$e^{+} e^{-}$ storage rings. We select events where one of the B mesons is
fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and the other B decays
semileptonically into an electron or a muon. We then use the invariant mass,
$\mx$, of the hadronic system, the invariant mass squared, $q^{2}$, of the
lepton and neutrino pair, the lepton momentum in the in the $B$ meson rest
frame $\Pl$, the kinematic variable $P_{+}$ or one of their combinations as
discriminating variables to isolate $\Bxulnu$ decays from the background.
  We then measure the partial branching fractions in various regions of phase
space These partial branching fractions are translated into values of $\Vub$
using several theoretical calculations. An estimate based on the most inclusive
analysis gives $\Vub = (4.31\pm 0.35) \times 10^{-3}$. Furthermore, we place a
limit on isospin breaking in $B\to X_u\ell\nu$ decays of 9% at 90% C.L. using
separate measurements of partial branching ratios for $B^0$ and $B^+$.
