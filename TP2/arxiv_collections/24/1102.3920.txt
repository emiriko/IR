(Abridged) We report on an accounting of the star formation and accretion
driven energetics of 24um detected sources in GOODS North. For sources having
infrared (IR; 8-1000um) luminosities >3x10^12 L_sun when derived by fitting
local SEDs to 24um photometry alone, we find these IR luminosity estimates to
be a factor of ~4 times larger than those estimated when the SED fitting
includes additional 16 and 70um data (and in some cases mid-infrared
spectroscopy and 850um data). This discrepancy arises from the fact that high
luminosity sources at z>>0 appear to have far- to mid-infrared ratios, as well
as aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies in
the local Universe. Using our improved estimates for IR luminosity and AGN
contributions, we investigate the evolution of the IR luminosity density versus
redshift arising from star formation and AGN processes alone. We find that,
within the uncertainties, the total star formation driven IR luminosity density
is constant between 1.15 < z < 2.35, although our results suggest a slightly
larger value at z>2. AGN appear to account for <18% of the total IR luminosity
density integrated between 0< z < 2.35, contributing <25% at each epoch. LIRG
appear to dominate the star formation rate (SFR) density along with normal
star-forming galaxies (L_IR < 10^11 L_sun) between 0.6 < z < 1.15. Once beyond
z >2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs becomes
comparable with that of LIRGs. Using our improved IR luminosity estimates, we
find existing calibrations for UV extinction corrections based on measurements
of the UV spectral slope typically overcorrect UV luminosities by a factor of
~2, on average, for our sample of 24um-selected sources; accordingly we have
derived a new UV extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.
