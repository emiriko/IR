We consider the application of high-pass Fourier filters to remove periodic
systematic fluctuations from full-sky survey CMB datasets. We compare the
filter performance with destriping codes commonly used to remove the effect of
residual 1/f noise from timelines. As a realistic working case, we use
simulations of the typical Planck scanning strategy and Planck Low Frequency
Instrument noise performance, with spurious periodic fluctuations that mimic a
typical thermal disturbance. We show that the application of Fourier high-pass
filters in chunks always requires subsequent normalisation of induced offsets
by means of destriping. For a complex signal containing all the astrophysical
and instrumental components, the result obtained by applying filter and
destriping in series is comparable to the result obtained by destriping only,
which makes the usefulness of Fourier filters questionable for removing this
kind of effects.
