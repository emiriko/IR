Many eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can exhibit remarkable sensing ability
under small gradient of chemical compound. In this study, we approach this
phenomenon by considering the contribution of multiple ligands to the chemical
kinetics within Michaelis-Menten model. This work was inspired by the recent
theoretical findings from Bo Hu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 048104 (2010)],
our treatment with practical binding energies and chemical potential provides
the results which are consistent with experimental observations.
