This paper addresses object perception applied to mobile robotics. Being able
to perceive semantically meaningful objects in unstructured environments is a
key capability in order to make robots suitable to perform high-level tasks in
home environments. However, finding a solution for this task is daunting: it
requires the ability to handle the variability in image formation in a moving
camera with tight time constraints. The paper brings to attention some of the
issues with applying three state of the art object recognition and detection
methods in a mobile robotics scenario, and proposes methods to deal with
windowing/segmentation. Thus, this work aims at evaluating the state-of-the-art
in object perception in an attempt to develop a lightweight solution for mobile
robotics use/research in typical indoor settings.
