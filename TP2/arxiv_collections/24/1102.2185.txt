We use the circularly polarized resonant Rayleigh scattering (RRS) to study
the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu$ = 1. At this filling factor we observe a
right handed copolarized RRS which probes the Skyrmion spin texture of the
electrons in the photoexcited grounds state. The resonant scattering is not
present in the left handed copolarization, and this can be related to the
correlation between Skymionic effects, screening and spin wave excitations.
These results evidence that RRS is a valid method for the study of the spin
texture of the quantum Hall states.
