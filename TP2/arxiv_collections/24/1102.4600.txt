We study metrical properties of various subsequences associated to the
sequence of rational approximants coming from the continued fraction of an
irrational number. Our methods build upon Bosma, Jager and Wiedijk's proof of
the Doblin-Lenstra conjecture as well as Jager's subsequent treatment of the
sequence of approximation pairs.
