Let F be a uniformly distributed random k-SAT formula with n variables and m
clauses. Non-rigorous statistical mechanics ideas have inspired a message
passing algorithm called Belief Propagation Guided Decimation for finding
satisfying assignments of F. This algorithm can be viewed as an attempt at
implementing a certain thought experiment that we call the Decimation Process.
In this paper we identify a variety of phase transitions in the decimation
process and link these phase transitions to the performance of the algorithm.
