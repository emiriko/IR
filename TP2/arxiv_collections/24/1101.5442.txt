Several proof translations of classical mathematics into intuitionistic
mathematics have been proposed in the literature over the past century. These
are normally referred to as negative translations or double-negation
translations. Among those, the most commonly cited are translations due to
Kolmogorov, Godel, Gentzen, Kuroda and Krivine (in chronological order). In
this paper we propose a framework for explaining how these different
translations are related to each other. More precisely, we define a notion of a
(modular) simplification starting from Kolmogorov translation, which leads to a
partial order between different negative translations. In this derived
ordering, Kuroda and Krivine are minimal elements. Two new minimal translations
are introduced, with Godel and Gentzen translations sitting in between
Kolmogorov and one of these new translations.
