We examine the modified electronic states at the interface between
superconducting and ferro(para)-electric heterostructures. We find that
electric polarization $P$ and superconducting $\psi$ order parameters can be
significantly modified due to coupling through linear terms brought about by
explicit symmetry breaking at the interface. Using an effective action and a
Ginzburg-Landau formalism, we show that an interaction term linear in the
electric polarization will modify the superconducting order parameter $\psi$ at
the interface. This also produces modulation of a ferroelectric polarization.
It is shown that a paraelectric-superconductor interaction will produce an
interface-induced ferroelectric polarization.
