The Gauss's law, in an abstract sense, is a theorem that relates quantities
on the boundary (flux) to the interior (charge) of a surface. An identity for
soap froths were proved with the same boundary-interior relation. In this
article, we try to construct a definition of flux for other graphs, such that a
similar boundary-interior relation can be satisfied.
