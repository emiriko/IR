E-commerce is an emerging technology. Impact of this new technology is
getting clearer with time and results are tangible to the user community. In
this paper we have tried to focus some of its issues like paradigms,
infrastructure integration, and security, which is considered to be the most
important issue in E-Commerce. At first we have elaborated the paradigms of
E-Commerce (Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer). Then comes the
necessity of infrastructure integration with the legacy system. Security
concerns comes next. Rest of the part contains conclusion and references.
