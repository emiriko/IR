In distributed storage systems built using commodity hardware, it is
necessary to have data redundancy in order to ensure system reliability. In
such systems, it is also often desirable to be able to quickly repair storage
nodes that fail. We consider a scheme--introduced by El Rouayheb and
Ramchandran--which uses combinatorial block design in order to design storage
systems that enable efficient (and exact) node repair. In this work, we
investigate systems where node sizes may be much larger than replication
degrees, and explicitly provide algorithms for constructing these storage
designs. Our designs, which are related to projective geometries, are based on
the construction of bipartite cage graphs (with girth 6) and the concept of
mutually-orthogonal Latin squares. Via these constructions, we can guarantee
that the resulting designs require the fewest number of storage nodes for the
given parameters, and can further show that these systems can be easily
expanded without need for frequent reconfiguration.
