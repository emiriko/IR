We perform a study on the predictions of electric-dipole moments (EDMs) of
neutron, Mercury (Hg), Thallium (Tl), deuteron, and Radium (Ra) in the
framework of next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with
CP-violating parameters in the superpotential and soft-supersymmetry-breaking
sector. We confine to the case in which only the physical tree-level CP phase
$(\phi'_\lambda - \phi'_\kappa)$, associated with the couplings of the singlet
terms in the superpotential and with the vacuum-expectation-values (VEVs),
takes on a nonzero value. We found that the one-loop contributions from
neutralinos are mostly small while the two-loop Higgs-mediated contributions of
the Barr-Zee (BZ) type diagrams dominate. We emphasize a scenario motivated by
electroweak baryogenesis.
