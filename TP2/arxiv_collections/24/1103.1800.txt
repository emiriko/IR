This paper covers the main eddy current effects in accelerator magnets -
field modification (time delay and field quality) and resistive power losses.
In the first part, starting from the Maxwell equations, a basic understanding
of the processes is given and explained with examples of simple geometry and
time behaviour. Useful formulas are derived for an analytic estimate of the
size of the effects. In the second part the effects in real magnets are
analysed and described in comparison with numerical and measured results.
Finally, based on the previous parts, design recommendations are given
regarding how to minimize eddy current effects.
