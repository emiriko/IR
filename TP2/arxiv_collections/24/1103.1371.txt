We prove the sharpness of the phase transition for speed in the biased random
walk on the supercritical percolation cluster on Z^d. That is, for each d at
least 2, and for any supercritical parameter p > p_c, we prove the existence of
a critical strength for the bias, such that, below this value, the speed is
positive, and, above the value, it is zero. We identify the value of the
critical bias explicitly, and, in the sub-ballistic regime, we find the
polynomial order of the distance moved by the particle. Each of these
conclusions is obtained by investigating the geometry of the traps that are
most effective at delaying the walk. A key element in proving our results is to
understand that, on large scales, the particle trajectory is essentially
one-dimensional; we prove such a `dynamic renormalization' statement in a much
stronger form than was previously known.
