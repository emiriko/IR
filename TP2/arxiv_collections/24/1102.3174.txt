We introduce formal languages over infinite alphabets where words may contain
binders. We define the notions of nominal language, nominal monoid, and nominal
regular expressions. Moreover, we extend history-dependent automata
(HD-automata) by adding stack, and study the recognisability of nominal
languages.
