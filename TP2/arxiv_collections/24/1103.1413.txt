We discuss several steady-state rotation and oscillation modes of the planar
parametric rotator and pendulum with damping. We consider a general elliptic
trajectory of the suspension point for both rotator and pendulum, for the
latter at an arbitrary angle with gravity, with linear and circular
trajectories as particular cases. We treat the damped, non-linear equation of
motion of the parametric rotator and pendulum perturbatively for small
parametric excitation and damping, although our perturbative approach can be
extended to other regimes as well. Our treatment involves only ordinary
second-order differential equations with constant coefficients, and provides
numerically accurate perturbative solutions in terms of elementary functions.
Some of the steady-state rotation and oscillation modes studied here have not
been discussed in the previous literature. Other well-known ones, such as
parametric resonance and the inverted pendulum, are extended to elliptic
parametric excitation tilted with respect to gravity. The results presented
here should be accessible to advanced undergraduates, and of interest to
graduate students and specialists in the field of non-linear mechanics.
