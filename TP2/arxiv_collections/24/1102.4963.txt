We have theoretically investigated the properties of electronic transport in
graphene heterostructures, which are consisted of two different graphene
superlattices with one-dimensional periodic potentials. It is found that such
heterostructures possess an unusual tunneling state occurring inside the
original forbidden gaps, and the electronic conductance is greatly enhanced and
Fano factor is strongly suppressed near the energy of the tunneling state.
Finally we present the matching condition of the impedance of the pseudospin
wave for occuring the tunneling state by using the Bloch-wave expansion method.
