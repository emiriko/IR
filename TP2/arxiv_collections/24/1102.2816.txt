We present a simple and practical quantum protocol involving two mistrustful
agencies in Minkowski space, which allows Alice to transfer data to Bob at a
spacetime location that neither can predict in advance. The location depends on
both Alice's and Bob's actions. The protocol guarantees unconditionally to
Alice that Bob learns the data at a randomly determined location; it guarantees
to Bob that Alice will not learn the transfer location even after the protocol
is complete.
  The task implemented, transferring data at a space-time location that remains
hidden from the transferrer, has no precise analogue in non-relativistic
quantum cryptography. It illustrates further the scope for novel cryptographic
applications of relativistic quantum theory.
