The forward-backward asymmetry A_{FB}^t in top quark production at the
Tevatron has been seen to be anomalously large both by CDF and D0. Parton-level
asymmetries as large as 50%, with a large error bar, have been extracted from
the data. It is important to measure other quark asymmetries if possible, as
these would help clarify the source of any new physics behind A_{FB}^t. In this
note it is argued that asymmetries in b\bar b and c\bar c should be accessible
to the Tevatron experiments, using the full data sets. A crude study suggests
that muon asymmetries in high-p_T dijet events, with suitable use of muon and
jet kinematics and (inefficient) heavy flavor tagging, might allow detection of
A_{FB}^c and A_{FB}^b ~ 0.3. Were it possible to make heavy flavor tagging at
high p_T efficient, or mistags rare, then the sensitivity of the measurement of
A_{FB}^b could be significantly better.
