For optimal application, pressure-sensitive adhesives must have rheological
properties in between those of a viscoplastic solid and those of a viscoelastic
liquid. Such adhesives can be produced by emulsion polymerisation, resulting in
latex particles which are dispersed in water and contain long-chain acrylic
polymers. When the emulsion is dried, the latex particles coalesce and an
adhesive film is formed. The rheological properties of the dried samples are
believed to be dominated by the interface regions between the original latex
particles, but the relation between rheology and latex particle properties is
poorly understood. In this paper we show that it is possible to describe the
bulk rheology of a pressure-sensitive adhesive by means of a mesoscale
simulation model. To reach experimental time and length scales, each latex
particle is represented by just one simulated particle. The model is subjected
to oscillatory shear flow and extensional flow. Simple order of magnitude
estimates of the model parameters already lead to semi-quantitative agreement
with experimental results. We show that inclusion of transient forces in the
model, i.e. forces with memory of previous configurations, is essential to
correctly predict the linear and nonlinear properties.
