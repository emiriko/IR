We consider the eigenvalue problem for the case where the input matrix is
symmetric and its entries perturb in some given intervals. We present a
characterization of some of the exact boundary points, which allows us to
introduce an inner approximation algorithm, that in many case estimates exact
bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that is able to guaran-
tee exactness. We illustrate our approach by several examples and numerical
experiments.
