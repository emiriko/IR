We have studied magnetic Feshbach resonances in an ultracold sample of Na
prepared in the absolute hyperfine ground state. We report on the observation
of three s-, eight d-, and three g-wave Feshbach resonances, including a more
precise determination of two known s-wave resonances, and one s-wave resonance
at a magnetic field exceeding 200mT. Using a coupled-channels calculation we
have improved the sodium ground-state potentials by taking into account these
new experimental data, and derived values for the scattering lengths. In
addition, a description of the molecular states leading to the Feshbach
resonances in terms of the asymptotic-bound-state model is presented.
