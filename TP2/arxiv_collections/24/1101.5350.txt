A new cluster model solution to the long standing nuclear structure problem
of describing the anomalously long lifetime of 14C is presented. Related
beta-decay data for 14O to states in 14N, gamma decay data between low lying
positive parity states in 14N and the elastic and inelastic magnetic dipole
electron scattering from 14N data are all shown to be very accurately described
by the model. The shapes of the beta spectra for the A=14 system are also well
reproduced by the model. The model invokes four-nucleon tetrahedral symmetric
spatial correlations arising from three- and four-nucleon interactions which
yields a high degree of SU(4) singlet structure for the clusters and a
tetrahedral intrinsic shape for the doubly magic 16O ground state. The large
quadrupole moment of the 14N ground state is obtained here for the first time
and arises because of the almost 100% d-wave deuteron-like-hole cluster
structure inherent in the model.
