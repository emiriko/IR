The solvability in Sobolev spaces is proved for divergence form
complex-valued higher order parabolic systems in the whole space, on a half
space, and on a Reifenberg flat domain. The leading coefficients are assumed to
be merely measurable in one spacial direction and have small mean oscillations
in the orthogonal directions on each small cylinder. The directions in which
the coefficients are only measurable vary depending on each cylinder. The
corresponding elliptic problem is also considered.
