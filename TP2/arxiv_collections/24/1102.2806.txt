The Nuclear Science References (NSR) database together with its associated
Web interface, is the world's only comprehensive source of easily accessible
low- and intermediate-energy nuclear physics bibliographic information for more
than 200,000 articles since the beginning of nuclear science. The
weekly-updated NSR database provides essential support for nuclear data
evaluation, compilation and research activities. The principles of the database
and Web application development and maintenance are described. Examples of
nuclear structure, reaction and decay applications are specifically included.
The complete NSR database is freely available at the websites of the National
Nuclear Data Center http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nsr and the International Atomic
Energy Agency http://www-nds.iaea.org/nsr.
