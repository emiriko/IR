A deep Very Large Array observation of the Geminga pulsar field led to the
discovery, at a higher than 10 sigma significance level, of radio emission
trailing the neutron star proper motion. This 10-arcsec-long radio feature,
detected with a flux of 0.4 mJy at 4.8 GHz, is marginally displaced (2.7\pm1.8
arcsec) from the pulsar (which, at any rate, is unlikely to contribute with
magnetospheric pulsed emission more than 15% to the total observed radio
luminosity, about 1E26 erg/s) and positionally coincident with the X-ray axial
tail recently discovered by Chandra and ascribed to the pulsar wind nebula
(PWN). Overall, the Geminga radio tail is compatible with the scenario of a
synchrotron-emitting PWN, but the present data do not allow us to discriminate
between different (and not always necessarily mutually exclusive) possible
processes for producing that. If this radio feature does not result from
intrinsic peculiarities of Geminga, but its proximity and radio-quiet nature
(both helping in not hindering the faint diffuse radio emission), other
relatively near and energetic radio-quiet pulsars could show similar structures
in dedicated interferometric observations.
