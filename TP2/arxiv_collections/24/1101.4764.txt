The superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer is one
of the most sensitive experimental techniques to magnetically characterize
samples with high sensitivity. Here we present a detailed discussion of
possible artifacts and pitfalls characteristic for commercial SQUID
magnetometers. This includes intrinsic artifacts which stem from the inherent
design of the magnetometer as well as potential issues due to the user. We
provide some guidelines how to avoid and correct these, which is of particular
importance when the proper magnetization of nano-scale objects shall be
established in cases where its response is dwarfed by that of the substrate it
comes with, a situation frequently found in the field of nano-magnetism.
