Recent results from the CDF Collaboration indicate the the top-pair
forward-backward asymmetry is largest in regions of high rapidity difference
$|\Delta y|$ and invariant mass $M_{t\bar t}.$ We show that experimental
observations can be explained by our previously proposed Asymmetric Left-Right
Model (ALRM). The gauge symmetry $U'(1)\times SU'(2)\times SU(2)$ is broken by
a triplet Higgs in the primed sector. The $W'$ boson has a $(t,d)$ right-handed
coupling and the $Z'$ boson has diagonal fermion couplings. We determine the
model parameters to be $M_{W'} = 700$ GeV, $M_{Z'}=1$ TeV, and charged current
coupling $g'_2=3$. The $W'$ and $Z'$ total decay widths are of
$\mathcal{O}(100$ GeV). The signals from $Z'\to t\bar t$ and $W'\to tb$ at the
LHC will test the model.
