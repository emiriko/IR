In a recent paper, K. O. Greulich propose an empirical, one-parameter rule
which is claimed to predict the masses of all fundamental elementary particles.
This statement seems to be true as sustained by the comparison of some
experimental and calculated elementary masses. The author admits that in the
case of an isolated single particle a good result could be achieved simply by
chance. He also states that the probability to fit by chance the whole ensemble
of all elementary masses within 1% accuracy is close to zero. However, one may
observe that only 8 of the 11 particles which are relevant for the correctness
of his model satisfy the formula within 1% accuracy and this result could have
been achieved simple by chance.
