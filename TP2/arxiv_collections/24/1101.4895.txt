Parton Cascade Models (PCM), which describe the full time-evolution of a
system of quarks and gluons using pQCD interactions are ideally suited for the
description of jet production, including the emission, evolution and
energy-loss of the full parton shower in a hot and dense QCD medium. The
Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, the quantum interference of parton wave
functions due to repeated scatterings against the background medium, is likely
the dominant in-medium effect affecting jet suppression. We have implemented a
probabilistic implementation of the LPM effect within the PCM which can be
validated against previously derived analytical calculations by Baier et al
(BDMPS-Z).
