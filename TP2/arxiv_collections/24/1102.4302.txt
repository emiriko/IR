We describe a subclass of the class of normal operators on Banach spaces over
non-Archimedean fields (A. N. Kochubei, J. Math. Phys. 51 (2010), article
023526) consisting of operators whose properties resemble those of unitary
operators. In particular, an analog of Stone's theorem about one-parameter
groups of unitary operators is proved.
