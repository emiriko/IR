We study the effect of vaccination on robustness of networks against
propagating attacks that obey the susceptible-infected-removed model.By
extending the generating function formalism developed by Newman (2005), we
analytically determine the robustness of networks that depends on the
vaccination parameters. We consider the random defense where nodes are
vaccinated randomly and the degree-based defense where hubs are preferentially
vaccinated. We show that when vaccines are inefficient, the random graph is
more robust against propagating attacks than the scale-free network. When
vaccines are relatively efficient, the scale-free network with the degree-based
defense is more robust than the random graph with the random defense and the
scale-free network with the random defense.
