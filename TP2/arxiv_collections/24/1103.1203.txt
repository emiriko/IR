We present a Regge model for pion photoproduction which is basically free of
parameters within the framework of the s-channel helicity amplitude. We use
coupling constants of all exchanged mesons determined from empirical decay
widths or from the SU(3) relations together with consistency check with
existing estimates that are widely accepted in other reaction processes. Cross
sections and spin polarization asymmetries at various photon energies are
analyzed and results are obtained in better agreement with experimental data
without referring to any fitting procedure.
