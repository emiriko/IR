It has been well-known that topological phenomena with fractional
excitations, i.e., the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) \cite{Tsui1982}
will emerge when electrons move in Landau levels. In this letter, we report the
discovery of the FQHE in the absence of Landau levels in an interacting fermion
model. The non-interacting part of our Hamiltonian is the recently proposed
topologically nontrivial flat band model on the checkerboard lattice
\cite{sun}. In the presence of nearest-neighboring repulsion ($U$), we find
that at 1/3 filling, the Fermi-liquid state is unstable towards FQHE. At 1/5
filling, however, a next-nearest-neighboring repulsion is needed for the
occurrence of the 1/5 FQHE when $U$ is not too strong. We demonstrate the
characteristic features of these novel states and determine the phase diagram
correspondingly.
