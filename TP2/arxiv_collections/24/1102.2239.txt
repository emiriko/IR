We investigate the structure of holographic renormalization in the presence
of sources for irrelevant operators. By working perturbatively in the sources
we avoid issues related to the non-renormalizability of the dual field theory.
We find new classes of divergences which appear to be non-local on the gravity
side. However in all cases a systematic renormalization procedure exists
involving either standard local counterterms or new counterterms which may be
interpreted as multi-trace counterterms in the field theory. The multi-trace
counterterms reflect a more intricate relation between sources and the
asymptotics of bulk fields.
