Fragmentation of light charged particles is studied for various systems at
different incident energies between 50 and 1000 MeV/nucleon. We analyze
fragment production at incident energies above, below and at transition
energies using the isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics(IQMD) model.
The trends observed for the fragment production and rapidity distributions
depend upon the incident energy, size of the fragments, composite mass of the
reacting system as well as on the impact parameter of the reaction. The free
nucleons and light charged particles show continous homogeneous changes
irrespective of the transition energies indicating that there is no relation
between the transition energy and production of the free as well as light
charged particles.
