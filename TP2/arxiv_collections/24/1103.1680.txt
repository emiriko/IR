The spread of a disease, a computer virus or information is discussed in a
directed complex network. We are concerned with a steady state of the spread
for the SIR and SIS dynamic models. In a scale-free directed network it is
shown that the threshold of its outbreak in both models approaches zero under a
high correlation between nodal indegrees and outdegrees.
