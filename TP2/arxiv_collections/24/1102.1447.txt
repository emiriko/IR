We consider the phenomenon of quantum charge pumping of electrons across a
superconducting double barrier structure in graphene in the adiabatic limit. In
this geometry, quantum charge pumping can be achieved by modulating the
amplitudes (Delta_1 and Delta_2) of the gaps associated with the two
superconducting strips. We show that the superconducting gaps give rise to a
transmission resonance in the Delta_1-Delta_2 plane, resulting in a large value
of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses the resonance. This is in
sharp contrast to the case of charge pumping in a normal double barrier
structure in graphene, where the pumped charge is very small, due to the
phenomenon of Klein tunneling. We analyse the behaviour of the pumped charge
through the superconducting double barrier geometry as a function of the
pumping strength and the phase difference between the two pumping parameters,
for various angles of the incident electron.
