A Causal rate distortion function with a general fidelity criterion is
formulated on abstract alphabets and the optimal reconstruction kernel is
derived, which consists of a product of causal kernels. In the process, general
abstract spaces are introduced to show existence of the minimizing kernel using
weak*-convergence. Certain properties of the causal rate distortion function
are presented.
