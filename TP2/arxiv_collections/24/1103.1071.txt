We study the possible dynamics associated with leptonic charge in future
linear colliders. Leptophilic massive vector boson, Z_(l), have been
investigated through the process e^(+)e^(-) -> mu^(+)mu^(-). We have shown that
ILC and CLIC will give opportunity to observe Z_(l) with masses up to the
center of mass energy if the corresponding coupling constant g_(l) exceeds
10^(-3).
