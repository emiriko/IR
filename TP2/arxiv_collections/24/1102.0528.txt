Using the ergodicity principle for the expectation values of several types of
observables, we investigate the thermalization process in isolated fermionic
systems. These are described by the two-body random ensemble, which is a
paradigmatic model to study quantum chaos and specially the dynamical
transition from integrability to chaos. By means of exact diagonalizations we
analyze the relevance of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as
the influence of other factors, like the energy and structure of the initial
state, or the dimension of the Hilbert space. We also obtain analytical
expressions linking the degree of thermalization for a given observable with
the so-called number of principal components for transition strengths
originated at a given energy, with the dimensions of the whole Hilbert space
and microcanonical energy shell, and with the correlations generated by the
observable. As the strength of the residual interaction is increased an
order-to-chaos transition takes place, and we show that the onset of Wigner
spectral fluctuations, which is the standard signature of chaos, is not
sufficient to guarantee thermalization in finite systems. When all the
signatures of chaos are fulfilled, including the quasi complete delocalization
of eigenfunctions, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is the mechanism
responsible for the thermalization of certain types of observables, such as
(linear combinations of) occupancies and strength function operators. Our
results also suggest that fully chaotic systems will thermalize relative to
most observables in the thermodynamic limit.
