Deep X-ray data from CHANDRA and XMM-Newton, and GMRT radio data are
presented for ZwCl 2341.1+0000, an extremely unusual and complex merging
cluster of galaxies at the intersection of optical filaments. We propose that
energetics of multiple mergers and accretion flows has resulted in wide-spread
shocks, acceleration of cosmic ray particles and amplification of weak magnetic
fields. This results in Mpc-scale peripheral radio relics and halo like
non-thermal emission observed near the merging center.
