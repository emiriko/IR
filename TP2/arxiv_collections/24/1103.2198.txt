In the wind power production calculations the air density is usually
considered as constant in time. Using the CIPM-2007 equation for the density of
moist air as a function of air temperature, air pressure and relative humidity,
we show that it is worth taking the variation of the air density into account,
because higher accuracy can be obtained in the calculation of the power
production for little effort.
