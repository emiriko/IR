Observation of CP violation in $B^o\to K^\pm\pi^{\mp}$ decays and its absence
in $B^+\to K^+\pi^o$ decays are explained in new improved data analysis of more
precise $B\to K\pi$ data. Success of the "Lipkin Sum Rule" indicates that four
$B\tow K\pi$ branching ratios are determined by three parameters, the penguin
diagram $P$ and two interference terms $P\cdot T$ and $P\cdot S$ between the
dominant penguin and two tree diagrams; the color-favored and color suppressed
diagrams. Previous analyzes confirmed the model with errors leaving values of
interference terms less that two standard deviations from zero. The observation
CP violation in $B^o\to K^\pm\pi^{\mp}$ decays indicates a finite value for
$P\cdot T$. New precise data analysis show $P\cdot T$ and $P\cdot S$
interference contributions well above errors. Their contributions to $B^\pm\to
K\pi$ decays are shown to be nearly equal with opposite phase and cancel within
experimental errors. This cancelation unexpected in previous analyzes explains
the failure to see CP violation in $B^\pm\to K\pi$ decays. It can be due to the
Pauli antisymmetry exchange neglected in previous analyzes. Two $B^\pm\to K\pi$
tree diagrams differ by interchange of two identical $u$ quarks. $B^o\to
K^\pm\pi^{\mp}$ diagrams have no identical quark pairs. This Pauli effect
explains the difference produced by changing the flavor of the spectator quark
which does not participate in the weak interaction. Our analysis differs from
previous analyzes which assume SU(3) flavor symmetry to use input from $B\to
\pi\pi$ data and neglect Pauli effects. We use new data, include Pauli effects
and strong final state interactions to all orders in QCD with no higher flavor
symmetry assumed beyond isospin. We do not use $B\to \pi\pi$ data.
