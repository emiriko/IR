In this paper, we study the non-convex problem of continuous frequency
optimal spectrum management in multiuser frequency selective interference
channels. Firstly, a simple pairwise channel condition for FDMA schemes to
achieve all Pareto optimal points of the rate region is derived. It enables
fully distributed global optimal decision making on whether any two users
should use orthogonal channels. Next, we present in detail an analytical
solution to finding the global optimum of sum-rate maximization in two-user
symmetric flat channels. Generalizing this solution to frequency selective
channels, a convex optimization is established that solves the global optimum.
Finally, we show that our method generalizes to K-user (K>=2) weighted sum-rate
maximization in asymmetric frequency selective channels, and transform this
classic non-convex optimization in the primal domain to an equivalent convex
optimization. The complexity is shown to be separable in its dependence on the
channel parameters and the power constraints.
