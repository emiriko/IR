We show in elementary terms the equivalence in a general gauge of a
U(1)-gauge theory of a scalar charged particle on a torus T^n = R^n/L to the
analogous theory on R^n constrained by quasiperiodicity under translations in
the lattice L. The latter theory provides a global description of the former:
the quasiperiodic wavefunctions defined on R^n play the role of sections of the
associated hermitean line bundle E on T^n, since also E admits a global
description as a quotient. The components of the covariant derivatives
corresponding to a constant (necessarily integral) magnetic field B = dA
generate a Lie algebra g_Q and together with the periodic functions the algebra
of observables O_Q . The non-abelian part of g_Q is a Heisenberg Lie algebra
with the electric charge operator Q as the central generator; the corresponding
Lie group G_Q acts on the Hilbert space as the translation group up to phase
factors. Also the space of sections of E is mapped into itself by g in G_Q . We
identify the socalled magnetic translation group as a subgroup of the
observables' group Y_Q . We determine the unitary irreducible representations
of O_Q, Y_Q corresponding to integer charges and for each of them an associated
orthonormal basis explicitly in configuration space. We also clarify how in the
n = 2m case a holomorphic structure and Theta functions arise on the associated
complex torus. These results apply equally well to the physics of charged
scalar particles on R^n and on T^n in the presence of periodic magnetic field B
and scalar potential. They are also necessary preliminary steps for the
application to these theories of the deformation procedure induced by Drinfel'd
twists.
