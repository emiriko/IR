The (abelian bosonic) heterotic string effective action, equations of motion
and Bianchi identity at order alpha prime in ten dimensions, are shown to be
equivalent to a higher dimensional action, its derived equations of motion and
Bianchi identity. The two actions are the same up to the gauge fields: the
latter are absorbed in the higher dimensional fields and geometry. This
construction is inspired by heterotic T-duality, which becomes natural in this
higher dimensional theory. We also prove the equivalence of the heterotic
string supersymmetry conditions with higher dimensional geometric conditions.
Finally, some known Kahler and non-Kahler heterotic solutions are shown to be
trivially related from this higher dimensional perspective, via a simple
exchange of directions. This exchange can be encoded in a heterotic T-duality,
and it may also lead to new solutions.
