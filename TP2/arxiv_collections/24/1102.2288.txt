This is a brief survey of applications of the harmonic superspace methods to
the models of N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM). The main focus is on
a recent progress in constructing SQM models with couplings to the background
non-Abelian gauge fields. Besides reviewing and systemizing the relevant
results, we present some new examples and make clarifying comments.
