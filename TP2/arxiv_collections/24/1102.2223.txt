Quadratic permutation polynomial interleavers over integer rings have
recently received attention in practical turbo coding systems from deep space
applications to mobile communications. In this correspondence, a necessary and
sufficient condition that determines the least degree inverse of a quadratic
permutation polynomial is proven. Moreover, an algorithm is provided to
explicitly compute the inverse polynomials.
