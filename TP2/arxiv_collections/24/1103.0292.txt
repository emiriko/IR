The messengers of Gauge-Mediation Models can couple to standard-model matter
fields through renormalizable superpotential couplings. These matter-messenger
couplings generate generation-dependent sfermion masses and are therefore
usually forbidden by discrete symmetries. However, the non-trivial structure of
the standard-model Yukawa couplings hints at some underlying flavor theory,
which would necessarily control the sizes of the matter-messenger couplings as
well. Thus for example, if the doublet messenger and the Higgs have the same
properties under the flavor theory, the resulting messenger-lepton couplings
are parametrically of the same order as the lepton Yukawas, so that slepton
mass-splittings are similar to those of minimally-flavor-violating models and
therefore satisfy bounds on flavor-violation, with, however, slepton mixings
that are potentially large. Assuming that fermion masses are explained by a
flavor symmetry, we construct viable and natural models with messenger-lepton
couplings controlled by the flavor symmetry. The resulting slepton spectra are
unusual and interesting, with slepton mass-splittings and mixings that may be
probed at the LHC. In particular, since the new contributions are typically
negative, and since they are often larger for the first- and second-generation
sleptons, some of these examples have the selectron or the smuon as the
lightest slepton, with mass splittings of a few to tens of GeV.
