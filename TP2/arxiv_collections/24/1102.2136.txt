This paper is a continuation of \cite{Lu1}. In Part I, applying the new
splitting theorems developed therein we generalize previous some results on
computations of critical groups and some critical point theorems to weaker
versions. In Part II (in progress), they are used to study multiple solutions
for nonlinear higher order elliptic equations described in the introduction of
\cite{Lu1}.
