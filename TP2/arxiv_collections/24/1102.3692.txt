We have studied the nonlinear structure formation of the environmentally
dependent dilaton model using $N$-body simulations. We find that the mechanism
of suppressing the scalar fifth force in high-density regions works very well.
Within the parameter space allowed by the solar system tests, the dilaton model
predicts small deviations of the matter power spectrum and the mass function
from their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts. The importance of taking full account of
the nonlinearity of the model is also emphasized.
