We show numerically that a finite isolated cluster of interacting spins 1/2
exhibits a surprising non-thermal statistics when subjected to a series of
small non-adiabatic perturbations by external magnetic field. The resulting
occupations of energy eigenstates are significantly higher than the thermal
ones on both the low and the high ends of the energy spectra. This behavior
semi-quantitatively agrees with the statistics predicted for the so-called
"quantum micro-canonical" (QMC) ensemble, which includes all possible quantum
superpositions with a given energy expectation value. Our findings also
indicate that the eigenstates of the perturbation operators are generically
localized in the energy basis of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. This kind of
localization possibly protects the thermal behavior in the macroscopic limit.
