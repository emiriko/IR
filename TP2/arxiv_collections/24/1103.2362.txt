We present distinctive signatures of flipped F-Theory models with TeV-scale
vector-like particles, a \sqrt{s} = 7 TeV 1 fb^{-1} test at LHC of a class of
models well-motivated from string theory. The characteristic feature is a light
stop and gluino, both sparticles lighter than all other squarks. This unique
aspect of the supersymmetry spectrum generates an ultra-high multiplicity of
hadronic jets. We find the optimal signal to background ratio is realized for 9
or more jets. Exclusion of the essential cuts presented here could leave the
ultra-high jet signal severely attenuated and concealed.
