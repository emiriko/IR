Many discussion about the black hole conundrums, such as singularity and
information loss, suggested that there must be some essential irreconcilable
conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity theory, which cannot be
solved with any semiclassical quantized model of gravity, the only feasible way
must be some complete unified quantum theory of gravity.
  In \cite{Vachaspati2007a}, the arguments indicate the possibility of an
alternate outcome of gravitational collapse which avoids the information loss
problem. In this paper, also with semiclassical analysis, it shows that so long
as the mechanism of black hole evaporation satisfies a quite loose condition
that the evaporation lifespan is finite for external observers, regardless of
the detailed mechanism and process of evaporation, the conundrums above can be
naturally avoided. This condition can be satisfied with Hawking-Unruh
mechanism. Thus, the conflict between quantum theory and classical gravity
theory may be not as serious as it seemed to be, the effectiveness of
semiclassical methods might be underestimated.
  An exact universal solution with spherical symmetry of Einstein field
equation has been derived in this paper. All possible solutions with spherical
symmetry of Einstein field equation are its special cases.
  In addition, some problems of the Penrose diagram of an evaporating black
hole first introduced by Hawking in 1975 \cite{Hawking1975} are clarified.
