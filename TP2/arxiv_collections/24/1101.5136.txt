I rederive the Kerr/CFT correspondence without first taking the near-horizon
extremal Kerr limit. This method extends easily to nonextremal black holes, for
which the temperature and central charge behave poorly at the horizon but the
entropy remains finite. A computation yields one-half of the standard
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, with hints that the other half may be related to a
conformal field theory at the inner horizon. I then present an alternative
approach, based on a stretched Killing horizon, in which the full entropy is
obtained and the temperature and central charge remain well-behaved even in the
nonextremal case.
