We report on the low-frequency current fluctuations and electronic noise in
thin-films made of bismuth selenide topological insulators. The films were
prepared via the graphene-like mechanical exfoliation and used as the current
conducting channels in the four- and two-contact devices. Analysis of the
resistance dependence on the film thickness indicates that the surface
contribution to conductance is dominant in our samples. It was established that
the current fluctuations have the noise spectrum close to the pure 1/f in the
frequency range from 1 to 10 kHz (f is the frequency). The relative noise
amplitude S/I^2 for the examined films was increasing from ~5x10^-8 to 5x10^-6
(1/Hz) as the resistance of the channels varied from ~10^3 to 10^5 Ohms. The
obtained noise data is important for understanding electron transport through
the surface and volume of topological insulators, and proposed applications of
this class of materials.
