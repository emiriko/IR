We present early results from the ongoing Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal
GAlaxieS (HALOGAS) Survey, which is being performed with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). The HALOGAS Survey aims to detect and
characterize the cold gas accretion process in nearby spirals, through
sensitive observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm line emission. In this
contribution, we present an overview of ongoing analyses of several HALOGAS
targets.
