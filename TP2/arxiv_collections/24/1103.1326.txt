Recent experiments on thin-film microcavities give evidence of Bose
condensation of exciton-polariton states. Inspired by these observations, we
consider the possibility that such exotic "half-light/half matter" states could
be observed in thin-film organic semiconductors where the oscillator strength
is generally stronger than in inorganic systems. Here we present a theoretical
model and simulations of macroscopic exciton-polartiton condensates in thracene
thin films sandwiched within a micro-meter scale resonant cavity and establish
criteria for the conditions under which BEC could be achieved in these systems.
We consider the effect of lattice disorder on the threshold intensities
necessary to create polartion superfluid states and conclude that even allowing
for up to 5% angular disorder of the molecules within the crystal lattice, the
superfluid transition remains sharp.
