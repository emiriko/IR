This paper addresses the distributed attitude synchronization problem of
multiple spacecraft with unknown inertia matrices. Two distributed adaptive
controllers are proposed for the cases with and without a virtual leader to
which a time-varying reference attitude is assigned. The first controller
achieves attitude synchronization for a group of spacecraft with a leaderless
communication topology having a directed spanning tree. The second controller
guarantees that all spacecraft track the reference attitude if the virtual
leader has a directed path to all other spacecraft. Simulation examples are
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.
