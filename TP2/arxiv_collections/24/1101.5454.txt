We present experimental, numerical and analytical results for the study of
near-field interaction of twisted split-ring resonators, the basic elements of
the so-called stereometamaterials. In contrast to previous results, we observe
a crossing point in the dispersion curves where the symmetric and antisymmetric
modes become degenerate. We introduce a model to describe the interplay between
magnetic and electric near-field interactions and demonstrate how this model
describes the crossing of the dispersion curves, initially considering lossless
identical resonators. Finally, we apply the theory of Morse critical points to
demonstrate the competition between losses and fabrication errors in
determining whether or not symmetric and antisymmetric modes cross.
