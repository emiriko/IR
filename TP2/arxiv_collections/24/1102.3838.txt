Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) for visualizing objects at atomic
resolution has been realized as a promising tool for imaging single molecules.
Drawbacks of CDI are associated with the difficulty of the numerical phase
retrieval from experimental diffraction patterns; a fact which stimulated
search for better numerical methods and alternative experimental techniques.
Common phase retrieval methods are based on iterative procedures which
propagate the complex-valued wave between object and detector plane.
Constraints in both, the object and the detector plane are applied. While the
constraint in the detector plane employed in most phase retrieval methods
requires the amplitude of the complex wave to be equal to the squared root of
the measured intensity, we propose a novel Fourier-domain constraint, based on
an analogy to holography. Our method allows achieving a low-resolution
reconstruction already in the first step followed by a high-resolution
reconstruction after further steps. In comparison to conventional schemes this
Fourier-domain constraint results in a fast and reliable convergence of the
iterative reconstruction process.
