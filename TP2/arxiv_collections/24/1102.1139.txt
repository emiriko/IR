When $L$ is a complete lattice, the collection $\Mon_L$ of all monotone
functions $L^p \to L^n$, $n,p \geq 0$, forms a Lawvere theory. We enrich this
Lawvere theory with the binary supremum operation $\vee$, an operation of
(left) residuation $\res$ and the parameterized least fixed point operation
$^\dagger$. We exhibit a system of \emph{equational} axioms which is sound and
proves all valid equations of the theories $\Mon_L$ involving only the theory
operations, $\vee$ and $^\dagger$, i.e., all valid equations not involving
residuation. We also present an alternative axiomatization, where $^\dagger$ is
replaced by a star operation, and provide an application to regular tree
languages.
