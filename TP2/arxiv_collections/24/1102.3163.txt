The LHC has successfully run for a long period at half energy, 7 TeV. In this
note, we update earlier full-energy Large Hadron Collider (LHC) forward
hadronic scattering predictions \cite{physicsreports}, giving new predictions,
including errors, for the $pp$ total and inelastic cross sections, the
$\rho$-value, the nuclear slope parameter $B$, $d\sigma_{\rm el}/dt$, and the
large gap survival probability at the current 7 TeV energy.
