3D non-abelian anyons have been theoretically proposed to exist in
heterostructures composed of type II superconductors and topological
insulators. We use realistic material parameters for a device derived from
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ to quantitatively predict the temperature and magnetic field
regimes where an experiment might detect the presence of these exotic states by
means of a cooling effect. Within the appropriate parameter regime, an
adiabatic increase of the magnetic field will result in a decrease of system
temperature when anyons are present. If anyons are not present, the same
experiment would result in heating.
