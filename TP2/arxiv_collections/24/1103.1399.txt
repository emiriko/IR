In this paper we present a simulation environment enhanced with parallel
processing which can be used on personal computers, based on a high-level user
interface developed on Mathematica\copyright which is connected to C++ code in
order to make our platform capable of communicating with a Graphics Processing
Unit. We introduce the reader to the behavior of our proposal by simulating a
quantum adiabatic algorithm designed for solving hard instances of the 3-SAT
problem. We show that our simulator is capable of significantly increasing the
number of qubits that can be simulated using classical hardware. Finally, we
present a review of currently available classical simulators of quantum systems
together with some justifications, based on our willingness to further
understand processing properties of Nature, for devoting resources to building
more powerful simulators.
