The forward-backward asymmetry in top pair production at Tevatron has been
reconfirmed by the CDF collaboration with 5.3 fb^{-1} of accumulated data.
These measurements also report that the asymmetry is the largest in regions of
high invariant mass M_{t\bar{t}} and rapidity difference |\Delta Y|. We
consider light colored sextet scalars appearing in a particular
non-supersymmetric \10 grand unification model within the \bar{126} scalar
representation. These scalar states have masses in the range of 300
\text{GeV}-2 \text{TeV} consistent with the requirements of gauge coupling
unification and bounds on the proton lifetime. The cross section and the total
asymmetry can be simultaneously explained with the contributions of these
scalars within 1$\sigma$. We find that the simultaneous fitting of the cross
section, the total asymmetry and the asymmetries in different rapidity and
M_{t\bar{t}} bins gives only a marginal improvement over the SM contribution.
We also study various production mechanisms of these colored sextet scalars at
the LHC.
