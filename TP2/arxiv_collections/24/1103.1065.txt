We consider perfect-information reachability stochastic games for 2 players
on infinite graphs. We identify a subclass of such games, and prove two
interesting properties of it: first, Player Max always has optimal strategies
in games from this subclass, and second, these games are strongly determined.
The subclass is defined by the property that the set of all values can only
have one accumulation point -- 0. Our results nicely mirror recent results for
finitely-branching games, where, on the contrary, Player Min always has optimal
strategies. However, our proof methods are substantially different, because the
roles of the players are not symmetric. We also do not restrict the branching
of the games. Finally, we apply our results in the context of recently studied
One-Counter stochastic games.
