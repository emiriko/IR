We study Nijenhuis structures on Courant algebroids in terms of the canonical
Poisson bracket on their symplectic realizations. We prove that the Nijenhuis
torsion of a skew-symmetric endomorphism N of a Courant algebroid is
skew-symmetric if the square of N is proportional to the identity, and only in
this case when the Courant algebroid is irreducible. We derive a necessary and
sufficient condition for a skew-symmetric endomorphism to give rise to a
deformed Courant structure. In the case of the double of a Lie bialgebroid
(A,A*), given an endomorphism n of A that defines a skew-symmetric endomorphism
N of the double of A, we prove that the torsion of N is the sum of the torsion
of n and that of the transpose of n.
