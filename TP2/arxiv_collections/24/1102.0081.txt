We determine the sensitivity of a modern Michelson-Morley resonant-cavity
experiment to the higher-order nonbirefringent and nondispersive coefficients
of the Lorentz-violating Standard-Model Extension. Data from a recent year-long
run of the experiment is used to place the first bounds on these coefficients.
