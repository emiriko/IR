Coherent light-matter interactions have recently extended their applications
to the ultrafast control of magnetization in solids. An important but
unrealized technique is the manipulation of magnetization vector motion to make
it follow an arbitrarily designed multi-dimensional trajectory. Furthermore,
for its realization, the phase and amplitude of degenerate modes need to be
steered independently. A promising method is to employ Raman-type nonlinear
optical processes induced by femtosecond laser pulses, where magnetic
oscillations are induced impulsively with a controlled initial phase and an
azimuthal angle that follows well defined selection rules determined by the
materials' symmetries. Here, we emphasize the fact that temporal variation of
the polarization angle of the laser pulses enables us to distinguish between
the two degenerate modes. A full manipulation of two-dimensional magnetic
oscillations is demonstrated in antiferromagnetic NiO by employing a pair of
polarization-twisted optical pulses. These results have lead to a new concept
of vectorial control of magnetization by light.
