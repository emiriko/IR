The LHCb experiment has the potential, during the 2010-11 run, to observe the
rare decay $B^0_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ or improve significantly its exclusion limits.
This study will provide very sensitive probes of New Physics (NP) effects. High
sensitivity to NP contributions is also achieved by measuring photon
polarization by performing a time dependent analysis of $B^0_s \to \phi\gamma$,
and by an angular study of the decay $B^0_d \to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$. Preparations
for these analyses are presented and studies shown of how existing data, for
example prompt $J/\psi$ events, can be used to validate the analysis strategy.
