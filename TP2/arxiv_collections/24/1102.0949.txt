We consider an equation modeling the evolution of a viscous liquid thin film
wetting a horizontal solid substrate destabilized by an electric field normal
to the substrate. The effects of the electric field are modeled by a lower
order non-local term. We introduce the good functional analysis framework to
study this equation on a bounded domain and prove the existence of weak
solutions defined globally in time for general initial data (with finite
energy).
