A polycrystalline sample of YNiGe3, being a non-magnetic isostructural
counterpart to the unconventional pressure-induced superconductor CeNiGe3, was
studied by means of specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements at
temperatures down to 360 mK and in magnetic fields up to 500 Oe. The compound
was found to exhibit an ambient-pressure superconductivity below Tc = 0.46 K.
The superconducting state in YNiGe3 is destroyed by magnetic field of the order
of 500 Oe.
