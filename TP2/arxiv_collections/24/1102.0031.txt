We introduce and study the class of groups graded by root systems. We prove
that if {\Phi} is an irreducible classical root system of rank at least 2 and G
is a group graded by {\Phi}, then under certain natural conditions on the
grading, the union of the root subgroups is a Kazhdan subset of G. As the main
application of this theorem we prove that for any reduced irreducible classical
root system {\Phi} of rank at least 2 and a finitely generated commutative ring
R with 1, the Steinberg group St_{\Phi}(R) and the elementary Chevalley group
E_{\Phi}(R) have property (T). We also show that there exists a group with
property (T) which maps onto all finite simple groups of Lie type and rank at
least 2, thereby providing a "unified" proof of expansion in these groups.
