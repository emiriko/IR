The central star of the planetary nebula (CSPN) M 2-29 shows an extraordinary
R Coronae Borealis-like fading event in its optical lightcurve. The only other
CSPN to show these events are CPD-568032 (Hen 3-1333) and V651 Mon (NGC 2346).
Dust cloud formation in the line of sight appears responsible but the exact
triggering mechanism is not well understood. Understanding how planetary
nebulae (PNe) trigger dust obscuration events may help understand the same
process in a wide range of objects including Population-I WC9 stars, symbiotic
stars and perhaps Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with long secondary
periods (LSPs). A binary scenario involving an eccentric, wide companion that
triggers dust formation via interaction at periastron is a potential
explanation that has been suggested for LSP variables. Model fits to the
lightcurves of CPD-568032 and M 2-29 show the dust forms in excess of 70 AU at
the inner edge of a dust disk. In the case of CPD-568032 this radius is far too
large to coincide with a binary companion trigger, although a binary may have
been responsible for the formation of the dust disk. We find no direct evidence
to support previous claims of binarity in M 2-29 either from the OGLE
lightcurve or deep medium-resolution VLT FLAMES spectroscopy of the CSPN. We
classify the CSPN as Of(H) with T_eff=50+-10 kK and log g=4.0+-0.3. We find a
mean distance of 7.4+-1.8 kpc to M 2-29 at which the M_V=-0.9 mag CSPN could
potentially hide a subgiant luminosity or fainter companion. A companion would
help explain the multiple similarities with D'-type symbiotic stars whose outer
nebulae are thought to be bona-fide PNe. The 7.4 kpc distance, oxygen abundance
of 8.3 dex and Galactic coordinates (l=4.0, b=-3.0) prove that M 2-29 is a
Galactic Bulge PN and not a Halo PN as commonly misconceived.
