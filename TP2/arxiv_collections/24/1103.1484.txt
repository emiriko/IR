A discrete-time version of the replicator equation for two-strategy games is
studied. The stationary properties differ from that of continuous time for
sufficiently large values of the parameters, where periodic and chaotic
behavior replace the usual fixed-point population solutions. We observe the
familiar period-doubling and chaotic-band-splitting attractor cascades of
unimodal maps but in some cases more elaborate variations appear due to
bimodality. Also unphysical stationary solutions have unusual physical
implications, such as uncertainty of final population caused by sensitivity to
initial conditions and fractality of attractor preimage manifolds.
