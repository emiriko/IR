We study the stability of static spherically symmetric charged black holes
under tensor type perturbations in Lovelock theory which is a natural higher
dimensional generalization of Einstein theory. We derive the master equation
for tensor type perturbations and present the criterions for the stability.
Examining these criterions numerically, we show that a black hole with small
charge has the instability if its mass is as small as extreme mass. Combined
with our previous result that neutral black hole has no dynamical instability
in odd dimensions, this result suggests that charges have fatal effects on
black holes in Lovelock theory.
