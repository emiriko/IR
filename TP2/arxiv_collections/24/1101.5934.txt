We use inelastic neutron scattering with spin polarization analysis to study
the magnetic excitations in the normal and superconducting states of
YBa2Cu3O6.9. Polarization analysis allows us to determine the spin polarization
of the magnetic excitations and to separate them from phonon scattering. In the
normal state, we find unambiguous evidence of magnetic excitations over the
10-60meV range of the experiment with little polarization dependence to the
excitations. In the superconducting state, the magnetic response is enhanced
near the "resonance energy" and above. At lower energies, 10<E<30meV, the local
susceptibility becomes anisotropic, with the excitations polarized along the
c-axis being suppressed. We find evidence for a new diffuse anisotropic
response polarized perpendicular to the c-axis which may carry significant
spectral weight.
