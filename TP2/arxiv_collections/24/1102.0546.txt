Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) and electromagnetically-induced transparency
(EIT) both yield transparency in an absorption profile, but only EIT yields
strong transparency for a weak pump field due to Fano interference. Empirically
discriminating EIT from ATS is important but so far has been subjective. We
introduce an objective method, based on Akaike's information criterion, to test
ATS vs. EIT from experimental data and determine which pertains. We apply our
method to a recently reported induced-transparency experiment in
superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics.
