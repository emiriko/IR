A poset is {\it $(\3+\1)$-free} if it contains no induced subposet isomorphic
to the disjoint union of a 3-element chain and a 1-element chain. These posets
are of interest because of their connection with interval orders and their
appearance in the $(\3+\1)$-free Conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge. The
dimension 2 posets $P$ are exactly the ones which have an associated
permutation $\pi$ where $i\prec j$ in $P$ if and only if $i<j$ as integers and
$i$ comes before $j$ in the one-line notation of $\pi$. So we say that a
permutation $\pi$ is {\it $(\3+\1)$-free} or {\it $(\3+\1)$-avoiding} if its
poset is $(\3+\1)$-free. This is equivalent to $\pi$ avoiding the permutations
2341 and 4123 in the language of pattern avoidance. We give a complete
structural characterization of such permutations. This permits us to find their
generating function.
