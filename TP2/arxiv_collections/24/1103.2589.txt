We study deformed supersymmetries in N=2 super Yang-Mills theory in the
Omega-backgrounds characterized by two complex parameters $\epsilon_1,
\epsilon_2$. When one of the $\epsilon$-parameters vanishes, the theory has
extended supersymmetries. We compute the central charge of the algebra and
obtain the deformed BPS monopole equation. We examine supersymmetries preserved
by the equation.
