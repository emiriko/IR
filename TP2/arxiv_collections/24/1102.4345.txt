We have obtained the first time-resolved, disc-integrated observations of
Earth's poles with the Deep Impact spacecraft as part of the EPOXI Mission of
Opportunity. These data mimic what we will see when we point next-generation
space telescopes at nearby exoplanets. We use principal component analysis
(PCA) and rotational lightcurve inversion to characterize color inhomogeneities
and map their spatial distribution from these unusual vantage points, as a
complement to the equatorial views presented in Cowan et al. (2009). We also
perform the same PCA on a suite of simulated rotational multi-band lightcurves
from NASA's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3D spectral Earth model. This
numerical experiment allows us to understand what sorts of surface features PCA
can robustly identify. We find that the EPOXI polar observations have similar
broadband colors as the equatorial Earth, but with 20-30% greater apparent
albedo. This is because the polar observations are most sensitive to
mid-latitudes, which tend to be more cloudy than the equatorial latitudes
emphasized by the original EPOXI Earth observations. The cloudiness of the
mid-latitudes also manifests itself in the form of increased variability at
short wavelengths in the polar observations, and as a dominant gray eigencolor
in the south polar observation. We construct a simple reflectance model for a
snowball Earth. By construction, our model has a higher Bond albedo than the
modern Earth; its surface albedo is so high that Rayleigh scattering does not
noticeably affect its spectrum. The rotational color variations occur at short
wavelengths due to the large contrast between glacier ice and bare land in
those wavebands. Thus we find that both the broadband colors and diurnal color
variations of such a planet would be easily distinguishable from the modern-day
Earth, regardless of viewing angle.
