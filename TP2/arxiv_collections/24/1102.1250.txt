In this paper we present a mathematical model to describe the phenomenon of
phase separation, which is modelled as space regions where an order parameter
changes smoothly. The model proposed, including thermal and mixing effects, is
deduced for an incompressible fluid, so the resulting differential system
couples a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation with the Navier-Stokes equation.
Its consistency with the second law of thermodynamics in the classical
Clausius-Duhem form is finally proved.
