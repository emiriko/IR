Anisotropic materials with different signs of components of the permittivity
tensor are called indefinite materials. Known realizations of indefinite media
suffer of high absorption losses. We show that periodic arrays of parallel
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can behave as a low-loss indefinite medium in the
infrared range. We show that a finite-thickness slab of CNTs supports the
propagation of backward waves with small attenuation in an ultra-broad
frequency band. In prospective, CNT arrays can be used for subwavelength
focusing and detection, enhancing the radiation efficiency of small sources.
