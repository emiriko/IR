On the level of phenomenology unification-type idea of a basic connection
between dimensionless mass and charge quantities requires particle mass copies
and therefore is interesting as raison d'etre for particle flavor (degree of
freedom). Particle mass ratios and mixing angles expressed in terms of related
to the fine structure constant e-parameter are particular examples of
mass-matrix -- charge unification. In this paper small violations of
quark-lepton-complementarity (QLC) come from an accurate system of three quark
mixing angles in terms of the e-parameter. Two patterns of small
QLC-violations, 'combined' and 'universal', are considered. The first pattern
predicts solar mixing angle {\theta}sol= 34.04o as ~7% violation of QLC, and
atmospheric mixing angle {\theta}atm= 42.64o that is in agreement with QLC. The
'universal' pattern predicts the same magnitude of solar angle, while the
atmospheric one violates QLC by ~1%, {\theta}atm= 43.0o. Quantitative tests of
both QLC-violation patterns and choice between them can be made at accurate
neutrino oscillation experiments.
