The geodesics of massless particles produced in collisions near a rotating
black hole are solved numerically and a Monte Carlo integration of the momentum
distribution of the massless particles is performed to calculate the fraction
that escape the black hole to infinity. A distribution of in falling dark
matter particles, which are assumed to annihilate to massless particles, is
considered and an estimate of the emergent flux from the collisions is made.
The energy spectrum of the emergent particles is found to contain two Lorentz
shifted peaks centred on the mass of the dark matter. The separation of the
peaks is found to depend on the density profile of the dark matter and could
provide information about the size of the annihilation plateau around a black
hole and the mass of the dark matter particle.
