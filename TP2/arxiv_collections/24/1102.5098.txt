The existence of bright quasars at high redshifts implies that supermassive
black holes were able to form in the early Universe. Though a number of
mechanisms to achieve this have been proposed, none yet stands out. A recent
suggestion is the formation of quasi-stars, initially stellar-mass black holes
accreting from hydrostatic giant-like envelopes of gas, formed from the
monolithic collapse of pre-galactic gas clouds. In this work, we modify the
Cambridge STARS stellar evolution package to construct detailed models of the
evolution of these objects. We find that, in all of our models, the black hole
inside the envelope is able to reach slightly more than one-tenth of the total
mass of the system before hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down. This breakdown
occurs after a few million years of evolution. We show that the mechanism which
causes the hydrostatic evolution to end is present in polytropic models. We
also show that the solutions are highly sensitive to the size of the inner
boundary radius and that no physical solutions exist if the inner boundary is
chosen to be less than about 0.3 of the Bondi radius.
