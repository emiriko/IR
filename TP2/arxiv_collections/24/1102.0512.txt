More than 450 exoplanets have currently been detected, most of them by the
radial velocity (RV) technique. While the majority of exoplanets have been
found around main-sequence (MS) FGK stars (M 1.5M*), only a small fraction (-
10%) have been discovered orbiting post- MS stars. However, such stars are
known to host exoplanets and the detection fraction appears to be larger than
for solar-type dwarfs. To date - 30 planets have been found orbiting giant
stars which have revealed interesting properties that contrast with the results
found for solar-type stars. We are carrying out a RV search for planets around
giant stars in the southern hemisphere in order to study different formation
scenarios for planets around intermediate-mass stars and the effect of the
post-MS evolution of the host stars on the orbits of close-in planets (a 0.6
AU).
