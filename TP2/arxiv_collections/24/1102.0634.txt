Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, evolving from the cerebral
supportive cells. For clinical follow-up, the evaluation of the preoperative
tumor volume is essential. Volumetric assessment of tumor volume with manual
segmentation of its outlines is a time-consuming process that can be overcome
with the help of computer-assisted segmentation methods. In this paper, a
semi-automatic approach for World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioma
segmentation is introduced that uses balloon inflation forces, and relies on
the detection of high-intensity tumor boundaries that are coupled by using
contrast agent gadolinium. The presented method is evaluated on 27 magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data sets and the ground truth data of the tumor
boundaries - for evaluation of the results - are manually extracted by
neurosurgeons.
