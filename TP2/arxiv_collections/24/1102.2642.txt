Graphene has demonstrated great promise for future electronics technology as
well as fundamental physics applications because of its linear energy-momentum
dispersion relations which cross at the Dirac point. However, accessing the
physics of the low density region at the Dirac point has been difficult because
of the presence of disorder which leaves the graphene with local microscopic
electron and hole puddles, resulting in a finite density of carriers even at
the charge neutrality point. Efforts have been made to reduce the disorder by
suspending graphene, leading to fabrication challenges and delicate devices
which make local spectroscopic measurements difficult. Recently, it has been
shown that placing graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) yields improved
device performance. In this letter, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to
show that graphene conforms to hBN, as evidenced by the presence of Moire
patterns in the topographic images. However, contrary to recent predictions,
this conformation does not lead to a sizable band gap due to the misalignment
of the lattices. Moreover, local spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the
electron-hole charge fluctuations are reduced by two orders of magnitude as
compared to those on silicon oxide. This leads to charge fluctuations which are
as small as in suspended graphene, opening up Dirac point physics to more
diverse experiments than are possible on freestanding devices.
