In this work we analyze the dynamical behavior of the collision between two
clouds of fermionic atoms with opposite spin polarization. By means of the
time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) numerical method, we simulate the
collision of two one-dimensional clouds in a lattice. There is a symmetry in
the collision behaviour between the attractive and repulsive interactions. We
analyze the pair formation dynamics in the collision region, providing a
quantitative analysis of the pair formation mechanism in terms of a simple
two-site model.
