Understanding the microscopic processes affecting the bulk thermal
conductivity is crucial to develop more efficient thermoelectric materials.
PbTe is currently one of the leading thermoelectric materials, largely thanks
to its low thermal conductivity. However, the origin of this low thermal
conductivity in a simple rocksalt structure has so far been elusive. Using a
combination of inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles
computations of the phonons, we identify a strong anharmonic coupling between
the ferroelectric transverse optic (TO) mode and the longitudinal acoustic (LA)
modes in PbTe. This interaction extends over a large portion of reciprocal
space, and directly affects the heat-carrying LA phonons. The LA-TO anharmonic
coupling is likely to play a central role in explaining the low thermal
conductivity of PbTe. The present results provide a microscopic picture of why
many good thermoelectric materials are found near a lattice instability of the
ferroelectric type.
