With the growing number of the elderly, we see a greater demand for home
care, and the vision of pervasive computing is also floating into the domain of
the household that aims to build a smart home which can assist inhabitants
(users) to live more conveniently and harmoniously. Such health-care pervasive
applications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in
diverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The
core challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess
occurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according
to the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive
computing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right
information and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a
context-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most
important component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level
description of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the
model multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.
Based on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach
using CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task
recognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.
Moreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is
also discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task
supporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle
and environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results
of the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good
efficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity
inference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.
