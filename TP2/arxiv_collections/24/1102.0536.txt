Non-extensive thermodynamics was criticized among others by stating that the
Zeroth Law cannot be satisfied with non-additive composition rules. In this
paper we determine the general functional form of those non-additive
composition rules which are compatible with the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics.
We find that this general form is additive for the formal logarithms of the
original quantities and the familiar relations of thermodynamics apply to
these. Our result offers a possible solution to the longstanding problem about
equilibrium between extensive and non-extensive systems or systems with
different non-extensivity parameters.
