At the beginning of academic year 2007-08, staff in the School of Physics &
Astronomy at the University of Glasgow started to implement a number of
substantial changes to the first year physics class. The main aims were to
improve the academic performance and progression statistics for the class, with
early identification of "at-risk" students being one priority. The introduction
of novel electronic and computer-based data processing strategies ensured both
a quick turnaround time in processing student records and also a much-improved
confidence in the accuracy of assessment feedback returned to students. These
techniques were a contributory factor in helping raise the pass-rate by ~10%
and the direct progression rate by ~13% by the end of 2008-09. The
effectiveness of these processes have proved adequate for coping with the
unexpected and dramatic 50% increase in class size 2009-10 and are now in the
process of being rolled out to other classes within the School
