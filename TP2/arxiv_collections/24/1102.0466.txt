In this paper, we review recent developments in the emerging field of
electron quantum optics, stressing analogies and differences with the usual
case of photon quantum optics. Electron quantum optics aims at preparing,
manipulating and measuring coherent single electron excitations propagating in
ballistic conductors such as the edge channels of a 2DEG in the integer quantum
Hall regime. Because of the Fermi statistics and the presence of strong
interactions, electron quantum optics exhibits new features compared to the
usual case of photon quantum optics. In particular, it provides a natural
playground to understand decoherence and relaxation effects in quantum
transport.
