In this work, we have considered modified Chaplygin gas with variable G and
$\Lambda$. The trivial solution describes decelerating phase to accelerating
phase of the universe. The non-static with constant equation of state describes
the inflationary solution. For static universe, G and $\Lambda$ must be forms
arbitrary and for static universe with constant equation of state G and
$\Lambda$ should be constant.
