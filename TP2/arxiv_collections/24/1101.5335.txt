In this paper, we investigate an opportunistic relaying scheme where the
selected relay assists the source-destination (direct) communication. In our
study, we consider a regenerative opportunistic relaying scheme in which the
direct path can be considered unusable, and takes into account the effect of
the possible erroneously detected and transmitted data at the best relay. We
first derive statistics based on exact probability density function (PDF) of
each hop. Then, the PDFs are used to determine accurate closed form expressions
for end-to-end bit-error rate (BER) of binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)
modulation. Furthermore, we evaluate the asymptotical performance analysis and
the diversity order is deduced. Finally, we validate our analysis by showing
that performance simulation results coincide with our analytical results over
different network architectures.
