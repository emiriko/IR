We present an H-band image of FS Tauri, a 0.2"-separated classical T Tauri
binary system, taken with the Coronagraphic Imager with Adaptive Optics on the
Subaru Telescope. This new image, combined with Hubble Space Telescope /
Advanced Camera for Surveys F606W-band polarimetric images, shows that the
binary has complicated circumbinary features, including a circumbinary disk,
western and eastern arm-like structures, and two cavities at the northeast and
southwest. The circumbinary disk is 630 AU in radius and the southeast side of
the disk is bright in the H-band. The brightness ratio (southeast/northwest) is
1.6. A single Rayleigh-like scattering model indicates that the disk is
inclined by 30 degree to 40 degree and that the southeast side corresponds to
the near side along our line of sight. The H-band surface brightness of the
southeast side decreases as r^(-1.9) from 15.2 mag arcsec^-2 to 16.8 mag
arcsec^-2. The outer portion of the disk is possibly more flared than its inner
portion. The weak centro-symmetric polarization pattern and redder F606W-H
color (4.2 mag) of the southeast side are probably caused by multiple
scattering events from the dust grains associated with the binary. The
F606W-band image shows the bright northwest side of the disk in contrast with
the H-band image. The F606W-H color of the northwest side is between 1.7 mag
and 3.0 mag. We consider that Haro 6-5 B (FS Tauri B), 20" away, produces the
neutral scattered light from the northwest side. This idea is supported by the
polarization pattern of the northwest side, which is centro-symmetric with
respect to Haro 6-5 B. The arms appear to encompass the western and eastern
cavities, suggesting that the arms + cavity systems are created by a bipolar
outflow from the binary. However, the direction of this outflow is inconsistent
with that of outflows inferred from the circumbinary disk model.
