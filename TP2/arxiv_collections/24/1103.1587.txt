This short article presents a class of projection-based solution algorithms
to the problem considered in the pioneering work on compressed sensing -
perfect reconstruction of a phantom image from 22 radial lines in the frequency
domain. Under the framework of projection-based image reconstruction, we will
show experimentally that several old and new tools of nonlinear filtering
(including Perona-Malik diffusion, nonlinear diffusion, Translation-Invariant
thresholding and SA-DCT thresholding) all lead to perfect reconstruction of the
phantom image.
