We suggest a natural mapping between bipartite states and quantum evolutions
of local states, which is a Jamiolkowski map. It is shown that spatial
correlations of weak measurements in bipartite systems precisely coincide with
temporal correlations of local systems. This mapping has several practical and
conceptual implications on the correspondence between Bell and Leggett-Garg
inequalities, the statistical properties of evolutions in large systems,
temporal decoherence and computational gain, in evaluation of spatial
correlations of large systems.
