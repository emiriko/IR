Invariant tori are prominent features of symplectic and volume preserving
maps. From the point of view of chaotic transport the most relevant tori are
those that are barriers, and thus have codimension one. For an $n$-dimensional
volume-preserving map, such tori are prevalent when the map is nearly
"integrable," in the sense of having one action and $n-1$ angle variables. As
the map is perturbed, numerical studies show that the originally connected
image of the frequency map acquires gaps due to resonances and domains of
nonconvergence due to chaos. We present examples of a three-dimensional,
generalized standard map for which there is a critical perturbation size,
$\epsilon_c$, above which there are no tori. Numerical investigations to find
the "last invariant torus" reveal some similarities to the behavior found by
Greene near a critical invariant circle for area preserving maps: the crossing
time through the newly destroyed torus appears to have a power law singularity
at $\epsilon_c$, and the local phase space near the critical torus contains
many high-order resonances.
