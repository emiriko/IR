We introduce two types of toroidal metamaterials which are invisible to
surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating on a metal surface. The former is
a toroidal handlebody bridging remote holes on the metal surface: It works as a
kind of plasmonic counterpart of electromagnetic wormholes. The latter is a
toroidal ring lying on the metal surface: This bridges two disconnected metal
surfaces i.e. It connects a thin metal cylinder to a flat metal surface with a
hole. Full-wave numerical simulations demonstrate that an electromagnetic field
propagating inside these metamaterials does not disturb the propagation of SPPs
at the metal surface. A multilayered design of these devices is proposed, based
on effective medium theory for a set of reduced parameters: The former
plasmonic analogue of electromagnetic wormhole requires homogeneous isotropic
magnetic layers, while the latter merely requires dielectric layers.
