It has been suggested that the narrow cores of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission
lines in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are likely produced in the torus, the
inner radius of which can be measured by observing the lag time between the $V$
and $K$ band flux variations. In this paper we compare the virial products of
the infrared time lags and the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ widths for 10 type 1 AGNs
with the black hole masses from other techniques. We find the narrow Fe
K$\alpha$ line width is in average 2.6$^{+0.9}_{-0.4}$ times broader than
expected assuming an isotropic velocity distribution of the torus at the
distance measured by the infrared lags. We propose the thick disk model of the
torus could explain the observed larger line width. Another possibility is the
contamination by emission from the broad line region or the outer accretion
disk. Alternatively, the narrow iron line might originate from the inner most
part of the obscuring torus within the sublimation radius, while the infrared
emission from outer cooler part. We note the correlation between the black hole
masses based on this new technique and those based on other known techniques is
statistically insignificant. We argue that this could be attributed to the
small sample size and the very large uncertainties in the measurements of iron
K line widths. The next generation of X-ray observatories could help verify the
origin of the narrow iron K$\alpha$ line and the reliability of this new
technique.
