We present phase-resolved spectroscopy and extensive survey photometry of the
detached eclipsing binary system XY Cet, which is composed of two
metallic-lined stars. We measure their masses to be 1.773 +/- 0.016 and 1.615
+/- 0.014 Msun and their radii to be 1.873 +/- 0.035 and 1.773 +/- 0.029 Rsun,
resulting in logarithmic surface gravities of 4.142 +/- 0.016 and 4.149 +/-
0.014 (cgs). We determine effective temperatures of 7870 +/- 115 and 7620 +/-
125 K. The projected rotational velocities are 34.4 +/- 0.4 and 34.1 +/- 0.4
km/s, which are close to synchronous. Theoretical models cannot match all of
these properties, but come closest for a solar helium and metal abundance and
an age in the region of 850 Myr. We obtain the individual spectra of the two
stars by the spectral disentangling method, and compare them to synthetic
spectra calculated for the measured effective temperatures and a solar chemical
composition. Both stars show enhanced abundances of iron-group elements and
clear deficiencies of Ca I and Sc II, confirming their classification as Am
stars. We also find strong overabundances of Zr II and the rare-earth species
La II, Ce II and Nd II, a hallmark of chemically peculiar A-stars. XY Cet is a
prime candidate for detailed spectroscopic analyses of metallic-lined stars
whose masses and radii are known to accuracies of 1-2%.
