Individuals often imitate each other to fall into the typical group, leading
to a self-organized state of typical behaviors in a community. In this paper,
we model self-organization in social tagging systems and illustrate the
underlying interaction and dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a model in
which individuals adjust their own tagging tendency to imitate the average
tagging tendency. We found that when users are of low confidence, they tend to
imitate others and lead to a self-organized state with active tagging. On the
other hand, when users are of high confidence and are stubborn for changes,
tagging becomes inactive. We observe a phase transition at a critical level of
user confidence when the system changes from one regime to the other. The
distributions of post length obtained from the model are compared to real data
which show good agreements.
