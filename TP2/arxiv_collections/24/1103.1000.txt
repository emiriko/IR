We study the thermal entanglement and quantum teleportation using quantum dot
as a resource. We first consider entanglement of the resource, and then focus
on the effects of different parameters on the teleportation fidelity under
different conditions. The critical temperature of disentanglement is obtained.
Based on Bell measurements in two subspaces, we find the anisotropy
measurements is optimal to the isotropy arising from the entangled eigenstates
of the system in the anisotropy subspace. In addition, it is shown that the
anisotropy transmission fidelity is very high and stable for quantum dot as
quantum channel when the parameters are adjusted. The possible applications of
quantum dot are expected in the quantum teleportation.
