Ensuring the usefulness of electronic data sources while providing necessary
privacy guarantees is an important unsolved problem. This problem drives the
need for an analytical framework that can quantify the safety of personally
identifiable information (privacy) while still providing a quantifable benefit
(utility) to multiple legitimate information consumers. This paper presents an
information-theoretic framework that promises an analytical model guaranteeing
tight bounds of how much utility is possible for a given level of privacy and
vice-versa. Specific contributions include: i) stochastic data models for both
categorical and numerical data; ii) utility-privacy tradeoff regions and the
encoding (sanization) schemes achieving them for both classes and their
practical relevance; and iii) modeling of prior knowledge at the user and/or
data source and optimal encoding schemes for both cases.
