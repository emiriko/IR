A novel model of discretized energy cascade generated by Benjamin-Feir
instability is presented. Conditions for appearance of direct and inverse
cascades are given explicitly, as well as conditions for stabilization of the
wave system due to cascade termination. These results can be used directly for
explanation of available results of laboratory experiments and as basic
forecast scenarios for planned experiments, depending on the frequency of an
initially excited mode and steepness of its amplitude.
