We have obtained long-slit, infrared spectra of Jupiter with the Anglo
Australian Telescope in the K and H bands at a resolving power of 2260. Using a
line-by-line, radiative transfer model with the latest, improved spectral line
data for methane and ammonia, we derive a model of the zonal characteristics in
the atmosphere of this giant planet. We fit our model to the spectra of the
zones and belts visible at 2.1 {\mu}m using different distributions of cloud
opacities. The modeled spectra for each region match observations remarkably
well at K band and in low pressure regions at the H band. Our results for the
upper deck cloud distribution are consistent with previous models (Banfield et
al.1998) fitted to low resolution, grism spectra. The ability to obtain and
model high resolution planetary spectra in order to search for weakly absorbing
atmospheric constituents can provide better constraints on the chemical
composition of planetary atmospheres.
