The role of long range badly screened Coulomb interactions in a
one-dimensional chain of Josephson junctions is studied. Correlation functions
for the phase correlator are obtained as a function of the Josephson coupling
energy, the short range part of Coulomb repulsion and its long range component.
Though quasi-long range order is no longer possible and the usual
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition no longer exists, there are remnants of it. As
an application, we calculate the $I-V$ curves for Andreev reflexion when a
normal metal is placed in contact with the chain. Formally, there is always an
offset voltage $V_0$ below which no current can flow, however, in some regimes
$V_0$ can be negligible. Contrary to what happens without long-range
interactions, the Andreev current, as a function of applied voltage, increases
faster than any power law. Signatures of long range interactions and phase
slips appear in the $I-V$ curves. Possible application for quasi
one-dimensional thin superconducting wires is outlined.
