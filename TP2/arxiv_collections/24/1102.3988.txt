In this paper we prove Lp multiplier theorems for invariant and non-invariant
operators on compact Lie groups in the spirit of the well-known
Hormander-Mikhlin theorem on Rn and its variants on tori Tn. We also give
applications to a-priori estimates for non-hypoelliptic operators. Already in
the case of tori we get an interesting refinement of the classical multiplier
theorem.
