The microscopic origin of space(-time) geometry is explained on the basis of
an emergence process associated with the condensation of infinite number of
microscopic quanta responsible for symmetry breakdown, which implements the
basic essence of "Quantum-Classical Correpondense" and of the forcing method in
physical and mathematical contexts, respectively. From this viewpoint, the
space(-time) dependence of physical quantities arises from the "logical
extension" OjiOza to change "constant objects" into "variable objects" by
tagging the order parameters associated with the condensation onto "constant
objects"; the logical direction here from a value y to a domain variable x (to
materialize the basic mechanism behind the Gel'fand isomorphism) is just
opposite to that common in the usual definition of a function f:x->f(x) from
its domain variable x to a value y=f(x).
