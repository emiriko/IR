The recent significant progress on both the experimental and theoretical
sides on the study of leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays allows to precisely
test the Standard Model. Here we present results for the determination of Vus
from experimental data, the comparison between the values of Vus obtained from
data on semileptonic and leptonic kaon decays, and tests of lepton universality
in semileptonic kaon decays.
