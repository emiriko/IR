We formulate a precise conjecture about the universal behavior near the
diagonal of the spectral function of the Laplacian of a smooth compact Riemann
manifold. We prove this conjecture when the manifold and the metric are real
analytic, and we also present an alternate proof when the manifold is the round
sphere.
