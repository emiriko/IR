We study Schr\"odinger invariant deformations of the AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 (or
K3) solution of IIB supergravity and find a large class of solutions with
integer and half-integer dynamical exponents. We analyze the supersymmetries
preserved by our solutions and find an infinite number of solutions with four
supersymmetries. We study the solutions holographically and find that the dual
D1-D5 (or F1-NS5) CFT is deformed by irrelevant operators of spin one and two.
