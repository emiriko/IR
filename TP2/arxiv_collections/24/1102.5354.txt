We built an ultra low noise angle sensor by combining a folded optical lever
and a Sagnac interferometer. The instrument has a measured noise floor of 1.3
prad / Hz^(1/2) at 2.4 kHz. We achieve this record angle sensitivity using a
proof-of-concept apparatus with a conservative N=11 bounces in the optical
lever. This technique could be extended to reach sub-picoradian / Hz^(1/2)
sensitivities with an optimized design.
