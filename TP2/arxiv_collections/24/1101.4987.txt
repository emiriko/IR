We study the light CP-even neutral Higgs boson production in association with
an electron and a jet at the possible CERN large hadron-electron collider
within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We investigate the possible
supersymmetric effects on this process and compare our standard model numerical
results with those in previous work. We present the leading-order and QCD
next-to-leading-order corrected total cross sections and the distributions of
the transverse momenta of the final electron, the light neutral Higgs boson,
and jet in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Our results show that the
scale dependence of the leading-order cross section is obviously reduced by the
QCD next-to-leading-order corrections. The K factor of the QCD correction to
the total cross section at the large hadron-electron collider varies from 0.893
to 1.048 when the factorization/renormalization scale $\mu$ goes up from $0.2
m_Z$ to $3.8 m_Z$ in our chosen parameter space.
