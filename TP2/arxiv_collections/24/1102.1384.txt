We show that trial-to-trial variability in sensory detection of a weak visual
stimulus is dramatically diminished when rather than presenting a fixed
stimulus contrast, fluctuations in a subject's judgment are matched by
fluctuations in stimulus contrast. This attenuation of fluctuations does not
involve a change in the subject's psychometric function. The result is
consistent with the interpretation of trial-to-trial variability in this
sensory detection task being a high-level meta-cognitive control process that
explores for something that our brains are so used to: subject-object
relational dynamics.
