We present the first method to handle curvature regularity in region-based
image segmentation and inpainting that is independent of initialization.
  To this end we start from a new formulation of length-based optimization
schemes, based on surface continuation constraints, and discuss the connections
to existing schemes. The formulation is based on a \emph{cell complex} and
considers basic regions and boundary elements. The corresponding optimization
problem is cast as an integer linear program.
  We then show how the method can be extended to include curvature regularity,
again cast as an integer linear program. Here, we are considering pairs of
boundary elements to reflect curvature. Moreover, a constraint set is derived
to ensure that the boundary variables indeed reflect the boundary of the
regions described by the region variables.
  We show that by solving the linear programming relaxation one gets quite
close to the global optimum, and that curvature regularity is indeed much
better suited in the presence of long and thin objects compared to standard
length regularity.
