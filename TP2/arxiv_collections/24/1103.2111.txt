We investigate the influence of deformation on the possible occurrence of
long-lived $K$ isomers in Hf isotopes around N=116, using
configuration-constrained calculations of potential-energy surfaces. Despite
having reduced shape elongation, the multi-quasiparticle states in
$^{186,188}$Hf remain moderately robust against triaxial distortion, supporting
the long expected occurrence of exceptionally long-lived isomers. The
calculations are compared with available experimental data.
