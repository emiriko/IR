A uniformly accelerated charged particle feels the vacuum as thermally
excited and fluctuates around the classical trajectory. Then we may expect
additional radiation besides the Larmor radiation. It is called Unruh
radiation. In this report, we review the calculation of the Unruh radiation
with an emphasis on the interference effect between the vacuum fluctuation and
the radiation from the fluctuating motion. Our calculation is based on a
stochastic treatment of the particle under a uniform acceleration. The basics
of the stochastic equation are reviewed in another report in the same
proceeding. In this report, we mainly discuss the radiation and the
interference effect.
