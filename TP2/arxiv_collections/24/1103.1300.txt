Low-temperature specific heat (SH) is measured on
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals in a wide doping region under
different magnetic fields. For the overdoped sample, we find the clear evidence
for the presence of $T^2$ term in the data, which is absent both for the
underdoped and optimal doped samples, suggesting the presence of line nodes in
the energy gap of the overdoped samples. Moreover, the field induced electron
specific heat coefficient $\Delta\gamma(H)$ increases more quickly with the
field for the overdoped sample than the underdoped and optimal doped ones,
giving another support to our arguments. Our results suggest that the
superconducting gap(s) in the present system may have different structures
strongly depending on the doping regions.
