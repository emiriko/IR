We investigate the recovery of signals exhibiting a sparse representation in
a general (i.e., possibly redundant or incomplete) dictionary that are
corrupted by additive noise admitting a sparse representation in another
general dictionary. This setup covers a wide range of applications, such as
image inpainting, super-resolution, signal separation, and recovery of signals
that are impaired by, e.g., clipping, impulse noise, or narrowband
interference. We present deterministic recovery guarantees based on a novel
uncertainty relation for pairs of general dictionaries and we provide
corresponding practicable recovery algorithms. The recovery guarantees we find
depend on the signal and noise sparsity levels, on the coherence parameters of
the involved dictionaries, and on the amount of prior knowledge about the
signal and noise support sets.
