The properties of gas in the halos of galaxies constrain global models of the
interstellar medium. Kinematical information is of particular interest since it
is a clue to the origin of the gas. Until now mostly massive galaxies have been
investigated for their halo properties. Here we report on deep HI and H{\alpha}
observations of the edge-on dwarf galaxy UGC 1281 in order to determine the
existence of extra-planar gas and the kinematics of this galaxy. This is the
first time a dwarf galaxy is investigated for its gaseous halo characteristics.
We have obtained H{\alpha} integral field spectroscopy using PPAK at Calar Alto
and deep HI observations with the WSRT of this edge-on dwarf galaxy. These
observations are compared to 3D models in order to determine the distribution
of HI in the galaxy. We find that UGC 1281 has H{\alpha} emission up to 25"(655
pc) in projection above the plane and in general a low H{\alpha} flux. Compared
to other dwarf galaxies UGC 1281 is a normal dwarf galaxy with a slowly rising
rotation curve that flattens off at 60 km/s and a central depression in its HI
distribution. Its HI extends 70" (1.8 kpc) in projection from the plane. This
gas can be explained by either a warp partially in the line-of-sight warp or a
purely edge-on warp with rotational velocities that decline with a vertical
gradient of 10.6 \pm 3.7 km/s/kpc. The line-of-sight warp model is the
preferred model as it is conceptually simpler. In either model the warp starts
well within the optical radius.
