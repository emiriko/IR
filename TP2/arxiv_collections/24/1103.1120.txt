We revise the construction of creation/annihilation operators in quantum
mechanics based on the representation theory of the Heisenberg and symplectic
groups. Besides the standard harmonic oscillator (the elliptic case) we
similarly treat the repulsive oscillator (hyperbolic case) and the free
particle (the parabolic case). The respective hypercomplex numbers turn to be
handy on this occasion, this provides a further illustration to Similarity and
Correspondence Principle.
