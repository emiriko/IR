This edition of the Australian Astronomical Observatory Observer contains
articles on the detection of the baryonic acoustic oscillation signal over a
wide range of redshifts by the WiggleZ dark energy survey; results and future
plans for the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey; an update on the HERMES
instrument; a report on the use of the AAT as a testbed for experiments using a
laser frequency comb to achieve ultra-precise calibration of spectrographs; an
innovative project combining professional astronomers and highly professional
'amateurs' to discover and characterise planets orbiting binary stars and
finding out what it's like to be present when the comet you discovered
encounters a spacecraft! The AAO's Distinguished Visitors for 2011 are
introduced and an announcement is made for the upcoming Southern Cross
Conference on 'Supernovae and their Host Galaxies' to be held in Sydney in June
