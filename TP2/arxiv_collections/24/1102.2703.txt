Low temperature magnetization M measurements down to 70~mK have been
performed through the superconducting upper critical field H_c2 of CeCoIn5 with
the field H parallel to the c axis of the tetragonal crystal. The crossing
through the upper critical field H_c2(0) is marked by a sign change in the
temperature dependence of M(T). A Fermi liquid law of the magnetization is
observed in the superconducting phase while in the paramagnetic state above
H_c2 a quasi-linear temperature dependence is obeyed. The specific heat below
H_c2 is therefor dominated by the increase of \gamma (H), the linear term of
the specific heat, and is marked by a singularity at H_{c2} (0). No indication
of the so called Q-phase was observed below H_c2 (in contrast to the case with
H applied in the basal plane).
