We work out the graph limit theory for dense interval graphs. The theory
developed departs from the usual description of a graph limit as a symmetric
function $W(x,y)$ on the unit square, with $x$ and $y$ uniform on the interval
$(0,1)$. Instead, we fix a $W$ and change the underlying distribution of the
coordinates $x$ and $y$. We find choices such that our limits are continuous.
Connections to random interval graphs are given, including some examples. We
also show a continuity result for the chromatic number and clique number of
interval graphs. Some results on uniqueness of the limit description are given
for general graph limits.
