We observe and analyze d-wave resonant scattering of bosons in tightly
confining harmonic waveguides. It is shown that the d-wave resonance emerges in
the quasi-1D regime as an imprint of a 3D d-wave shape resonance. A scaling
relation for the position of the d-wave resonance is provided. By changing the
trap frequency, ultracold scattering can be continuously tuned from s-wave to
d-wave resonant behavior. The effect can be utilized for the realization of
ultracold atomic gases interacting via higher partial waves and opens a novel
possibility for studying strongly correlated atomic systems beyond s-wave
physics.
