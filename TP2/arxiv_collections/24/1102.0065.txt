A signature independent formalism is created and utilized to determine the
general second-order symmetry operators for Dirac's equation on two-dimensional
Lorentzian spin manifolds. The formalism is used to characterize the
orthonormal frames and metrics that permit the solution of Dirac's equation by
separation of variables in the case where a second-order symmetry operator
underlies the separation. Separation of variables in complex variables on
two-dimensional Minkowski space is also considered.
