A procedure to obtain the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of a quantum
spiked oscillator is presented. The originality of the method lies in an
adequate use of asymptotic expansions of Wronskians of algebraic solutions of
the Schroedinger equation. The procedure is applied to three familiar examples
of spiked oscillators.
