An electrostatic quantum dot cannot be formed in monolayer graphene, because
of the Klein tunnelling. However, a dot can be formed with the help of a
uniform magnetic field. As shown here, a spatial modulation of the Dirac gap
leads to confined states with discrete energy levels, thus defining a dot,
without applying external electric and magnetic fields. Gap-induced dot states
can coexist and couple with states introduced by an electrostatic potential.
This property allows the region in which the resulting states are localized to
be tuned with the potential.
