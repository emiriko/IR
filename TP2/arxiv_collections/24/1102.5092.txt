We report the discovery of a unique $z=6.027$ galaxy, multiply imaged by the
cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope ACS and WFC3
imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations. This galaxy was selected as a
pair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by the
measurement of a strong Lyman-alpha line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS.
Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination by
line emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong Balmer
break of 1.5 magnitudes. Taking into account the magnification factor of
11.4+/-1.9 (2.65+/-0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed AB magnitude
for the source is 27.2+/-0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy,
and 25.7+/-0.08 at 3.6 um. The UV slope is consistent with beta~2.0, and from
the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star formation rate of
2.4+/-1.1 Msol/yr. The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc,
from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ~10 Msol/yr/kpc2. The
Lyman-alpha emission is found to be extended over ~3" along the slit,
corresponding to ~5 kpc in the source plane. This can be explained by the
presence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-forming
region. Finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution using 7 photometric
data points with simple SED models, we derive the following properties: very
little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of M*=6e9 Msol, and an inferred age
of ~800 Myrs (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ~18). The
star-formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than at
the time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction of
galaxies at z~6 which have already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.
