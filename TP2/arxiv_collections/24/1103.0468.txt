We present a new method to explicitly define Abelian functions associated
with algebraic curves, for the purpose of finding bases for the relevant vector
spaces of such functions. We demonstrate the procedure with the functions
associated with a trigonal curve of genus four. The main motivation for the
construction of such bases is that it allows systematic methods for the
derivation of the addition formulae and differential equations satisfied by the
functions. We present a new 3-term 2-variable addition formulae and a complete
set of differential equations to generalise the classic Weierstrass identities
for the case of the trigonal curve of genus four.
