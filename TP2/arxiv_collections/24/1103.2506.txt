In the framework of the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity (LHT), we study
the contributions of the new particles to $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings at one-loop
level. Based on these results, we further study the branching ratio $R_{b}$ and
the unpolarized forward-backward asymmetry ${A_{FB}^{b}}$. We find that the
correction of the new particles to $Zb\bar{b}$ couplings is mainly on the
left-handed coupling and has small part of the parameter space to alleviate the
deviation between theoretical predictions and experimental values. The
precision measurement value of $R_{b}$ can give severe constraints on the
relevant parameters. The constraints from the precision measurement value of
${A_{FB}^{b}}$ are very weak.
