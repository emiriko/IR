We investigate the effect of a large number of kinks on the gravitational
power radiated by cosmic string loops. We show that the total power radiated by
a loop with N left-moving and right-moving kinks is proportional to N and
increases with the typical kink angle. We then apply these results to loops
containing junctions which give rise to a proliferation of the number of sharp
kinks. We show that the time of gravitational decay of these loops is smaller
than previously assumed. In light of this we revisit the gravitational wave
burst predictions from a network containing such loops. We find there is no
parameter regime in which the rate of individual kink bursts is enhanced with
respect to standard networks. By contrast, there remains a region of parameter
space for which the kink-kink bursts dominate the stochastic background.
Finally, we discuss the order of magnitude of the typical number of sharp kinks
resulting from kink proliferation on loops with junctions.
