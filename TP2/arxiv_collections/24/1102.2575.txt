Cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra have been measured with the
balloon-borne Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass experiment flown for 42 days in
Antarctica in the 2004-2005 austral summer season. High-energy cosmic-ray data
were collected at an average altitude of ~38.5 km with an average atmospheric
overburden of ~3.9 g cm$^{-2}$. Individual elements are clearly separated with
a charge resolution of ~0.15 e (in charge units) and ~0.2 e for protons and
helium nuclei, respectively. The measured spectra at the top of the atmosphere
are represented by power laws with a spectral index of -2.66 $\pm$ 0.02 for
protons from 2.5 TeV to 250 TeV and -2.58 $\pm$ 0.02 for helium nuclei from 630
GeV/nucleon to 63 TeV/nucleon. They are harder than previous measurements at a
few tens of GeV/nucleon. The helium flux is higher than that expected from the
extrapolation of the power law fitted to the lower-energy data. The relative
abundance of protons to helium nuclei is 9.1 $\pm$ 0.5 for the range from 2.5
TeV/nucleon to 63 TeV/nucleon. This ratio is considerably smaller than the
previous measurements at a few tens of GeV/nucleon.
