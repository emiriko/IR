The transient phenomena produced in solid noble gases by the stopping of the
recoils resulting from the elastic scattering processes of WIMPs from the
galactic halo were modelled, as dependencies of the temperatures of lattice and
electronic subsystems on the distance to the recoil's trajectory, and time from
its passage. The peculiarities of these thermal transients produced in Ar, Kr
and Xe were analysed for different initial temperatures and WIMP energies, and
were correlated with the characteristics of the targets and with the energy
loss of the recoils. The results were compared with the thermal spikes produced
by the same WIMPs in Si and Ge. In the range of the energy of interest, up to
tens of keV for the self-recoil, local phase transitions solid - liquid and
even liquid - gas were found possible, and the threshold parameters were
established.
