Let X be a projective variety, possibly singular. A generalized Albanese
variety of X was constructed by Esnault, Srinivas and Viehweg over
algebraically closed base field as a universal regular quotient of the relative
Chow group of 0-cycles by Levine-Weibel. In this paper, we obtain a functorial
description of the Albanese of Esnault-Srinivas-Viehweg over a perfect base
field, using duality theory of 1-motives with unipotent part.
