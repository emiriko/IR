Drawing on similarities in Hartree-Fock theory and the theory of matrix
product states (MPS), we explore extensions to time evolution, response theory,
and Green functions. We derive analytic equations of motion for MPS from the
least action principle, which describe optimal evolution in the small time-step
limit. We further show how linearized equations of motion yield a MPS random
phase approximation, from which one obtains response functions and excitations.
Finally we analyze the structure of site-based Green functions associated with
MPS, as well as the structure of correlations introduced via the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
