In this paper we focus on the finite n probability distribution function of
the largest eigenvalue in the classical Gaussian Ensemble of n by n matrices
(GEn). We derive the finite n largest eigenvalue probability distribution
function for the Gaussian Orthogonal and Symplectic Ensembles and also prove an
Edgeworth type Theorem for the largest eigenvalue probability distribution
function of Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble. The correction terms to the limiting
probability distribution are expressed in terms of the same Painleve II
functions appearing in the Tracy-Widom distribution.
