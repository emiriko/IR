A search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing jets, missing
transverse momentum and no electrons or muons is presented. The data were
recorded by the ATLAS experiment in sqrt(s) = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at
the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background
expectation was observed in 35 inverse picobarns of analysed data. Gluino
masses below 500 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level in simplified
models containing only squarks of the first two generations, a gluino octet and
a massless neutralino. The exclusion increases to 870 GeV for equal mass
squarks and gluinos. In MSUGRA/CMSSM models with tan(beta)= 3, A_0=0 and mu>0,
squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded below 775 GeV. These are the
most stringent limits to date.
