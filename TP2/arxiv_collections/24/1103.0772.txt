In this paper, the density-matrix renormalization group method is employed to
investigate the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling fractions $\nu=1/3$
and 5/2. We first present benchmark results at both filling fractions for large
system sizes to show the accuracy as well as the capability of the numerical
algorithm. Furthermore, we show that by keeping a large number of basis states,
one can also obtain accurate entanglement spectrum at $\nu=5/2$ for large
system with electron number up to $N_e=34$, much larger than systems previously
studied. Based on a finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate that the
entanglement gap defined by Li and Haldane is finite in the thermodynamic
limit, which characterizes the topological order of the FQHE state.
