The purpose of this paper is to provide an elementary introduction to the
qualitative and quantitative results of velocity combination in special
relativity, including the Wigner rotation and Thomas precession. We utilize
only the most familiar tools of special relativity, in arguments presented at
three differing levels: (1) utterly elementary, which will suit a first course
in relativity; (2) intermediate, to suit a second course; and (3) advanced, to
suit higher level students. We then give a summary of useful results, and
suggest further reading in this often obscure field.
