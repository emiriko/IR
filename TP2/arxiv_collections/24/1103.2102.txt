We present a new algorithm for estimating the star discrepancy of arbitrary
point sets. Similar to the algorithm for discrepancy approximation of Winker
and Fang [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 34 (1997), 2028--2042] it is based on the
optimization algorithm threshold accepting. Our improvements include, amongst
others, a non-uniform sampling strategy which is more suited for
higher-dimensional inputs, and rounding steps which transform axis-parallel
boxes, on which the discrepancy is to be tested, into \emph{critical test
boxes}. These critical test boxes provably yield higher discrepancy values, and
contain the box that exhibits the maximum value of the local discrepancy. We
provide comprehensive experiments to test the new algorithm. Our randomized
algorithm computes the exact discrepancy frequently in all cases where this can
be checked (i.e., where the exact discrepancy of the point set can be computed
in feasible time). Most importantly, in higher dimension the new method behaves
clearly better than all previously known methods.
