Starting from a Cluster Variational Method, and inspired by the correctness
of the paramagnetic Ansatz (at high temperatures in general, and at any
temperature in the 2D Edwards-Anderson model) we propose a novel message
passing algorithm --- the Dual algorithm --- to estimate the marginal
probabilities of spin glasses on finite dimensional lattices. We show that in a
wide range of temperatures our algorithm compares very well with Monte Carlo
simulations, with the Double Loop algorithm and with exact calculation of the
ground state of 2D systems with bimodal and Gaussian interactions. Moreover it
is usually 100 times faster than other provably convergent methods, as the
Double Loop algorithm.
