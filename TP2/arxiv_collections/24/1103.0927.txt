We probe a ground-state superposition that produces a quantum beat in the
intensity correlation of a two-mode cavity QED system. We mix drive with
scattered light from an atomic beam traversing the cavity, and effectively
measure the interference between the drive and the light from the atom. When a
photon escapes the cavity, and upon detection, it triggers our feedback which
modulates the drive at the same beat frequency but opposite phase for a given
time window. This results in a partial interruption of the beat oscillation in
the correlation function, that then returns to oscillate.
