A relation between physical consequences of the so-called Ehrenfest's Paradox
and the radial electric field in the classical quasi-neutral tokamak plasma is
shown. Basic author's approach to the relativistic nature of the tokamak has
been described in [1]. The experiment which can resolve the Ehrenfest's Paradox
is presented.
