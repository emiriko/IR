We study a Hamiltonian system describing a three spin-1/2 cluster-like
interaction competing with an Ising-like exchange. We show that the ground
state in the cluster phase possesses symmetry protected topological order. A
continuous quantum phase transition occurs as result of the competition between
the cluster and Ising terms. At the critical point the Hamiltonian is
self-dual. The geometric entanglement is also studied. Our findings in one
dimension corroborate the analysis of the two dimensional generalization of the
system, indicating, at a mean field level, the presence of a direct transition
between an antiferromagnetic and a valence bond solid ground state.
