We study the breaking of baryonic symmetries in the AdS_5/CFT_4
correspondence for D3 branes at Calabi-Yau three-fold singularities. This
leads, for particular VEVs, to the emergence of non-anomalous baryonic
symmetries during the renormalization group flow. We claim that these VEVs
correspond to critical values of the B-field moduli in the dual supergravity
backgrounds. We study in detail the C^3/Z_3 orbifold, the cone over F_0 and the
C^3/Z_5 orbifold. For the first two examples, we study the dual supergravity
backgrounds that correspond to the breaking of the emerging baryonic symmetries
and identify the expected Goldstone bosons and global strings in the infra-red.
In doing so we confirm the claim that the emerging symmetries are indeed
non-anomalous baryonic symmetries.
