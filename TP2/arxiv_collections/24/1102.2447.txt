We show that a crystal of mesoscopic Fe8 single molecule magnets is an
experimental realization of the Quantum Ising Phase Transition (QIPT) model in
a transverse field, with dipolar interactions. Quantum annealing has enabled us
to explore the QIPT at thermodynamical equilibrium. The phase diagram and
critical exponents we obtain are compared to expectations for the mean-field
QIPT Universality class.
