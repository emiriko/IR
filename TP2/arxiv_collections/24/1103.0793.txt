We present an analysis of the spatial distribution of metal-rich gas in ten
galaxy clusters using deep observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The
brightest cluster galaxies have experienced recent AGN activity in the forms of
bright radio emission, cavities, and shock fronts embedded in the hot
atmospheres. The heavy elements are distributed anisotropically and are aligned
with the large-scale radio and cavity axes. They are apparently being
transported from the halo of the brightest cluster galaxy into the intracluster
medium along large-scale outflows driven by the radio jets. The radial ranges
of the metal-enriched outflows are found to scale with jet power as R_Fe ~
P_jet^0.42, with a scatter of only 0.5 dex. The heavy elements are transported
beyond the extent of the inner cavities in all clusters, suggesting this is a
long lasting effect sustained over multiple generations of outbursts. Black
holes in BCGs will likely have difficulty ejecting metal enriched gas beyond 1
Mpc unless their masses substantially exceed 10^9 M_sun.
