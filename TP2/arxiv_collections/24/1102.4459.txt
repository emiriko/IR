We comment on the recent paper "Reconciling results of tunnelling experiments
on (Ga,Mn)As" arXiv:1102.3267v2 by Dietl and Sztenkiel. They claimed that the
oscillations observed in the d2I/dV2-V characteristics in our studies on the
resonant tunneling spectroscopy on GaMnAs, are not attributed to the resonant
levels in the GaMnAs layer but to the two-dimensional interfacial subbands in
the GaAs:Be layer. Here, we show that this interpretation is not able to
explain our experimental results and our conclusions remain unchanged.
