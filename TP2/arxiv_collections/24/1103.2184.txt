Group behavior has received much attention as a test case of
self-organization. There has been much written in recent years to investigate
interactions within groups of agents. These agents can be animals moving in an
interactive way, such as birds, but can also refer to situations such as people
driving in traffic. The models that describe these interactions are able to
reproduce different structures and patterns relating to the movement and
interaction of the agents involved. The advantages and necessities of this type
of analysis in any complex biological, technological, economic, or social
system are important and far-reaching. Each model that we will discuss
describes interaction between agents.
