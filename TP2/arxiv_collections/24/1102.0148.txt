A Spectral Correlator is the main component of the real time signal
processing for a Radio Telescope array. The correlation of signals received at
each element with every other element of the array is a classic case of an
application requiring a complete graph connectivity between its data sources,
as well as a very large number of simple operations to carry out the
correlation. Datarates can be extremely large in order to achieve high
sensitivities required for the detection of weak celestial signals. Hence,
correlators are prime targets for HPC implementations. In this paper, we
present the design and implementation of a massively parallel software spectral
Correlator for a 44 element array. The correlator handles ~735 MB/s of incoming
data from the 44 spatially distributed sources, and concurrently sustains a
computational load of ~100 Gflops. We first describe how we partition the large
incoming data stream into grouped datasets suited for transport over high speed
serial networks, as well as ideal for processing on commodity multicore
processors. An OpenMP based software correlator optimized for operation on
multicore SMP systems and implemented on a set of Harpertown class dual
processor machines is then presented.
