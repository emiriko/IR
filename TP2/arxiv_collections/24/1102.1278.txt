We construct nontrivial homomorphisms from the quasi group of some cubic
surfaces over $\bbF_{\!p}$ into a group. We show experimentally that the
homomorphisms constructed are the only possible ones and that there are no
nontrivial homomorphisms in the other cases. Thereby, we follow the
classification of cubic surfaces, due to A. Cayley.
