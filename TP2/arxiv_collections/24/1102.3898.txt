Little Higgs models contain heavy scalars in their content of particles as a
result of extended symmetry group of SM. In the littlest Higgs model of little
Higgs models there exists a new heavy scalar triplet.The physical states of
this triplet contains a double charged scalar, a single charged scalar, as well
as a neutral scalar and a neutral pseudo scalar. In little Higgs models a
Majorana type mass term can also be implemented in Yukawa Lagrangian, resulting
lepton flavor violation.
  In this talk the pair productions of double charged scalars in the context of
littlest Higgs model in $e^+e^-$ colliders are presented. Also the final
signatures of double charged scalars will be analyzed depending on lepton
flavor violation parameters. Finally it will be presented that if there is
lepton flavor violation, double charged scalars can be observed without any SM
background in $e^+e^-$ colliders with a collider signal of four leptons,
otherwise if there is no lepton flavor violation they can be reconstructed with
a background analysis.
