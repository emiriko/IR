We discuss several new results on nonnegative approximate controllability for
the one-dimensional Heat equation governed by either multiplicative or
nonnegative additive control, acting within a proper subset of the space domain
at every moment of time. Our methods allow us to link these two types of
controls to some extend. The main results include approximate controllability
properties both for the static and mobile control supports.
