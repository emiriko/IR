We propose a new permanent magnetic lattice for creating periodic arrays of
Ioffe-Pritchard permanent magnetic microtraps for holding and controlling
ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Lattice can be designed
on thin layer of magnetic films such as $Tb_6$$Gd_10$$Fe_{80}$$Co_4$. In
details, we investigate single layer and two crossed layers of sawtooth
magnetic patterns with thicknesses of 50 and 500nm respectively with a
periodicity of 1$\mu$m. Trap depth and frequencies can be changed via an
applied bias field to handle tunneling rates between lattice sites. We present
analytical expressions and using numerical calculations show that this lattice
has non-zero potential minima to avoid majorana spin flips. One advantage of
this lattice over previous ones is that it is easier to manufacture.
