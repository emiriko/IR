Metal hydrides have earlier been suggested for utilization in solar cells.
With this as a motivation we have prepared thin films of yttrium hydride by
reactive magnetron sputter deposition. The resulting films are metallic for low
partial pressure of hydrogen during the deposition, and black or
yellow-transparent for higher partial pressure of hydrogen. Both metallic and
semiconducting transparent YHx films have been prepared directly in-situ
without the need of capping layers and post-deposition hydrogenation. Optically
the films are similar to what is found for YHx films prepared by other
techniques, but the crystal structure of the transparent films differ from the
well-known YH3 phase, as they have an fcc lattice instead of hcp.
