Azimuthal decorrelations between the two central jets with the largest
transverse momenta are sensitive to the dynamics of events with multiple jets.
We present a measurement of the normalized differential cross section based on
the full dataset (L=36/pb) acquired by the ATLAS detector during the 2010
sqrt(s)=7 TeV proton-proton run of the LHC. The measured distributions include
jets with transverse momenta up to 1.3 TeV, probing perturbative QCD in a high
energy regime.
