The existence of a kinematically defined moving group of stars centred at U =
-40, V = -17 km/s referred to as the Hyades Supercluster, has been suggested as
the debris of an originally large star forming event, with its core being the
present day Hyades open cluster. Using high-resolution UVES spectra, we present
elemental abundances for a range of alpha, Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements
for 26 proposed supercluster stars. Our results show that the sample stars
display a heterogeneous abundance distribution, with a clump around [Fe/H] =
+0.15. We also calculate stellar radial velocities and U,V,W space velocities.
Enforcing a strict chemical and kinematical membership criteria, we find 4
supercluster stars share the Hyades open cluster abundances and kinematics,
while many of the remaining stars fit the disc field kinematics and abundance
range. We discuss our findings in the context of the Hyades supercluster being
a dispersed star-forming remnant, a stellar stream of purely dynamical origin
or a result of several processes.
