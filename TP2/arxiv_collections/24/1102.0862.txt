We define the category of partitioned binary relations and show that it
contains many classical diagram categories, including categories of binary
relations, maps, injective maps, partitions, (oriented) Brauer diagrams and
(oriented) Temperley-Lieb diagrams. We construct a one-parameter deformation of
the category of partitioned binary relations and show that it gives rise to
classical one-parameter deformations of partition, Brauer and Temperley-Lieb
categories. Finally, we describe a factorization of partitioned binary
relations into a product of certain idempotents and pairs of usual binary
relations.
