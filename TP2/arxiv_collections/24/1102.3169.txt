If the unitary quantum mechanical state evolution is universally valid,
quantized systems evolve uniformly, deterministically, and reversible; that is,
one-to-one. Hence, what is considered an irreversible measurement might be a
purely subjective, conventional, and convenient abstraction of the situation
that, although in principal totally reversible, for all practical purposes
(fapp), measurements cannot be undone. If this is granted, then Schroedinger's
"quantum jellification" arises because of the inevitability of the physical
co-existence of classically mutually exclusive states through quantum
coherence. It is suggested to take the rather unique human cognitive and
perceptive experience as evidence that, at least at the level of apperception,
quantum jellification does not exist at all. Otherwise the problems of how to
characterize the ambivalence of perception and cognition induced by quantum
coherence on a fundamental level of cognition, and why this ambivalence appears
to be rather weak and can be ignored fapp, remain unsolved.
