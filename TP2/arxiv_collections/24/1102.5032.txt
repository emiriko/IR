A novel point of view on the phenomenon of self-pulsations is presented,
which shows that they are a balanced state formed by two counteracting
processes: beating of modes and bistable switching. A structure based on two
coupled nonlinear microcavities provides a generic example of system with
enhanced ability to this phenomenon. The specific design of such structure in
the form of multilayered media is proposed, and the coupled mode theory is
applied to describe its dynamical properties. It is emphasized that the
frequency of self-pulsations is related to the frequency splitting between
resonant modes and can be adjusted over a broad range.
