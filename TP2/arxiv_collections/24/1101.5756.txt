Based on the matrix representation of octonion algebra, supplied with
specific multiplication rule, the model of electroweak and gravitational
interactions is built up. While electroweak interaction in this model is
induced by charged W-bosons, other two forces appear to have slightly more
complicated nature. Gravitational interaction coincides in the model with
dipole interaction of a pair of charged bosons. The dipole consists of a
charged vector bosons pair from the major octonion algebra fields. When the
charged dipole pair interacts with the neutral bosons pair from the major
octonion algebra fields, the charged bosons pair misses its mass. The drop in
mass leads to appearance of far-ranging forces of gravitational interaction.
Finally, strong interaction appears in the model as internal gravitational
solution of 'black whole' type with the peculiar 'gravitational' constant. The
solution is a product of interaction of major vector fields pair with charged
W-bosons pair. It is inferred from the model that the state space is
ten-dimensional. The space is built as a module of the matrix representation of
octonion algebra over the particles field (O-module). Similarly to the Standard
Weinberg-Salam theory, the particle mass here appears as the product of
interaction of massless spinor fields and Higgs field from O-module
representation.
