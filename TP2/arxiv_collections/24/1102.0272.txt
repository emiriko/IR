We consider a simple mathematical model of gradual Darwinian evolution in
continuous time and continuous trait space, due to intraspecific competition
for common resource in an asexually reproducing population in constant
environment, while far from evolutionary stable equilibrium. The model admits
exact analytical solution. In particular, Gaussian distribution of the trait
emerges from generic initial conditions.
