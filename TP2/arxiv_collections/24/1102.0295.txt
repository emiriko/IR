The GALEX General Data Release 4/5 includes 174 spectroscopic tiles, obtained
from slitless grism observations, for a total of more than 60,000 ultraviolet
spectra. We have determined statistical properties of the sample of GALEX
stars. We have defined a suitable system of spectroscopic indices, which
measure the main mid-UV features at the GALEX low spectral resolution and we
have employed it to determine the atmospheric parameters of of stars in the
range 4500<Teff<9000 K. Our preliminary results indicate that the sample is
formed by a majority of main sequence F- and G-type stars, with metallicity
[M/H]>-1 dex.
