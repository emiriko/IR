Positron annihilation induced Auger electron spectroscopy was used to obtain
Cu and Au Auger spectra that are free of primary beam induced background by
impinging the positrons at energy below the secondary electron emission
threshold. The removal of the core electron via annihilation in the PAES
process resulted in the elimination of post-collision affects. The spectrum
indicates that there is an intense low energy tail (LET) associated with the
Auger peak that extends all the way to 0 eV. The LET has been interpreted as
being due to processes in which the filling of the core by a valence electron
results in the ejection of two or more valence electrons which share the energy
of the otherwise Auger electron
