The current status of the theoretical understanding of the
transverse-momentum dependent parton densities (TMDs) is discussed. Special
attention is payed to the difference between the operator definitions of TMDs
proposed so far, the treatment of specific divergences, the geometry of the
gauge links, and the role of the soft factors.
