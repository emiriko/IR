We obtained complete $R$ and $I$ light curves of GSC 02393-00680 in 2008 and
analyzed them with the 2003 version of the W-D code. It is shown that GSC
02393-00680 is a W-type shallow contact binary system with a high mass ratio
$q=1.600$ and a degree of contact factor $f=5.0%(\pm1.3%)$. It will be a good
example to check up on the TRO theory. A period investigation based on all
available data suggests that the system has a small-amplitude period
oscillation ($A_3=0.^{d}0030$; $T_3=1.92$years). This may indicate it has a
moderate mass close third body, which is similar to XY Leo.
