We report thermal transport measurement of KxFe2-ySe2 superconducting single
crystal. Significant peak anomaly in thermal conductivity is observed at nearly
TC/2 indicating a large phonon mean-free-path in the superconducting state. The
zero-temperature extrapolated thermoelectric power is smaller than the value in
typical strongly correlated superconductors, implying large normalized Fermi
temperature. In contrast to other iron superconductors, thermoelectric power in
our sample does not exhibit significant anomalies. These findings indicate that
KxFe2-ySe2 is a weakly or intermediately correlated superconductor without
significant Fermi surface nesting.
