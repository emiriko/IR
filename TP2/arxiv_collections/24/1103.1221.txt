We theoretically show that the magnon wavepacket has a rotational motion in
two ways; a self-rotation and a motion along the boundary of the sample (edge
current). They are similar to cyclotron motion of electrons, but unlike
electrons the magnons have no charge and the rotation is not due to Lorenz
force. These rotational motions are caused by the Berry phase in momentum space
from magnon band structure. Furthermore, these rotational motions of the magnon
give an additional correction term to the magnon Hall effect. We also discuss
the Berry curvature effect in the classical limit of long-wavelength
magnetostatic spin waves having macroscopic coherence length.
