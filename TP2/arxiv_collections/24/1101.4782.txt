We analyze the charge and spin transport through a ballistic
ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor junction by means of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. For the ferromagnetic side we assume that ferromagnetism may
be driven by an unequal mass renormalization of oppositely polarized carriers,
i.e. a spin bandwidth asymmetry, and/or by a rigid splitting of up-and
down-spin electron bands, as in a standard Stoner ferromagnet, whereas the
superconducting side is assumed to exhibit a d-wave symmetry of the order
parameter, which can be pure or accompanied by a minority component breaking
time-reversal symmetry. Several remarkable features in the charge conductance
arise in this kind of junction, providing useful information about the
mechanism of ferromagnetism in the ferromagnetic electrode, as well as of the
order parameter symmetry in the superconducting one. In particular, we show
that when a time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor is considered, the
use of the two kinds of ferromagnet mentioned above represents a valuable tool
to discriminate between the different superconducting mixed states. We also
explain how this junction may mimic a switch able to turn on and off a spin
current, leaving the charge conductance unchanged, and we show that for a wide
range of insulating barrier strengths, a spin bandwidth asymmetry ferromagnet
may support a spin current larger than a standard Stoner one.
