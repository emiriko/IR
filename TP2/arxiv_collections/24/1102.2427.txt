Suppose Alice and Bob have access to two separated regions, respectively, of
a system of electrons moving in the presence of a regular one-dimensional
lattice of binding atoms. We consider the problem of communicating as much
quantum information, as measured by the qubit rate, through this quantum
information wire as possible. We describe a protocol whereby Alice and Bob can
achieve a qubit rate for these systems which is proportional to N^(-1/3) qubits
per unit time, where N is the number of lattice sites. Our protocol also
functions equally in the presence of interactions modelled via the t-J and
Hubbard models.
