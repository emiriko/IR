We report a new transport feature in a GaAs lateral double quantum dot that
emerges only for magnetic field sweeps and shows hysteresis due to dynamic
nuclear spin polarization (DNP). This DNP signal appears in the Coulomb
blockade regime by virtue of the finite inter-dot tunnel coupling and
originates from the crossing between ground levels of the spin triplet and
singlet extensively used for nuclear spin manipulations in pulsed gate
experiments. The unexpectedly large signal intensity is suggestive of
unbalanced DNP between the two dots, which opens up the possibility of
controlling electron and nuclear spin states via DC transport.
