We utilize an exact variational numerical procedure to calculate the ground
state properties of a polaron in the presence of a Rashba-like spin orbit
interaction. Our results corroborate with previous work performed with the
Momentum Average approximation and with weak coupling perturbation theory. We
find that spin orbit coupling increases the effective mass in the regime with
weak electron phonon coupling, and decreases the effective mass in the
intermediate and strong electron phonon coupling regime. Analytical strong
coupling perturbation theory results confirm our numerical results in the small
polaron regime. A large amount of spin orbit coupling can lead to a significant
lowering of the polaron effective mass.
