We report measurements of the temperature and pressure dependence of the
electrical resistivity of single crystalline iron-based chalcogenide
Cs0.8Fe2Se2. In this material superconductivity Tc~30K develops from a normal
state with extremely large resistivity. At ambient pressure a large "hump" in
the resistivity is observed around 200K. Under pressure, the resistivity
decreases by two orders of magnitude, concomitant with a sudden Tc suppression
around p~8GPa. Even at 9GPa a metallic resistivity state is not recovered, and
the {\rho}(T) "hump" is still detected. A comparison of the data measured upon
increasing and decreasing the external pressure leads us to suggest that
superconductivity is not related to this hump.
