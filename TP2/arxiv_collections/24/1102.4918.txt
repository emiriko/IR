We compute the electrostatic potential at the surface, or zeta potential
$\zeta$, of a charged particle embedded in a colloidal suspension using a
hybrid mesoscopic model. We show that for weakly perturbing electric fields,
the value of $\zeta$ obtained at steady state during electrophoresis is
statistically indistinguishable from $\zeta$ in thermodynamic equilibrium. We
quantify the effect of counterions concentration on $\zeta$. We also evaluate
the relevance of the lattice resolution for the calculation of $\zeta$ and
discuss how to identify the effective electrostatic radius.
