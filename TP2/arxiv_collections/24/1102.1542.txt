Variational Monte-Carlo calculations are carried out for
${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^4}H$ to explore on the possibility of its existence, using
realistic NN, NNN, and phenomenological {\Lambda}N and {\Lambda}NN
interactions. We also perform calculations using FGNN and NSC97 {\Lambda}N
potentials.We have demonstrated the effect of the exchange part of the two-body
{\Lambda}N interaction and three-body {\Lambda}NN interaction on the binding
energy of . Still the stability of ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^ 4} H$ remains an open
question and this hypernuclear system has to be explored more, theoretically.
