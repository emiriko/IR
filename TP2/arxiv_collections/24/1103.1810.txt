In lattice field theory, renormalizable simulation algorithms are attractive,
because their scaling behaviour as a function of the lattice spacing is
predictable. Algorithms implementing the Langevin equation, for example, are
known to be renormalizable if the simulated theory is. In this paper we show
that the situation is different in the case of the molecular-dynamics evolution
on which the HMC algorithm is based. More precisely, studying the phi^4 theory,
we find that the hyperbolic character of the molecular-dynamics equations leads
to non-local (and thus non-removable) ultraviolet singularities already at
one-loop order of perturbation theory.
