The two-variable Langevin equations, modeling the Brownian motion of a
particle moving in a potential and leading to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, are shown to give
rise to types of stationary power-law distributions through the multiplicative
noise. The power-law distributions induced by this inhomogeneous noise are
proved to be a result of that the relation of diffusion to friction depends on
the energy. We understand the conditions under which the power-law
distributions are produced and how they are produced in systems away from
equilibrium, and hence derive a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
This leads to a generalized Klein-Kramers equation, and a generalized
Smoluchowski equation for the particle moving in a strong friction medium,
whose stationary-state solutions are exactly Tsallis distribution.
