The Fermi surfaces of Fe-pnictide superconductors are fairly two-dimensional
(2D), and it has thus come as a surprise that recent penetration depth and
thermal conductivity measurements on systems of the 122 type have reported
c-axis transport coefficients at low temperatures in the superconducting state
comparable to or even larger than that in the $ab$-plane. These results should
provide important information on both the Fermi surface and the superconducting
state. Here we consider the theory of the superfluid density and thermal
conductivity in models of extended-$s$ wave superconducting states expected to
be appropriate for Fe-pnictide systems. We include intraband disorder and
consider a range of different Fermi surfaces where gap nodes might exist. We
show that recent experiments on Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ can be
semiquantitatively understood by such an approach, and discuss their
implications.
