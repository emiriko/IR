The application of the consolidation equation is based on Taylor's
approximate solution alone. The existence of the exact solution emerged from
the analysis of the logical structure of d'Alambert's, Fourier' and Laplace's
differential equations. This led to a nonlinear equation - based on the
properties of elastic waves and elastic functions - which is able to simulate
excess pore pressure transmission in the soil. The research is completed with
the application of the solution obtained, thereby discovering that
consolidation decay times may be calculated both through the construction of
dissipation curves and through he analytical research of the time value
satisfying the condition Delta u(z,t100) = 0. Finally, decay times match the
approximate solution eliminating in fact the introduction of Taylor's
additional parameters.
