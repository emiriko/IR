We investigate the meaning of the entropy carried away by Hawking radiations
from a black hole. We propose that the entropy for a black hole measures the
uncertainty of the information about the black hole forming matter's
precollapsed configurations, self-collapsed configurations, and inter-collapsed
configurations. We find that gravitational wave or gravitational radiation
alone cannot carry all information about the processes of black hole
coalescence and collapse, while the total information locked in the hole could
be carried away completely by Hawking radiation as tunneling.
