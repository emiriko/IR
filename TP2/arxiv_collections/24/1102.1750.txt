The pinwheel tiling is the paradigm for a substitution tiling with circular
symmetry, in the sense that the corresponding autocorrelation is circularly
symmetric. As a consequence, its diffraction measure is also circularly
symmetric, so the pinwheel diffraction consists of sharp rings and, possibly, a
continuous component with circular symmetry. We consider some combinatorial
properties of the tiles and their orientations, and a numerical approach to the
diffraction of weighted pinwheel point sets.
