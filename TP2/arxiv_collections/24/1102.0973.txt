It is shown that the presence of the Majorana fermion edge states along the
perimeter of a topological superconductor can be probed using an interacting
quantum dot coupled to three terminals: two spin-polarized (ferromagnetic)
leads and one lead supporting the Majorana edge states. The hybridization with
the Majorana states induces a particular type of the Kondo effect with
non-Fermi-liquid properties which can be detected by performing linear
conductance measurements between the source and drain normal leads: the
temperature dependence of the conductance is characteristically different from
that in the conventional Kondo effect.
