In this work we present a calculation of both t-channel and s-channel
single-top production at next-to-leading order in QCD for the Tevatron and for
the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. All the cross sections and
kinematical distributions presented include leading non-factorizable
corrections arising from interferences of the production and decay
subprocesses, extending previous results beyond the narrow-width approximation.
The new off-shell effects are found to be generally small, but can be sizeable
close to kinematical end-points and for specific distributions.
