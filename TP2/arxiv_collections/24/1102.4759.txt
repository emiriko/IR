We analyse the entanglement tradeoff between particle and anti-particle modes
of a Dirac field from the perspective of inertial and uniformly accelerated
observers. Our results show that a redistribution of entanglement between
particle and anti-particle modes plays a key role in the survival of fermionic
field entanglement in the infinite acceleration limit.
