We use density-functional theory, of the fundamental-measure type, to study
the relative stability of the biaxial nematic phase, with respect to
non-uniform phases such as smectic and columnar, in fluids made of hard
board-like particles with sizes $\sigma_1>\sigma_2>\sigma_3$. A
restricted-orientation (Zwanzig) approximation is adopted. Varying the ratio
$\kappa_1=\sigma_1/\sigma_2$ while keeping $\kappa_2=\sigma_2/\sigma_3$, we
predict phase diagrams for various values of $\kappa_2$ which include all the
uniform phases: isotropic, uniaxial rod- and plate-like nematics, and biaxial
nematic. In addition, spinodal instabilities of the uniform phases with respect
to fluctuations of the smectic, columnar and plastic-solid type, are obtained.
In agreement with recent experiments, we find that the biaxial nematic phase
begins to be stable for $\kappa_2\simeq 2.5$. Also, as predicted by previous
theories and simulations on biaxial hard particles, we obtain a region of
biaxility centred on $\kappa_1\approx\kappa_2$ which widens as $\kappa_2$
increases. For $\kappa_2\agt 5$ the region $\kappa_2\approx\kappa_1$ of the
packing-fraction vs. $\kappa_1$ phase diagrams exhibits interesting topologies
which change qualitatively with $\kappa_2$. We have found that an increasing
biaxial shape anisotropy favours the formation of the biaxial nematic phase.
Our study is the first to apply FMT theory to biaxial particles and, therefore,
it goes beyond the second-order virial approximation. Our prediction that the
phase diagram must be asymmetric is a genuine result of the present approach,
which is not accounted for by previous studies based on second-order theories.
