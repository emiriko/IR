We discuss recent work which has found, using a tunneling approach,
higher-order terms in the Hawking temperature. We highlight a few important
issues in the derivation, such as a misleading definition of energy, and
criticize some of the conclusions that have been reached. In particular, we
conclude that contrary to many recent claims, the tunneling method yields no
higher-order corrections to the Hawking Temperature.
