Ultrasound velocity measurements of the orbitally-frustrated GeCo$_2$O$_4$
reveal unusual elastic instabilities due to the phonon-spin coupling within the
antiferromagnetic phase. Shear moduli exhibit anomalies arising from the
coupling to short-range ferromagnetic excitations. Diplike anomalies in the
magnetic-field dependence of elastic moduli reveal magnetic-field-induced
orbital order-order transitions. These results strongly suggest the presence of
geometrical orbital frustration which causes novel orbital phenomena within the
antiferromagnetic phase.
