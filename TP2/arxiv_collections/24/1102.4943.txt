The long-time and long-distance asymptotic behavior of the $x$ spin
correlations at finite temperature in an anisotropic spin-1/2 XY chain is
determined numerically. The decay of the correlations is exponential in both
space and time. Similar exponential decay of correlations was already found
earlier in the special case of the isotropic model, where analytical
expressions for the decay rates could be derived via a mapping to a different
model. While no such mapping is known for the anisotropic model, the asymptotic
correlations can be very well approximated by a natural generalization of the
known analytic results for the isotropic case.
