We discuss a supergravity description of the metastable state that is created
by a stack of anti-D3-branes placed at the tip of the KS background. When the
number p of the anti-D3-branes is large g_s p >> 1 the characteristic curvature
of the corresponding gravity dual is large in stringy units and one may expect
the background to be regular everywhere. Starting from the distances of order R
~ (g_s p)^{1/4} away from the tip the new background can be well approximated
by a linear perturbation around KS. By applying the appropriate boundary
conditions in both IR and UV we found the lowest KK mode of the corresponding
linear perturbation. The solution we found contains VEVs of the SU(2)x SU(2)
invariant operators at the linear order in p. As a non-trivial check we
calculate the ADM mass which exactly matches the probe approximation. As a
byproduct we also found a gravity background dual to the KS theory deformed by
the operators W^2 and W^2\bar{W}^2 with small coefficients.
