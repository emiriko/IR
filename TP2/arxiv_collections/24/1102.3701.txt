Magnetic fields on a range of scales play a large role in the ecosystems of
galaxies, both in the galactic disk and in the extended layers of gas away from
the plane. Observing magnetic field strength, structure and orientation is
complex, and necessarily indirect. Observational data of magnetic fields in the
halo of the Milky Way are scarce, and non-conclusive about the large-scale
structure of the field. In external galaxies, various large-scale
configurations of magnetic fields are measured, but many uncertainties about
exact configurations and their origin remain. There is a strong interaction
between magnetic fields and other components in the interstellar medium such as
ionized and neutral gas and cosmic rays. The energy densities of these
components are comparable on large scales, indicating that magnetic fields are
not passive tracers but that magnetic field feedback on the other interstellar
medium components needs to be taken into account.
