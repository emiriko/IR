We report a comparative study of the properties of very thin films of
La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ grown epitaxially under strain on flat SrTiO$_3$
(STO), lattice matched on NdGaO$_3$ (NGO), and strained on $1^{\circ}$-miscut
STO. We use transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss
spectroscopy to study the microstructure, composition, and Mn valence state.
Near the interface we find no significant segregation, but a charge
compensation layer where the valence is enhanced over the nominal value of
3.3+, and a relaxation to this value over several nanometer. The transport
properties show well-known behavior for the films on flat STO and NGO, namely
values of the metal-insulator transition temperature which are strongly (STO)
or only little (NGO) reduced with respect to the bulk value. The reduction in
films on miscut STO however is less strong than in films on flat STO, even
though they appear similar as to strain state and interface layer.
Magnetically, we find reduced values of the saturation magnetization for the
strained films with respect to the bulk value, which cannot only be ascribed to
the interface layer.
