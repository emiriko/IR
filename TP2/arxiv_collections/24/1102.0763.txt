Yeh et al. recently have proposed a mutual authentication protocol based on
EPC Class-1 Gen.-2 standard [1]. They have claimed that their protocol is
secure against adversarial attacks and also provides forward secrecy. In this
paper we will show that the proposed protocol does not have proper security
features. A powerful and practical attack is presented on this protocol whereby
the whole security of the protocol is broken. Furthermore, Yeh et al. protocol
does not assure the untraceabilitiy and backward untraceabilitiy aspects.
Namely, all past and next transactions of a compromised tag will be traceable
by an adversary.
