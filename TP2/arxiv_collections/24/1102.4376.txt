We present a unified Dyson-Schwinger equation treatment of static and
electromagnetic properties of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, and scalar and
axial-vector diquark correlations, based upon a vector-vector
contact-interaction. A basic motivation for this study is the need to document
a comparison between the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and those
diquarks which play a material role in nucleon structure. This is an important
step toward a unified description of meson and baryon form factors based on a
single interaction. A notable result, therefore, is the large degree of
similarity between related meson and diquark form factors. The simplicity of
the interaction enables computation of the form factors at arbitrarily-large
spacelike-Q^2, which enables us to expose a zero in the rho-meson electric form
factor at z_Q^\rho ~ Sqrt[6] m_\rho. Notably, r_\rho*z_Q^\rho ~ r_D*z_Q^D,
where r_\rho, r_D are, respectively, the electric radii of the rho-meson and
deuteron.
