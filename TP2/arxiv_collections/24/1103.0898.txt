The temporal evolution of the spatially periodic electroconvection (EC)
patterns has been studied within the period of the driving ac voltage by
monitoring the light intensity diffracted from the pattern. Measurements have
been carried out on a variety of nematic systems, including those with negative
dielectric and positive conductivity anisotropy, exhibiting "standard EC"
(s-EC), those with both anisotropies negative exhibiting "non-standard EC"
(ns-EC), as well as those with the two anisotropies positive. Theoretical
predictions have been confirmed for stationary s-EC and ns-EC patterns.
Transitions with Hopf bifurcation have also been studied. While traveling had
no effect on the temporal evolution of dielectric s-EC, traveling conductive
s-EC and ns-EC patterns exhibited a substantially altered temporal behavior
with a dependence on the Hopf frequency. It has also been shown that in
nematics with both anisotropies positive, the pattern develops and decays
within an interval much shorter than the period, even at relatively large
driving frequencies.
