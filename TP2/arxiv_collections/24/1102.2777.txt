We present a model for weak CC induced nuclear reactions at energies of
interest for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. This model is
a natural extension of the work of Refs.[1,2], where the QE contribution to the
inclusive electron and neutrino scattering on nuclei was analyzed. The model is
based on a systematic many body expansion of the gauge boson absorption modes
that includes one, two and even three body mechanisms, as well as the
excitation of Delta isobars. The whole scheme has no free parameters, besides
those previously adjusted to the weak pion production off the nucleon cross
sections in the deuteron, since all nuclear effects were set up in previous
studies of photon, electron and pion interactions with nuclei. We have
discussed at length the recent charged current quasi-elastic MiniBooNE cross
section data, and showed that two nucleon knockout mechanisms are essential to
describe these measurements.
