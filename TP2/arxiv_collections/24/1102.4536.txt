London's polarization model is extended over a wide range of VdW attraction.
At low temperature the VdW attraction is the main competitor to the Casimir
force. As the temperature is raised, the VdW force decreases by virtue of the
polsrizability falling down gradually. This trend is advanced in multilevel
systems. such as the off-center defects, where the polarizability is
renormalized through electron-vibrational mode coupling to gain a multiple
vibronic enhancement by many orders of magnitude. Applications to high-Tc
superconductivity and cosmology are conceivable.
