We present a numerical approach which allows the solving of Bethe equations
whose solutions define the eigenstates of Gaudin models. By focusing on a new
set of variables, the canceling divergences which occur for certain values of
the coupling strength no longer appear explicitly. The problem is thus reduced
to a set of quadratic algebraic equations. The required inverse transformation
can then be realized using only linear operations and a standard polynomial
root finding algorithm. The method is applied to Richardson's fermionic pairing
model, the central spin model and generalized Dicke model.
