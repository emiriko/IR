We study properties of Wigner crystal in snaked nanochannels and show that
they are characterized by conducting sliding phase at low charge densities and
insulating pinned phase emerging above a certain critical charge density. The
transition between these phases has a devil's staircase structure typical for
the Aubry transition in dynamical maps and the Frenkel-Kontorova model. We
discuss implications of this phenomenon for charge density waves in
quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors and for supercapacitors in nanopore
materials.
