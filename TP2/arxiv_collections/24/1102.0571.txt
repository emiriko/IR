We study the Gaussent-Littelmann formula for Hall-Littlewood polynomials and
we develop combinatorial tools to describe the formula in a purely
combinatorial way for type A_n, B_n and C_n. This description is in terms of
Young tableaux and arises from identifying one-skeleton galleries that appear
in the Gaussent-Littelmann formula with Young tableaux. Furthermore, we show by
using these tools that the Gaussent-Littelmann formula and the well-known
Macdonald formula for Hall-Littlewood polynomials for type A_n are the same.
