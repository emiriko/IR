Let X be a finite set of cardinality n. The Kalmanson complex K_n is the
simplicial complex whose vertices are non-trivial X-splits, and whose facets
are maximal circular split systems over X. In this paper we examine K_n from
three perspectives. In addition to the T-theoretic description, we show that
K_n has a geometric realization as the Kalmanson conditions on a finite metric.
A third description arises in terms of binary matrices which possess the
circular ones property. We prove the equivalence of these three definitions.
This leads to a simplified proof of the well-known equivalence between
Kalmanson and circular decomposable metrics, as well as a partial description
of the f-vector of K_n.
