The laws of gravitation devised by Newton, and by Hilbert and Einstein, have
failed many experimental and observational tests, namely the bore hole g
anomaly, flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies, supermassive black hole mass
spectrum, uniformly expanding universe, cosmic filaments, laboratory G
measurements, galactic EM bending, precocious galaxy formation,.. The response
has been the introduction of the new epicycles: ``dark matter", ``dark energy",
and others. To understand gravity we must restart with the experimental
discoveries by Galileo, and following a heuristic argument we are led to a
uniquely determined theory of a dynamical 3-space. That 3-space exists has been
missed from the beginning of physics, although it was 1st directly detected by
Michelson and Morley in 1887. Uniquely generalising the quantum theory to
include this dynamical 3-space we deduce the response of quantum matter and
show that it results in a new account of gravity, and explains the above
anomalies and others. The dynamical theory for this 3-space involves G, which
determines the dissipation rate of space by matter, and alpha, which
experiments and observation reveal to be the fine structure constant. For the
1st time we have a comprehensive account of space and matter and their
interaction - gravity.
