We study absorbing state phase transition in one dimension in presence of a
conserved continuous local field (CCLF) called energy. A pair of sites on a
lattice is said to be active if one or both sites posses more energy than a
pre-defined threshold. The active pair of sites are allowed to redistribute
their energy following a stochastic rule. We show that, the CCLF model undergo
a continuous absorbing state transition when energy per site is decreased below
a critical value. The critical exponents are found to be different from those
of DP.
