We have studied the time evolution of the electron spin polarization under
continuous photoexcitation in remotely n-doped semiconductor quantum wells. The
doped region allows us to get the necessary excess of free electrons to form
trions. We have considered electron resonant photoexcitation at free, exciton
and trion electron energy levels. Also, we have studied the relative effect of
photoexcitation energy density and doping concentration. In order to obtain the
two-dimensional density evolution of the different species, we have performed
dynamic calculations through the matrix density formalism. Our results indicate
that photoexcitation of free electron level leads to a higher spin
polarization. Also, we have found that increasing the photoexcitation energy or
diminishing the doping enhances spin polarization.
