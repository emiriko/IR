A coherent state technique is used to generate an Interacting Boson Model
(IBM) Hamiltonian energy surface that simulates a mean field energy surface.
The method presented here has some significant advantages over previous work.
Specifically, that this can be a completely predictive requiring no a priori
knowledge of the IBM parameters. The technique allows for the prediction of the
low lying energy spectra and electromagnetic transition rates which are of
astrophysical interest. Results and comparison with experiment are included for
krypton, molybdenum, palladium, cadmium, gadolinium, dysprosium and erbium
nuclei.
