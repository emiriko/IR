We report on a combined structural and electronic analysis of niobium
ultrathin films (from 2 to 10 nm) deposited in ultra-high vacuum on atomically
flat R-plane sapphire wafers. A textured polycrystalline morphology is observed
for the thinnest films showing that hetero-epitaxy is not achieved under a
thickness of 3.3nm, which almost coincides with the first measurement of a
superconducting state. The superconducting critical temperature rise takes
place on a very narrow thickness range, of the order of a single monolayer
(ML). The thinnest superconducting sample (3 nm/9ML) has an offset critical
temperature above 4.2K and can be processed by standard nanofabrication
techniques to generate air- and time-stable superconducting nanostructures,
useful for quantum devices.
