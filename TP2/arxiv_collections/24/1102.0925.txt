The current paper is aimed at the determination of barriers that govern the
covalent coupling between two fullerenes C60 (C60 dimer), C60 and single-walled
carbon nanotube ([C60-(4,4)] carbon nanobud), and C60 and graphene ([C60-(5,5)]
and [C60-(9,8)] graphene nanobuds). Brutto barriers determined as couplings
energies are expanded over two contributions that present total energy of
deformation of the composites' components and energy of covalent coupling . In
view of these energetic parameters and in contrast to expectations, seemingly
identical reactions result in different final products. The peculiarity is
suggested to be provided by a topochemical character of the covalent coupling
between any two members of the sp2 nanocarbons' family. The computations were
performed by using the AM1 semiempirical version of unrestricted broken
symmetry Hartree-Fock approach.
