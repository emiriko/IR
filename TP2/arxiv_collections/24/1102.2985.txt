We report the first detection of buckminsterfullerene (C60) in a
proto-planetary nebula (PPN). The vibrational transitions of C60 at 7.0, 17.4,
and 18.9um are detected in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum of IRAS 01005+7910. This
detection suggests that fullerenes are formed shortly after the asymptotic
giant branch but before the planetary nebulae stage. A comparison with the
observations of C60 in other sources is made and the implication on
circumstellar chemistry is discussed.
