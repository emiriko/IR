The electromagnetic transition properties of the decuplet to octet baryon
($\Delta \rightarrow N\gamma$) is studied within the frame work of a
hypercentral quark model. The confinement potential is assumed as hypercentral
coloumb plus linear potential. The transition magnetic moment and transition
amplitude $f_{M_1}$ for the $\Delta \rightarrow N\gamma$ are in agreement with
other theoretical predictions. The present result of the radiative decay width
is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental values reported by
the particle data group over other theoretical model predictions.
