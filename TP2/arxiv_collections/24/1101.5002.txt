The abstract framework of quantum mechanics (QM) causes the well-known
weirdness, which leads to the field of foundation of QM. We constructed the new
concept, i.e., scope, to lay the foundation of quantum coherence and openness,
also the principles of superposition and entanglement. We studied analytically
and quantitatively the quantum correlations and information, also we discussed
the physical essence of the existed entanglement measures. We compared with
several other approaches to the foundation of QM, and we stated that the
concept of scope is unique and has not been demonstrated before.
