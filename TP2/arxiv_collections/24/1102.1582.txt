The branching ratio for the mu-->e+gamma decay in the framework of the
minimal flavour violation in the MSSM is calculated for various regions of the
MSSM parameter space. The lepton flavour violation goes through the PMNS mixing
matrix. The dependence on tanbeta is studied in comparison with experimental
data. The results crucially depend on the mixing angle theta_{13}. Observation
of this decay would serve as a manifestation of new physics beyond the SM.
