Technology progress in DNA sequencing boosts the genomic database growth at
faster and faster rate. Compression, accompanied with random access
capabilities, is the key to maintain those huge amounts of data. In this paper
we present an LZ77-style compression scheme for relative compression of
multiple genomes of the same species. While the solution bears similarity to
known algorithms, it offers significantly higher compression ratios at
compression speed over a order of magnitude greater. One of the new successful
ideas is augmenting the reference sequence with phrases from the other
sequences, making more LZ-matches available.
