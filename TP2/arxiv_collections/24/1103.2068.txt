COMET is a single-pass MapReduce algorithm for learning on large-scale data.
It builds multiple random forest ensembles on distributed blocks of data and
merges them into a mega-ensemble. This approach is appropriate when learning
from massive-scale data that is too large to fit on a single machine. To get
the best accuracy, IVoting should be used instead of bagging to generate the
training subset for each decision tree in the random forest. Experiments with
two large datasets (5GB and 50GB compressed) show that COMET compares favorably
(in both accuracy and training time) to learning on a subsample of data using a
serial algorithm. Finally, we propose a new Gaussian approach for lazy ensemble
evaluation which dynamically decides how many ensemble members to evaluate per
data point; this can reduce evaluation cost by 100X or more.
