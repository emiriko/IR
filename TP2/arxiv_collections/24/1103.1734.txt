Continuous-variable (CV) multipartite unlockable bound-entangled states is
investigated in this paper. Comparing with the qubit multipartite unlockable
bound-entangled states, CV multipartite unlockable bound-entangled states
present the new and different properties. CV multipartite unlockable
bound-entangled states may serve as a useful quantum resource for new
multiparty communication schemes. The experimental protocol for generating CV
unlockable bound-entangled states is proposed with a setup that is at present
accessible.
