Self-inducing structure of pentagonal piecewise isometry is applied to show
detailed description of periodic and aperiodic orbits, and further dynamical
properties. A Pisot number appears as a scaling constant and plays a crucial
role in the proof. Further generalization is discussed in the last section.
