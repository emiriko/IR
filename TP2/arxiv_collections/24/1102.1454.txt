Suppose that $d\ge 1$ and $\alpha\in (0, 2)$. In this paper, by using
probabilistic methods, we establish sharp two-sided pointwise estimates for the
Dirichlet heat kernels of $\{\Delta+ a^\alpha \Delta^{\alpha/2}; \ a\in (0,
1]\}$ on half-space-like $C^{1, 1}$ domains in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for all time
$t>0$. The large time estimates for half-space-like domains are very different
from those for bounded domains. Our estimates are uniform in $a \in (0, 1]$ in
the sense that the constants in the estimates are independent of $a\in (0, 1]$.
Thus it yields the Dirichlet heat kernel estimates for Brownian motion in
half-space-like domains by taking $a\to 0$. Integrating the heat kernel
estimates in time $t$, we obtain uniform sharp two-sided estimates for the
Green functions of $\{\Delta+ a^\alpha \Delta^{\alpha/2}; \ a\in (0, 1]\}$ in
half-space-like $C^{1, 1}$ domains in ${\mathbb R}^d$.
