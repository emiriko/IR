A "monkey book" is a book consisting of a random distribution of letters and
blanks, where a group of letters surrounded by two blanks is defined as a word.
We compare the statistics of the word distribution for a monkey book with the
corresponding distribution for the general class of random books, where the
latter are books for which the words are randomly distributed. It is shown that
the word distribution statistics for the monkey book is different and quite
distinct from a typical sampled book or real book. In particular the monkey
book obeys Heaps' power law to an extraordinary good approximation, in contrast
to the word distributions for sampled and real books, which deviate from Heaps'
law in a characteristics way. The somewhat counter-intuitive conclusion is that
a "monkey book" obeys Heaps' power law precisely because its word-frequency
distribution is not a smooth power law, contrary to the expectation based on
simple mathematical arguments that if one is a power law, so is the other.
