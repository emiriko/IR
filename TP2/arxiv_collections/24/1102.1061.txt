A class of models is presented, in the form of continuation monads
polymorphic for first-order individuals, that is sound and complete for minimal
intuitionistic predicate logic. The proofs of soundness and completeness are
constructive and the computational content of their composition is, in
particular, a $\beta$-normalisation-by-evaluation program for simply typed
lambda calculus with sum types. Although the inspiration comes from Danvy's
type-directed partial evaluator for the same lambda calculus, the there
essential use of delimited control operators (i.e. computational effects) is
avoided. The role of polymorphism is crucial -- dropping it allows one to
obtain a notion of model complete for classical predicate logic. The connection
between ours and Kripke models is made through a strengthening of the
Double-negation Shift schema.
