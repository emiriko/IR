By means of Monte Carlo techniques, we study the role of disorder on a system
of hard-core bosons in a two-leg ladder with both intra-chain ($t$) and
inter-chain ($t^\prime$) hoppings. We find that the phase diagram as a function
of the boson density, disorder strength, and $t^\prime/t$ is far from being
trivial. This contrasts the case of spin-less fermions where standard
localization arguments apply and an Anderson-localized phase pervades the whole
phase diagram. A compressible Bose-glass phase always intrudes between the Mott
insulator with zero (or one) bosons per site and the superfluid that is
stabilized for weak disorder. At half filling, there is a direct transition
between a (gapped) rung-Mott insulator and a Bose glass, which is driven by
exponentially rare regions where disorder is suppressed. Finally, by doping the
rung-Mott insulator, a direct transition to the superfluid is possible only in
the clean system, whereas the Mott phase is always surrounded by the a Bose
glass when disorder is present. The phase diagram based on our numerical
evidence is finally reported.
