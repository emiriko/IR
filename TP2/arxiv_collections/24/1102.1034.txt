With the ever increasing influx of high resolution images of the solar
surface obtained at a multitude of wavelengths, various processes occurring at
small spatial scales have become a greater focus of our attention. Complex
small-scale magnetic fields have been reported that appear to have enough
stored to heat the chromosphere. While significant progress has been made in
understanding small-scale phenomena, many specifics remain elusive. We present
here a detailed study of a single event of disappearance of a magnetic dipole
and associated chromospheric activity. Based on New Solar Telescope H$\alpha$
data and {\it Hinode} photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and Ca II H
images we report the following. 1) Our analysis indicates that even very small
dipoles (elements separated by about 0\arcsec.5 or less) may reach the
chromosphere and trigger non-negligible chromospheric activity. 2) Careful
consideration of the magnetic environment where the new flux is deposited may
shed light on the details of magnetic flux removal from the solar surface. We
argue that the apparent collision and disappearance of two opposite polarity
elements may not necessarily indicate their cancellation (i.e., reconnection,
emergence of a "U" tube or submergence of $ \Omega $ loops). In our case, the
magnetic dipole disappeared by reconnecting with overlying large-scale inclined
plage fields. 3) Bright points seen in off-band H$\alpha$ images are very
well-correlated with the Ca II H bright points, which in turn are co-spatial
with G-band bright points. We further speculate that, in general, H$\alpha$
bright points are expected be co-spatial with photospheric BPs, however, a
direct comparison is needed to refine their relationship.
