The Parikh vector p(s) of a string s is defined as the vector of
multiplicities of the characters. Parikh vector q occurs in s if s has a
substring t with p(t)=q. We present two novel algorithms for searching for a
query q in a text s. One solves the decision problem over a binary text in
constant time, using a linear size index of the text. The second algorithm, for
a general finite alphabet, finds all occurrences of a given Parikh vector q and
has sub-linear expected time complexity; we present two variants, which both
use a linear size index of the text.
