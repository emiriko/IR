A true critical current density, $j_{c}$, as opposite to commonly measured
relaxed persistent (Bean) current, $j_{B}$, was extracted from the Campbell
penetration depth, $\lambda_{C}(T,H)$ measured in single crystals of LiFeAs.
The effective pinning potential is non-parabolic, which follows from the
magnetic field - dependent Labusch parameter $\alpha$. At the equilibrium (upon
field - cooling), $\alpha(H)$ is non-monotonic, but it is monotonic at a finite
gradient of the vortex density. This behavior leads to a faster magnetic
relaxation at the lower fields and provides a natural \emph{dynamic}
explanation for the fishtail (second peak) effect. We also find the evidence
for strong pinning at the lower fields. The inferred field dependence of the
pinning potential is consistent with the evolution from strong pinning, through
collective pinning and, eventually, to a disordered vortex lattice. The values
of $j_{c}(2\text{K}) \simeq 2\times10^{6}$ A/cm$^{2}$ provide an upper estimate
of the current carrying capability of LiFeAs. Overall, vortex behavior of
almost isotropic, fully-gapped LiFeAs is very similar to highly anisotropic
d-wave cuprate superconductors, the similarity that requires further studies in
order to understand unconventional superconductivity in cuprates and pnictides.
