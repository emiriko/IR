Possible phase transition of strongly interacting matter from hadron to a
Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state have in the p ast received considerable
interest. It has been suggested that this problem might be treated by
percolation theory. Th e Color String Percolation Model (CSPM) is used to
determine the equation of state (EOS) of the QGP produced in central Au-Au
collisions at RHIC energies. The bulk thermodynamic quantities- energy density,
entropy density and t he sound velocity- are obtained in the framework of CSPM.
It is shown that the results are in excellent agreement with the recent lattice
QCD calculations(LQCD).
