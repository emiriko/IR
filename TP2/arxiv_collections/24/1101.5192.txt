We revisit the idea that the Galactic center (GC) is the dominant source of
Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), based on a series of new observational evidence. A
unified model is proposed to explain the new phenomena of GCRs and
$\gamma$-rays simultaneously. The GCRs are thought to be accelerated during
past activities of the GC. The pair production process of GCRs in the strong
radiation field due to the GC activity is responsible for the knee structure of
the cosmic ray spectra. A f raction of $e^+e^-$ produced by pair production
interactions, can be reaccelerated in the induced bipolar jets and be
transported into the halo, leaving the Fermi $\gamma$-ray bubbles and WMAP
microwave haze as the remnant signal. Finally, the CRs diffuse in the bulge
could further interact with the interstellar medium to produce low energy
$e^+e^-$. After cooling down, these positrons may annihilate to produce the 511
keV line emission as discovered by INTEGRAL.
