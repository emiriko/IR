A promising practical application of entanglement is metrology, where quantum
states can be used to make measurements beyond the shot noise limit. Here we
consider how metrology schemes could be realised using atomic Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) trapped in different potentials. In particular, we show that
if a trapped BEC is rotated at just the right frequency, it can undergo a
quantum phase transition characterised by large-scale entanglement spreading
across the system. This simple process of stirring can generate interesting
quantum states such as macroscopic superpositions of all the atoms flowing in
opposite directions around a ring-shaped potential. We consider different
trapping potentials and show how this leads to different entangled states. In
particular, we find that by reducing the dimensionality of the system to one or
two dimensions, it is possible to generate entangled states that are remarkably
robust to the loss of atoms and so are ideally suited to precision measurement
schemes.
