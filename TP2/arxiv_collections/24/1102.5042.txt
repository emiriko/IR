In order to check the definite amplitude and the exact zero result of the
amplitude of three massless points $(CAA)$ in both string theory and field
theory side for $p=n$ case and to find all gauge field couplings to R-R closed
string, we investigate the disk level S-matrix element of one Ramond-Ramond
field and two gauge field vertex operators in the world volume of BPS branes.
