Today World Wide Web (WWW) has become a huge ocean of information and it is
growing in size everyday. Downloading even a fraction of this mammoth data is
like sailing through a huge ocean and it is a challenging task indeed. In order
to download a large portion of data from WWW, it has become absolutely
essential to make the crawling process parallel. In this paper we offer the
architecture of a dynamic parallel Web crawler, christened as "WEB-SAILOR,"
which presents a scalable approach based on Client-Server model to speed up the
download process on behalf of a Web Search Engine in a distributed Domain-set
specific environment. WEB-SAILOR removes the possibility of overlapping of
downloaded documents by multiple crawlers without even incurring the cost of
communication overhead among several parallel "client" crawling processes.
