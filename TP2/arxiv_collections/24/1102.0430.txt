Coagulation models assume a higher sticking threshold for micrometer-sized
ice particles than for micrometer-sized silicate particles. However, in
contrast to silicates, laboratory investigations of the collision properties of
micrometer-sized ice particles (in particular, of the most abundant water ice)
have not been conducted yet. Thus, we used two different experimental methods
to produce micrometer-sized water ice particles, i. e. by spraying water
droplets into liquid nitrogen and by spraying water droplets into a cold
nitrogen atmosphere. The mean particle radii of the ice particles produced with
these experimental methods are $(1.49 \pm 0.79) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ and $(1.45
\pm 0.65) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$. Ice aggregates composed of the micrometer-sized
ice particles are highly porous (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.11 \pm 0.01$)
or rather compact (volume filling factor: $\phi = 0.72 \pm 0.04$), depending on
the method of production. Furthermore, the critical rolling friction force of
$F_{Roll,ice}=(114.8 \pm 23.8) \times 10^{-10}\, \mathrm{N}$ was measured for
micrometer-sized ice particles, which exceeds the critical rolling friction
force of micrometer-sized $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles ($F_{Roll,SiO_2}=(12.1 \pm
3.6) \times 10^{-10}\, \mathrm{N}$). This result implies that the adhesive
bonding between micrometer-sized ice particles is stronger than the bonding
strength between $\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles. An estimation of the specific
surface energy of micrometer-sized ice particles, derived from the measured
critical rolling friction forces and the surface energy of micrometer-sized
$\mathrm{SiO_2}$ particles, results in $\gamma_{ice} = 0.190 \, \mathrm{J \,
m^{-2}}$.
