We numerically study the hyperfine induced nuclear spin dynamics in a system
of two coupled quantum dots in zero magnetic field. Each of the electron spins
is considered to interact with an individual bath of nuclear spins via
homogeneous coupling constants (all coupling coefficients being equal). In
order to lower the dimension of the problem, the two baths are approximated by
two single long spins. We demonstrate that the hyperfine interaction enables to
utilize the nuclear baths for quantum information purposes. In particular, we
show that it is possible to swap the nuclear ensembles on time scales of
seconds and indicate that it might even be possible to fully entangle them. As
a key result, it turns out that the larger the baths are, the more useful they
become as a resource of quantum information. Interestingly, the nuclear spin
dynamics strongly benefits from combining two quantum dots of different
geometry to a double dot set up.
