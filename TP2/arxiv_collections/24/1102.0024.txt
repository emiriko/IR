We report on a search for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two
bottom quarks accompanied by two additional quarks. The data sample used
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 4\,\invfb\, of
\ppbar\, collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$\,TeV recorded by the CDF II experiment.
This search includes twice the integrated luminosity of the previous published
result, uses analysis techniques to distinguish jets originating from light
flavor quarks and those from gluon radiation, and adds sensitivity to a Higgs
boson produced by vector boson fusion. We find no evidence of the Higgs boson
and place limits on the Higgs boson production cross section for Higgs boson
masses between 100\,\gevcc\, and 150\,\gevcc\, at the 95% confidence level. For
a Higgs boson mass of 120\,\gevcc\, the observed (expected) limit is
10.5\,(20.0) times the predicted Standard Model cross section.
