We compute the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate and the
polarization of quarks at zero temperature and in a uniform magnetic
background. Our theoretical framework consists of two chiral models that allow
to treat self-consistently the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry: the
linear $\sigma-$model coupled to quarks, dubbed quark-meson model, and the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We also perform analytic estimates of the same
quantities within the renormalized quark-meson model, both in the regimes of
weak and strong fields. Our numerical results are in agreement with the recent
literature; moreover, we confirm previous Lattice findings, related to the
saturation of the polarization at large fields.
