We discuss the breakdown of spatial coherence in networks of coupled
oscillators with nonlocal interaction. By systematically analyzing the
dependence of the spatio-temporal dynamics on the range and strength of
coupling, we uncover a dynamical bifurcation scenario for the
coherence-incoherence transition which starts with the appearance of narrow
layers of incoherence occupying eventually the whole space. Our findings for
coupled chaotic and periodic maps as well as for time-continuous R\"ossler
systems reveal that intermediate, partially coherent states represent
characteristic spatio-temporal patterns at the transition from coherence to
incoherence.
