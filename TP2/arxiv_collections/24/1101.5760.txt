The structure and stability of strongly charged complex fibers formed by
complexation of a single long semi-flexible polyelectrolyte (PE) chain and many
oppositely charged spherical macroions are investigated numerically at the
ground-state level using a chain-sphere cell model. The model takes into
account chain elasticity as well as electrostatic interactions between charged
spheres and chain segments. Using a numerical optimization method based on a
periodically repeated unit cell, we obtain fiber configurations that minimize
the total energy. The optimal configurations exhibit a variety of helical
structures for the arrangement of macroions including zig-zag, solenoidal and
beads-on-a-string patterns. These structures are determined by a competition
between attraction between spheres and the PE chain (which favors chain
wrapping around the spheres), chain bending and electrostatic repulsion between
chain segments (which favor unwrapping of the chain), and the interactions
between neighboring sphere-chain complexes which can be attractive or repulsive
depending on the system parameters such as medium salt concentration, macroion
charge and chain length per macroion (linker size). At about physiological salt
concentration, dense zig-zag patterns are found to be energetically most stable
when parameters appropriate for the DNA-histone system in a chromatin fiber are
adopted. In fact, the predicted fiber diameter in this regime is found to be
around 30nm, which appears to agree with the thickness observed in in vitro
experiments on chromatin. We also find a macroion density of 5-6 per 11nm which
agrees with the zig-zag or cross-linker models of chromatin. Since our study
deals primarily with a generic model, these findings suggest that
chromatin-like structures should also be observable for PE-macroion complexes
formed in solutions of DNA and synthetic nano-colloids of opposite charge.
