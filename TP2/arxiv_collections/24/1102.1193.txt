We extend the black hole/qudit correspondence by identifying five and
six-dimensional 1/2-BPS black string and hole charge vectors in N=8 and N=2
magic supergravities with qubits and qutrits over composition algebras. In D=6,
this is accomplished via Hopf fibrations, which map qubits over composition
algebras to rank one elements of Jordan algebras of degree two. An analogous
procedure maps qutrits over composition algebras to D=5 charge vectors, which
are rank one elements of Jordan algebras of degree three. In both cases, the
U-duality groups are interpreted as qudit SLOCC transformation groups. We
provide explicit gates for such transformations and study their applications in
toroidally compactified M-theory.
