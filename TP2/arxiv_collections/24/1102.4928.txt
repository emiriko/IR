The mixed spin-(1/2,1) Ising chain with axial and rhombic zero-field
splitting parameters in a presence of the longitudinal magnetic field is
exactly solved within the framework of decoration-iteration transformation and
transfer-matrix method. Our particular emphasis is laid on an investigation of
the influence of the rhombic term, which is responsible for an onset of quantum
entanglement between two magnetic states S_k^z = 1 and -1 of the spin-1 atoms.
It is shown that the rhombic term gradually destroys a classical ferrimagnetic
order in the ground state and simultaneously causes diversity in magnetization
curves including intermediate plateau regions, regions with a continuous change
in the magnetization as well as several unusual field-induced transitions
accompanied with magnetization jumps. Another interesting findings concern with
an appearance of the round minimum in the temperature dependence of
susceptibility times temperature data, the double-peak zero-field specific heat
curves and the enhanced magnetocaloric effect. The temperature dependence of
the specific heat with three separate maxima may also be detected when driving
the system through the axial and rhombic zero-field splitting parameters close
enough to a phase boundary between the ferrimagnetic and disordered states and
applying sufficiently small longitudinal magnetic field.
