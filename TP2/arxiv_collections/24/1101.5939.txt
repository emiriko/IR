We calculate low-energy proton--deuteron scattering in the framework of
pionless effective field theory. In the quartet channel, we calculate the
elastic scattering phase shift up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the power
counting. In the doublet channel, we perform a next-to-leading order
calculation. We obtain good agreement with the available phase shift analyses
down to the scattering threshold. The phase shifts in the region of
non-perturbative Coulomb interactions are calculated by using an optimised
integration mesh. Moreover, the Coulomb contribution to the 3He-3H binding
energy difference is evaluated in first order perturbation theory. We comment
on the implications of our results for the power counting of subleading
three-body forces.
