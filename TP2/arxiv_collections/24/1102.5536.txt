Consider a branching random walk on the real line with a killing barrier at
zero: starting from a nonnegative point, particles reproduce and move
independently, but are killed when they touch the negative half-line. The
population of the killed branching random walk dies out almost surely in both
critical and subcritical cases, where by subcritical case we mean that the
rightmost particle of the branching random walk without killing has a negative
speed, and by critical case, when this speed is zero. We investigate the total
progeny of the killed branching random walk and give their precise tail
distribution both in the critical and subcritical cases, which solves an open
problem of Aldous [Power laws and killed branching random walks,
