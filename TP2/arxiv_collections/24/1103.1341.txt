The purpose of the 2010 NASA Laboratory Astrophysics Workshop (LAW) was, as
given in the Charter from NASA, "to provide a forum within which the scientific
community can review the current state of knowledge in the field of Laboratory
Astrophysics, assess the critical data needs of NASA's current and future Space
Astrophysics missions, and identify the challenges and opportunities facing the
field as we begin a new decade". LAW 2010 was the fourth in a roughly
quadrennial series of such workshops sponsored by the Astrophysics Division of
the NASA Science Mission Directorate. In this White Paper, we report the
findings of the workshop.
