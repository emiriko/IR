We present radio continuum observations at frequencies ranging from $\sim$150
to 5000 MHz of the misaligned double-double radio galaxy, DDRG, 3C293
(J1352+3126) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Very
Large Array (VLA). The spectra of the outer lobes and the central source are
consistent with being straight, indicating spectral ages of $\lapp17-$23 Myr
for the outer lobes, and $\lapp$0.1 Myr for the central source. The
north-western lobe has a prominent hotspot suggesting that the interruption of
jet activity is $\lapp$0.1 Myr, consistent with the age of the inner double.
The time scale of interruption of jet activity appears significantly smaller
than observed in most other DDRGs which are often associated with giant radio
sources. These observations suggest that there is a wide range of time scales
of interruption of jet activity in active galaxies.
