We prove an analog of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem for weak
solutions of a system of PDE that model a viscoelastic fluid in the presence of
an energy damping mechanism. The system was recently introduced as a possible
method of establishing the global in time existence of weak solutions of the
well known Oldroyd system.
