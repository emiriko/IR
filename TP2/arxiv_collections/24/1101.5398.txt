Progress in computing the spectrum of excited baryons and mesons in lattice
QCD is described. Large sets of spatially-extended hadron operators are used. A
new method of stochastically estimating the low-lying effects of quark
propagation is utilized which allows reliable determinations of temporal
correlations of both single-hadron and multi-hadron operators. The method is
tested on the eta, sigma, omega mesons.
