We study a ferromagnetic tendency in the two-dimensional Hubbard model near
van Hove filling by using a functional renormalization-group method. We compute
temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibilities including incommensurate
magnetism. The ferromagnetic tendency is found to occur in a dome-shaped region
around van Hove filling with an asymmetric property: incommensurate magnetism
is favored near the edge of the dome above van Hove filling whereas a
first-order-like transition to the ferromagnetic ground state is expected below
van Hove filling. The dome-shaped phase diagram is well captured in the Stoner
theory by invoking a smaller Coulomb interaction. Triplet p-wave
superconductivity tends to develop at low temperatures inside the dome and
extends more than the ferromagnetic region above van Hove filling.
