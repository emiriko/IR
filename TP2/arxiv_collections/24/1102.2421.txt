The transiting extrasolar planet WASP-12 b was found to be one of the most
intensely irradiated exoplanets. It is unexpectedly bloated and is losing mass
that may accrete into the host star. Our aim was to refine the parameters of
this intriguing system and search for signs of transit timing variations. We
gathered high-precision light curves for two transits of WASP-12 b. Assuming
various limb-darkening laws, we generated best-fitting models and redetermined
parameters of the system. Error estimates were derived by the prayer bead
method and Monte Carlo simulations. System parameters obtained by us are found
to agree with previous studies within one sigma. Use of the non-linear
limb-darkening laws results in the best-fitting models. With two new
mid-transit times, the ephemeris was refined to BJD(TDB)=(2454508.97682 +/-
0.00020) + (1.09142245 +/- 0.00000033) E. Interestingly, indications of transit
timing variation are detected at the level of 3.4 sigma. This signal can be
induced by an additional planet in the system. Simplified numerical simulations
shows that a perturber could be a terrestrial-type planet if both planets are
in a low-order orbital resonance. However, we emphasise that further
observations are needed to confirm variation and to constrain properties of the
perturber.
