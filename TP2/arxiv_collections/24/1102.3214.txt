A code for communication over the k-receiver additive white Gaussian noise
broadcast channel with feedback is presented and analyzed using tools from the
theory of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control. It is shown that the
performance of this code depends on the noise correlation at the receivers and
it is related to the solution of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. For the
case of independent noises, the sum rate achieved by the proposed code,
satisfying average power constraint P, is characterized as 1/2 log (1+P*phi),
where the coefficient "phi" in the interval [1,k] quantifies the power gain due
to the presence of feedback. When specialized to the case of two receivers,
this includes a previous result by Elia and strictly improves upon the code of
Ozarow and Leung. When the noises are correlated, the pre-log of the
sum-capacity of the broadcast channel with feedback can be strictly greater
than one. It is established that for all noise covariance matrices of rank r
the pre-log of the sum capacity is at most k-r+1 and, conversely, there exists
a noise covariance matrix of rank r for which the proposed code achieves this
upper bound. This generalizes a previous result by Gastpar and Wigger for the
two-receiver broadcast channel.
