The novel Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach is applied
to nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC energies with respect to differential
hadronic spectra in comparison to available data. The PHSD approach is based on
a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons (DQPM) matched to reproduce recent
lattice-QCD results from the Wuppertal-Budapest group in thermodynamic
equilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is
described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs
or three quarks (antiquarks), respectively, obeying flavor
current-conservation, color neutrality as well as energy-momentum conservation.
Our dynamical studies for heavy-ion collisions at relativistic collider
energies are compared to earlier results from the Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD)
approach - incorporating no explicit dynamical partonic phase - as well as to
experimental data from the STAR, PHENIX, BRAHMS and PHOBOS collaborations for
Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. We find a
reasonable reproduction of hadron rapidity distributions and transverse mass
spectra and also a fair description of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons as
a function of the centrality of the reaction and the transverse momentum $p_T$.
Furthermore, an approximate quark-number scaling of the elliptic flow $v_2$ of
hadrons is observed in the PHSD results, too.
