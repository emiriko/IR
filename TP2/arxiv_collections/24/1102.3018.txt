In this paper we study potential function of gradient steady Ricci solitons.
We prove that infimum of potential function decays linearly; in particular,
potential function of rectifiable gradient steady Ricci solitons decays
linearly. As a consequence, we show that a gradient steady Ricci soliton with
bounded potential function must be trivial, and no gradient steady Ricci
soliton admits uniformly positive scalar curvature.
