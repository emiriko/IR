It is shown by numerical calculations that the convoluted QCD pomeron
propagator in the external field created by a solution of the
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation in the nuclear matter vanishes at high rapidities.
This may open a possibility to apply the perturbative approach for the
calculation of pomeron loops.
