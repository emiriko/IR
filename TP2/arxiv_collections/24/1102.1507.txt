Transfer entropy provides a general tool for analyzing the magnitudes and
directions---but not the \emph{kinds}---of information transfer in a system. We
extend transfer entropy in two complementary ways. First, we distinguish
state-dependent from state-independent transfer, based on whether a source's
influence depends on the state of the target. Second, for multiple sources, we
distinguish between unique, redundant, and synergistic transfer. The new
measures are demonstrated on several systems that extend examples from previous
literature.
