We make a comprehensive study of (rigid) N=1 supersymmetric sigma-models with
general K\"ahler potentials K and superpotentials w on four-dimensional
space-times with boundaries. We determine the minimal (non-supersymmetric)
boundary terms one must add to the standard bulk action to make it off-shell
invariant under half the supersymmetries without imposing any boundary
conditions. Susy boundary conditions do arise from the variational principle
when studying the dynamics. Upon including an additional boundary action that
depends on an arbitrary real boundary potential B one can generate very general
susy boundary conditions. We show that for any set of susy boundary conditions
that define a Lagrangian submanifold of the K\"ahler manifold, an appropriate
boundary potential B can be found. Thus the non-linear sigma-model on a
manifold with boundary is characterised by the tripel (K,B,w). We also discuss
the susy coupling to new boundary superfields and generalize our results to
supersymmetric junctions between completely different susy sigma-models, living
on adjacent domains and interacting through a "permeable" wall. We obtain the
supersymmetric matching conditions that allow us to couple models with
different K\"ahler potentials and superpotentials on each side of the wall.
