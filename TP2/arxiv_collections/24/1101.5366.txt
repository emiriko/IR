We discuss three different globally regular non-topological stationary
soliton solutions in the theory of a complex scalar field in 3+1 dimensions,
so-called Q-balls, Q-vortices and Q-walls. The charge, energy and profiles of
the corresponding solutions are presented for each configuration studied. The
numerical investigation of these three types of solutions shows different
behavior of charge and energy with changing frequency for each type. We
investigate properties of new families of coupled non-topological 2-Q-ball
solutions obtained within the same model by generalization of the ansatz for
the scalar field which includes an independent phase. New composite solutions
for another known model, which describes two Q-balls minimally interacting via
a coupling term, are discussed briefly.
