The tomographic transform was first introduced in the field theory literature
long ago. It is closely related to Radon transform. In this paper we show how
the tomographic transform can be implemented on a sphere and apply this result
to study surface excitations of a spherical topological insulator with a single
Dirac cone on the surface.
