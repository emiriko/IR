Most neurons in the primary visual cortex initially respond vigorously when a
preferred stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The
functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of
firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available
for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level,
adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis
as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural
variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as
well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that
implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic
adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net
effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation
mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding
accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of
the findings and relate it to published experimental data.
