The electromagnetic form factors of the Xi baryons and the semileptonic decay
process Xi_c->Xi e^+nu_e are investigated in the frame work of the light-cone
QCD sum rule method with Ioffe-type interpolating currents. Our estimates on
the magnetic moments are $mu_{Xi^0}=-(1.75\pm0.21) mu_N and
mu_{Xi^-}=-(1.01\pm0.11)mu_N. The decay width of the semileptonic process is
expected to be Gamma(\Xi_c\to \Xi
e^+\nu_e)=(6.17^{+2.24}_{-2.48})\times10^{-14}GeV. The results make sure that
the adoption of this type interpolating current improve the calculations of the
magnetic form factors and give more reliable prediction for the analysis of the
semileptonic decay process.
