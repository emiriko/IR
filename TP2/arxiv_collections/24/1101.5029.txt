Measurements of dijet azimuthal decorrelations in pp collisions at sqrt(s) =
7 TeV using the CMS detector at the CERN LHC are presented. The analysis is
based on an inclusive dijet event sample corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 2.9 inverse picobarns. The results are compared to predictions
from perturbative QCD calculations and various Monte Carlo event generators.
The dijet azimuthal distributions are found to be sensitive to initial-state
gluon radiation.
