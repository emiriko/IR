A spin-thermo-electronic valve with the free layer of exchange-spring type
and inverse magnetoresistance is investigated. The structure has S-shaped
current-voltage characteristics and can exhibit spontaneous oscillations when
integrated with a conventional capacitor within a resonator circuit. The
frequency of the oscillations can be controlled from essentially dc to the GHz
range by the circuit capacitance.
