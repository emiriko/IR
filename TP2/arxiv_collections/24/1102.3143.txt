We reapply our approach to designing nanophotonic quantum memories to
formulate an optical network that autonomously protects a single logical qubit
against arbitrary single-qubit errors. Emulating the 9 qubit Bacon-Shor
subsystem code, the network replaces the traditionally discrete syndrome
measurement and correction steps by continuous, time-independent optical
interactions and coherent feedback of unitarily processed optical fields.
