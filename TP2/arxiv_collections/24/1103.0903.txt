We revisit experimental studies performed by Ekman on dead-water using modern
techniques in order to present new insights on this peculiar phenomenon. We
extend its description to more general situations such as a three-layer fluid
or a linearly stratified fluid in presence of a pycnocline, showing the
robustness of dead-water phenomenon. We observe large amplitude nonlinear
internal waves which are coupled to the boat dynamics, and we emphasize that
the modeling of the wave-induced drag requires more analysis, taking into
account nonlinear effects.
