Entanglement degradation caused by the Unruh effect is discussed for the
tripartite GHZ or W states constructed by modes of a non-interacting quantum
field viewed by one inertial observer and two uniformly accelerated observers.
For fermionic states, the Unruh effect even for infinite accelerations cannot
completely remove the entanglement. However, for the bosonic states, the
situation is different and the entanglement vanishes asymptotically. Also, the
entanglement is studied for the bipartite subsystems. While for the GHZ states
all the bipartite subsystems are identically disentangled, for the W states the
bipartite subsystems are somewhat entangled, though, this entanglement can be
removed for appropriately accelerated observers. Interestingly, logarithmic
negativity as a measure for determining the entanglement of one part of the
system relative to the other two parts, is not generally the same for different
parts. This means that we encounter tripartite systems where each part is
differently entangled to the other two parts.
