The first step to handle semantic heterogeneity should be the attempt to
enrich the semantic information about documents, i.e. to fill up the gaps in
the documents meta-data automatically. Section 2 describes a set of cascading
deductive and heuristic extraction rules, which were developed in the project
CARMEN for the domain of Social Sciences. The mapping between different
terminologies can be done by using intellectual, statistical and/or neural
network transfer modules. Intellectual transfers use cross-concordances between
different classification schemes or thesauri. Section 3 describes the creation,
storage and handling of such transfers.
