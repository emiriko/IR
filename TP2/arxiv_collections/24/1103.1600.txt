We present results on the second-faintest pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) star
known, RAT J0455+1305, derived from photometric data obtained in 2009. It shows
both short and long periods oscillations, theoretically assigned as pressure
and gravity modes. We identify six short-period frequencies (with one being a
combination) and six long-period frequencies. This star is the fourth hybrid
sdB star discovered so far which makes it of special interest as each type of
mode probes a different part of the star. This star is similar to the sdB
hybrid pulsator Balloon 090100001 in that it exhibits short-period mode
groupings, which can be used to identify pulsation parameters and constrain
theoretical models.
