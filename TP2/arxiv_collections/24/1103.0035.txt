Context: Only recently it has become possible to measure the thermal emission
from hot-Jupiters at near-Infrared wavelengths using ground-based telescopes,
by secondary eclipse observations. This allows the planet flux to be probed
around the peak of its spectral energy distribution, which is vital for the
understanding of its energy budget. Aims: The aim of the reported work is to
measure the eclipse depth of the planet HAT-P-1b at 2.2micron. This planet is
an interesting case, since the amount of stellar irradiation it receives falls
in between that of the two best studied systems (HD209458 and HD189733), and it
has been suggested to have a weak thermal inversion layer. Methods: We have
used the LIRIS instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) to observe
the secondary eclipse of HATP-1b in the Ks-band, as part of our Ground-based
secondary eclipse (GROUSE) project. The observations were done in staring mode,
while significantly defocusing the telescope to avoid saturation on the K=8.4
star. With an average cadence of 2.5 seconds, we collected 6520 frames during
one night. Results: The eclipse is detected at the 4sigma level, the measured
depth being 0.109+/-0.025%. The uncertainties are dominated by residual
systematic effects, as estimated from different reduction/analysis procedures.
The measured depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 2136+150-170K.
This brightness temperature is significantly higher than those derived from
longer wavelengths, making it difficult to fit all available data points with a
plausible atmospheric model. However, it may be that we underestimate the true
uncertainties of our measurements, since it is notoriously difficult to assign
precise statistical significance to a result when systematic effects are
important.
