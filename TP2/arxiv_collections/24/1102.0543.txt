About one-third of the ~1200 transiting planet candidates detected in the
first four months of \ik data are members of multiple candidate systems. There
are 115 target stars with two candidate transiting planets, 45 with three, 8
with four, and one each with five and six. We characterize the dynamical
properties of these candidate multi-planet systems. The distribution of
observed period ratios shows that the vast majority of candidate pairs are
neither in nor near low-order mean motion resonances. Nonetheless, there are
small but statistically significant excesses of candidate pairs both in
resonance and spaced slightly too far apart to be in resonance, particularly
near the 2:1 resonance. We find that virtually all candidate systems are
stable, as tested by numerical integrations that assume a nominal mass-radius
relationship. Several considerations strongly suggest that the vast majority of
these multi-candidate systems are true planetary systems. Using the observed
multiplicity frequencies, we find that a single population of planetary systems
that matches the higher multiplicities underpredicts the number of
singly-transiting systems. We provide constraints on the true multiplicity and
mutual inclination distribution of the multi-candidate systems, revealing a
population of systems with multiple super-Earth-size and Neptune-size planets
with low to moderate mutual inclinations.
