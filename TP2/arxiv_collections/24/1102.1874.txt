In this paper, based on the Fokas, Gel'fand et al approach [15,16], we
provide a symmetry characterization of continuous deformations of soliton
surfaces immersed in a Lie algebra using the formalism of generalized vector
fields, their prolongation structure and links with the Fr\'echet derivatives.
We express the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such
surfaces in terms of the invariance criterion for generalized symmetries and
identify additional sufficient conditions which admit an explicit integration
of the immersion functions of 2D surfaces in Lie algebras. We discuss in detail
the $su(N)$-valued immersion functions generated by conformal symmetries of the
$CP^{N-1}$ sigma model defined on either the Minkowski or Euclidean space. We
further show that the sufficient conditions for explicit integration of such
immersion functions impose additional restrictions on the admissible conformal
symmetries of the model defined on Minkowski space. On the other hand, the
sufficient conditions are identically satisfied for arbitrary conformal
symmetries of finite action solutions of the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma model defined on
Euclidean space.
