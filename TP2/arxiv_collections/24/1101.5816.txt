In this paper we present a self consistent theoretical approach for the
calculation of the Survival Probability for central dijet production . These
calculations are performed in a model of high energy soft interactions based on
two ingredients:(i) the results of N=4 SYM, which at the moment is the only
theory that is able to deal with a large coupling constant; and (ii) the
required matching with high energy QCD. Assuming, in accordance with these
prerequisites, that soft Pomeron intercept is rather large and the slope of the
Pomeron trajectory is equal to zero, we derive analytical formulae that sum
both enhanced and semi-enhanced diagrams for elastic and diffractive
amplitudes. Using parameters obtained from a fit to the available experimental
data, we calculate the Survival Probability for central dijet production at
energies accessible at the LHC. The results presented here which include the
contribution of semi-enhanced and net diagrams, are considerably larger than
our previous estimates.
