We prove that interactive learning based classical realizability (introduced
by Aschieri and Berardi for first order arithmetic) is sound with respect to
Coquand game semantics. In particular, any realizer of an
implication-and-negation-free arithmetical formula embodies a winning recursive
strategy for the 1-Backtracking version of Tarski games. We also give examples
of realizer and winning strategy extraction for some classical proofs. We also
sketch some ongoing work about how to extend our notion of realizability in
order to obtain completeness with respect to Coquand semantics, when it is
restricted to 1-Backtracking games.
