We present a flexible Monte Carlo implementation of the perturbative
framework of High Energy Jets, describing multi-jet events at hadron colliders.
The description includes a resummation which ensures leading logarithmic
accuracy for large invariant mass between jets, and is matched to tree-level
accuracy for multiplicities up to 4 jets. The resummation includes all-order
hard corrections, which become important for increasing centre-of-mass energy
of the hadronic collision.
  We discuss observables relevant for confronting the perturbative framework
with 7 TeV data from the LHC, and the impact of the perturbative corrections on
several dijet and trijet observables which are relevant in the search for new
physics.
