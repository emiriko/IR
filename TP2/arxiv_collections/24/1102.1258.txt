This work is focused on a nonlinear equation describing the oscillations of
an extensible viscoelastic beam with fixed ends, subject to distributed elastic
external force. For a general axial load $\beta$, the existence of a
finite/infinite set of stationary solutions and buckling occurrence are
scrutinized. The exponential stability of the straight position is discussed.
Finally, the related dynamical system in the history space framework is shown
to possess a regular global attractor.
