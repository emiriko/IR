We wish to show that the root lattice of B\"acklund transformations of the
$q$-analogue of the third and fourth Painlev\'e equations, which is of type
$(A_2+ A_1)^{(1)}$, may be expressed as a quotient of the lattice of connection
preserving deformations. Furthermore, we will show various directions in the
lattice of connection preserving deformations present equivalent evolution
equations under suitable transformations. These transformations correspond to
the Dynkin diagram automorphisms.
