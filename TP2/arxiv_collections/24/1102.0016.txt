The Classical Twin Paradox is widely dealt in literature and neatly resolved.
In addition, it is also well known that, when looking at two systems which are
boosted relative to each other, the concept of the simultaneous effect of a
quantum measurement in space-time causes some discrepancies in the cause-effect
behavior. However, these discrepancies have been thought not to cause any
apparent paradox except for violating the Free-Will postulate. In this paper we
suggest that using the local t axis, all over space, as the axis in which the
quantum measurement is thought to be simultaneous, we do reach a kind of true
"Twin Paradox". The resolution of this paradox requires the introduction of a
global proper time into a covariant quantum theory.
