Power-law singularities and critical exponents in n-vector models are
considered from different theoretical points of view. It includes a theoretical
approach called the GFD (grouping of Feynman diagrams) theory, as well as the
perturbative renormalization group (RG) treatment. A non-perturbative proof
concerning corrections to scaling in the two-point correlation function of the
phi^4 model is provided, showing that predictions of the GFD theory rather than
those of the perturbative RG theory can be correct. Critical exponents
determined from highly accurate experimental data very close to the
lambda-transition point in liquid helium, as well as the Goldstone mode
singularities in n-vector spin models, evaluated from Monte Carlo simulation
results, are discussed with an aim to test the theoretical predictions. Our
analysis shows that in both cases the data can be well interpreted within the
GFD theory.
