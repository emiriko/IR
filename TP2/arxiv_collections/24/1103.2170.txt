We present a study of the dust properties of 12 classical and superbubble HII
regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We use infrared photometry from Spitzer
(8, 24, 70, and 160 \mum bands), obtained as part of the Surveying the Agents
of a Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) program, along with archival spectroscopic
classifications of the ionizing stars to examine the role of stellar sources on
dust heating and processing. Our infrared observations show surprisingly little
correlation between the emission properties of the dust and the effective
temperatures or bolometric magnitudes of stars in the HII regions, suggesting
that the HII region evolutionary timescale is not on the order of the dust
processing timescale. We find that the infrared emission of superbubbles and
classical HII regions shows little differentiation between the two classes,
despite the significant differences in age and morphology. We do detect a
correlation of the 24 \mum emission from hot dust with the ratio of 70 to 160
\mum flux. This correlation can be modeled as a trend in the temperature of a
minority hot dust component, while a majority of the dust remains significantly
cooler.
