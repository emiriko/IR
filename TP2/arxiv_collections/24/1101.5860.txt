We calculate photons from jet-plasma interaction considering collisional and
radiative energy loss of jet parton. The phase space distribution of the
participating jet is dynamically evolved by solving Fokker-Planck equation. We
treat the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$) as function of momentum and
temperature while calculating the drag and diffusion coefficients. It is
observed that the quenching factor is substantially modified as compared to the
case when $\alpha_s$ is taken as constant. It is shown that the Phenix data is
reasonably well reproduced when contributions from all the relevant sources are
taken into account.
