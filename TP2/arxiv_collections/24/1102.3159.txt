The acoustical performances of regular arrays of cylindrical elements, with
their axes aligned and parallel to a ground plane, have been investigated
through predictions and laboratory experiments. Semi-analytical predictions
based on multiple scattering theory and numerical simulations based on a
boundary element formulation have been made. Measurements have been made in an
anechoic chamber using arrays of (a) cylindrical acoustically-rigid scatterers
(PVC pipes) and (b) thin elastic shells. Insertion loss (IL) spectra due to the
arrays have been measured without and with ground planes for several receiver
heights. Data and predictions have been compared. The minima in the excess
attenuation spectrum i.e., attenuation maxima due to the ground alone resulting
from destructive interference between direct and ground-reflected sound waves,
tend to have an adverse influence on the band gaps (BG) related to a periodic
array in the free field when these two effects coincide. On the other hand, the
presence of rigid ground may result in an IL for an array near the ground
similar to or, in the case of the first BG, greater than that resulting from a
double array, equivalent to the original array plus its ground plane mirror
image, in the free field.
