We study the accretion of modified Chaplygin gas upon different types of
black hole. Modified Chaplygin gas is one of the best candidates for a combined
model of dark matter and dark energy. In addition, from a field theoretical
point of view the modified Chaplygin gas model is equivalent to that of a
scalar field having a self-interacting potential. We formulate the equations
related to both spherical accretion and disc accretion, and respective winds.
The corresponding numerical solutions of the flow, particularly of velocity,
are presented and are analyzed. We show that the accretion-wind system of
modified Chaplygin gas dramatically alters the wind solutions, producing faster
winds, upon changes in physical parameters, while accretion solutions
qualitatively remain unaffected. This implies that modified Chaplygin gas is
more prone to produce outflow which is the natural consequence of the dark
energy into the system.
