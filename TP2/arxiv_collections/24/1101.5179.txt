Tightly focused laser pulses as they diverge or converge in underdense plasma
can generate wake waves, having local structures that are spherical waves. Here
we report on theoretical study of relativistic spherical wake waves and their
properties, including wave breaking. These waves may be suitable as particle
injectors or as flying mirrors that both reflect and focus radiation, enabling
unique X-ray sources and nonlinear QED phenomena.
