In this paper, we prove even symmetry and monotonicity of certain solutions
of Allen-Cahn equation in a half plane. We also show that entire solutions with
{\it finite Morse index} and {\it four ends} must be evenly symmetric with
respect to two orthogonal axes. A classification scheme of general entire
solutions with {\it finite Morse index} is also presented using energy
quantization.
