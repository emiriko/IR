We discuss the equations for the bound one-active electron states based on
the analytic solutions of the Schrodinger and Pauli equations for a uniform
magnetic field and a single attractive $\delta({\bf r})$-potential. It is vary
important that ground electron states in the magnetic field differ essentially
from the analogous state of spin-0 particles, whose binding energy was
intensively studied more than forty years ago. We show that binding energy
equations for spin-1/2 particles can be obtained without using the language of
boundary conditions in the $\delta$-potential model developed in pioneering
works. We use the obtained equations to calculate the energy level
displacements analytically and demonstrate nonlinear dependencies on field
intensity. We show that the magnetic field indeed plays a stabilizing role in
considered systems in a case of the weak intensity, but the opposite occurs in
the case of strong intensity. These properties may be important for real
quantum mechanical fermionic systems in two and three dimensions. We also
analyze the exact solution of the Pauli equation for an electron moving in the
potential field determined by the three-dimensional $\delta$-well in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. We obtain asymptotic expressions for this
solution for different values of the problem parameters. In addition, we
consider electron probability currents and their dependence on the magnetic
field. We show that including the spin in the framework of the nonrelativistic
approach allows correctly taking the effect of the magnetic field on the
electric current into account. The obtained dependencies of the current
distribution, which is an experimentally observable quantity, can be manifested
directly in scattering processes, for example.
