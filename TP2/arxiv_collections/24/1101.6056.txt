We calculate RPA-BCS based spin resonance spectra of newly discovered
iron-selenide superconductor using two orbitals tight-binding (TB) model. The
slightly squarish electron pocket Fermi surfaces (FSs) at
$(\pi,0)/(0,\pi)-$momenta produce leading interpocket nesting instability at
incommensurate vector $q\sim(\pi,0.5\pi)$ in the normal state static
susceptibility, pinning a strong stripe-like spin-density wave (SDW) or
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at some critical value of $U$. The same nesting
also induces $d_{x^2-y^2}-$pairing. The superconducting (SC) gap is nodeless
and isotropic on the FSs as they are concentric to the four-fold symmetry point
of the $d-$wave gap maxima, in agreement with various measurements. This
induces an slightly incommensurate spin resonance with `hour-glass'-like
dispersion feature, in close agreement with neutron data of chalcogenides. We
also calculate $T$ pendence of the SC gap solving BCS gap equations and find
that the spin resonance follows the same $T$ evolution of $\Delta(T)$ both in
energy and intensity, suggesting that an itinerant weak or intermediate pair
coupling theory is relevant in this system.
