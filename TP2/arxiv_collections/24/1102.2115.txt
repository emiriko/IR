The correlated motion of electrons in multi-orbital metallic ferromagnets is
investigated in terms of a realistic Hubbard model with {\cal N}-fold orbital
degeneracy and arbitrary intra- and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions U and J
using a Goldstone-mode-preserving non-perturbative scheme. An effective quantum
parameter '\hbar'=\frac{U^2+({\cal N}-1)J^2}{(U+({\cal N}-1)J)^2} is obtained
which determines, in analogy with 1/S for quantum spin systems and 1/N for the
N-orbital Hubbard model, the strength of correlation-induced quantum
corrections to magnetic excitations. The rapid suppression of this quantum
parameter with Hund's coupling J, especially for large {\cal N}, provides
fundamental insight into the phenomenon of strong stabilization of metallic
ferromagnetism by orbital degeneracy and Hund's coupling. This approach is
illustrated for the case of ferromagnetic iron and the half metallic Heusler
alloy Co_2 Mn Si. For realistic values for iron, the calculated spin stiffness
and Curie temperature values obtained are in quantitative agreement with
measurements. Significantly, the contribution of long wavelength modes is shown
to yield a nearly ~25% reduction in the calculated Curie temperature. Finally,
an outline is presented for extending the approach to generic multi-band
metallic ferromagnets including realistic band-structure features of
non-degenerate orbitals and inter-orbital hopping as obtained from LDA
calculations.
