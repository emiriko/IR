Depth profiling of graphene with high-resolution ion beam analysis is a
practical method for analysis of monolayer thicknesses of graphene. Not only is
the energy resolution sufficient to resolve graphene from underlying SiC, but
by use of isotope labeling it is possible to tag graphene generated from
reacted ethylene. Furthermore, we are able to analyze graphene supported by
oxidized Si(100) substrates, allowing the study of graphene films grown by
chemical vapor deposition on metal and transfered to silicon. This introduces a
powerful method to explore the fundamentals of graphene formation.
