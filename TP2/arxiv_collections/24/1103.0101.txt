The key empirical property of the X-ray emission from O stars is a strong
correlation between the bolometric and X-ray luminosities. In the framework of
the Chandra Carina Complex Project, 129 O and B stars have been detected as
X-ray sources; 78 of those, all with spectral type earlier than B3, have enough
counts for at least a rough X-ray spectral characterization. This leads to an
estimate of the Lx/Lbol ratio for an exceptional number of 60 O stars belonging
to the same region and triples the number of Carina massive stars studied
spectroscopically in X-rays. The derived log(Lx/Lbol) is -7.26 for single
objects, with a dispersion of only 0.21dex. Using the properties of hot massive
stars listed in the literature, we compare the X-ray luminosities of different
types of objects. In the case of O stars, the Lx/Lbol ratios are similar for
bright and faint objects, as well as for stars of different luminosity classes
or spectral types. Binaries appear only slightly harder and slightly more
luminous in X-rays than single objects; the differences are not formally
significant (at the 1% level), except for the Lx/Lbol ratio in the medium
(1.0--2.5keV) energy band. Weak-wind objects have similar X-ray luminosities
but they display slightly softer spectra compared to "normal" O stars with the
same bolometric luminosity. Discarding three overluminous objects, we find a
very shallow trend of harder emission in brighter objects. The properties of
the few B stars bright enough to yield some spectral information appear to be
different overall (constant X-ray luminosities, harder spectra), hinting that
another mechanism for producing X-rays, besides wind shocks, might be at work.
However, it must be stressed that the earliest and X-ray brightest amongst
these few detected objects are similar to the latest O stars, suggesting a
possibly smooth transition between the two processes.
