A nanostructured chalcogenide-metal optical fiber is proposed. This hybrid
nanofiber is embedded with a periodic array of triangular-shaped
deep-subwavelength metallic nanowires set up in a bowtie configuration. Our
simulations show that the proposed nanostructured fiber supports a guided
collective plasmonic mode enabling both subwavelength field confinement and
extreme nonlinear light- matter interactions, much larger than a bare
chalcogenide nanowire of comparable diameter. This is all achieved with less
than 3% by volume of metal content.
