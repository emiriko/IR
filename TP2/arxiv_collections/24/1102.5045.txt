We study transport through a quantum dot side-coupled to two parallel
Luttinger liquid leads in the presence of a Coulombic dot-lead interaction.
This geometry enables an exact treatment of the inter-lead Coulomb
interactions. We find that for dots symmetrically disposed between the two
leads the correlation of charge fluctuations between the two leads can lead to
an enhancement of the current at the Coulomb-blockade edge and even to a
negative differential conductance. Moving the dot off center or separating the
wires further converts the enhancement to a suppression.
