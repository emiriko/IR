I outline a model where a massive particle in 4D spacetime follows a null
(photon-like) path in 5D canonical (super-spherically-symmetric) space. This
leads to wave-particle duality and quantization, along with other effects which
show that it is possible to unify general relativity and wave mechanics in a
simple fashion, given an extra dimension.
