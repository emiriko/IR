In this paper, under mild assumptions, we derive a law of large numbers, a
central limit theorem with an error estimate, an almost sure invariance
principle and a variant of Chernoff bound in finite-state hidden Markov models.
These limit theorems are of interest in certain ares in statistics and
information theory. Particularly, we apply the limit theorems to derive the
rate of convergence of the maximum likelihood estimator in finite-state hidden
Markov models.
