Logarithmic gaps have been used in order to find a periodic component of the
sequence of prime numbers, hidden by a random noise (stochastic or chaotic).
The recovered period for the sequence of the first 10000 prime numbers is equal
to 8\pm1 (subject to the prime number theorem). For small and moderate values
of the prime numbers (first 2000 prime numbers) this result has been directly
checked using the twin prime killing method.
