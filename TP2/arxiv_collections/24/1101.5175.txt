Heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory (HHchiPT) and XEFT are applied to the
decays X(3872) -> psi(2S) + gamma and psi(4040) -> X(3872) + gamma under the
assumption that the X(3872) is a molecular bound state of neutral charm mesons.
In these decays the emitted photon energies are 181 MeV and 165 MeV,
respectively, so HHchiPT can be used to calculate the underlying D^0
bar{D}^{0*}+ bar{D}^0 D^{0*} -> psi(2S) + gamma or psi(4040) -> (D^0
bar{D}^{0*}+ bar{D}^0 D^{0*}) + gamma transition. These amplitudes are matched
onto XEFT to obtain decay rates. The decays receive contributions from both
long distance and short distance processes. We study the polarization of the
psi(2S) in the decay X(3872) -> psi(2S) + gamma and the angular distribution of
X(3872) in the decay psi(4040) -> X(3872) + gamma and find they can be used to
differentiate between different decay mechanisms as well as discriminate
between 2^{-+} and 1^{++} quantum number assignments of the X(3872).
