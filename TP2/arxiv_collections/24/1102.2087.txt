We obtain a complete description of the planar cubic Cayley graphs, providing
an explicit presentation and embedding for each of them. This turns out to be a
rich class, comprising several infinite families. We obtain counterexamples to
conjectures of Mohar, Bonnington and Watkins. Our analysis makes the involved
graphs accessible to computation, corroborating a conjecture of Droms.
