We investigate the switching dynamics of multistable nematic liquid crystal
devices. In particular we identify a remarkably simple 2-dimensional (2D)
device which exploits hybrid alignment at the surfaces to yield a bistable
response. We also consider a 3-dimensional (3D) tristable nematic device with
patterned anchoring, recently implemented in practice, and discuss how the
director and disclination patterns change during switching.
