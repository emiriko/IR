We study the condition for optimizing superconductivity in the iron pnictides
from the lattice structure point of view. Studying the band structure of the
hypothetical lattice structure of LaFeAsO, the hole Fermi surface multiplicity
is found to be maximized around the Fe-As-Fe bond angle regime where the
arsenic atoms form a regular tetrahedron. Superconductivity is optimized within
this three hole Fermi surface regime, while the stoner factor of the
antiferromagnetism has an overall tendency of increasing upon decreasing the
bond angle. Combining also the effect of the varying the Fe-As bond length, we
provide a guiding principle for obtaining high $T_c$.
