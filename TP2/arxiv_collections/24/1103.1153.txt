The purpose of this paper is to place side by side the experimental results
of Piezonu- clear reactions, which have been recently unveiled, and those
collected during the last twenty years of experiments on low energy nuclear
reactions (LENR). We will briefy re- port the results of our campaign of
piezonuclear reactions experiments where ultrasounds and cavitation were
applied to solutions of stable elements. These outcomes will be shown to be
compatible with the results and evidences obtained from low energy nuclear
reac- tion experiments. Some theoretical concepts and ideas, on which our
experiments are grounded, will be sketched and it will be shown that, in order
to trigger our measured effects, it exists an energy threshold, that has to be
overcome, and a maximum inter- val of time for this energy to be released to
the nuclear system. Eventually, a research hypothesis will be put forward about
the chance to raise the level of analogy from the mere comparison of results up
to the phenomenological level. Here, among the various evidences collected in
LENR experiments, we will search for hints about the overcome of the energy
threshold and about the mechanism that releases the loaded energy in a suitable
interval of time.
