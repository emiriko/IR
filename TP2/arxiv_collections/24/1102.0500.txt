Most of the known transiting extrasolar planets orbit slowly rotating F, G or
K stars. In here we report on the detection of a transiting planet orbiting the
bright, rapidly rotating A5 star HD15082 (WASP-33b, V=8.3, m sin i = 86 km
s-1), recently made by SuperWASP. Time resolved spectroscopic observations
taken during transit show a hump caused by the planet crossing the line
profile. From the analysis of the spectra, we derive the radius of the planet
and find that it is orbiting retrograde in respect to the spin of the star.
Because of its small distance from an A5 star (the orbital period of only 1.22
days), the equilibrium temperature of the planet is estimated to be 2700 K. The
planet thus is one of the hottest planets known, which makes it relatively easy
to detect it in the IR. We thus tried to detect it using the TNG but did not
succeed.
