The mixed states are important in quantum optics since they frequently appear
in the decoherence problems. When one of the components of the system is
prepared in the mixed state and the evolution operator of this system is not
available, one cannot deduce the density matrix. We present analytical approach
to accurately solve this problem. The approach can be applied on the condition
that the Schr\"odinger's equation of the system is solvable with any arbitrary
initial state. In deriving the solution we exploit the fact that any mixed
state can be expressed in terms of a phase state. The approach is illustrated
by deriving the density matrix of a single-mode heat environment interacting
asymmetrically with two qubits. Our results are in good agreement with the
available results in the literature. This approach opens new perspectives for
treating complicated systems and may impact other applications in the quantum
theory.
