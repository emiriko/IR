Second and third order longitudinal structure functions and wavenumber
spectra of isotropic turbulence are computed using the EDQNM model and compared
to results of the multifractal formalism. At the highest Reynolds number
available in windtunnel experiments, $R_\lambda=2500$, both the multifractal
model and EDQNM give power-law corrections to the inertial range scaling of the
velocity increment skewness. For EDQNM, this correction is a finite Reynolds
number effect, whereas for the multifractal formalism it is an intermittency
correction that persists at any high Reynolds number. Furthermore, the two
approaches yield realistic behavior of second and third order statistics of the
velocity fluctuations in the dissipative and near-dissipative ranges.
Similarities and differences are highlighted, in particular the Reynolds number
dependence.
