This paper studies the throughput performance of HARQ (hybrid automatic
repeat request) protocols over block fading Gaussian channels. It proposes new
protocols that use the available feedback bit(s) not only to request a
retransmission, but also to inform the transmitter about the instantaneous
channel quality. An explicit protocol construction is given for any number of
retransmissions and any number of feedback bits. The novel protocol is shown to
simultaneously realize the gains of HARQ and of power control with partial CSI
(channel state information). Remarkable throughput improvements are shown,
especially at low and moderate SNR (signal to noise ratio), with respect to
protocols that use the feedback bits for retransmission request only. In
particular, for the case of a single retransmission and a single feedback bit,
it is shown that the repetition is not needed at low $\snr$ where the
throughput improvement is due to power control only. On the other hand, at high
SNR, the repetition is useful and the performance gain comes form a combination
of power control and ability of make up for deep fades.
