We have performed powder neutron diffraction on the new superconductor,
CeNi$_{0.8}$Bi$_2$ with a superconducting transtion temperature $T_\textrm{c}
\sim$ 4.2 K. The structural parameters of this compound at room temperature are
determined by Rietveld analysis. Below about 5 K, the clear magnetic Bragg
peaks with propagation vector $q$=(0 0 0) are observed. The observed
intensities of magnetic Bragg peaks can be explained by the magnetic structure
that the two Ce moments in the unit cell are antiparallel along c axis. The
magnetic Bragg peaks are observed in the superconducting state, indicating the
coexistence of the antiferromagnetic ordering and the superconductivity in this
compound. The intensity of magnetic Bragg peak monotonously increases with
decreasing temperature below $T_\textrm{N}$ and does not exhibit apparent
anomaly at $T_\textrm{c}$, obviously different from cases of heavy fermion
superconductors in which the magnetic ordering and the superconductivity
coexist, for example, Cd-doped CeCoIn$_5$. These results suggest that the 4$f$
electron of the Ce atom is not coupled with the superconducting carrier, and
the magnetic ordering is almost independent of the superconductivity in
CeNi$_{0.8}$Bi$_2$.
