We calculate the meson scattering and electro-production amplitudes in the
S11 partial wave in a coupled-channel approach that incorporates quasi-bound
quark-model states. Using the quark wave functions and the quark-meson
interaction from the Cloudy Bag Model, we obtain a good overall agreement with
the available experimental results for the partial widths of the N(1535) and
the N(1650) resonances as well as for the pion, eta and kaon electro-production
amplitudes. Our model is consistent with the N(1535) resonance being dominantly
a genuine three-quark state rather than a quasi-bound state of mesons and
baryons.
