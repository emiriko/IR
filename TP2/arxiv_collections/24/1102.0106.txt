MEG (Mu to Electron Gamma) is an experiment dedicated to search for the
$\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+\gamma$ decay that is strongly suppressed in the Standard
Model but predicted in several Super Symmetric extensions of it at an
accessible rate. MEG is a small-size experiment ($\approx 50-60$ physicists at
any time) with a life span of about 10 years. The limited human resource
available, in particular in the core offline group, emphasized the importance
of reusing software and exploiting existing expertise. Great care has been
devoted to provide a simple system that hides implementation details to the
average programmer. That allowed many members of the collaboration to
contribute to the development of the software of the experiment with limited
programming skill. The offline software is based on two frameworks: {\bf REM}
in FORTRAN 77 used for the event generation and detector simulation package
{\bf GEM}, based on GEANT 3, and {\bf ROME} in C++ used in the readout
simulation {\bf Bartender} and in the reconstruction and analysis program {\bf
Analyzer}. Event display in the simulation is based on GEANT 3 graphic
libraries and in the reconstruction on ROOT graphic libraries. Data are stored
in different formats in various stage of the processing. The frameworks include
utilities for input/output, database handling and format conversion transparent
to the user.
