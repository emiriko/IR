The inner structure of the attractor appearing when the
Varley-Gradwell-Hassell population model bifurcates from regular to chaotic
behaviour is studied. By algebraic and geometric arguments the coexistence of a
continuum of neutrally stable limit cycles with different periods in the
attractor is explained.
