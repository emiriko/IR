A measurement is presented for the energy flow of minimum bias events in the
forward region (3.15 <|\eta |< 4.9, where \eta is the pseudorapidity) of the
CMS detector at the LHC for center-of-mass energies sqrt(s) = 0.9 TeV, 2.36 TeV
and 7 TeV. The measurement is compared to Monte Carlo simulations, which use a
model of multiparton interactions for the underlying event. In addition,
production of forward jets was studied for the very first pp collisions at
sqrt(s) = 0.9 TeV at LHC.
