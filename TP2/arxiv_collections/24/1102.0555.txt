This paper reports the detection and the measurements of occultations of the
two transiting hot giant exoplanets Kepler-5b and Kepler-6b by their parent
stars. The observations are obtained in the near infrared with Spitzer Space
Telescope and at optical wavelengths by combining more than a year of Kepler
photometry. The investigation consists of constraining the eccentricities of
these systems and of obtaining broad band emergent spectra for individual
planets. For both targets, the occultations are detected at 3 sigma level at
each wavelength with mid-occultation times consistent with circular orbits. The
brightness temperatures of these planets are deduced from the infrared
observations and reach T=1930+/-100K and T=1660+/-120K for Kepler-5b and
Kepler-6b respectively. We measure optical geometric albedos A_g in the Kepler
bandpass and find A_g=0.12+/-0.04 for Kepler-5b and A_g=0.11+/-0.04 for
Kepler-6b leading to an upper limit for the Bond albedo of A_B < 0.17 in both
cases. The observations for both planets are best described by models for which
most of the incident energy is redistributed on the dayside, with only less
than 10% of the absorbed stellar flux redistributed to the night side of these
planets. The data for Kepler-5b favor a model without a temperature inversion,
whereas for Kepler-6b they do not allow distinguishing between models with and
without inversion.
