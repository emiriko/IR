Isoprene is one of the most abundant endogenous volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) contained in human breath and is considered to be a potentially useful
biomarker for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. However, neither the exact
biochemical origin of isoprene nor its physiological role are understood in
sufficient depth, thus hindering the validation of breath isoprene tests in
clinical routine.
  Exhaled isoprene concentrations are reported to change under different
clinical and physiological conditions, especially in response to enhanced
cardiovascular and respiratory activity. Investigating isoprene exhalation
kinetics under dynamical exercise helps to gather the relevant experimental
information for understanding the gas exchange phenomena associated with this
important VOC.
  A first model for isoprene in exhaled breath has been developed by our
research group. In the present paper, we aim at giving a concise overview of
this model and describe its role in providing supportive evidence for a
peripheral (extrahepatic) source of isoprene. In this sense, the results
presented here may enable a new perspective on the biochemical processes
governing isoprene formation in the human body.
