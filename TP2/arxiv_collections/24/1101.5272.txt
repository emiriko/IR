Fractional photon-assisted tunneling is investigated both analytically and
numerically for few interacting ultra-cold atoms in the double-wells of an
optical superlattice. This can be realized experimentally by adding periodic
shaking to an existing experimental setup [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 090404
(2008)]. Photon-assisted tunneling is visible in the particle transfer between
the wells of the individual double wells. In order to understand the physics of
the photon-assisted tunneling, an effective model based on the rotating wave
approximation is introduced. The validity of this effective approach is tested
for wide parameter ranges which are accessible to experiments in double-well
lattices. The effective model goes well beyond previous perturbation theory
approaches and is useful to investigate in particular the fractional
photon-assisted tunneling resonances. Analytic results on the level of the
experimentally realizable two-particle quantum dynamics show very good
agreement with the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation. Far from being a small effect, both the one-half-photon and the
one-third-photon resonance are shown to have large effects on the particle
transfer.
