Since its original use on the Hubble Deep Field, "Drizzle" has become a de
facto standard for the combination of images taken by the Hubble Space Tele-
scope. However, the drizzle algorithm was developed with small, faint,
partially resolved sources in mind, and is not the best possible algorithm for
high signal-to-noise unresolved objects. Here, a new method for creating
band-limited images from undersampled data is presented. The method uses a
drizzled image as a first order approximation and then rapidly converges toward
a band-limited image which fits the data given the statistical weighting
provided by the drizzled image. The method, named iDrizzle, for iterative
Drizzle, effectively eliminates both the small high-frequency artifacts and
convolution with an interpolant kernel that can be introduced by drizzling. The
method works well in the presence of geometric distortion, and can easily
handle cosmic rays, bad pixels, or other missing data. It can combine images
taken with random dithers, though the number of dithers required to obtain a
good final image depends in part on the quality of the dither placements.
iDrizzle may prove most beneficial for producing high-fidelity point spread
functions from undersampled images, and could be particularly valuable for
future Dark Energy missions such as WFIRST and EUCLID, which will likely
attempt to do high precision supernova photometry and lensing experiments with
undersampled detectors.
