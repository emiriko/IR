The excitation spectra of two-dimensional strongly coupled (liquid-like)
Yukawa systems under the influence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the
plane are found to sustain additional high-frequency modes at multiples of the
magnetoplasmon. These modes are reminiscent of the well-known Bernstein modes
but show a number of important differences due to the strong coupling of the
particles.
