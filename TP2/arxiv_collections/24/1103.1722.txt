We report on a novel experiment to generate non-classical atomic states via
quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements on cold atomic samples prepared in a
high finesse ring cavity. The heterodyne technique developed for the QND
detection exhibits an optical shot-noise limited behavior for local oscillator
optical power of a few hundred \muW, and a detection bandwidth of several GHz.
This detection tool is used in single pass to follow non destructively the
internal state evolution of an atomic sample when subjected to Rabi
oscillations or a spin-echo interferometric sequence.
