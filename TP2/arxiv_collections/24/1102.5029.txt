We examine how best to design qubits for use in topological quantum
computation. These qubits are topological Hilbert spaces associated with small
groups of anyons. Op- erations are performed on these by exchanging the anyons.
One might argue that, in order to have as many simple single qubit operations
as possible, the number of anyons per group should be maximized. However, we
show that there is a maximal number of particles per qubit, namely 4, and more
generally a maximal number of particles for qudits of dimension d. We also look
at the possibility of having topological qubits for which one can perform
two-qubit gates without leakage into non-computational states. It turns out
that the requirement that all two-qubit gates are leakage free is very
restrictive and this property can only be realized for two-qubit systems
related to Ising-like anyon models, which do not allow for universal quantum
computation by braiding. Our results follow directly from the representation
theory of braid groups which means they are valid for all anyon models. We also
make some remarks on generalizations to other exchange groups.
