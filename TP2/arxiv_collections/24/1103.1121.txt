Within the Cold Dark Matter scenario the hierarchical merging paradigm is the
natural result to form massive galactic halos by the minor mergers of sub-halos
and, by this, inherently their stellar halo. Although this must be also invoked
for the Milky Way, the context of chemical and kinematic coherence of halo
stars and dwarf spheroidal galaxies is yet unsolved a focus of present-day
research. To examine this issue we model the chemo-dynamical evolution of the
system of satellites selected from the cosmological Via Lactea II simulations
to be similar for the Milky Way environment but at an early epoch.
