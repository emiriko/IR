I report on the discovery of quantum compatible local variables that are
shared between subsystems of quantum-conventionally entangled physical systems
such that they determine the correlations of spatially separated systems while
preserving strict Einstein locality. This puts an end to the mystery of spooky
action at a distance and alleged collapse at a distance, answering vital
questions, first raised in the EPR paper, on the behaviour of spatially
separated entangled systems. The solution helps to understand quantitative
measures of entanglement in a transparent way. It also provides new insight,
consistent with strict locality, of the physics of quantum teleportation and
related phenomena.
