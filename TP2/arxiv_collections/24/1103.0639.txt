We develop a unified theory for clocks and gravimeters using the
interferences of multiple atomic waves put in levitation by traveling light
pulses. Inspired by optical methods, we exhibit a propagation invariant, which
enables to derive analytically the wave function of the sample scattering on
the light pulse sequence. A complete characterization of the device sensitivity
with respect to frequency or to acceleration measurements is obtained. These
results agree with previous numerical simulations and confirm the conjecture of
sensitivity improvement through multiple atomic wave interferences. A realistic
experimental implementation for such clock architecture is discussed.
