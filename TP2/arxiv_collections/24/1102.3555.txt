In many biological and small scale technological applications particles may
transiently bind to a cylindrical surface. In between two binding events the
particles diffuse in the bulk, thus producing an effective translation on the
cylinder surface. We here derive the effective motion on the surface, allowing
for additional diffusion on the cylinder surface itself. We find explicit
solutions for the number of adsorbed particles at one given instant, the
effective surface displacement, as well as the surface propagator. In
particular sub- and superdiffusive regimes are found, as well as an effective
stalling of diffusion visible as a plateau in the mean squared displacement. We
also investigate the corresponding first passage and first return problems.
