Entanglement between stationary systems at remote locations is a key resource
for quantum networks. We report on the experimental generation of remote
entanglement between a single atom inside an optical cavity and a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC). To produce this, a single photon is created in the
atom-cavity system, thereby generating atom-photon entanglement. The photon is
transported to the BEC and converted into a collective excitation in the BEC,
thus establishing matter-matter entanglement. After a variable delay, this
entanglement is converted into photon-photon entanglement. The matter-matter
entanglement lifetime of 100 $\mu$s exceeds the photon duration by two orders
of magnitude. The total fidelity of all concatenated operations is 95%. This
hybrid system opens up promising perspectives in the field of quantum
information.
