Steady-state turbulent motion is created in superfluid 3He-B at low
temperatures in the form of a turbulent vortex front, which moves axially along
a rotating cylindrical container of 3He-B and replaces vortex-free flow with
vortex lines at constant density. We present the first measurements on the
thermal signal from dissipation as a function of time, recorded at 0.2 Tc
during the front motion, which is monitored using NMR techniques. Both the
measurements and the numerical calculations of the vortex dynamics show that at
low temperatures the density of the propagating vortices falls well below the
equilibrium value, i.e. the superfluid rotates at a smaller angular velocity
than the container. This is the first evidence for the decoupling of the
superfluid from the container reference frame in the zero-temperature limit.
