I discuss methods and current software packages for radio searches for
pulsars and short-duration transients. I then describe the properties of the
current pulsar population and the status of and predictions for ongoing and
future surveys. The presently observed pulsar population numbers around 2000
and is expected to roughly double over the next five years, with the number of
millisecond pulsars expected to more than triple. Finally, I discuss individual
objects discovered in the Green Bank Telescope 350-MHz Drift-Scan Survey and
the Arecibo Pulsar ALFA Survey.
