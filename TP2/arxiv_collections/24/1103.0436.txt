Electronic transport in a one-dimensional mesoscopic ring threaded by a
magnetic flux is studied in presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
interactions. A completely analytical technique within a tight-binding
formalism unveils the spin-split bands in presence of the spin-orbit
interactions and leads to a method of determining the strength of the
Dresselhaus interaction. In addition to this, the persistent currents for
ordered and disordered rings have been investigated numerically. It is observed
that, the presence of the spin-orbit interaction, in general, leads to an
enhanced amplitude of the persistent current. Numerical results corroborate the
respective analytical findings.
