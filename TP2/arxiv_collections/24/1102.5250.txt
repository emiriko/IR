The quantum Hall effects, discovered about thirty years ago have remained one
of the most spectacular discoveries in condensed matter physics in the past
century. Those discoveries triggered huge expansion in the field of
low-dimensional electronic systems, the area grew at an unprecedented rate and
continues to expand. Novel and challenging observations, be it theoretical or
experimental, have been reported since then on a regular basis. Additionally,
the effects have inspired physicists to find analogous situations in far-flung
fields as disparate as string theory or black hole physics.
