The set of experimental data on the X-ray-excited luminescence and X-ray
induced conductivity of ZnSe are compared to the data on the photoluminescence
and photoconductivity. It is experimentally established that the
current-voltage characteristics and the kinetics of phosphorescence and current
relaxation depend on the type of excitation. It is found that the external
electric field influences the intensity and shape of bands in the luminescence
spectra. It is shown that the character of excitation defines the kinetics of
recombination, charge carrier trapping, and conductivity in wide-gap
semiconductors.
