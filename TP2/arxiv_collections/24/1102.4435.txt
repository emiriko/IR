The Cosmic Defect theory has been confronted with four observational
constraints: primordial nuclear species abundances emerging from the big bang
nucleosynthesis; large scale structure formation in the universe; cosmic
microwave background acoustic scale; luminosity distances of type Ia
supernovae. The test has been based on a statistical analysis of the a
posteriori probabilities for three parameters of the theory. The result has
been quite satisfactory and such that the performance of the theory is not
distinguishable from the one of the Lambda-CDM theory. The use of the optimal
values of the parameters for the calculation of the Hubble constant and the age
of the universe confirms the compatibility of the Cosmic Defect approach with
observations.
