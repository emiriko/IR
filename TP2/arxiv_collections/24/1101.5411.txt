In a previous work it was shown that the best measure for the efficiency of a
single burst-correcting code is obtained using the Gallager bound as opposed to
the Reiger bound. In this paper, an efficient algorithm that searches for the
best (shortened) cyclic burst-correcting codes is presented. Using this
algorithm, extensive tables that either tie existing constructions or improve
them are obtained for burst lengths up to b=10.
