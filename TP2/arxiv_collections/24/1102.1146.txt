We consider the lambda-coalescent processes with positive frequency of
singleton clusters. The class in focus covers, for instance, the
beta$(a,b)$-coalescents with $a>1$. We show that some large-sample properties
of these processes can be derived by coupling the coalescent with an increasing
L{\'e}vy process (subordinator), and by exploiting parallels with the theory of
regenerative composition structures. In particular, we discuss the limit
distributions of the absorption time and the number of collisions.
