We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study
of the iron-based superconductor PrFeAsO_{0.7} and examined the Fermi surfaces
and band dispersions near the Fermi level. Heavily hole-doped electronic states
have been observed due to the polar nature of the cleaved surfaces.
Nevertheless, we have found that the ARPES spectra basically agree with band
dispersions calculated in the local density approximation (LDA) if the
bandwidth is reduced by a factor of ~2.5 and then the chemical potential is
lowered by ~70 meV. Comparison with previous ARPES results on LaFePO reveals
that the energy positions of the d_{3z^2-r^2}- and d_{yz,zx}-derived bands are
considerably different between the two materials, which we attribute to the
different pnictogen height as predicted by the LDA calculation.
