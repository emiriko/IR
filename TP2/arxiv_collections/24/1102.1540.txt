We show that the mathematical structure of Gibbsian thermodynamics flows from
the following simple elements: the state space of a thermodynamical substance
is a measure space together with two orderings (corresponding to "warmer than"
and "adiabatically accessible from") which satisfy certain plausible physical
axioms and an area condition which was introduced by Paul Samuelson. We show
how the basic identities of thermodynamics, in particular the Maxwell
relations, follow and so the existence of energy, free energy, enthalpy and the
Gibbs potential function. We also discuss some questions which we have not
found dealt with in the literature, such as the amount of information required
to reconstruct the equations of state of a substance and a systematic approach
to thermodynamical identities.
