This paper describes an empirical study of shortfall optimization with Barra
Extreme Risk. We compare minimum shortfall to minimum variance portfolios in
the US, UK, and Japanese equity markets using Barra Style Factors (Value,
Growth, Momentum, etc.). We show that minimizing shortfall generally improves
performance over minimizing variance, especially during down-markets, over the
period 1985-2010. The outperformance of shortfall is due to intuitive tilts
towards protective factors like Value, and away from aggressive factors like
Growth and Momentum. The outperformance is largest for the shortfall that
measures overall asymmetry rather than the extreme losses.
