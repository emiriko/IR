We consider an electroweak model based on the gauge symmetry SU(2)_L X
U(1)_Y' X U(1)_B-L which has right-handed neutrinos with different exotic B-L
quantum numbers. Because of this particular feature we are able to write Yukawa
terms, and right-handed neutrino mass terms, with scalar fields that can
develop vacuum expectation values belonging to different energy scales. We make
a detailed study of the scalar and the Yukawa neutrino sectors to show that
this model is compatible with the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino mass
scales and the tribimaximal mixing matrix.We also show that there are dark
matter candidates if a Z_2 symmetry is included.
