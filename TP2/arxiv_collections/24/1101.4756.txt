We investigate coupled circle maps in presence of feedback and explore
various dynamical phases observed in this system of coupled high dimensional
maps. We observe an interesting transition from localized chaos to
spatiotemporal chaos. We study this transition as a dynamic phase transition.
We observe that persistence acts as an excellent quantifier to describe this
transition. Taking the location of the fixed point of circle map (which does
not change with feedback) as a reference point, we compute number of sites
which have been greater than (less than) the fixed point till time t. Though
local dynamics is high-dimensional in this case this definition of persistence
which tracks a single variable is an excellent quantifier for this transition.
In most cases, we also obtain a well defined persistence exponent at the
critical point and observe conventional scaling as seen in second order phase
transitions. This indicates that persistence could work as good order parameter
for transitions from fully or partially arrested phase. We also give an
explanation of gaps in eigenvalue spectrum of the Jacobian of localized state.
