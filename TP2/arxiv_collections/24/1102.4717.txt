We present an updated calibration of the Swift/UVOT broadband ultraviolet
(uvw1, uvm2, and uvw2) filters. The new calibration accounts for the ~1% per
year decline in the UVOT sensitivity observed in all filters, and makes use of
additional calibration sources with a wider range of colours and with HST
spectrophotometry. In this paper we present the new effective area curves and
instrumental photometric zeropoints and compare with the previous calibration.
