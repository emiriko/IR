Since 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope has provided groundbreaking views of
Galactic star formation in bands from 3.6 past 24 microns. During the cryogenic
mission (the first 5.5 years), variability of young stars at these bands was
noted, although typically with just a few epochs of observation. The cryogen
ran out in 2009, and we are now in the warm mission era where the shortest two
bands (3.6 and 4.5 microns) continue to function essentially as before. The
phenomenal sensitivity and stability of Spitzer at these bands has enabled
several dedicated monitoring programs studying the variability of young stars
at timescales from minutes to years. The largest of these programs is YSOVAR
(Stauffer et al.), but there are several smaller programs as well. With at
least as many as 2200 young star light curves likely to come out of this, these
programs as a whole enable more detailed study of the young star-disk
interaction in the infrared for a wider range of ages and masses than has ever
been accomplished before. Early results suggest a wide variety of sources of
variability, including dust clouds in the disk, disk warps, star spots, and
accretion. This contribution will review some of the most recent results from
these programs.
