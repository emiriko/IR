In this paper, we prove a general theorem concerning the analyticity of the
closure of a subspace defined by a family of variations of mixed Hodge
structures, which includes the analyticity of the zero loci of degenerating
normal functions. For the proof, we use a moduli of the valuative version of
log mixed Hodge structures.
