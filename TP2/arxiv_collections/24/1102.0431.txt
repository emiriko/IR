Let M be a Margulis spacetime whose associated complete hyperbolic surface S
has compact convex core. Generalizing the correspondence between closed
geodesics on M and closed geodesics on S, we establish an orbit equivalence
between recurrent spacelike geodesics on M and recurrent geodesics on S. In
contrast, no timelike geodesic recurs in either forward or backwards time.
