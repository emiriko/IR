Variability in Business Process modeling has already been faced by different
authors from the literature. Depending on the context in which each author
faces the modeling problem, we find different approaches (C-EPC, C-YAWL,
FEATURE-EPC, PESOA, PROVOP, or WORKLETS). In this report we present four of the
most representative approaches (C-EPC, PESOA, PROVOP and WORKLETS) which are
presented by means of the different case studies found in the literature.
