The recent progress in R&D of the Micromegas detectors for hadronic
calorimetry including new engineering-technical solutions, electronics
development, and accompanying simulation studies with emphasis on the
comparison of the physics performance of the analog and digital readout is
described. The developed prototypes are with 2 bit digital readout to exploit
the Micromegas proportional mode and thus improve the calorimeter linearity. In
addition, measurements of detection efficiency, hit multiplicity, and energy
shower profiles obtained during the exposure of small size prototypes to
radioactive source quanta, cosmic particles and accelerator beams are reported.
Eventually, the status of a large scale chamber (1{\times}1 m2) are also
presented with prospective towards the construction of a 1 m3 digital
calorimeter consisting of 40 such chambers.
