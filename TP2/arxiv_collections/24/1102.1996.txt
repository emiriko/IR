The \emph{Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} has surveyed the entire sky at
four infrared wavelengths with greatly improved sensitivity and spatial
resolution compared to its predecessors, the \emph{Infrared Astronomical
Satellite} and the \emph{Cosmic Background Explorer}. NASA's Planetary Science
Division has funded an enhancement to the \WISE\ data processing system called
"NEOWISE" that allows detection and archiving of moving objects found in the
\WISE\ data. NEOWISE has mined the \WISE\ images for a wide array of small
bodies in our Solar System, including Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), Main Belt
asteroids, comets, Trojans, and Centaurs. By the end of survey operations in
February 2011, NEOWISE identified over 157,000 asteroids, including more than
500 NEOs and $\sim$120 comets. The NEOWISE dataset will enable a panoply of new
scientific investigations.
