We review progress on the use of electron spins to store and process quantum
information, with particular focus on the ability of the electron spin to
interact with multiple quantum degrees of freedom. We examine the benefits of
hybrid quantum bits (qubits) in the solid state that are based on coupling
electron spins to nuclear spin, electron charge, optical photons, and
superconducting qubits. These benefits include the coherent storage of qubits
for times exceeding seconds, fast qubit manipulation, single qubit measurement,
and scalable methods for entangling spatially separated matter-based qubits. In
this way, the key strengths of different physical qubit implementations are
brought together, laying the foundation for practical solid-state quantum
technologies.
