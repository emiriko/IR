We present the results of C18O(J=1-0) mapping observations of a 20'x18' area
in the Lynds 1204 molecular cloud associated with the Sharpless 2-140 (S140) H
II region. The C18O cube (alpha-delta-vLSR) data shows that there are three
clumps with sizes of \sim 1 pc in the region. Two of them have peculiar red
shifted velocity components at their edges, which can be interpreted as the
results of the interaction between the cloud and the Cepheus Bubble. From the
C18O cube data, the clumpfind identified 123 C18O cores, which have mean
radius, velocity width in FWHM, and LTE mass of 0.36\pm0.07 pc, 0.37\pm0.09 km
s-1, and 41\pm29 Msun, respectively. All the cores in S140 are most likely to
be gravitationally bound by considering the uncertainty in the C18O abundance.
We derived a C18O core mass function (CMF), which shows a power-law-like
behavior above a turnover at 30 Msun. The best-fit power-law index of
-2.1\pm0.2 is quite consistent with those of the IMF and the C18O CMF in the
OMC-1 region by Ikeda & Kitamura (2009). Kramer et al. (1998) estimated the
power-law index of -1.65 in S140 from the C18O(J=2-1) data, which is
inconsistent with this study. However, the C18O(J=2-1) data are spatially
limited to the central part of the cloud and are likely to be biased toward
high-mass cores, leading to the flatter CMF. Consequently, this study and our
previous one strongly support that the power-law form of the IMF has been
already determined at the density of \sim 10^{3-4} cm^{-3}, traced by the
C18O(J=1-0) line.
