We present the first lattice calculation of nucleon matrix elements using
four dynamical flavors. We use the $N_f=2+1+1$ maximally twisted mass
formulation. The renormalization is performed non-perturbatively in the
RI$^\prime$-MOM scheme and results are given for the vector and axial vector
operators with up to one-derivative. Our calculation of the average momentum of
the unpolarized non-singlet parton distribution is presented and compared to
our previous results obtained from the $N_f=2$ case.
