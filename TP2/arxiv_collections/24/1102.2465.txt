Control of spatial quantum correlations in bi-photons is one of the
fundamental principles of Quantum Imaging. Up to now, experiments have been
restricted to controlling the state of a single bi-photon, by using linear
optical elements. In this work we demonstrate experimental control of quantum
correlations in a four-photon state comprised of two pairs of photons. Our
scheme is based on a high-efficiency parametric downconversion source coupled
to a double slit by a variable linear optical setup, in order to obtain
spatially encoded qubits. Both entangled and separable pairs have been
obtained, by altering experimental parameters. We show how the correlations
influence both the interference and diffraction on the double slit.
