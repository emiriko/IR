It was shown that the including spin of 2d electrons at high magnetic field
is possible to remove the divergencies in the cores of the vortex lattice and
construct the topologically stable states. These states can be considered as
the lattices of skyrmions where the unit cell is mapped on the whole sphere of
spin directions.That gives the gapped ground state for electrons and can be
used as a model for FQHE.
