The Paschen-Back effect influences the Zeeman sublevels of the He I multiplet
at 10830 {\AA}, leading to changes in strength and in position of the Zeeman
components of these lines. We illustrate the relevance of this effect using
synthetic Stokes profiles of the He I 10830 {\AA} multiplet lines and
investigate its influence on the inversion of polarimetric data. We invert data
obtained with the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP) at the German Vacuum
Tower Telescope (VTT). We compare the results of inversions based on synthetic
profiles calculated with and without the Paschen-Back effect being included. We
find that when taking into account the incomplete Paschen-Back effect, on
average 16% higher field strength values are obtained. We also show that this
effect is not the main cause for the area asymmetry exhibited by many He I
10830 Stokes V-profiles. This points to the importance of velocity and magnetic
field gradients over the formation height range of these lines.
