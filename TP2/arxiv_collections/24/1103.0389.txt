The concept of extremely dense matter at supra-nuclear density was first
speculated by L. Landau in the beginning of 1930s when neutron was just
discovered. A historical review on these issues not only explains the
interaction between micro and cosmic physics, but also has profound
implications for scientific innovation. It is surely meaningful in realistic
physics education to look back to this history. (The review was published in
Chinese.)
