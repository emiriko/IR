Advances on the formation and survival of the so-called Tidal Dwarf Galaxies
(TDGs) are reviewed. The understanding on how objects of the mass of dwarf
galaxies may form in debris of galactic collisions has recently benefited from
the coupling of multi-wavelength observations with numerical simulations of
galaxy mergers. Nonetheless, no consensual scenario has yet emerged and as a
matter of fact the very definition of TDGs remains elusive. Their real
cosmological importance is also a matter of debate, their presence in our Local
Group of galaxies as well. Identifying old, evolved, TDGs among the population
of regular dwarf galaxies and satellites may not be straightforward. However a
number of specific properties (location, dark matter and metal content) that
objects of tidal origin should have are reminded here. Examples of newly
discovered genuine old TDGs around a nearby elliptical galaxy are finally
presented.
