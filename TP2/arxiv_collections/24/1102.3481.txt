We investigate the ordering instability of interacting (and for simplicity,
spinless) fermions on graphene's honeycomb lattice by numerically computing the
Hartree self-consistent solution for the charge-density-wave order parameter in
presence of both uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields. For a uniform field
the overall behavior of the order parameter is found to be in accord with the
continuum theory. In the inhomogeneous case, the spatial profile of the order
parameter resembles qualitatively the form of the magnetic field itself, at
least when the interaction is not overly strong. We find that right at the
zero-field critical point of the infinite system the local order parameter
scales as the square-root of the local strength of the magnetic field,
apparently independently of the assumed field's profile. The finite size
effects on various parameters of interest, such as the critical interaction and
the universal amplitude ratio of the interaction-induced gap to the Landau
level energy at criticality are also addressed.
