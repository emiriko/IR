We present results of deep direct imaging of the radial velocity (RV)
planet-host star 14 Her (=GJ 614, HD 145675), obtained in the \lprime ~band
with the Clio-2 camera and the MMT adaptive optics system. This star has one
confirmed planet and an unconfirmed outer companion, suggested by residuals in
the RV data. The orbital parameters of the unconfirmed object are not well
constrained since many mass/semimajor axis configurations can fit the available
data. The star has been directly imaged several times, but none of the
campaigns has ruled out sub-stellar companions. With \about 2.5 hrs of
integration, we rule out at 5$\sigma$ confidence $\gtrsim$ 18 \mj ~companions
beyond \about 25 AU, based on the \cite{baraffe} COND mass-luminosity models.
Combining our detection limits with fits to the RV data and analytic dynamical
analysis, we constrain the orbital parameters of 14 Her c to be: $3 \lesssim
m/$\mj ~$\lesssim 42$, $7 \lesssim a/$AU $\lesssim 25$, and $e \lesssim 0.5$. A
wealth of information can be obtained from RV/direct imaging overlap,
especially with deep imaging as this work shows. The collaboration between RV
and direct imaging will become more important in the coming years as the phase
space probed by each technique converges. Future studies involving RV/imaging
overlap should be sure to consider the effects of a potential planet's
projected separation, as quoting limits assuming face-on orientation will be
misleading.
