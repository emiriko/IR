The energetic balance of the Standard Solar Model (SSM) results from an
equilibrium between nuclear energy production, energy transfer, and
photospheric emission. In this letter, we derive an order of magnitude of
several % for the loss of energy in kinetic energy, magnetic energy, and X or
UV radiation during the whole solar lifetime from the observations of the
present Sun. We also estimate the mass loss from the observations of young
solar analogs which could reach up to 30% of the current mass. We deduce new
models of the present Sun, their associated neutrino fluxes, and their internal
sound-speed profile. This approach sheds quantitative lights on the
disagreement between the sound speed obtained by helioseismology and the sound
speed derived from the SSM including the updated photospheric CNO abundances,
based on recent observations. We conclude that about 20% of the present
discrepancy could come from the incorrect description of the early phases of
the Sun, its activity, its initial mass and mass-loss history. This study has
obvious consequences on the solar system formation and the early evolution of
the closest planets.
