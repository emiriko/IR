Several widely used methods for the calculation of band structures and photo
emission spectra, such as the GW approximation, rely on Many-Body Perturbation
Theory. They can be obtained by iterating a set of functional differential
equations relating the one-particle Green's function to its functional
derivative with respect to an external perturbing potential. In the present
work we apply a linear response expansion in order to obtain insights in
various approximations for Green's functions calculations. The expansion leads
to an effective screening, while keeping the effects of the interaction to all
orders. In order to study various aspects of the resulting equations we
discretize them, and retain only one point in space, spin, and time for all
variables. Within this one-point model we obtain an explicit solution for the
Green's function, which allows us to explore the structure of the general
family of solutions, and to determine the specific solution that corresponds to
the physical one. Moreover we analyze the performances of established
approaches like $GW$ over the whole range of interaction strength, and we
explore alternative approximations. Finally we link certain approximations for
the exact solution to the corresponding manipulations for the differential
equation which produce them. This link is crucial in view of a generalization
of our findings to the real (multidimensional functional) case where only the
differential equation is known.
