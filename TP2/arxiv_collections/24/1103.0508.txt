Bubble nucleation in weakly supersaturated solutions of carbon dioxide - such
as champagne, sparkling wines and carbonated beers - is well understood.
Bubbles grow and detach from nucleation sites: gas pockets trapped within
hollow cellulose fibres. This mechanism appears not to be active in stout beers
that are supersaturated solutions of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In their
canned forms these beers require additional technology (widgets) to release the
bubbles which will form the head of the beer. We extend the mathematical model
of bubble nucleation in carbonated liquids to the case of two gasses and show
that this nucleation mechanism is active in stout beers, though substantially
slower than in carbonated beers and confirm this by observation. A rough
calculation suggests that despite the slowness of the process, applying a
coating of hollow porous fibres to the inside of a can or bottle could be a
potential replacement for widgets.
