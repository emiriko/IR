Recent results and data suggests that high magnetic field in neutron stars
(NS) strongly affects the characteristic (radius, mass) of the star. They are
even separated as a class known as magnetars, for whom the surface magnetic
field are greater than $10^{14}$ G. In this work we discuss the effect of such
high magnetic field on the phase transition of NS to quark star (QS). We study
the effect of magnetic field on the transition from NS to QS including the
magnetic field effect in equation of state (EoS). The inclusion of the magnetic
field increases the range of baryon number density, for which the flow
velocities of the matter in the respective phase are finite. The magnetic field
helps in initiation of the conversion process. The velocity of the conversion
front however decreases due to the presence of magnetic field, as the presence
of magnetic field reduces the effective pressure (P). The magnetic field of the
star gets decreased by the conversion process, and the resultant QS has lower
magnetic field than that of the initial NS.
