We study the structural properties of a quasi-one-dimensional classical
Wigner crystal, confined in the transverse direction by a parabolic potential.
With increasing density, the one-dimensional crystal first splits into a zigzag
crystal before progressively more rows appear. While up to four rows the ground
state possesses a regular structure, five-row crystals exhibit defects in a
certain density regime. We identify two phases with different types of defects.
Furthermore, using a simplified model, we show that beyond nine rows no stable
regular structures exist.
