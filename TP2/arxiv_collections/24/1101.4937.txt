Since many thermodynamic properties of black holes are universal, the
thermodynamics of their holographic duals should be universal too. We show how
this universality is exhibited in the example of symmetric orbifolds of general
two dimensional CFTs. We discuss the free energies and phase diagrams of such
theories and show that they are indeed universal in the large N limit. We also
comment on the implications of our results for the classification of CFTs that
can have an interpretation as holographic duals to gravity theories on AdS(3).
