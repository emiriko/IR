We present a general formalism to the problem of perfect state-transfer
(PST), where the state involves multiple excitations of the quantum network. A
key feature of our formalism is that it allows for inclusion of nontrivial
interactions between the excitations. Hence, it is perfectly suited to
addressing the problem of PST in the context of various types of physical
realizations. The general formalism is also flexible enough to account for
situations where multiple excitations are "focused" onto the same site.
