We apply Dirac's square root idea to constraints for embedded 4-geometries
swept by a 3-dimensional membrane. The resulting Dirac-like equation is then
analyzed for general coordinates as well as for the case of a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric for spatially closed geometries. The problem
of the singularity formation at quantum level is addressed.
