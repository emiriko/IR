We collect explicit and user-friendly expressions for one-point densities of
the real eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}$ of $N\times N$ Wishart-Laguerre and Jacobi
random matrices with orthogonal, unitary and symplectic symmetry. Using these
formulae, we compute integer moments $\tau_n=<\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_i^n>$ for all
symmetry classes without any large $N$ approximation. In particular, our
results provide exact expressions for moments of transmission eigenvalues in
chaotic cavities with time-reversal or spin-flip symmetry and supporting a
finite and arbitrary number of electronic channels in the two incoming leads.
