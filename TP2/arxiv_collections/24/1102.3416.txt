Liquid drop impact and penetration into a granular layer are investigated
with diverse liquids and granular materials. We use various size of SiC
abrasives and glass beads as a target granular material. We also employ ethanol
and glycerol aqueous solutions as well as distilled water to make a liquid
drop. The liquid drop impacts the granular layer with a low speed (~ m/s). The
drop deformation and penetration are captured by a high speed camera. From the
video data, characteristic time scales are measured. Using a laser profilometry
system, resultant crater morphology and its characteristic length scales are
measured. Static strength of the granular layer is also measured by the slow
pillar penetration experiment to quantify the cohesive force effect. We find
that the time scales are almost independent of impact speed, but they depend on
liquid drop viscosity. Particularly, the penetration time is proportional to
the square root of the liquid drop viscosity. Contrastively, the crater radius
is independent of the liquid drop viscosity. The crater radius is scaled by the
same form as the previous paper, (Katsuragi, Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 104, 2010,
p. 218001).
