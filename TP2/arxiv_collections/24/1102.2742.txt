Twenty-one eclipsing binaries were selected for an analysis from a huge
database of observations made by the INTEGRAL/OMC camera. The photometric data
were processed and analyzed, resulting in a first light-curve study of these
neglected eclipsing binaries. In several systems from this sample even their
orbital periods have been confirmed or modified. Thirty-two new minima times of
these binaries have been derived.
