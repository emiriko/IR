Active-sterile neutrino mixing is strongly constrained for m_s > 100 keV to
avoid excessive energy losses from supernova cores. For smaller m_s, matter
effects suppress the effective mixing angle except for a resonant range of
energies where it is enhanced. We study the case of \nu_tau-\nu_s-mixing where
a \nu_tau-\bar\nu_tau asymmetry builds up due to the strong excess of \nu_s
over \bar\nu_s emission or vice versa, reducing the overall emission rate. In
the warm dark matter range m_s < 10 keV the mixing angle is essentially
unconstrained.
