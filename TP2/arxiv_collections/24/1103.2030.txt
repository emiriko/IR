This is a survey of some very old knowledge about Mutually Unbiased Bases
(MUB) and Symmetric Informationally Complete POVMs (SIC). In prime dimensions
the former are closely tied to an elliptic normal curve symmetric under the
Heisenberg group, while the latter are believed to be orbits under the
Heisenberg group in all dimensions. In dimensions 3 and 4 the SICs are
understandable in terms of elliptic curves, but a general statement escapes us.
The geometry of the SICs in 3 and 4 dimensions is discussed in some detail.
