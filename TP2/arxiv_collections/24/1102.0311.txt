We present optical and infrared characterization of the polluted DAZ white
dwarf GALEX J193156.8+011745. Imaging and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet to
the thermal infrared indicates that the white dwarf hosts excess infrared
emission consistent with the presence of an orbiting dusty debris disk. In
addition to the five elements previously identified, our optical echelle
spectroscopy reveals chromium and manganese and enables restrictive upper
limits on several other elements. Synthesis of all detections and upper limits
suggests that the white dwarf has accreted a differentiated parent body. We
compare the inferred bulk elemental composition of the accreted parent body to
expectations for the bulk composition of an Earth-like planet stripped of its
crust and mantle and find relatively good agreement. At least two processes
could be important in shaping the final bulk elemental composition of rocky
bodies during the late phases of stellar evolution: irradiation and interaction
with the dense stellar wind.
