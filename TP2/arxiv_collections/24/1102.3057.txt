Aim of this work is to calculate explicitly the result of the experiment of
superposition of a mirror in the Michelson photon cavities interferometric
device proposed by Marshall, Simon, Penrose and Bownmeester, as expected within
a recently proposed model of non-unitary self-gravity inducing localization. As
for other proposals of modifications of Quantum Mechanics in a non-unitary
sense, aimed to account for both unitary evolution and irreversible collapse,
like in the famous Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber and Pearle's models, it turns out
that, for the experimental parameters proposed, no effect is detectable at all.
It is pointed out that the enhancing properties of matter granularity does not
substantially change this conclusion. Parameters have also been exploratively
varied in a certain range beyond the proposed values. It is shown that within
`sensible' parameters, that are not yet attainable within current technology,
the model exhibits a peculiar signature with respect to other collapse models
as far as parameters space is explored. Besides, the calculation offers a way
to see non-unitary gravity at work in a quasi-realistic setting.
