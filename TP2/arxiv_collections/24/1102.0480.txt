In this paper, we design high order accurate and stable finite difference
schemes for the initial-boundary value problem, associated with the magnetic
induction equation with resistivity. We use Summation-By-Parts (SBP) finite
difference operators to approximate spatial derivatives and a Simultaneous
Approximation Term (SAT) technique for implementing boundary conditions. The
resulting schemes are shown to be energy stable. Various numerical experiments
demonstrating both the stability and the high order of accuracy of the schemes
are presented.
