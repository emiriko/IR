We study the implementation of global $SO(4)\sim SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R$
symmetry in general potentials with N-Higgs-doublets in order to obtain models
with custodial $SO(3)_C$ symmetry. We conclude that any implementation of the
custodial SO(4) symmetry is equivalent, by a basis transformation, to a
canonical one if $SU(2)_L$ is the gauge factor, $U(1)_Y$ is embedded in
$SU(2)_R$ and we require $N$ copies of the doublet representation of $SU(2)_R$.
The invariance by SO(4) automatically leads to a CP invariant potential and the
basis of the canonical implementation of SO(4) is aligned to a basis where
CP-symmetry acts in the standard fashion. We show different but equivalent
implementations for the 2HDM, including an implementation not previously
considered.
