Bilayer graphene nanoribbon with zigzag edge is investigated with the tight
binding model. Two stacking structures, alpha and beta, are considered. The
band splitting is seen in the alpha structure, while the splitting in the wave
number direction is found in the beta structure. The local density of states in
the beta structure tend to avoid sites where inter-layer hopping interactions
are present.
