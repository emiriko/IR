Rank two momentum tensors, free of mass singularities, are often used for
identification and analysis of two and three hadronic jet events. Based on
Monte-Carlo generated events, we find that for sufficiently high energies, the
tensor invariants provide the characteristics of a three-jet event, without
assigning the particles to the jets. Furthermore, the combined application of
rank two and rank three momentum tensors, provides a signature for a 3-jet
event.
