A radiative-dynamic positive feedback mechanism (Wind Enhanced Interaction of
Radiation and Dust: WEIRD) for localized Mars dust disturbances was previously
found to operate in highly idealized numerical experiments. Numerical
simulations are used to test for the presence and quantitative effect of the
radiative-dynamic WEIRD feedback mechanism under more realistic conditions.
Comparisons between cases where lifted dust is radiatively active and
radiatively passive elucidate the importance of the dust radiative forcing on
the thermodynamic and kinematic structure of the atmosphere. The WEIRD feedback
mechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked
and diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms. Globally increased
dust loading is found to accelerate the local winds while simultaneously
diminishing the impact of local physiographical forcing. Local enhancements of
dust produce a thermal and dynamical response that resembles many of the
essential features seen in the idealized experiments. The development of a warm
core low, rotational wind tendencies and convergence boundaries intersecting at
the center of the strongest dust storms are consistent with WEIRD. Local and
regional storms are effective at producing elevated dust layers above the
boundary layer aided by the radiative forcing of the dust. Ubiquitous and
persistent thermal circulations associated with topography can also inject dust
into the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer, but they are less
efficient than the dust storms. High concentrations of dust in the lowest
levels of the atmosphere produce a significant and dramatic heating of the
ground and the near-surface air despite greatly reduced insolation at the
surface.
