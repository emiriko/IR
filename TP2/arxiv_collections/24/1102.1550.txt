Paramagnetic centers in a solid-state environment usually give rise to
inhomogenously broadened electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lines, making
conventionally detected free induction decay (FID) signals disappear within the
spectrometer dead time. Here, experimental results of an electrically detected
FID of phosphorus donors in silicon epilayers with natural isotope composition
are presented, showing Ramsey fringes within the first 150 ns. An analytical
model is developed to account for the data obtained as well as for the results
of analogous two-pulse echo experiments. The results of a numerical calculation
are further presented to assess the capability of the method to study spin-spin
interactions.
