The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) has opened an Evening Tutoring
Center to provide after-hours tutoring every evening before class days. The
center focuses on first and second year courses in challenging quantitative
disciplines: mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering mechanics.
Staffed exclusively by faculty-level instructors, the center offers extra
instruction to all first and second year cadets. Early demand has been
remarkable, and early indications are that cadets who visit the center for
extra instruction in mathematics perform better than peers with comparable
backgrounds.
