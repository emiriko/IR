A new category of algebro-geometric objects is defined. This construction is
a vast generalization of existing F1-theories, as it contains the the theory of
monoid schemes on the one hand and classical algebraic theory, e.g.
Grothendieck schemes, on the the other. It also gives a handy description of
Berkovich subdomains and thus contains Berkovich's approach to abstract
skeletons. Further it complements the theory of monoid schemes in view of
number theoretic applications as congruence schemes encode number theoretical
information as opposed to combinatorial data which are seen by monoid schemes.
