In this paper we report a new sol-gel method for the fabrication of MgB2
films. Polycrystalline MgB2 films were prepared by spin-coating a precursor
solution of Mg(BH_4)_2 diethyl ether on (001)Al2O3 substrates followed with
annealing in Mg vapor. In comparison with the MgB2 films grown by other
techniques, our films show medium qualities including a superconducting
transition temperature of Tc ~ 37 K, a critical current density of Jc(5 K, 0 T)
~ 5 {\times} 10^6 A cm^{-2}, and a critical field of H_{c2}(0) ~ 19 T. Such a
sol-gel technique shows potential in the commercial fabrication of practically
used MgB2 films as well as MgB2 wires and tapes.
