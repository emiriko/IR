Suppose that $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ without
complex multiplication and with conductor $N$. For each positive integer $m$,
the action of the absolute Galois group
$G_{\mathbb{Q}}=\operatorname{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ on the torsion
points over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ gives rise to a representation of
$G_\mathbb{Q}$. A celebrated paper of Serre shows that this representation is
surjective for all sufficiently large primes; the other primes are termed
\emph{exceptional}. Serre conjectures that there are no exceptional primes
$\ell>37$ for any non CM elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. The best result in
this direction is due to Cojocaru, who proves that the largest exceptional
prime $\ell_0\ll_{\epsilon} N^{1+\epsilon}$. In this paper we lower the
exponent on the bound to obtain $\ell_0\ll_{\epsilon} N_0^{1/4}+\epsilon}$,
where $N_0$ is the product of primes of bad reduction. If $E$ has no places of
multiplicative reduction, then we have $\ell_0\ll_{\epsilon}N^{1/8}+\epsilon}$.
Assuming the Frey-Szpiro conjecture, we have that
$\ell_0\ll_{\epsilon}N^{1/8}+\epsilon}$ in general. Our main methods include
the Rankin-Selberg method and the classical work on distribution of quadratic
residues.
