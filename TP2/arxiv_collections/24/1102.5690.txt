We predict the existence of transverse electric (TE) plasmons in bilayer
graphene. We find that their plasmonic properties are much more pronounced in
bilayer than in monolayer graphene, in a sense that they can get more localized
at frequencies just below $\hbar\omega=0.4$~eV for adequate doping values. This
is a consequence of the perfectly nested bands in bilayer graphene which are
separated by $\sim 0.4$~eV.
