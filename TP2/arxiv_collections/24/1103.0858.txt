We report on microwave measurements on DyBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\rm\delta}$
monodomains grown by the top-seeded melt-textured technique. We measured the
field increase of the surface resistance $R_{\rm s}(H)$ in the a-b plane at
48.3 GHz. Measurements were performed at fixed temperatures in the range 70 K -
$T_{\rm c}$ with a static magnetic field $\mu_0H<0.8$ T parallel to the c-axis.
Low field steep increase of the dissipation, typical signature of the presence
of weak links, is absent, thus indicating the single-domain behaviour of the
sample under study. The magnetic field dependence of $R_{\rm s}(H)$ is ascribed
to the dissipation caused by vortex motion. The analysis of $X_{\rm s}(H)$
points to a free-flow regime, thus allowing to obtain the vortex viscosity as a
function of temperature. We compare the results with those obtained on RE-BCO
systems. In particular, we consider strongly pinned films of
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\rm\delta}$ with nanometric BaZrO$_3$ inclusions.
