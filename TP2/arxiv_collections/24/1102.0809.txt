In the present work we focus on the case of (few-site) configurations
respecting the PT-symmetry. We examine the case of such "oligomers" with not
only 2-sites, as in earlier works, but also the cases of 3- and 4-sites. While
in the former case of recent experimental interest, the picture of existing
stationary solutions and their stability is fairly straightforward, the latter
cases reveal a considerable additional complexity of solutions, including ones
that exist past the linear PT-breaking point in the case of the trimer, and
more complex, even asymmetric solutions in the case of the quadrimer with
nontrivial spectral and dynamical properties. Both the linear stability and the
nonlinear dynamical properties of the obtained solutions are discussed.
