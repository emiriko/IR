Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory we derive factorization formulae for
semi-inclusive processes where a light hadron h fragments from a jet whose
invariant mass is measured. Our analysis yields a novel "fragmenting jet
function" G_i^h(s,z) that depends on the jet invariant mass \sqrt{s}, and on
the fraction z of the large light-cone momentum components of the hadron and
the parent parton i. We show that G_i^h(s,z) can be computed in terms of
perturbatively calculable coefficients, J_{ij}(s,z/x), integrated against
standard non-perturbative fragmentation functions, D_j^h(x). Our analysis
yields a simple replacement rule that allows any factorization theorem
depending on a jet function J_i to be converted to a semi-inclusive process
with a fragmenting hadron h.
