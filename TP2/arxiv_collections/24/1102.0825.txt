Following a previous work [Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 43 (2011)], we further study
the behavior of a real scalar field in a hidden brane in a configuration of two
branes embedded in a five dimensional bulk. We find an expression for the
equation of state for this scalar field in the visible brane in terms of the
fields of the hidden one. Additionally, we investigated the perturbations
produced by this scalar field in the visible brane with the aim to study their
dynamical properties. Our results show that if the kinetic energy of the scalar
field dominates during the early universe the perturbed scalar field could
mimic the observed dynamics for the dark matter in the standard paradigm. Thus,
the scalar field dark matter hypothesis in the context of braneworld theory
could be an interesting alternative to the nature of dark matter in the
Universe.
