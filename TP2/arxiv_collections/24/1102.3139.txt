The behavior of the average energy for an ensemble of non-interacting
particles is studied using scaling arguments in a dissipative time-dependent
stadium-like billiard. The dynamics of the system is described by a four
dimensional nonlinear mapping. The dissipation is introduced via inelastic
collisions between the particles and the moving boundary. For different
combinations of initial velocities and damping coefficients, the long time
dynamics of the particles leads them to reach different states of final energy
and to visit different attractors, which change as the dissipation is varied.
The decay of the average energy of the particles, which is observed for a large
range of restitution coefficients and different initial velocities, is
described using scaling arguments. Since this system exhibits unlimited energy
growth in the absence of dissipation, our results for the dissipative case give
support to the principle that Fermi acceleration seem not to be a structurally
stable phenomenon.
