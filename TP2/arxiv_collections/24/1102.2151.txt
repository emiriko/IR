Several technical aspects concerning the evaluation of the overlap between
two mean field wave functions of the Hartree Fock Bogoliubov type, are
discussed. The limit when several orbitals become fully occupied is derived as
well as the formula to reduce the dimensionality of the problem when exactly
empty orbitals are present. The formalism is also extended to deal with the
case where the bases of each of the wave functions are different. Several
practical results concerning the evaluation of pfaffians as well as the
canonical decomposition of norm overlaps are also discussed in the appendices.
