In this paper we perform canonical quantization of the product of the gauged
WZW models on a strip with boundary conditions specified by permutation branes.
We show that the phase space of the $N$-fold product of the gauged WZW model
$G/H$ on a strip with boundary conditions given by permutation branes is
symplectomorphic to the phase space of the double Chern-Simons theory on a
sphere with $N$ holes times the time-line with $G$ and $H$ gauge fields both
coupled to two Wilson lines. For the special case of the topological coset
$G/G$ we arrive at the conclusion that the phase space of the $N$-fold product
of the topological coset $G/G$ on a strip with boundary conditions given by
permutation branes is symplectomorphic to the phase space of Chern-Simons
theory on a Riemann surface of the genus $N-1$ times the time-line with four
Wilson lines.
