Let k be a field. A finite dimensional k-algebra is said to be minimal
representation-infinite provided it is representation-infinite and all its
proper factor algebras are representation-finite. Our aim is to classify the
special biserial algebras which are minimal representation-infinite. The second
part describes the corresponding module categories.
