We analyse a simple Standard Model (SM) extension with only two new light
fields: a scalar partner of the top (stop) (with mass above m_t) and a light
neutral fermion chi^0 (with mass of a few GeV), coupled to SM quarks via a
Yukawa interaction. We show that such model can lead to a significant
enhancement of the forward-backward asymmetry in t tbar production at the
Tevatron via the additional t tbar pairs produced from (stop anti-stop) decays.
The model satisfies existing constraints on new-physics searches both at low
and high energies, and could even address the cosmological dark-matter
abundance. The implications for future searches at the LHC are briefly
outlined.
