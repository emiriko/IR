We investigate the single-point velocity probability density function (PDF)
in three-dimensional fully developed homogeneous isotropic turbulence within
the framework of PDF equations focussing on deviations from Gaussianity. A
joint analytical and numerical analysis shows that these deviations may be
quantified studying correlations of dynamical quantities like pressure
gradient, external forcing and energy dissipation with the velocity. A
stationary solution for the PDF equation in terms of these quantities is
presented, and the theory is validated with the help of direct numerical
simulations indicating sub-Gaussian tails of the PDF.
