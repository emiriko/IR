All second order scalar differential invariants of symplectic hyperbolic and
elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equations with respect to symplectomorphisms are
explicitly computed. In particular, it is shown that the number of independent
second order invariants is equal to 7, in sharp contrast with general
Monge-Amp\`ere equations for which this number is equal to 2. We also introduce
a series of invariant differential forms and vector fields which allows us to
construct numerous scalar differential invariants of higher order. The
introduced invariants give a solution of the symplectic equivalence of
Monge-Amp\`ere equations. As an example we study quasilinear equations of a
suitable kind and in particular find a simple linearization criterion.
