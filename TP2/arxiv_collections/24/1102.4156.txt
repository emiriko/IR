Recently we generalized Toponogov's comparison theorem to a complete
Riemannian manifold with smooth convex boundary, where a geodesic triangle was
replaced by an open (geodesic) triangle standing on the boundary of the
manifold, and a model surface was replaced by the universal covering surface of
a cylinder of revolution with totally geodesic boundary. The aim of this
article is to prove splitting theorems of two types as an application.
Moreover, we establish a weaker version of our Toponogov comparison theorem for
open triangles, because the weaker version is quite enough to prove one of the
splitting theorems.
