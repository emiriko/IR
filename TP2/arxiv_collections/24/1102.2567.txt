We show that as a consequence of basic properties of elementary arithmetic
journal impact factors show a counterintuitive behaviour with respect to adding
non-cited articles. Synchronous as well as diachronous journal impact factors
are affected. Our findings provide a rationale for not taking uncitable
publications into account in impact factor calculations, at least if these
items are truly uncitable.
