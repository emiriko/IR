In this work we present a platform for testing the device performance of a
cavity-emitter system, using an ensemble of emitters and a tapered optical
fiber. This method provides high-contrast spectra of the cavity modes,
selective detection of emitters coupled to the cavity, and an estimate of the
device performance in the single- emitter case. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
centers in diamond and a GaP optical microcavity, we are able to tune the
cavity onto the NV resonance at 10 K, couple the cavity-coupled emission to a
tapered fiber, and measure the fiber-coupled NV spontaneous emission decay.
Theoretically we show that the fiber-coupled average Purcell factor is 2-3
times greater than that of free-space collection; although due to ensemble
averaging it is still a factor of 3 less than the Purcell factor of a single,
ideally placed center.
