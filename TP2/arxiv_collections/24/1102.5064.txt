Universal quantum computation can be achieved by simply performing
single-qubit measurements on a highly entangled resource state, such as cluster
states. The family of Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states has recently been
intensively explored and shown to provide restricted computation. Here, we show
that the two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state on a honeycomb
lattice is a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation.
