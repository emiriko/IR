We present a pulsing protocol that significantly increases the endurance of a
titanium-manganite interface used as a binary memory cell. The core of this
protocol is an algorithm that searches for the proper values for the set and
reset pulses, canceling the drift in the resistance values. A set of
experiments show the drift-free operation for more than $10^{5}$ switching
cycles, as well as the detrimental effect by changing the amplitude of pulses
indicated by the protocol. We reproduced the results with a numerical model,
which provides information on the dynamics of the oxygen vacancies during the
switching cycles.
