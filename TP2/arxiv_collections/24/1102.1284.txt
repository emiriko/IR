By using a reductive perturbation technique applied to a two-level model,
this study puts forward a generic two-dimensional sine-Gordon evolution
equation governing the propagation of femtosecond spatiotemporal optical
solitons in Kerr media beyond the slowly varying envelope approximation. Direct
numerical simulations show that, in contrast to the long-wave approximation, no
collapse occurs, and that robust (2+1)-dimensional ultrashort light bullets may
form from adequately chosen few-cycle input spatiotemporal wave forms. In
contrast to the case of quadratic nonlinearity, the light bullets oscillate in
both space and time and are therefore not steady-state lumps.
