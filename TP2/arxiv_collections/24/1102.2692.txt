Anti-symmetric localized surface plasmons are demonstrated on a single silver
nanostrip sandwiched by SiC layers. By employing the resonance of
anti-symmetric localized surface plasmons, we enable single metal nanobricks to
produce optical magnetism, in the blue and violet light range, as well as in a
part of the ultraviolet light range. The physical mechanism is explained.
