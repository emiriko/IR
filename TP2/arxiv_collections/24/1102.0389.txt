We use Rice formulae in order to compute the moments of some level
functionals which are linked to problems in oceanography and optics: the number
of specular points in one and two dimensions, the distribution of the normal
angle of level curves and the number of dislocations in random wavefronts. We
compute expectations and, in some cases, also second moments of such
functionals. Moments of order greater than one are more involved, but one needs
them whenever one wants to perform statistical inference on some parameters in
the model or to test the model itself. In some cases, we are able to use these
computations to obtain a central limit theorem.
