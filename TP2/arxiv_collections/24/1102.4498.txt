The paper describes a general glance to the use of element exchange
techniques for optimization over permutations. A multi-level description of
problems is proposed which is a fundamental to understand nature and complexity
of optimization problems over permutations (e.g., ordering, scheduling,
traveling salesman problem). The description is based on permutation
neighborhoods of several kinds (e.g., by improvement of an objective function).
Our proposed operational digraph and its kinds can be considered as a way to
understand convexity and polynomial solvability for combinatorial optimization
problems over permutations. Issues of an analysis of problems and a design of
hierarchical heuristics are discussed. The discussion leads to a multi-level
adaptive algorithm system which analyzes an individual problem and
selects/designs a solving strategy (trajectory).
