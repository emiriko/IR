A hypotheses of energy loss for polarization of e-e+ vacuum by a photon
passing interstellar space is considered. An excitation and relaxation of
vacuum can't run with speed of light due to very small but finite fraction of
e-e+ pair mass that creates a retardment in recuperation of deposited energy
back to photon. This "forgotten" by many photons energy is finally splashed out
in real space as a Relic Radiation. An assumption that such energy loss is
proportional to a photon energy conforms to Hubble low of Red Shift and
experimental data treated as accelerated expansion of Universe. A possibility
of an observation of this type energy loss is considered at high-energy
accelerators where energy deposition may reach up hundreds MeV in second.
