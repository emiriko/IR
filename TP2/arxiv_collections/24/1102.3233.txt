Quantum communication devices, such as quantum repeaters, quantum memories,
or quantum channels, are unavoidably exposed to imperfections. However, the
presence of imperfections can be tolerated, as long as we can verify such
devices retain their quantum advantages. Benchmarks based on witnessing
entanglement have proven useful for verifying the true quantum nature of these
devices. The next challenge is to characterize how strongly a device is within
the quantum domain. We present a method, based on entanglement measures and
rigorous state truncation, which allows us to characterize the degree of
quantumness of optical devices. This method serves as a quantitative extension
to a large class of previously-known quantum benchmarks, requiring no
additional information beyond what is already used for the non-quantitative
benchmarks.
