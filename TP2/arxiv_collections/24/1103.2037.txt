We investigate the self-assembly (crystallisation) of particles with hard
cores and isotropic, square-well interactions, using a Monte Carlo scheme to
simulate overdamped Langevin dynamics. We measure correlation and response
functions during the early stages of assembly, and we analyse the results using
fluctuation-dissipation theorems, aiming to predict which systems will
self-assemble successfully and which will get stuck in disordered states. The
early-time correlation and response measurements are made before significant
crystallisation has taken place, indicating that dynamical measurements are
valuable in measuring a system's propensity for kinetic trapping.
