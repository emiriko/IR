We study the effects of network topology on the response of networks of
coupled discrete excitable systems to an external stochastic stimulus. We
extend recent results that characterize the response in terms of spectral
properties of the adjacency matrix by allowing distributions in the
transmission delays and in the number of refractory states, and by developing a
nonperturbative approximation to the steady state network response. We confirm
our theoretical results with numerical simulations. We find that the steady
state response amplitude is inversely proportional to the duration of
refractoriness, which reduces the maximum attainable dynamic range. We also
find that transmission delays alter the time required to reach steady state.
Importantly, neither delays nor refractoriness impact the general prediction
that criticality and maximum dynamic range occur when the largest eigenvalue of
the adjacency matrix is unity.
