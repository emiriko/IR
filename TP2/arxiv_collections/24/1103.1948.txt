We present recent studies on the effective mass of the nucleon in infinite
and homogeneous nuclear matter and its relation to nuclear matter properties
within the framework of the in-medium modified Skyrme model. Medium
modifications are achieved by introducing optical potential for pion fields and
parametrization of the Skyrme parameter in nuclear medium. The present approach
is phenomenologically well justified by pion physics in nuclear matter and
describe successfully bulk nuclear matter properties.
