The stability is analyzed of the magnetic junction collinear configurations
against small fluctuations under amplitude-modulated current with CPP mode.
High spin injection is assumed. Under parametric resonance conditions, with the
modulation frequency twice the precession frequency, instability is possible of
one, or another, or both the collinear configurations. When the dc component of
the current density exceeds the instability threshold of the antiparallel
configuration, the parametric instability is suppressed by nonparametric one
which is induced by the dc current. The parametric instability manifests itself
as lowering the threshold of the dc current density in presence of the
high-frequency current, such an effect has been observed in experiments
repeatedly.
