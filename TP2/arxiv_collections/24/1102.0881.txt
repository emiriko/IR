Pure metals (Cu, Ti, Zr, V, Pd) and diluted Pd-alloys (Pd-Ag, Pd-Pt, Pd-Ru,
Pd-Rh) were implanted by 25 keV deuterium ions at fluences in the range
(1.2{\div}2.3)x1022 D+/m2. The post-treatment depth distributions of deuterium
ions were measured 10 days and three months after the implantation using
Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA) and Rutherford Backscattering (RBS).
Comparison of the obtained results allowed to make conclusions about relative
stability of deuterium and hydrogen gases in pure metals and diluted Pd alloys.
Very high diffusion rates of implanted deuterium ions from V and Pd pure metals
and Pd alloys were observed. Small-angle X-ray scattering revealed formation of
nanosized defects in implanted corundum and titanium.
