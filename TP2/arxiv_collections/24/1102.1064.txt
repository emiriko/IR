We analyze the database research publications of four major core database
technology conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, EDBT), two main theoretical
database conferences (PODS, ICDT) and three database journals (TODS, VLDB
Journal, TKDE) over a period of 10 years (2001 - 2010). Our analysis considers
only regular papers as we do not include short papers, demo papers, posters,
tutorials or panels into our statistics. We rank the research scholars
according to their number of publication in each conference/journal separately
and in combined. We also report about the growth in the number of research
publications and the size of the research community in the last decade.
