Since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in oxy-pnictide
LaFeAsO1-xFx, enormous interests have been stimulated in the field of condensed
matter physics and material sciences. Among the many kind of structures in the
iron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special
attention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical
composition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting
transition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as
high as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the
superconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide
KxFe2-ySe2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are
both observed in KxFe2-ySe2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have
tuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio
of starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest
that the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies
as well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic
moment 3.4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on
a single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast
quenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the
superconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating
behavior again. The spatial distribution of the compositions of the as-grown
sample and the post-annealed-quenched one was analyzed by the Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectrum (EDXS) and found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is
tempting to conclude that the superconductivity is achieved when the
Fe-vacancies are in a random (disordered) state. Once they arrange in an
ordered state by relaxation or slow cooling, the system turns out to be an
insulator.
