A quantum theory on conformation-electron system is presented. Protein
folding is regarded as the quantum transition between torsion states on
polypeptide chain, and the folding rate is calculated by nonadiabatic operator
method. The theory is used to study the temperature dependences of folding rate
of 15 proteins and their non-Arrhenius behavior can all be deduced in a natural
way. A general formula on the rate-temperature dependence has been deduced
which is in good accordance with experimental data. These temperature
dependences are further analyzed in terms of torsion potential parameters. Our
results show it is necessary to move outside the realm of classical physics
when the temperature dependence of protein folding is studied quantitatively.
