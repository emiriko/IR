The magnetic ground states of the isostructural double perovskites
Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and Ba$_2$LiOsO$_6$ are investigated with muon-spin rotation.
In Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ long-range magnetic order is detected via the onset of a
spontaneous muon-spin precession signal below $T_{\mathrm{c}}=7.2\pm
0.2\;\mathrm{K}$, while in Ba$_2$LiOsO$_6$ a static but spatially-disordered
internal field is found below 8 K. A novel probabilistic argument is used to
show from the observed precession frequencies that the magnetic ground state in
Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ is most likely to be low-moment ($\approx 0.2$\,$\mu_{\rm B}$)
ferromagnetism and not canted antiferromagnetism. Ba$_2$LiOsO$_6$ is
antiferromagnetic and we find a spin-flop transition at 5.5\,T. A reduced
osmium moment is common to both compounds, probably arising from a combination
of spin-orbit coupling and frustration.
