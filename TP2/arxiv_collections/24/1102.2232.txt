Consider a linear ordering equipped with a finite sequence of monadic
predicates. If the ordering contains an interval of order type \omega or
-\omega, and the monadic second-order theory of the combined structure is
decidable, there exists a non-trivial expansion by a further monadic predicate
that is still decidable.
