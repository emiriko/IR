Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field K. Let h be an element
of order 4 in the Shafarevich-Tate group of E. We prove that h is visible in
infinitely many abelian surfaces up to isomorphism. This is to say that there
are infinitely many abelian surfaces J such that E\hookrightarrow J and h lies
in the kernel of the natural map H^1(K,E)\rightarrow H^1(K,J).
