The spectrum of electrons and positrons originating from vacuum decay
occurring in the collision of two non-colinear laser pulses is obtained. It
displays high energy, highly-collimated particle bunches traveling in a
direction separate from the laser beams. This result provides an unmistakable
signature of the vacuum decay phenomenon and could suggest a new avenue for
development of high energy electron and/or positron beams.
