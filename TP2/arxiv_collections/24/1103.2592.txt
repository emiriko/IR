The present status of the Lambda(1405) structure study in chiral dynamics is
briefly reviewed. It turns out that the Lambda(1405) resonance can be described
by hadronic dynamics. The idea of the hadronic molecular state is extended to
kaonic few-body states. It is concluded that, due to the fact that K and N have
similar coupling nature in s-wave Kbar couplings, there are few-body quasibound
states with kaons systematically just below the break-up thresholds, like
KbarNN, KbarKN and KbarKK, as well as Lambda(1405) as a KbarN quasibound state
and f_0(980) and a_0(980) as KbarK.
