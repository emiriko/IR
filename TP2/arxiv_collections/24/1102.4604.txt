A variety of heterogeneous potentials are capable of localizing linear
non-interacting waves. In this work, we review different examples of
heterogeneous localizing potentials which were realized in experiments. We then
discuss the impact of nonlinearity induced by wave interactions, in particular
its destructive effect on the localizing properties of the heterogeneous
potentials.
