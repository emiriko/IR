The time evolution of atmospheric dust at high southern latitudes on Mars has
been determined using observations of the south seasonal cap acquired in the
near infrared (1-2.65 {\mu}m) by OMEGA/Mars Express in 2005. Observations at
different solar zenith angles and one EPF sequence demonstrate that the
reflectance in the 2.64 {\mu}m saturated absorption band of the surface CO2 ice
is mainly due to the light scattered by aerosols above most places of the
seasonal cap. We have mapped the total optical depth of dust aerosols in the
near-IR above the south seasonal cap of Mars from mid-spring to early summer
with a time resolution ranging from one day to one week and a spatial
resolution of a few kilometers. The optical depth above the south perennial cap
is determined on a longer time range covering southern spring and summer. A
constant set of optical properties of dust aerosols is consistent with OMEGA
observations during the analyzed period. Strong variations of the optical depth
are observed over small horizontal and temporal scales, corresponding in part
to moving dust clouds. The late summer peak in dust opacity observed by
Opportunity in 2005 propagated to the south pole contrarily to that observed in
mid spring. This may be linked to evidence for dust scavenging by water
ice-rich clouds circulating at high southern latitudes at this season.
