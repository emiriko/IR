A search for the decays Bs-->mumu and Bd-->mumu is performed with about 37
pb^{-1} of pp collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV collected by the LHCb experiment at
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The observed numbers of events are
consistent with the background expectations. The resulting upper limits on the
branching ratios are BR(Bs-->mumu) < 5.6 x 10^{-8} and BR(Bd-->mumu) <1.5 x
10^{-8} at 95% confidence level.
