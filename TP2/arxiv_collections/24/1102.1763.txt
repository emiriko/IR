A special case of the Fateev-Zamolodchikov model is studied resulting in a
solution of the Yang-Baxter equation with two spectral parameters. Integrable
models from this solution are shown to have the symmetry of the Drinfeld double
of a dihedral group. Viewing this solution as a descendant of the zero-field
six-vertex model allows for the construction of functional relations and Bethe
ansatz equations.
