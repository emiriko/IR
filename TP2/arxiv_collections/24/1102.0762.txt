We study the protocol known as quantum state transfer for a strongly coupled
antiferromagnetic spin chain or ring (acting as a spin bus), with weakly
coupled external qubits. By treating the weak coupling as a perturbation, we
find that perfect state transfer (PST) is possible when second order terms are
included in the expansion. We also show that PST is robust against variations
in the couplings along the spin bus and between the bus and the qubits. As
evidence of the quantum interference which mediates PST, we show that the
optimal time for PST can be smaller with larger qubit separations, for an
even-size chain or ring.
