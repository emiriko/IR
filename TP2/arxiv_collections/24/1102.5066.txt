We study the spin-dependent transmission through interfaces between a
HgTe/CdTe quantum well (QW) and a metal - both for the normal metal and the
superconducting case. Interestingly, we discover a new type of spin Hall effect
at these interfaces that happens to exist even in the absence of structure and
bulk inversion asymmetry within each subsystem (i.e. the QW and the metal).
Thus, this is a pure boundary spin Hall effect which can be directly related to
the existence of exponentially localized edge states at the interface. We
demonstrate how this effect can be measured and functionalized for an
all-electric spin injection into normal metal leads.
