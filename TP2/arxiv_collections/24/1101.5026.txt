A refinement of uniform resolvent estimate is given and several smoothing
estimates for Schrodinger equations in the critical case are induced from it.
The relation between this resolvent estimate and radiation condition is
discussed. As an application of critical smoothing estimates, we show a global
existence results for derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equations.
