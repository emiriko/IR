By means of molecular dynamics simulations based on the Billeter et al. [S.
R. Billeter, A. Curioni, D. Fischer, and W. Andreoni, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 73},
155329] environment-dependent classical force field we studied the structural
features of SiN$_x$ samples at various stoichiometries. Our results are in good
agreement with experimental data and are able to reproduce some features which
so far were not reproduced by simulations. In particular, we identified units
containing N--N bonds, which are thought to be responsible for an unassigned
peak in the radial distribution function obtained from neutron diffraction data
and signals observed in electron spin resonance, X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy and optical absorption
experiments.
  We have identified defects which are thought to be the responsible for the
high concentration of charge traps that makes this material suitable for
building non-volatile memory devices. We analyzed the dependency of the
concentration of these defects with the stoichiometry of the sample.
