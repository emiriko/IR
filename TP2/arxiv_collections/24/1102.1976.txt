We report the detection of X-ray emission from the symbiotic star V1329 Cyg
with XMM-Newton. The spectrum from the EPIC pn, MOS1 and MOS2 instruments
consists of a two-temperature plasma with k T = 0.11 keV and k T = 0.93 keV.
Unlike the vast majority of symbiotic stars detected in X-rays, the soft
component of the spectrum seems to be absorbed only by interstellar material.
The shock velocities corresponding to the observed temperatures are about 300
km/s and about 900 km/s. We did not find either periodic or aperiodic X-ray
variability, with upper limits on the amplitudes of such variations being 46 %
and 16 % (rms), respectively. We also did not find any ultraviolet variability
with an rms amplitude of more than approximately 1 %. The derived velocities
and the unabsorbed nature of the soft component of the X-ray spectrum suggest
that some portion of the high energy emission could originate in shocks within
a jet and beyond the symbiotic nebula. The lower velocity is consistent with
the expansion velocity of the extended structure present in HST observations.
The higher velocity could be associated with an internal shock at the base of
the jet or with shocks in the accretion region.
