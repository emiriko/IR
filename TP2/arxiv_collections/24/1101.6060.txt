Full control over the spatio-temporal structure of quantum states of light is
an important goal in quantum optics, to generate for instance single-mode
quantum pulses or to encode information on multiple modes, enhancing channel
capacities. Quantum light pulses feature an inherent, rich spectral
broadband-mode structure. In recent years, exploring the use of integrated
optics as well as source-engineering has led to a deep understanding of the
pulse-mode structure of guided quantum states of light. In addition, several
groups have started to investigate the manipulation of quantum states by means
of single-photon frequency conversion. In this paper we explore new routes
towards complete control of the inherent pulse-modes of ultrafast pulsed
quantum states by employing specifically designed nonlinear waveguides with
adapted dispersion properties. Starting from our recently proposed quantum
pulse gate (QPG) we further generalize the concept of spatio-spectral
engineering for arbitrary $\chitwo$-based quantum processes. We analyse the
sum-frequency generation based QPG and introduce the difference-frequency
generation based quantum pulse shaper (QPS). Together, these versatile and
robust integrated optics devices allow for arbitrary manipulations of the
pulse-mode structure of ultrafast pulsed quantum states. The QPG can be
utilized to select an arbitrary pulse mode from a multimode input state,
whereas the QPS enables the generation of specific pulse modes from an input
wavepacket with Gaussian-shaped spectrum.
