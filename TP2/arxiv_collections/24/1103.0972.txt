We introduce an approach for the accurate calculation of thermal properties
of classical nanoclusters. Based on a recently developed enhanced sampling
technique, replica exchange metadynamics, the method yields the true free
energy of each relevant cluster structure, directly sampling its basin and
measuring its occupancy in full equilibrium. All entropy sources, whether
vibrational, rotational anharmonic and especially configurational -- the latter
often forgotten in many cluster studies -- are automatically included. For the
present demonstration we choose the water nonamer (H2O)9, an extremely simple
cluster which nonetheless displays a sufficient complexity and interesting
physics in its relevant structure spectrum. Within a standard TIP4P potential
description of water, we find that the nonamer second relevant structure
possesses a higher configurational entropy than the first, so that the two free
energies surprisingly cross for increasing temperature.
