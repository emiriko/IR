We experimentally demonstrate the coupling of far-field light to highly
confined plasmonic gap modes via connected nanoantennas. The excitation of
plasmonic gap modes is shown to depend on the polarization, position and
wavelength of the incident beam. Far-field measurements performed in crossed
polarization allow for the detection of extremely weak signals re-emitted from
gap waveguides and can increase the signal-to-noise ratio dramatically.
