This paper presents a new multi-objective hybrid model that makes cooperation
between the strength of research of neighborhood methods presented by the tabu
search (TS) and the important exploration capacity of evolutionary algorithm.
This model was implemented and tested in benchmark functions (ZDT1, ZDT2, and
ZDT3), using a network of computers.
