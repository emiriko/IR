LOFAR is a new form of radio telescope which can detect radio emission from
air showers induced by very high-energy cosmic rays. It can also look for radio
emission from particle cascades on the Moon induced by ultra high-energy cosmic
rays or neutrinos. To complement the radio detection, we are setting up a small
particle detector array LORA (LOfar Radboud Air shower array) within an area of
$\sim 300$ m diameter in the LOFAR core. It will help in triggering and
confirming the radio detection of air showers with the LOFAR antennas. In this
paper, we present a short overview about LORA and discuss its current status.
