We consider the nonlinear extension of the Kuramoto model of globally coupled
phase oscillators where the phase shift in the coupling function depends on the
order parameter. A bifurcation analysis of the transition from fully
synchronous state to partial synchrony is performed. We demonstrate that for
small ensembles it is typically mediated by stable cluster states, that
disappear with creation of heteroclinic cycles, while for a larger number of
oscillators a direct transition from full synchrony to a periodic or
quasiperiodic regime occurs.
