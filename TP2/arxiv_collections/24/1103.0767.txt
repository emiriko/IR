We theoretically consider the effects of having unintentional charged
impurities in laterally coupled two-dimensional double (GaAs) quantum dot
systems, where each dot contains one or two electrons and a single charged
impurity in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using molecular orbital
and configuration interaction method, we calculate the effect of the impurity
on the 2-electron energy spectrum of each individual dot as well as on the
spectrum of the coupled-double-dot 2-electron system. We find that the
singlet-triplet exchange splitting between the two lowest energy states, both
for the individual dots and the coupled dot system, depends sensitively on the
location of the impurity and its coupling strength (i.e. the effective charge).
A strong electron-impurity coupling breaks down equality of the two
doubly-occupied singlets in the left and the right dot leading to a mixing
between different spin singlets. As a result, the maximally entangled qubit
states are no longer fully obtained in zero magnetic field case. Moreover, a
repulsive impurity results in a triplet-singlet transition as the impurity
effective charge increases or/and the impurity position changes. We comment on
the impurity effect in spin qubit operations in the double dot system based on
our numerical results.
