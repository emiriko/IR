Experiments searching for rare events, such as neutrinoless double beta decay
and interactions of dark matter candidates, require extremely low levels of
background. When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,
radioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order
to control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique
that uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur
close to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The
composite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy
absorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers
that act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the
analysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields. In this
paper, we describe a full thermal model and experimental results for three
prototype detectors. The detectors consist of Ge, Si, or TeO2 thin absorbers as
active shields, all with TeO2 crystals as main absorbers. In all cases, the
surface event rejection capability is clearly demonstrated. In addition,
simulations and preliminary results show that it is possible to detect energy
depositions that occurred on the shields without separate readout channels for
them. The energy depositions in the shields are distinguished from those in the
main absorber through pulse shape discrimination. This simplification makes
this technique a viable method for the rejection of surface energy depositions
in next-generation bolometric double beta decay searches, such as possible
extensions or upgrades of the CUORE experiment.
