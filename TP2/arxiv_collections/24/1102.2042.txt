We extend the ab initio no-core shell model/resonating-group method
(NCSM/RGM) to projectile-target binary-cluster states where the projectile is a
deuteron. We discuss the formalism in detail and give algebraic expressions for
the integration kernels. Using a soft similarity-renormalization-group evolved
chiral nucleon-nucleon potential, we calculate deuteron-4He scattering and
investigate 6Li bound and unbound states. Virtual three-body breakup effects
are obtained in an approximated way by including excited pseudo-states of the
deuteron in the calculation. We compare our results to experiment and to a
standard NCSM calculation for 6Li.
