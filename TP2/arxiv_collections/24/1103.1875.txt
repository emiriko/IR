We use a volume-limited spectroscopic sample of isolated galaxies in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to investigate the frequency and radial
distribution of luminous (M_r <~ -18.3) satellites like the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) around ~L* Milky Way analogs and compare our results
object-by-object to LCDM predictions based on abundance matching in
simulations. We show that 12% of Milky Way-like galaxies host an LMC-like
satellite within 75 kpc (projected), and 42 % within 250 kpc (projected). This
implies ~10% have a satellite within the distance of the LMC, and ~40% of L*
galaxies host a bright satellite within the virialized extent of their dark
matter halos. Remarkably, the simulation reproduces the observed frequency,
radial dependence, velocity distribution, and luminosity function of observed
secondaries exceptionally well, suggesting that LCDM provides an accurate
reproduction of the observed Universe to galaxies as faint as L~10^9 Lsun on
~50 kpc scales. When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity
dispersion of these satellites is sigma~160 km/s, in agreement with
abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright
satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies
in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating
within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single
bright satellite. This redness trend is in stark contrast to the Milky Way's
LMC, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy. We suggest that the LMC's
discrepant color might be further evidence that it is undergoing a triggered
star-formation event upon first infall.
