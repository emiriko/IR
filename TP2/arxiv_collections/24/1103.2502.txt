Additional radio-frequency (rf) potentials applied to linear multipole traps
create extra field nodes in the radial plane which allow one to confine single
ions, or strings of ions, in totally rf field-free regions. The number of nodes
depends on the order of the applied multipole potentials and their relative
distance can be easily tuned by the amplitude variation of the applied
voltages. Simulations using molecular dynamics show that strings of ions can be
laser cooled down to the Doppler limit in all directions of space. Once cooled,
organized systems can be moved with very limited heating, even if the cooling
process is turned off.
