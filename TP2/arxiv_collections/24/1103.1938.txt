Organic/inorganic donor-acceptor interfaces are gaining growing attention in
organic photovoltaic applications as each component of the interface offers
unique attributes. Here we use hybrid-density functional theory to examine the
electronic structure of sexithiophene/ZnO interfaces. We find that interfacial
molecular orientations strongly influence the adsorption energy, the energy
level alignment, and the open circuit voltage. We attribute the orientation
dependence to the varied strength of electronic coupling between the molecule
and the substrate. Our study suggests that photovoltaic performance can be
optimized by controlling the interfacial design of molecular orientations.
