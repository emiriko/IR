We discuss the possibility to probe the QCD critical point during the
dynamical black hole formation from a gravitational collapse of a massive star,
where the temperature and the baryon chemical potential become as high as T ~
90 MeV and $\mu_B$ ~ 1300 MeV. Comparison with the phase boundary in chiral
effective models suggests that quark matter is likely to be formed before the
horizon is formed. Furthermore, the QCD critical point may be probed during the
black hole formation. The critical point is found to move in the lower
temperature direction in asymmetric nuclear matter, and in some of the chiral
models it is found to be in the reachable region during the black hole
formation processes.
