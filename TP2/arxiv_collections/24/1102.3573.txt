We present efficient methods to implement the quantum computing Grover search
algorithm using the Rydberg blockade interaction. We show that simple pi-pulse
excitation sequences between ground and Rydberg excited states readily produce
the key conditional phase shift and inversion-about-the mean unitary operations
for the Grover search. Multi-qubit implementation schemes suitable for
different properties of the atomic interactions are identifed and the error
scaling of the protocols with system size is found to be promising for
immediate experimental investigation.
