Limited liability creates a conflict of interests between policyholders and
shareholders of insurance companies. It provides shareholders with incentives
to increase the risk of the insurer's assets and liabilities which, in turn,
might reduce the value policyholders attach to and premiums they are willing to
pay for insurance coverage. We characterize Pareto optimal investment and
premium policies in this context and provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for their existence and uniqueness. We then identify investment and
premium policies under the risk shifting problem if shareholders cannot
credibly commit to an investment strategy before policies are sold and premiums
are paid. Last, we analyze the effect of solvency regulation, such as Solvency
II or the Swiss Solvency Test, on the agency cost of the risk shifting problem
and calibrate our model to a non-life insurer average portfolio.
