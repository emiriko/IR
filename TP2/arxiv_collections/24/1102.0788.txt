The existence of strong absorption bands of singly deuterated methane (CH3D)
at wavelengths where normal methane (CH4) absorbs comparatively weakly could
enable remote measurement of D/H ratios in methane ice on outer solar system
bodies. We performed laboratory transmission spectroscopy experiments,
recording spectra at wavelengths from 1 to 6 \mum to study CH3D bands at 2.47,
2.87, and 4.56 \mum, wavelengths where ordinary methane absorption is weak. We
report temperature-dependent absorption coefficients of these bands when the
CH3D is diluted in CH4 ice and also when it is dissolved in N2 ice, and
describe how these absorption coefficients can be combined with data from the
literature to simulate arbitrary D/H ratio absorption coefficients for CH4 ice
and for CH4 in N2 ice. We anticipate these results motivating new telescopic
observations to measure D/H ratios in CH4 ice on Triton, Pluto, Eris, and
Makemake.
