This paper considers a communication network comprised of two nodes, which
have no mutual direct communication links, communicating two-way with the aid
of a common relay node (RN), also known as separated two-way relay (TWR)
channel.
  We first recall a cut-set outer bound for the set of rates in the context of
this network topology assuming full-duplex transmission capabilities. Then, we
derive a new achievable rate region based on hash-and-forward (HF) relaying
where the RN does not attempt to decode but instead hashes its received signal,
and show that under certain channel conditions it coincides with Shannon's
inner-bound for the two-way channel [1]. Moreover, for binary adder TWR channel
with additive noise at the nodes and the RN we provide a detailed capacity
achieving coding scheme based on structure codes.
