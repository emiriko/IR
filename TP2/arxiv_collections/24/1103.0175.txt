The review analyses studies on magnetically assisted proliferations and batch
fermentations with Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts. The results available in
the literature are contradictory and show two tendencies: magnetic field
suppression of the cell growth and positive effects in batch fermentation with
increasing both biomass and metabolite production. The amount of data analyzed
allows several concepts existing in the literature to be outlined and
critically commented. Further, a new concept of magnetically induced
micro-dynamos, recently conceived, is developed towards a unified explanation
of the results provided by proliferation and batch fermentation experiments
