Low temperature growth Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (PCMO) thin film showed high
performance in electric field induced resistance switching (RS). To understand
the micro-mechanism of RS in Metal/PCMO/Metal devices, structure evolution of
PCMO under external electric field monitored inside transmission electron
microscope (TEM) were performed. Evolution of the modulation stripe in as-grown
PCMO sample was investigated when applying electric field. The new-generated
modulation stripe gradually disappeared. These results indicate that oxygen ion
migration plays a key role in RS.
