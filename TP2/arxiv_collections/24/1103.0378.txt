We perform a cosmographic analysis using several cosmological observables
such as the luminosity distance moduli, the volume distance, the angular
diameter distance and the Hubble parameter. These quantities are determined
using different data sets: Supernovae type Ia and Gamma Ray Bursts, the
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, the cosmic microwave background power spectrum
and the Hubble parameter as measured from surveys of galaxies. This data set
allows to put constraints on the cosmographic expansion with unprecedented
precision. We also present forecasts for the coefficients of the kinematic
expansion using future but realistic data sets: constraints on the coefficients
of the expansions are likely to improve by a factor ten with the upcoming large
scale structure probes. Finally, we derive the set of the cosmographic
parameters for several cosmological models (including $\Lambda$CDM) and compare
them with our best fit set. While distance measurements are unable to
discriminate among these models, we show that the inclusion of the Hubble data
set leads to strong constraints on the lowest order coefficients and in
particular it is incompatible with $\Lambda$CDM at 3-$\sigma$ confidence level.
We discuss the reliability of this determination and suggest further
observations which might be of crucial importance for the viability of
cosmographic tests in the next future.
