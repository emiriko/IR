As the missing complement to existing studies of shell galaxies, we carried
out a set of self-consistent N-body simulations of a minor merger forming a
stellar shell system within a giant elliptical galaxy. We discuss the effect of
a phenomenon possibly associated with the galaxy merger simulations --- a
presence of multiple generations of shells.
