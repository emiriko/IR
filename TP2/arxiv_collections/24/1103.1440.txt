We present In NMR measurements in a novel thermodynamic phase of CeCoIn5 in
high magnetic field, where exotic superconductivity coexists with the
incommensurate spin-density wave order. We show that the NMR spectra in this
phase provide direct evidence for the emergence of the spatially distributed
normal quasiparticle regions. The quantitative analysis for the field evolution
of the paramagnetic magnetization and newly-emerged low-energy quasiparticle
density of states is consistent with the nodal plane formation, which is
characterized by an order parameter in the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) state. The NMR spectra also suggest that the spatially uniform
spin-density wave is induced in the FFLO phase.
