We examine many SO(10) models for their viability or otherwise in explaining
all the fermion masses and mixing angles. This study is carried out for both
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models and with minimal ($10+\bar{126}$)
and non-minimal ($10+\bar{126}+120$) Higgs content. Extensive numerical fits to
fermion masses and mixing are carried out in each case assuming dominance of
type-II or type-I seesaw mechanism. Required scale of the B-L breaking is
identified in each case. In supersymmetric case, several sets of data at the
GUT scale with or without inclusion of finite supersymmetric corrections are
used. All models studied provide quite good fits if the type-I seesaw mechanism
dominates while many fail if the type-II seesaw dominates. This can be traced
to the absence of the $b$-$\tau$ unification at the GUT scale in these models.
The minimal non-supersymmetric model with type-I seesaw dominance gives
excellent fits. In the presence of a $45_H$ and an intermediate scale, the
model can also account for the gauge coupling unification making it potentially
interesting model for the complete unification. Structure of the Yukawa
coupling matrices obtained numerically in this specific case is shown to follow
from a very simple U(1) symmetry and a Froggatt-Nielsen singlet.
