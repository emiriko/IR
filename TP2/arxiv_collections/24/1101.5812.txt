We report magnetization data for several titanium pyrochlore systems measured
down to 0.5 K. The measurements, performed on single crystal samples in fields
of up to 7 T, have captured the essential elements of the previously reported
phase transitions in these compounds and have also revealed additional
important features overlooked previously either because of the insufficiently
low temperatures used, or due to limitations imposed by polycrystalline
samples. For the spin-ice pyrochlores Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7, an unusually slow
relaxation of the magnetization has been observed in lower fields, while the
magnetization process in higher fields is essentially hysteresis-free and does
not depend on sample history. For the XY pyrochlore Er2Ti2O7, the magnetic
susceptibility shows nearly diverging behaviour on approach to a critical
field, HC = 13.5 kOe, above which the magnetization does not saturate but
continues to grow at a significant rate. For the Heisenberg pyrochlore
Gd2Ti2O7, the magnetic susceptibility shows a pronounced change of slope at
both transition temperatures, TN1 = 1.02 K and TN2 = 0.74 K, contrary to the
earlier reports.
