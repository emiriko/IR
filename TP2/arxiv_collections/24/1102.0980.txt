A word-graph Gw is a digraph represented by a word w such that the vertex-set
V(Gw) is the alphabet of w and the edge-set E(Gw) is determined by
non-identical adjacent letter pairs in w. In this paper we study the
strong-connectivity of word-graphs. Our main result is that the number of
strongly connected word-graphs represented by l-words of over an n-alphabet can
be expressed via a recurrence relation T(l,n) on the Stirling numbers of the
second kind using a link between word partitions and digraph connectivity.
