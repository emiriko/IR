We present the Dynamic Eclipse Mapping (DEM) method designed specifically to
reconstruct the surface intensity patterns of non-radial stellar oscillations
in eclipsing binaries. The method needs a geometric model of the binary,
accepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on
output yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus
allowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\ell,m)$.
  Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric
observations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the
wide-band time series collected by space observatories.
  The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all
photometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\ell-|m|\le 4$
were properly restored. Multimode pulsations can be also reconstructed in a
natural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis
of known direction. It can also be used in principle to isolate the
contribution of hidden modes from the light curve.
  Sensitivity tests show that moderate errors in the geometric parameters and
the assumed limb darkening can be partially tolerated by the inversion, in the
sense that the lower degree modes are still recoverable. Tidally induced or
mutually resonant pulsations, however, are an obstacle that neither the eclipse
mapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass.
  We conclude that, with reasonable assumptions, Dynamic Eclipse Mapping could
be a powerful tool for mode identification, especially in moderately close
eclipsing binary systems, where the pulsating component is not seriously
affected by tidal interactions so that the pulsations are intrinsic to them,
and not a consequence of the binarity.
