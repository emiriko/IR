We calculate quark-antiquark potentials using the relationship between the
expectation value of the Wilson loop and the action of a probe string in the
string dual. We review and categorize the possible forms of the dependence of
the energy on the separation between the quarks. In particular, we examine the
possibility of there being a minimum separation for probe strings which do not
penetrate close to the origin of the bulk space, and derive a condition which
determines whether this is the case. We then apply these considerations to the
flavoured resolved deformed conifold background of Gaillard et al. We suggest
that the unusual behaviour we observe in this solution is likely to be related
to the IR singularity which is not present in the unflavoured case.
