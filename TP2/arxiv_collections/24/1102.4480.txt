A linear graph is a graph whose vertices are totally ordered. Biological and
linguistic sequences with interactions among symbols are naturally represented
as linear graphs. Examples include protein contact maps, RNA secondary
structures and predicate-argument structures. Our algorithm, linear graph miner
(LGM), leverages the vertex order for efficient enumeration of frequent
subgraphs. Based on the reverse search principle, the pattern space is
systematically traversed without expensive duplication checking. Disconnected
subgraph patterns are particularly important in linear graphs due to their
sequential nature. Unlike conventional graph mining algorithms detecting
connected patterns only, LGM can detect disconnected patterns as well. The
utility and efficiency of LGM are demonstrated in experiments on protein
contact maps.
