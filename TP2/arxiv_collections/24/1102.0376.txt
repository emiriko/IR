Distribution of the two phonon $\gamma$ vibrational collectivity in the
rotating triaxial odd-$A$ nucleus, $^{103}$Nb, that is one of the three
nuclides for which experimental data were reported recently, is calculated in
the framework of the particle vibration coupling model based on the cranked
shell model plus random phase approximation. This framework was previously
utilized for analyses of the zero and one phonon bands in other mass region and
is applied to the two phonon band for the first time. In the present
calculation, three sequences of two phonon bands share collectivity almost
equally at finite rotation whereas the $K=\Omega+4$ state is the purest at zero
rotation.
