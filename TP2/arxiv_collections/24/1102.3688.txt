Polarized Raman-scattering spectra of non-superconducting, single-crystalline
FeTe are investigated as function of temperature. We have found a relation
between the magnitude of ordered magnetic moments and the linewidth of A1g
phonons at low temperatures. This relation is attributed to the intermediate
spin state (S=1) and the orbital degeneracy of the Fe ions. Spin-phonon
coupling constants have been estimated based on microscopic modeling using
density-functional theory and analysis of the local spin density. Our
observations show the importance of orbital degrees of freedom for the Fe-based
superconductors with large ordered magnetic moments, while small magnetic
moment of Fe ions in some iron pnictides reflects the low spin state of Fe ions
in those systems.
