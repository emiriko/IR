We describe an approach to the study of phase transitions in Potts models
based on an estimate of the complexity of the locus of real zeros of the
partition function, computed in terms of the classes in the Grothendieck ring
of the affine algebraic varieties defined by the vanishing of the multivariate
Tutte polynomial. We give completely explicit calculations for the examples of
the chains of linked polygons and of the graphs obtained by replacing the
polygons with their dual graphs. These are based on a deletion-contraction
formula for the Grothendieck classes and on generating functions for splitting
and doubling edges.
