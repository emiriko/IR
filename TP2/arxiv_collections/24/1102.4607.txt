A broad variety of observational methods allows us to see the effect of
magnetic reconnection in high-temperature strongly-magnetized plasma of the
solar corona. Some specific features of the large-scale reconnection in large
solar flares are summarized in this review but they are not investigated in
detail yet. For example, an analysis of the topological peculiarities of
magnetic field in active regions clearly shows that the so-called topological
trigger phenomenon is necessary to allow for in order to construct realistic
models for large solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). However this
is not a simple task. We discuss also some new analytical models of magnetic
reconnection in a current layer with attached MHD discontinuities. These models
take into account the possibility of a current layer rupture in the region of
anomalous plasma resistivity. In the context of the numerical simulations on
reconnection, a question on their interpretation is considered. Some new
results obtained recently are briefly reviewed together with new questions of
the solar flare physics to be studied.
