We consider the information causality in the multi-receiver random access
codes. Therein, no receiver can gain any information only from classical
communication. We claim the following statement. Information causality still
holds even with the help of the multi-partite physical non-local resource. That
is, the summation of all revivers' information gain cannot be greater than the
amount of classical communication. The distributive multi-party physical
nonlocal resource can be exploited only for information splitting. It is proved
that such trade-off leads to the monogamy of entanglement. Finally the
connection between information causality and spin-glass Bethe lattice is
discussed.
