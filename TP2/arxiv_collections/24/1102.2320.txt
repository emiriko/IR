Surface plasmon-polaritons in a multilayer structure consisting of a metallic
film and one or more layers of nanocrystal (NC) quantum dots (QDs) are studied.
It is shown that there is resonance coupling between the plasmon-polaritons
propagating along the metal/NC-layer interface and excitons confined in the
dots, which makes a considerable effect on the optical properties of the
structure unless the dispersion of the QD size is too large. This coupling can
be explored in order to selectively excite QDs of different size by using an
attenuated total reflection (ATR) structure. It opens the possibility of
control of the relative intensity of light of different color, emitted by the
QDs of different size.
