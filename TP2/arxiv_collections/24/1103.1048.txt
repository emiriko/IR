First searches for new physics phenomena using the LHC 7 TeV proton-proton
collision data collected by the CMS detector in 2010 are reviewed. Results are
presented of searches for new physics in events with hadronic jet pairs, and
for heavy stable charged particles, including a dedicated search for long-lived
particles that stop in the detector and decay in periods between beam
crossings.
