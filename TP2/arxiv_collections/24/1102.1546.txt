Superposition and entanglement are uniquely quantum phenomena. Superposition
incorporates a phase which contains information surpassing any classical
mixture. Entanglement offers correlations between measurements in quantum
systems that are stronger than any which would be possible classically. These
give quantum computing its spectacular potential, but the implications extend
far beyond quantum information processing. Early applications may be found in
entanglement enhanced sensing and metrology. Quantum spins in condensed matter
offer promising candidates for investigating and exploiting superposition and
entanglement, and enormous progress is being made in quantum control of such
systems. In GaAs, individual electron spins can be manipulated and measured,
and singlet-triplet states can be controlled in double-dot structures. In
silicon, individual electron spins can be detected by ionisation of phosphorous
donors, and information can be transferred from electron spins to nuclear spins
to provide long memory times. Electron and nuclear spins can be manipulated in
nitrogen atoms incarcerated in fullerene molecules, which in turn can be
assembled in ordered arrays. Spin states of charged nitrogen vacancy centres in
diamond can be manipulated and read optically. Collective spin states in a
range of materials systems offer scope for holographic storage of information.
Conditions are now excellent for implementing superposition and entanglement in
spintronic devices, thereby opening up a new era of quantum technologies.
