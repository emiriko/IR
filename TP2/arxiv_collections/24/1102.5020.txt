The potential energy curves, permanent and transition dipole moments, and the
static dipolar polarizability, of molecular ions composed of one alkali-metal
atom and a Strontium ion are determined with a quantum chemistry approach. The
molecular ions are treated as effective two-electron systems and are treated
using effective core potentials including core polarization, large gaussian
basis sets, and full configuration interaction. In the perspective of upcoming
experiments aiming at merging cold atom and cold ion traps, possible paths for
radiative charge exchange, photoassociation of a cold Lithium or Rubidium atom
and a Strontium ion are discussed, as well as the formation of stable molecular
ions.
