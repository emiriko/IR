We proof that if we have a thermal equilibrium state on Minkowski spacetime
in two dimensions then we have a thermal equilibrium state on the cylindrical
spacetime obtained from this Minkowski spacetime by making 2\pi-periodic the
spatial direction. We perform this by using the algebraic approach to Quantum
Field Theory.
