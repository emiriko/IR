Superconductivity, at 2-3 K, was observed in a novel phase of the ternary
Li-Rh-B system. The structural phase exhibits a large noncentrosymmetric cubic
unit cell with the a-parameter being within 1.208 \leq a \leq 1.215 nm. This
phase is stable over a wider compositional range of LixRhBy (0.6 < x < 2, 1 < y
< 2). The superconductivity, as well as the unit cell volume, is sensitive to
the Li/B content but it is manifested with Tc \geq 1.8 K over a wider
compositional range: the highest Tc \approx 3 K occurs for x : y \approx
0.9:1.5 with a \approx 1.209 nm. The superconducting shielding fraction of most
samples is almost 80% of that of Sn. The lower critical field, Hc1(0), is ~65
Oe while the upper one, Hc2(0) is determined from extrapolation to be higher
than 14 kOe. We discuss the influence of pressure on Tc and also the influence
of the lack of inversion symmetry on the superconducting properties.
