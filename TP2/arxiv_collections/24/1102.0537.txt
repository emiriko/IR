We present HST/ACS observations of ten galaxies that host narrow-line Seyfert
1 (NLS1) nuclei, believed to contain relatively smaller mass black holes
accreting at high Eddington ratios. We deconvolve each ACS image into a nuclear
point source (AGN), a bulge, and a disk, and fitted the bulge with a Sersic
profile and the disk with an exponential profile. We find that at least five
galaxies can be classified as having pseudobulges. All ten galaxies lie below
the \mbh--L$_{bulge}$ relation, confirming earlier results. Their locus is
similar to that occupied by pseudobulges. This leads us to conclude that the
growth of BHs in NLS1s is governed by secular processes rather than
merger-driven. Active galaxies in pseudobulges point to an alternative track of
black hole--galaxy co-evolution. Because of the intrinsic scatter in black hole
mass--bulge properties scaling relations caused by a combination of factors
such as the galaxy morphology, orientation, and redshift evolution, application
of scaling relations to determine BH masses may not be as straightforward as
has been hoped.
