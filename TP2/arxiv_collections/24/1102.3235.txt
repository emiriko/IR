This paper derives an outer bound on the capacity region of a general
memoryless interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. The
derivation follows from a generalization of the techniques developed by Kramer
and by Etkin et al for the Gaussian two-user channel. The derived bound is the
first known outer bound valid for any memoryless channel. In Gaussian noise,
classes of channels for which the proposed bound gives the sum-rate capacity
are identified, including degraded channels and a class of Z-channels.
