The aim of this paper is to provide a model of relationship between the
number of galaxies and the rate of type Ia supernovae (SNe). In addition,
present approach prepares a framework to analyze this relationship and its
dependence on the redshif, giving aid to the deepening of studies on radial
distribution of galaxies. The work also shows how the ratio of counts entails
to the topological aspects regarding the evolution of the universe itself from
z ~ 2. The relationships refer directly to the redshift apart from
morphological considerations.
