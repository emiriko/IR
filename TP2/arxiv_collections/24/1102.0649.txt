We study structural stability of smoothness of the maximal solution to the
geometric eikonal equation on (Rd, G), d \geq 2. This is within the framework
of order zero metrics G. For a subclass we show existence, stability as well as
precise asymptotics for derivatives of the solution. These results are
applicable for examples from Schr\"odinger operator theory.
