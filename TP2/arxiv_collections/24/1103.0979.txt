The one-loop radiative correction in an ultraviolet (UV) complete electroweak
(EW) model without a Higgs particle is calculated. The $\rho$ parameter
determining the ratio of the charged to neutral currents is derived for the
dominant top quark contribution with the result $\rho\sim 1.01$. This result is
compared to the radiative correction to $\rho$ in the standard EW model with a
Higgs particle. For the favored light Higgs particle mass from global fits to
EW data: $114.4\,{\rm GeV} \leq m_H\leq 135\, {\rm GeV}$, the Higgs
contribution up to three loops is negligible and the Higgless model is
consistent with EW data for the energy scale $\Lambda_W\lesssim 1-2$ TeV.
