In this work the propulsion force developed in an asymmetric capacitor will
be calculated for three different diameters of the ground electrode. The used
ion source is a small diameter wire, which generates a positive corona
discharge in nitrogen gas directed to the ground electrode. By applying the
fluid dynamic and electrostatic theories all hydrodynamic and electrostatic
forces that act on the considered geometries will be computed in an attempt to
provide a physical insight on the force mechanism that acts on the asymmetrical
capacitors, and also to understand how to increase the efficiency of
propulsion.
