We discuss strategies for quantum enhanced estimation of atomic transition
frequencies with ions stored in Paul traps or neutral atoms trapped in optical
lattices. We show that only marginal quantum improvements can be achieved using
standard Ramsey interferometry in the presence of collective dephasing, which
is the major source of noise in relevant experimental setups. We therefore
analyze methods based on decoherence free subspaces and prove that quantum
enhancement can readily be achieved even in the case of significantly imperfect
state preparation and faulty detections.
