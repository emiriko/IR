In this paper, we consider terminal reflexive polytopes arising from finite
directed graphs and study the problem of deciding which directed graphs yield
smooth Fano polytopes. We show that any centrally symmetric or pseudo-symmetric
smooth Fano polytopes can be obtained from directed graphs. Moreover, by using
directed graphs, we provide new examples of smooth Fano polytopes whose
corresponding varieties admit K\"ahler--Einstein metrics.
