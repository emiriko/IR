In this talk we introduce the main features of a QCD-based model in which the
coupling $\alpha_{s}$ is constrained by an infrared mass scale. We show recent
applications of this model to hadron-hadron collisions, gap survival
probability calculations, and soft gluon resummation techniques. These results
indicate a smooth transition from non-perturbative to perturbative behaviour of
the QCD.
