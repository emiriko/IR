A short comment on "The Jones-Hore theory of radical-ion-pair reactions is
not self-consistent" (arXiv:1010.3888v3) is presented. In the comment, it is
pointed out that the paper includes a misconception about the Jones-Hore
approach in Chem. Phys. Lett. 488 (2010) 90-93. The re-formulation is presented
and it is demonstrated that the Jones-Hore theory is consistent at least on the
point claimed by I. K. Kominis in the paper.
