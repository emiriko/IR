The antenna subtraction method developed originally for the computation of
higher order corrections to jet observables from a colourless initial state is
extended for hadron collider processes involving a pair of massive particles
and jets in the final state at the next-to-leading order (NLO) level. Due to
the presence of coloured initial states, the subtraction terms need to be
divided into three categories (final-final, initial-final and initial-initial).
In this paper, we outline their construction and derive the necessary
ingredients: phase space factorisation, antenna functions and also integrated
antennae, including the effects of massive final states in all of those
building parts. As a first application, we explicitly construct the
colour-ordered real radiation and the corresponding antenna subtraction terms
required at NLO for the production of a top quark pair and for the production
of a top quark pair in association with a hard jet. The latter constitutes an
essential ingredient for the computation of the hadronic production of a
top-antitop pair at NNLO.
