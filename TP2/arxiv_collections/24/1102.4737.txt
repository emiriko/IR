In this paper we consider an equilibrium last-passage percolation model on an
environment given by a compound two-dimensional Poisson process. We prove an
$\LL^2$-formula relating the initial measure with the last-passage percolation
time. This formula turns out to be a useful tool to analyze the fluctuations of
the last-passage times along non-characteristic directions.
