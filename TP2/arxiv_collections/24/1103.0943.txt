The strong coupling constants, $g_{D_{s}DK_0^*}$, $g_{B_{s}BK_0^*}$,
$g_{D^{\ast}_{s}D K}$, $g_{B^{\ast}_{s}BK}$, $g_{D^{\ast}_{s}D K_1}$ and
$g_{B^{\ast}_{s}BK_1}$, where $K_0^*$, $K$ and $K_1$ are scalar, pseudoscalar
and axial vector kaon mesons, respectively are calculated in the framework of
three-point QCD sum rules. In particular, the correlation functions of the
considered vertices when both $B(D)$ and $K_0^*(K)(K_1)$ mesons are off-shell
are evaluated. In the case of $K_1$, which is either $K_1(1270)$ or
$K_1(1400)$, the mixing between these two states are also taken into account. A
comparison of the obtained result with the existing prediction on
$g_{D^{\ast}_{s}D K}$ as the only coupling constant among the considered
vertices, previously calculated in the literature, is also made.
