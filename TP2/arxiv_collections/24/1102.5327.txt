We revisit the "`hybrid formalism"' for particle production used recently to
study saturation effects in single hadron multiplicities at forward rapidities
at RHIC and LHC. We point out that at leading twist there is an extra
contribution to the formulae used so far, which corresponds to particle
production via inelastic scattering of the projectile partons on the target
fields. This contribution is expected to be small due to kinematics at very
forward rapidities/very high transverse momenta, but should be significant at
high momenta and very high energies. This contribution is expected to be most
affected by saturation effects and is therefore an interesting object of study
in the context of possible onset of saturation at high energies.
