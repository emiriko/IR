We have investigated the main scattering mechanisms affecting mobility in
graphene nanoribbons using detailed atomistic simulations. We have considered
carrier scattering due to acoustic and optical phonons, edge roughness, single
defects, and ionized impurities, and we have defined a methodology based on
simulations of statistically meaningful ensembles of nanoribbon segments. Edge
disorder heavily affects mobility at room temperature in narrower nanoribbons,
whereas charged impurities and phonons are hardly the limiting factors. Results
are favorably compared to the few experiments available in the literature.
