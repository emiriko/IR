We claim that the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) License Choice Algorithm,
implemented in mobile DRM agents as specified by OMA suffers from a bug. More
precisely there exist some cases that the user, may end up losing some rights
without even to exercise them. We redesign this algorithm and claim that our
approach eliminates this bug.
