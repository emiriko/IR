We present results for a photonic microwave resonator designed and fabricated
at 17.4GHz with a record high Quality factor (Q = 26,400) at room temperature
over a mode volume smaller than one cubic wavelength. The cavity is uniquely
designed to have its electric field concentrated in air, which allows for
efficient coupling to free space and facilitates interactions with gaseous
atomic systems and fluids.
