Simonovits and S\'{o}s conjectured that the maximal size of a
triangle-intersecting family of graphs on $n$ vertices is $2^{\binom{n}{2}-3}$.
Their conjecture has recently been proved using spectral methods. We provide an
elementary proof of the special case of $8$ vertices using a partition
argument.
