This paper treats the problem of determining conditions for the Fourier
coefficients of a Maass-Hecke newform at cusps other than infinity to be
multiplicative. To be precise, the Fourier coefficients are defined using a
choice of matrix in SL(2, Z) which maps infinity to the cusp in question. Let c
and d be the entries in the bottom row of this matrix, and let N be the level.
In earlier work with Dorian Goldfeld and Min Lee, we proved that the
coefficients will be multiplicative whenever N divides 2cd. This paper proves
that they will not be multiplicative unless N divides 576cd. Further, if one
assumes that the Hecke eigenvalue vanishes less than half the time then this
number drops to 48cd.
