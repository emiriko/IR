We establish the optimal quantum teleportation protocol for the realistic
scenario when both input state and quantum channel are afflicted by noise. In
taking these effects into account higher fidelities are achieved. The
optimality of the proposed protocol prevails even when restricted to a reduced
set of generically available operations.
