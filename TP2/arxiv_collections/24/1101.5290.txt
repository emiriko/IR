Using exact diagonalization in the spherical geometry, we investigate systems
of localized quasiholes at nu=5/2 for interactions interpolating between the
pure Coulomb and the three-body interaction for which the Moore-Read state is
the exact ground state. We show that the charge e/4 quasihole can be easily
localized by means of a delta-function pinning potential. Using a tuned smooth
pinning potential, the quasihole radius can be limited to approximately three
magnetic length units. For systems of two quasiholes, adiabatic continuity
between the Moore-Read and the Coulomb limit holds for the ground state, while
for four quasiholes, the lowest two energy states exhibit adiabatic continuity.
This implies the existence of a Majorana fermion for pure Coulomb interaction.
We also present preliminary results in the Coulomb limit for braiding in
systems containing four quasiholes, with up to 14 electrons, diagonalizing in
the full spin-polarized sector of the second Landau-level Hilbert space.
