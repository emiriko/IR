This work is focused on the doubly nonlinear equation, whose solutions
represent the bending motion of an extensible, elastic bridge suspended by
continuously distributed cables which are flexible and elastic with stiffness
k^2. When the ends are pinned, long-term dynamics is scrutinized for arbitrary
values of axial load p and stiffness k^2. For a general external source f, we
prove the existence of bounded absorbing sets.When f is timeindependent, the
related semigroup of solutions is shown to possess the global attractor of
optimal regularity and its characterization is given in terms of the steady
states of the problem.
