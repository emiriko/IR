We consider non-minimal \lambda \phi^4 inflation in a gauged
non-supersymmetric U(1)_{B-L} model containing the gravitational coupling \xi
\mathcal{R} \Phi^\dagger \Phi, where \mathcal{R} denotes the Ricci scalar and
the standard model singlet inflaton field \Phi spontaneously breaks the
U(1)_{B-L} symmetry. Including radiative corrections, the predictions 0.956 <
n_s < 0.984 and 0.007 < r < 0.1 for the scalar spectral index and tensor to
scalar ratio r lie within the current WMAP 1-\sigma bounds. If the B-L symmetry
breaking scale is of order a TeV or so, one of the three right handed neutrinos
is a plausible cold dark matter candidate. Bounds on the dimensionless
parameters \lambda, \xi and the gauge coupling g_{B-L} are obtained.
