We give a complete list of indecomposable characters of the infinite
symmetric semigroup. In comparison with the analogous list for the infinite
symmetric group, one should introduce only one new parameter, which has a clear
combinatorial meaning. The paper relies on the representation theory of the
finite symmetric semigroups and the representation theory of the infinite
symmetric group.
