Hadrons measured in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 0.9 and 7 TeV with
the ALICE detector have been identified using various techniques: the specific
energy loss and the time-of flight information for charged pions, kaons and
protons, the displaced vertex resulting from their weak decay for K0, Lambda
and Xi and the kink topology of decaying charged kaons. These various particle
identification tools give the best separation at different momentum ranges and
the results are combined to obtain spectra from pt = 100 MeV/c to 2.5 GeV/c.
This allows to extract total yields. In detail we discuss the K/pi ratio
together with previous measurements and we show a fit using a statistical
approach.
