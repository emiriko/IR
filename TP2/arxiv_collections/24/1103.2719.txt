Recent "science of science" research shows that scientific impact measures
for journals and individual articles have quantifiable regularities across both
time and discipline. However, little is known about the scientific impact
distribution at the scale of an individual scientist. We analyze the aggregate
scientific production and impact of individual careers using the rank-citation
profile c_{i}(r) of 200 distinguished professors and 100 assistant professors.
For the entire range of paper rank r, we fit each c_{i}(r) to a common
distribution function that is parameterized by two scaling exponents. Since two
scientists with equivalent Hirsch h-index can have significantly different
c_{i}(r) profiles, our results demonstrate the utility of the \beta_{i} scaling
parameter in conjunction with h_{i} for quantifying individual publication
impact. We show that the total number of citations C_{i} tallied from a
scientist's N_{i} papers scales as C_{i} \sim h_{i}^{1+\beta_{i}}. Such
statistical regularities in the input-output patterns of scientists can be used
as benchmarks for theoretical models of career progress.
