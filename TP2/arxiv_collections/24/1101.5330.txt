We present a visco-elastic coupling model between caked spheres, suitable for
DEM simulations, which incorporates the different loading mechanisms (tension,
shear, bending, torsion) in a combined manner and allows for a derivation of
elastic and failure properties on a common basis. In pull, shear, and torsion
failure tests with agglomerates of up to 10000 particles, we compare the
failure criterion to different approximative variants of it, with respect to
accuracy and computational cost. The failure of the agglomerates, which behave
according to elastic parameters derived from the contact elasticity, gives also
insight into the relative relevance of the different load modes.
