We extend our technique for observing very small concentrations of impurities
in xenon gas to the problem of krypton detection. We use a conventional mass
spectrometer to identify the krypton content of the xenon, but we improve the
sensitivity of the device by about five orders of magnitude with a liquid
nitrogen cold trap. We find that the absolute krypton concentration of the
xenon can be inferred from the mass spectrometry measurements, and we identify
krypton signals at concentrations as low as 0.5x10^{-12} mol/mol (Kr/Xe). This
technique simplifies the monitoring of krypton backgrounds for WIMP dark matter
searches in liquid xenon.
