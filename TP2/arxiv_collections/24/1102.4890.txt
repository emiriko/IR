Little is known about morphological instability of a solidification front
during the crystal growth of a thin film of flowing supercooled liquid with a
free surface: for example, the ring-like ripples on the surface of icicles. The
length scale of the ripples is nearly 1 cm. Two theoretical models for the
ripple formation mechanism have been proposed. However, these models lead to
quite different results because of differences in the boundary conditions at
the solid-liquid interface and liquid-air surface. The validity of the
assumption used in the two models is numerically investigated and some of the
theoretical predictions are compared with experiments.
