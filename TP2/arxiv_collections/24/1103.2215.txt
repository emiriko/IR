Models of computational trust support users in taking decisions. They are
commonly used to guide users' judgements in online auction sites; or to
determine quality of contributions in Web 2.0 sites. However, most existing
systems require historical information about the past behavior of the specific
agent being judged. In contrast, in real life, to anticipate and to predict a
stranger's actions in absence of the knowledge of such behavioral history, we
often use our "instinct"- essentially stereotypes developed from our past
interactions with other "similar" persons. In this paper, we propose
StereoTrust, a computational trust model inspired by stereotypes as used in
real-life. A stereotype contains certain features of agents and an expected
outcome of the transaction. When facing a stranger, an agent derives its trust
by aggregating stereotypes matching the stranger's profile. Since stereotypes
are formed locally, recommendations stem from the trustor's own personal
experiences and perspective. Historical behavioral information, when available,
can be used to refine the analysis. According to our experiments using
Epinions.com dataset, StereoTrust compares favorably with existing trust models
that use different kinds of information and more complete historical
information.
