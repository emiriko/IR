We report a robust process for fabrication of surface-gated Si/SiGe quantum
dots (QDs) with an integrated superconducting single-electron transistor
(S-SET) charge sensor. A combination of a deep mesa etch and AlOx backfill is
used to reduce gate leakage. After the leakage current is suppressed, Coulomb
oscillations of the QD and the current-voltage characteristics of the S-SET are
observed at a temperature of 0.3 K. Coupling of the S-SET to the QD is
confirmed by using the S-SET to perform sensing of the QD charge state.
