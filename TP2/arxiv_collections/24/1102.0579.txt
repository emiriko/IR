We construct a functor from the triangulated category of Voevodsky motives to
a certain derived category of mixed Hodge structures enriched with integral
weight filtration. We use this construction to prove a strong integral version
of the Deligne conjecture on 1-motives which was known previously only up to
isogeny.
