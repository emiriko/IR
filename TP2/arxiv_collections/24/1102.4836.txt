It is well known that the compactifications of the canonical contact systems
living on real jet spaces $J^{\,r}(1,1)$, $r \ge 2$, are locally universal
Goursat distributions, $\Delta^r$, living on compact manifolds (called Goursat
monsters) having open dense jet-like ($J^{\,r}(1,1)$-like) parts.
  By virtue of the results of Jean (1996), one was able, for each $r \ge 2$, to
recursively compute the {\it small growth vector\,} of \,$\Delta^r$ at any
point of the $r$-th monster. The result was got by performing series of $r$
operations taken, in function of the local geometry of \,$\Delta^r$ in
question, from the set of fixed recursive rules $\{\,1,\,2,\,3\,\}$ (called in
the present text S,\,T,\,G, respectively). By the local universality of
\,$\Delta^r$ one was thus able to compute {\it all\,} small growth vectors of
all existing Goursat distributions.
  In the work of Mormul (2004) proposed were explicit solutions to the series
of Jean's recurrences. The solutions uncovered a surprisingly involved
underlying arithmetics -- a kind of G{\"o}del-like encoding of words over a
three-letter alphabet $\{$G,\,S,\,T$\}$ by neat sequences of positive integers.
Yet, those formulas, though characterizing really existing objects, appeared as
if from thin air, and proofs were postponed to another publication.
  In the present contribution we submit proofs of our formulas from 2004. It is
not, however, a plain check that our candidates satisfy Jean's recurrences.
Under the way we retrieve and re-produce those surprising formulas.
