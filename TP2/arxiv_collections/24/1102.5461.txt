In this paper, the problem of distributed opportunistic channel access in
wireless relaying is investigated. A relay network with multiple
source-destination pairs and multiple relays is considered. All the source
nodes contend through a random access procedure. A winner source node may give
up its transmission opportunity if its link quality is poor. In this research,
we apply the optimal stopping theory to analyze when a winner node should give
up its transmission opportunity. By assuming the winner node has information of
channel gains of links from itself to relays and from relays to its
destination, the existence and uniqueness of an optimal stopping rule are
rigorously proved. It is also found that the optimal stopping rule is a
pure-threshold strategy. The case when the winner node does not have
information of channel gains of links from relays to its destination is also
studied. Two stopping problems exist, one in the main layer (for channel access
of source nodes), and the other in the sub-layer (for channel access of relay
nodes). An intuitive stopping rule, where the sub-layer and the main layer
maximize their throughput respectively, is shown to be a semi-pure-threshold
strategy. The intuitive stopping rule turns out to be non-optimal. An optimal
stopping rule is then derived theoretically. Our research reveals that
multi-user (including multi-source and multi-relay) diversity and time
diversity can be fully utilized in a relay network by our proposed strategies.
