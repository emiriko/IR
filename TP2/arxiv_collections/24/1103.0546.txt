Quantum control of individual spins in condensed matter systems is an
emerging field with wide-ranging applications in spintronics, quantum
computation, and sensitive magnetometry. Recent experiments have demonstrated
the ability to address and manipulate single electron spins through either
optical or electrical techniques. However, it is a challenge to extend
individual spin control to nanoscale multi-electron systems, as individual
spins are often irresolvable with existing methods. Here we demonstrate that
coherent individual spin control can be achieved with few-nm resolution for
proximal electron spins by performing single-spin magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), which is realized via a scanning magnetic field gradient that is both
strong enough to achieve nanometric spatial resolution and sufficiently stable
for coherent spin manipulations. We apply this scanning field-gradient MRI
technique to electronic spins in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond and
achieve nanometric resolution in imaging, characterization, and manipulation of
individual spins. For NV centers, our results in individual spin control
demonstrate an improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude in spatial
resolution compared to conventional optical diffraction-limited techniques.
This scanning-field-gradient microscope enables a wide range of applications
including materials characterization, spin entanglement, and nanoscale
magnetometry.
