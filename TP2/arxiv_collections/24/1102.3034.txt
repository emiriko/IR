The low-energy breakup differential cross sections of the neutron-deuteron
(nd) scattering are studied by employing the energy-independent version of the
quark-model baryon-baryon interaction fss2. This interaction reproduces almost
all the breakup differential cross sections predicted by the meson-exchange
potentials for the neutron incident energies $E_n \leq$ 65 MeV. The space star
anomaly of 13 MeV nd scattering is not improved even in our model. Some
overestimation of the breakup differential cross sections at $E_n$=22.7 - 65
MeV implies that systematic studies of various breakup configurations are
necessary both experimentally and theoretically.
