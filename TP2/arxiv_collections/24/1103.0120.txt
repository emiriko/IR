In this paper we present a novel approach for automatic recognition of ring
worm skin disease based on LBP (Local Binary Pattern) feature extracted from
the affected skin images. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive
experiments on the skin images collected from internet. The dataset is tested
using three different classifiers i.e. Bayesian, MLP and SVM. Experimental
results show that the proposed methodology efficiently discriminates between a
ring worm skin and a normal skin. It is a low cost technique and does not
require any special imaging devices.
