The evolution of suspension drops sedimenting under gravity in a viscous
fluid close to a vertical wall was studied experimentally and numerically with
the use of the point-force model, in the Stokes flow regime. The fluid inside
and outside the drop was identical. The initial distribution of the suspended
solid heavy particles was uniform inside a spherical volume. In the experiments
and in the simulations, the suspension drops evolved qualitatively in the same
way as in an unbounded fluid. However, it was observed, both experimentally and
numerically that, on the average, the destabilization time T and the distance L
traveled by the drop until break-up were smaller for a closer distance h of the
drop center from the wall, with approximately linear dependence of T and L on
D/h, for h larger or comparable to the drop diameter D. Destabilization times
and lengths of individual drops with different random configurations of the
particles were shown to differ significantly from each other, owing to the
chaotic nature of the particle dynamics.
