We conjecture a relationship between the scaling limit of the fixed-length
ensemble of self-avoiding walks in the upper half plane and radial SLE with
kappa=8/3 in this half plane from 0 to i. The relationship is that if we take a
curve from the fixed-length scaling limit of the SAW, weight it by a suitable
power of the distance to the endpoint of the curve and then apply the conformal
map of the half plane that takes the endpoint to i, then we get the same
probability measure on curves as radial SLE. In addition to a non-rigorous
derivation of this conjecture, we support it with Monte Carlo simulations of
the SAW. Using the conjectured relationship between the SAW and radial SLE, our
simulations give estimates for both the interior and boundary scaling
exponents. The values we obtain are within a few hundredths of a percent of the
conjectured values.
