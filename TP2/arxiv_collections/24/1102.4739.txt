We present a time-resolved spectral analysis of the bright, long GRB 061007
(z=1.261) using Swift BAT and Suzaku WAM data. We find that the prompt emission
of GRB 061007 can be equally well explained by a photospheric component
together with a power law as by a Band function, and we explore the
implications of the former model. The photospheric component, which we model
with a multicolour blackbody, dominates the emission and has a very stable
shape throughout the burst. This component provides a natural explanation for
the hardness-intensity correlation seen within the burst and also allows us to
estimate the bulk Lorentz factor and the radius of the photosphere. The
power-law component dominates the fit at high energies and has a nearly
constant slope of -1.5. We discuss the possibility that this component is of
the same origin as the high-energy power laws recently observed in some Fermi
LAT bursts.
