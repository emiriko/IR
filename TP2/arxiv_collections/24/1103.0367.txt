We study Hall effect in sputtered NixPt1-x thin films with different Ni
concentrations. Temperature, magnetic field and angular dependencies are
analyzed and the phase diagram of NiPt thin films is obtained. It is found that
films with sub-critical Ni concentration exhibit cluster-glass behavior at low
temperatures with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy below the freezing
temperature. Films with over-critical Ni concentration are ferromagnetic with
parallel anisotropy. At the critical concentration the state of the film is
strongly frustrated. Such films demonstrate canted magnetization with the easy
axis rotating as a function of temperature. The magnetism appears via
consecutive paramagnetic - cluster glass - ferromagnetic transitions, rather
than a single second-order phase transition. But most remarkably, the
extraordinary Hall effect changes sign at the critical concentration. We
suggest that this is associated with a reconstruction of the electronic
structure of the alloy at the normal metal - ferromagnet quantum phase
transition.
