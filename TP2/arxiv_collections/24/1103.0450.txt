We present here our results on a complete sample of Brightest Cluster
Galaxies (BCGs) in nearby Abell Clusters (distance class <3). Combined with
data from the literature, we provide parsec scale information for 34 BCGs. We
found that also radio loud BCGs have core structures very complex (e.g. 4C
26.42 in Abell 1795). Moreover, we noted a possible dichotomy between BCGs in
cool-core clusters and those in non-cool-core clusters. Among resolved sources,
those in cool-core clusters tend to have two-sided parsec scale jets, while
those in less relaxed clusters have predominantly one-sided parsec scale jets.
We suggest that this difference is caused by the interplay between the jets and
the surrounding medium. Evidence of recurrent activity is also found in BCGs in
cool-core clusters. For two peculiar cases of BCGs (IC 712 in Abell 1314 and
NGC 6047 in Abell 2151) we asked and obtained new VLBA observations a 1.6 GHz.
We discuss them here for the first time.
