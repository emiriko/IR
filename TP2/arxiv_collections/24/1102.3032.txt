The electronic properties of graphene zig-zag nanoribbons with electrostatic
potentials along the edges are investigated. Using the Dirac-fermion approach,
we calculate the energy spectrum of an infinitely long nanoribbon of finite
width $w$, terminated by Dirichlet boundary conditions in the transverse
direction. We show that a structured external potential that acts within the
edge regions of the ribbon, can induce a spectral gap and thus switches the
nanoribbon from metallic to insulating behavior. The basic mechanism of this
effect is the selective influence of the external potentials on the spinorial
wavefunctions that are topological in nature and localized along the boundary
of the graphene nanoribbon. Within this single particle description, the
maximal obtainable energy gap is $E_{\rm max}\propto \pi\hbar v_{\rm F}/w$,
i.e., $\approx 0.12$\,eV for $w=$15\,nm. The stability of the spectral gap
against edge disorder and the effect of disorder on the two-terminal
conductance is studied numerically within a tight-binding lattice model. We
find that the energy gap persists as long as the applied external effective
potential is larger than $\simeq 0.55\times W$, where $W$ is a measure of the
disorder strength. We argue that there is a transport gap due to localization
effects even in the absence of a spectral gap.
