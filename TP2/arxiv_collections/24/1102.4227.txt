We have stabilized an external cavity diode laser to a whispering gallery
mode resonator formed by a protrusion of a single-crystal magnesiumdifluoride
cylinder. The cylinder's compact dimensions (<1 cm^3) reduce the sensitivity to
vibrations and simplify the stabilization of its temperature in a compact
setup. In a comparison to an ultrastable laser used for precision metrology we
determine a minimum Allan deviation of 20 Hz, corresponding to a relative Allan
deviation of 6*10^-14, at an integration time of 100 ms. This level of
instability is compatible with the limits imposed by fundamental fluctuations
of the material's refractive index at room temperature.
