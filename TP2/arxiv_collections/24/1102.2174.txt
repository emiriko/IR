This paper relates the well-known Linear Temporal Logic with the logic of
propositional schemata introduced by the authors. We prove that LTL is
equivalent to a class of schemata in the sense that polynomial-time reductions
exist from one logic to the other. Some consequences about complexity are
given. We report about first experiments and the consequences about possible
improvements in existing implementations are analyzed.
