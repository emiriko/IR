We develop an analytical approach which provides the dependence of the mean
first-passage time (MFPT) for random walks on complex networks both on the
target connectivity and on the source-target distance. Our approach puts
forward two strongly different behaviors depending on the type - compact or non
compact - of the random walk. In the case of non compact exploration, we show
that the MFPT scales linearly with the inverse connectivity of the target, and
is largely independent of the starting point. On the contrary, in the compact
case the MFPT is controlled by the source-target distance, and we find that
unexpectedly the target connectivity becomes irrelevant for remote targets.
