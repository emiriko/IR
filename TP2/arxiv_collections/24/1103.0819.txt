There has recently been a large increase in the number of known eclipsing
radio millisecond pulsars in the Galactic field, many of which are associated
with Fermi gamma-ray sources. All are in tight binaries (P_b < 24hr) many of
which are classical "black widows" with very low mass companions (M_c << 0.1
M_sol) but some are "redbacks" with probably non-degenerate low mass companions
(M_c ~ 0.2 M_sol). I review the new discoveries, briefly discuss the distance
uncertainties and the implications for high-energy emission.
