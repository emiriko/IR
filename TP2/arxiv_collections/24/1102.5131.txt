We completely classify the real root subsystems of root systems of loop
algebras of Kac-Moody Lie algebras. This classification involves new notions of
"admissible subgroups" of the coweight lattice of a root system $\Psi$, and
"scaling functions" on $\Psi$. Our results generalise and simplify earlier work
on subsystems of real affine root systems.
