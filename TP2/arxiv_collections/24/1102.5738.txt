The momentum distribution is one of the most important quantities which
provides information about interactions in many-body systems. At the same time
it is a quantity that can easily be accessed in experiments on ultracold atoms.
In this paper, we consider mixtures of light and heavy fermionic atoms in an
optical lattice described effectively by the Falicov-Kimball model. Using a
Monte Carlo method, we study how different ordered density-wave phases can be
detected by measurement of the momentum distribution of the light atoms. We
also demonstrate that ordered phases can be seen in Bragg scattering
experiments. Our results indicate that the main factor that determines the
momentum distribution of the light atoms is the trap confinement. On the other
hand, the pattern formed by the heavy atoms seen in the Bragg scattering
experiments is very sensitive to the temperature and possibly can be used in
low-temperature thermometry.
