Spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the interaction between the spin and momentum of a
quantum particle, is crucial for many important condensed matter phenomena. The
recent experimental realization of SOC in neutral bosonic cold atoms provides a
new and ideal platform for investigating spin-orbit coupled quantum many-body
physics. In this Letter, we derive a generic Gross-Pitaevskii equation as the
starting point for the study of many-body dynamics in spin-orbit coupled
Bose-Einstein condensates. We show that different laser setups for realizing
the same SOC may lead to different mean field dynamics. Various ground state
phases (stripe, phase separation, etc.) of the condensate are found in
different parameter regions. A new oscillation period induced by the SOC,
similar to the Zitterbewegung oscillation, is found in the center of mass
motion of the condensate.
