The phenomenon is described that is an analogue of the Vavilov-Cherenkov
phenomenon and that could be observable in a space with the boundary separated
a well reflecting light metal and a dielectric. An electron that is moving at a
constant velocity in proximity to the such boundary creates surface
plasmon-polaritons with a phase velocity that is below the electron velocity.
The linear momentum of a photon in the created plasmon-polariton is calculated.
This momentum could be as high as a doubled initial electron momentum. In the
other case the electron that has created the photon in the plasmon-polariton
could totally lost its velocity. It is shown that at the non-zero temperature
this process has a non-zero probability.
