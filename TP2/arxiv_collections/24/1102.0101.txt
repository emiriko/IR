We reformulate the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid theory for
quasi-one-dimensional Fermion systems with many subbands across the Fermi
energy. Our theory enables us to obtain a rigorous expression of the local
density of states (LDOS) for general multichannel quantum wires, describing how
the power-law anomalies of LDOS depend on inter- and intra-subbands couplings
as well as the Fermi velocity of each band. The resulting formula for the
exponents is valid in the case of both bulk contact and edge contact, and thus
plays a fundamental role in the physical properties of multicomponent
Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid systems.
