A generalized Dirac equation is derived in order to describe charge carriers
moving in corrugated graphene, which is the case for temperatures above
10{\deg}K due to the presence of flexural phonons. Such interaction is taken
into account by considering an induced metric, in the same spirit as the
general relativity approach for the description of fermionic particle moving in
a curved space-time. The resulting equation allows to include in a natural way
the presence of other phonon branches as well as an external electromagnetic
field. It also predicts non-linear effects which are not present in the usual
vector potential approximation used in most of publications on the subject, as
well as the possibility of controlling electronic conductivity using pure
sinusoidal strain fields. The non-linear terms are important at high
temperatures, and can also lead to interesting effects, like e.g. resonances
between flexural phonons and external electromagnetic fields.
