The results of studies of 2006 VV2 and 13170 (1999 HF1) binary asteroids of
NEA group, (45) Eugenia and (87) Sylvia triple asteroids, (762) Pulcova and
(90) Antiope binary asteroids of the Main Belt are presented. For the asteroid
2006 VV2, color indices (B-V, V-R, R-I), the absolute magnitude (16.7 \pm
0.2m), a taxonomy class, the density (2.71 \pm 0.04 g/cm3), the masses of
components as well as refined form of the main component and the satellite
orbit were determined. For the (45) Eugenia asteroid, refined form the main
component, simulated orbits of both satellites were determined and it was
showed that the axis of rotation of the main component undergoes a forced
precession with an angle of 10 deg and a period of 66 days. Based on a
comparison of model lightcurves with observations over a long interval of time
of (90) Antiope asteroid, reflective surface properties of its components were
investigated. For asteroid (762) Pulcova, form of the main component was
determined and the reflective properties of its surface were investigated. For
asteroid 137170 (1999 HF1), estimates of the size of the main component (a =
2.12 \pm 0.02, b = 1.77 \pm 0.01, c = 1.73 \pm 0.03 km) were made and possible
stable orbit of the satellite (with the elements of a~6.2 km, e~0.1, i~2 deg)
was identified and of component masses were estimated. For the asteroid (87)
Sylvia, form the main component was refined.
