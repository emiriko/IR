We demonstrate the fast accumulation of Cr atoms in a conservative potential
from a magnetically guided atomic beam. Without laser cooling on a cycling
transition, a single dissipative step realized by optical pumping allows to
load atoms at a rate of 2*10^7 1/s in the trap. Within less than 100 ms we
reach the collisionally dense regime, from which we directly produce a
Bose-Einstein condensate with subsequent evaporative cooling. This constitutes
a new approach to degeneracy where, provided a slow beam of particles can be
produced by some means, Bose-Einstein condensation can be reached for species
without a cycling transition.
