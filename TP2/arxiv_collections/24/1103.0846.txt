If the zeta function regularization is used and a complex mass term
considered for fermions, the phase does not appear in the fermion determinant.
This is not a drawback of the regularization, which can recognize the phase
through source terms, as demonstrated by the anomaly equation which is
explicitly derived here for a complex mass term.
