The recent results in \sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) reported by the ALICE collaboration shows that the power-law
energy-dependence of charged hadron multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions is
significantly different from p+p collisions. We show that this different
energy-dependence can be explained by inclusion of a strong angular-ordering in
the gluon-decay cascade within the Color-Glass-Condensate (or gluon saturation)
approach. This effect is more important in nucleus-nucleus collisions where the
saturation scale is larger than 1 GeV. Our prescription gives a good
description of the LHC data both in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions.
