We define a new family of matrix product states which are exact ground states
of spin 1/2 Hamiltonians on one dimensional lattices. This class of
Hamiltonians contain both Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions but
at specified and not arbitrary couplings. We also compute in closed forms the
one and two-point functions and the explicit form of the ground state. The
degeneracy structure of the ground state is also discussed.
