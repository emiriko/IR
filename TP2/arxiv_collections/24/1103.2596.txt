Label propagation has proven to be a fast method for detecting communities in
complex networks. Recent work has also improved the accuracy and stability of
the basic algorithm, however, a general approach is still an open issue. We
propose different label propagation algorithms that convey two unique
strategies of community formation, namely, defensive preservation and offensive
expansion of communities. Furthermore, the strategies are combined in an
advanced label propagation algorithm that retains the advantages of both
approaches; and are enhanced with hierarchical community extraction, prominent
for the use on larger networks. The proposed algorithms were empirically
evaluated on different benchmarks networks with planted partition and on over
30 real-world networks of various types and sizes. The results confirm the
adequacy of the propositions and give promising grounds for future analysis of
(large) complex networks. Nevertheless, the main contribution of this work is
in showing that different types of networks (with different topological
properties) favor different strategies of community formation.
