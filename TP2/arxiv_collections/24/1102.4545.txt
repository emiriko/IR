We investigate theoretically and experimentally the transport properties of a
plain Al superconducting strip in the presence of a single straight
current-carrying wire, oriented perpendicular to the superconducting strip. It
is well known that the critical current of the superconducting strip, Ic, in
such cryotron--like system can be tuned by changing the current in the control
wire, Iw. We demonstrated that the discrete change in the number of the pinned
vortices/antivortices inside the narrow and long strip nearby the
current-carrying wire results in a peculiar oscillatory dependence of Ic on Iw.
