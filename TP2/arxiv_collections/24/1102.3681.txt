The current definition of a conditional probability distribution enables one
to update probabilities only on the basis of stochastic information. This paper
provides a definition for conditional probability distributions with
non-stochastic information. The definition is derived as a solution of a
decision theoretic problem, where the information is connected to the outcome
of interest via a loss function. We shall show that the Kullback-Leibler
divergence plays a central role. Some illustrations are presented.
