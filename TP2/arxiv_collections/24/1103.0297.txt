In this paper we describe a first quantitative search for several molecules
in Titan's stratosphere in Cassini CIRS infrared spectra. These are: ammonia
(NH3), methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (H2CO), and acetonitrile (CH3CN), all of
which are predicted by photochemical models but only the last of which
observed, and not in the infrared. We find non-detections in all cases, but
derive upper limits on the abundances from low-noise observations at 25{\deg}S
and 75{\deg}N. Comparing these constraints to model predictions, we conclude
that CIRS is highly unlikely to see NH3 or CH3OH emissions. However, CH3CN and
H2CO are closer to CIRS detectability, and we suggest ways in which the
sensitivity threshold may be lowered towards this goal.
