Spin resistivity $R$ has been shown to result mainly from the scattering of
itinerant spins with magnetic impurities and lattice spins. $R$ is proportional
to the spin-spin correlation so that its behavior is very complicated near and
at the magnetic phase transition of the lattice spins. For the time being there
are many new experimental data on the spin resistivity going from
semiconductors to superconductors. Depending on materials, various behaviors
have been observed. There is however no theory so far which gives a unified
mechanism for spin resistivity in magnetic materials. Recently, we have showed
Monte Carlo results for different systems. We found that the spin resistivity
is very different from one material to another. In this paper, we show for the
first time how the dynamic relaxation time of the lattice spins affects the
resistivity of itinerant spins observed in Monte Carlo simulation.
