One of the basic motivations of the KLOE-2 and WASA-at-COSY experiments is
the test of fundamental symmetries and the search for phenomena beyond the
Standard Model in the hadronic and leptonic decays of ground-state mesons and
in particular in decays of the $\eta$ meson. At COSY these mesons are produced
in collisions of proton or deuteron beam with hydrogen or deuterium pellet
target, and at DA$\Phi$NE $\eta$ mesons originate from radiative decays of
$\phi$ meson or from the fusion of virtual gamma quanta exchanged between
colliding electrons and positrons. This contribution includes brief description
of experimental techniques used by KLOE-2 and WASA-at-COSY as well as some of
physics aspects motivating investigations of production and decays of $\eta$
mesons.
