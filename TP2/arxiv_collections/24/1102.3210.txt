Based on the near-IR spectra of 33 late-type stars in the wide metallicity
range (mainly dwarfs and partly giants) obtained with IRCS+AO188 of the Subaru
Telescope, we confirmed that He I 10830A line is seen in absorption in almost
all moderately to extremely metal-poor stars of thick disk and halo population
(from [Fe/H]~ -0.5 down to [Fe/H]~ -3.7), the strength of which is almost
constant irrespective of the metallicity. This is an evidence that
chromospheric activity at a basal level persists even for such old stars,
despite that their rotations are considered to be slowed down and incapable of
sustaining a dynamo, suggesting that some kind of chromospheric heating
mechanism independent of rotation/magnetism (e.g., acoustic heating) may take
place.
