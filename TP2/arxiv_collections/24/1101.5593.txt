Considerable efforts are currently devoted to the preparation of ultracold
neutral atoms in the emblematic strongly correlated quantum Hall regime. The
routes followed so far essentially rely on thermodynamics, i.e. imposing the
proper Hamiltonian and cooling the system towards its ground state. In rapidly
rotating 2D harmonic traps the role of the transverse magnetic field is played
by the angular velocity. For particle numbers significantly larger than unity,
the required angular momentum is very large and it can be obtained only for
spinning frequencies extremely near to the deconfinement limit; consequently,
the required control on experimental parameters turns out to be far too
stringent. Here we propose to follow instead a dynamic path starting from the
gas confined in a rotating ring. The large moment of inertia of the fluid
facilitates the access to states with a large angular momentum, corresponding
to a giant vortex. The initial ring-shaped trapping potential is then
adiabatically transformed into a harmonic confinement, which brings the
interacting atomic gas in the desired quantum Hall regime. We provide clear
numerical evidence that for a relatively broad range of initial angular
frequencies, the giant vortex state is adiabatically connected to the bosonic
$\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state, and we discuss the scaling to many particles.
