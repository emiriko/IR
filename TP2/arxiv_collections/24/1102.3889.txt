Tunneling density of states measurements of disordered superconducting (SC)
Al films in high Zeeman fields reveal a significant population of subgap states
which cannot be explained by standard BCS theory. We provide a natural
explanation of these excess states in terms of a novel disordered
Larkin-Ovchinnikov (dLO) phase that occurs near the spin-paramagnetic
transition at the Chandrasekhar-Clogston critical field. The dLO superconductor
is characterized by a pairing amplitude that changes sign at domain walls.
These domain walls carry magnetization and support Andreev bound states, which
lead to distinct spectral signatures at low energy.
