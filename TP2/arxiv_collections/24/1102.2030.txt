We generalize here our earlier results on particle acceleration by naked
singularities. We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due
to gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where
particles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass
energies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric
gravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In
this paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse
models leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of
collapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior
restrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show
that when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the
energy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus
offering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of
various possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy
particles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of
gravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the
working of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the
energy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy
density has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked
singularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked
singularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role
in the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly
energetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate
in extreme high energy collisions.
