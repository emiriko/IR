Nanowire (NW) arrays form spontaneously after high temperature annealing of a
submonolayer deposition of Pt on a Ge(001) surface. These NWs are a single atom
wide, with a length limited only by the underlying beta-terrace to which they
are uniquely connected. Using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT)
calculations we study possible geometries of the NWs and substrate. Direct
comparison to experiment is made via calculated scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) images. Based on these images, geometries for the beta-terrace and the
NWs are identified, and a formation path for the nanowires as function of
increasing local Pt density is presented. We show the beta-terrace to be a
dimer row surface reconstruction with a checkerboard pattern of Ge-Ge and Pt-Ge
dimers. Most remarkably, comparison of calculated to experimental STM images
shows the NWs to consist of germanium atoms embedded in the Pt-lined troughs of
the underlying surface, contrary to what was assumed previously in experiments.
