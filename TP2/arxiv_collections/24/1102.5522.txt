We present an example of a generically forbidden phase transition in 1d at
finite temperature -- stress induced and thermally assisted roughening of a
superclimbing dislocation in a Peierls potential. We also argue that such
roughening is behind the strong suppression of the superflow through solid \he4
in a narrow temperature range recently observed by Ray and Hallock (Phys.Rev.
Lett. {\bf 105}, 145301 (2010)).
