Resonant Raman spectroscopy is realized on closely spaced nanowire based
quantum wells. Phonon quantization consistent with 2.4 nm thick quantum wells
is observed, in agreement with cross-section transmission electron microscopy
measurements and photoluminescence experiments. The creation of a high density
plasma within the quantized structures is demonstrated by the observation of
coupled plasmon-phonon modes. The density of the plasma and thereby the
plasmon-phonon interaction is controlled with the excitation power. This work
represents a base for further studies on confined high density charge systems
in nanowires.
