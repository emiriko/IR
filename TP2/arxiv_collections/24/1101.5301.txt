We study the dynamics and thermodynamics of one-dimensional spin-orbital
models relevant for transition metal oxides. We show that collective spin,
orbital, and combined spin-orbital excitations with infinite lifetime can
exist, if the ground state of both sectors is ferromagnetic. Our main focus is
the case of effectively ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) exchange for the spin
(orbital) sector, respectively, and we investigate the renormalization of spin
excitations via spin-orbital fluctuations using a boson-fermion representation.
We contrast a mean-field decoupling approach with results obtained by treating
the spin-orbital coupling perturbatively. Within the latter self-consistent
approach we find a significant increase of the linewidth and additional
structures in the dynamical spin structure factor as well as Kohn anomalies in
the spin-wave dispersion caused by the scattering of spin excitations from
orbital fluctuations. Finally, we analyze the specific heat c(T) by comparing a
numerical solution of the model obtained by the density-matrix renormalization
group with perturbative results. At low temperatures T we find numerically c(T)
T pointing to a low-energy effective theory with dynamical critical exponent
z=1.
