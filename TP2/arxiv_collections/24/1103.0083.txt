To optimize telecom service management, it is necessary that information
about telecom services is highly related to the most popular telecom service.
To this end, we propose an algorithm for mining target-oriented fuzzy
correlation rules. In this paper, we show that by using the fuzzy statistics
analysis and the data mining technology, the target-oriented fuzzy correlation
rules can be obtained from a given database. We conduct an experiment by using
a sample database from a telecom service provider in Taiwan. Our work can be
used to assist the telecom service provider in providing the appropriate
services to the customers for better customer relationship management.
