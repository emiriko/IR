Selene is the attempt to implement a new scheme for high-intensity specular
reflectometry. Instead of a highly collimated beam one uses a convergent beam
covering a large angular range. The angular resolution is then performed by a
position-sensitive detector. Off-specular scattering in this set-up leads to
some background, but for screening of wide parameter ranges (e.g. temperature,
electric and magnetic fields) the intensity gain of at least one order of
magnitude is essential. If necessary, the high precession measurements (even
with off-specular components) then are performed with the conventional set-up.
The heart of this new set-up is an elliptically focusing guide element of 2\,m
length. Though this guide is optimised for the use on the TOF reflectometer
Amor at SINQ, it can be used as stand-alone device to check the possible
application also for other neutron scattering techniques. The first
measurements on AMOR confirmed the general concept and the various operation
modes. A draw-back occurred due to problems with the internal alignment of the
guide. Nevertheless in the TOF mode a gain factor of 10 was reached, and a
factor 25 can be expected for an improved guide.
