We present a novel approach to the readout of ionization detectors. The
solution allows to minimize the number of components and the space occupation
close to the detector. This way a minimal impact is added on the radioactive
background in those experiments where very low signal rates are expected, such
as GERDA and MAJORANA. The circuit consists in a JFET transistor and a remote
second stage. The DC feedback path is closed using a diode. Two signal cables
are only necessary for biasing and readout.
