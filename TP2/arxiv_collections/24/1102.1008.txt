We show that rotating shallow water dynamics possesses an approximate
(adiabatic-type) positive quadratic invariant, which exists not only at
mid-latitudes (where its analogue in the quasigeostrophic equation has been
previously investigated), but near the equator as well (where the
quasigeostrophic equation is inapplicable). Deriving the extra invariant, we
find "small denominators" of two kinds: (1) due to the triad resonances (as in
the case of the quasigeostrophic equation) and (2) due to the equatorial limit,
when the Rossby radius of deformation becomes infinite. We show that the "small
denominators" of both kinds can be canceled. The presence of the extra
invariant can lead to the generation of zonal jets. We find that this tendency
should be especially pronounced near the equator. Similar invariant occurs in
magnetically confined fusion plasmas and can lead to the emergence of zonal
flows.
