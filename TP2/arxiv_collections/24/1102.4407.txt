A recent Letter in Physical Review Letters, "Contextual Values of Observables
in Quantum Measurements", by J. Dressel, S. Agarwal, and A. N. Jordan
(abbreviated DAJ below), introduces the concept of "contextual values" and
claims that they lead to "a natural definition of a general conditioned average
that converges uniquely to the quantum weak value in the minimal disturbance
limit". However, they do not define "minimal disturbance limit". The present
paper is in part the saga of my search for a definition of "minimal disturbance
limit" under which this claim could be proved. The search finally ended in what
is probably a definitive counterexample to the claim.
