The quark-lepton complementarity (QLC) relations indicate a deep structure
that interrelates quarks and leptons. We propose new scenarios, in a seesaw
framework with discrete $A_4$ flavor symmetry, which can accommodate the QLC
relations and the nonzero neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ together with all
the available neutrino experimental data, in a consistent way to generate the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for the quark mixing. Certain effective
dimension-5 operators are introduced, which induce a deviation of the lepton
mixing matrix from the tribimaximal mixing (TBM) pattern and lead the quark
mixing matrix to the CKM one in form. We explicitly demonstrate three different
possibilities of constructing the charged lepton mixing matrix and point out
that the {\it phases} of whose elements play a crucial role to satisfy the QLC
relations. We find that for the reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ its possible
values can vary around the center value $\sin \theta_{13} \simeq \lambda
/\sqrt{2}$ ($\lambda \simeq 0.22$ being the Cabbibo angle) and have the lower
bound $\theta_{13} \gtrsim 3.5^{\circ}$. We also show that sizable leptonic CP
violation characterized by the Jarlskog invariant $|J_{\rm CP}|\sim{\cal
O}(10^{-2})$ is allowed, which is expected to be tested in the future
experiments such as the upcoming long baseline neutrino oscillation ones.
