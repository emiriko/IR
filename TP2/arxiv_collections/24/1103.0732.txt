In this work, we study parametric resonances in an elongated cigar-shaped BEC
in a combined harmonic trap and a time dependent optical lattice by using
numerical and analytical techniques. We show that there exists a relative
competition between the harmonic trap which tries to spatially localize the BEC
and the time varying optical lattice which tries to delocalize the BEC. This
competition gives rise to parametric resonances (collapse and revival of the
oscillations of the BEC width). Parametric resonances disappear when one of the
competing factors i.e strength of harmonic trap or the strength of optical
lattice dominates. Parametric instabilities (exponential growth of Bogoliubov
modes) arise for large variations in the strength of the optical lattice.
