Pulse formation in passively mode locked lasers is often accompanied with
dispersive waves that form of spectral sidebands due to spatial inhomogoneities
in the laser cavity. Here we present an explicit calculation of the amplitude,
frequency, and precise shape of the sidebands accompanying a soliton-like
pulse. We then extend the study to the global steady state of mode locked laser
with a variable number of pulses, and present experimental results in a mode
locked fiber laser that confirm the theory. The strong correlation between the
temporal width of the sidebands and the measured spacing between the pulses in
multipulse operation suggests that the sidebands have an important role in the
inter-pulse interaction.
