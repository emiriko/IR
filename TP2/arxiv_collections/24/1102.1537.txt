We have analyzed pion-nucleon scattering using the manifestly relativistic
covariant framework of Infrared Regularization up to {\cal O}(q^3) in the
chiral expansion, where q is a generic small momentum. We describe the
low-energy phase shifts with a similar quality as previously achieved with
Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory, \sqrt{s}\lesssim1.14 GeV. New values
are provided for the {\cal O}(q^2) and {\cal O}(q^3) low-energy constants,
which are compared with previous determinations. This is also the case for the
scattering lengths and volumes. Finally, we have unitarized the previous
amplitudes and as a result the energy range where data are reproduced increases
significantly.
