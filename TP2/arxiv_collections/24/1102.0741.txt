We consider the possibility of studying new physics that singles out the
tau-lepton at the LHC. We concentrate on the tau-lepton charge asymmetry in
tau+tau- pair production as a tool to probe this physics beyond the Standard
Model. We consider two generic scenarios for the new physics. We first study a
non-universal Z' boson as an example of a new resonance that can single out
tau-leptons. We then consider vector lepto-quarks coupling of the first
generation quarks with the third generation leptons as an example of
non-resonant new physics. We find that in both cases the charge asymmetry can
be sufficiently sensitive to the new physics to provide useful constraints at
the LHC.
