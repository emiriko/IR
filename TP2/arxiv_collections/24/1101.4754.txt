We report a theoretical low-field magnetotransport study unveiling the effect
of pseudospin in realistic models of weakly disordered graphene-based
materials. Using an efficient Kubo computational method, and simulating the
effect of charges trapped in the oxide, different magnetoconductance
fingerprints are numerically obtained in system sizes as large as 0.3
micronmeter squared, containing tens of millions of carbon atoms. In
two-dimensional graphene, a strong valley mixing is found to irreparably yield
a positive magnetoconductance (weak localization), whereas crossovers from
positive to a negative magnetoconductance (weak antilocalization) are obtained
by reducing disorder strength down to the ballistic limit. In sharp contrast,
graphene nanoribbons with lateral size as large as 10nm show no sign of weak
antilocalization, even for very small disorder strength. Our results
rationalize the emergence of a complex phase diagram of magnetoconductance
fingerprints, shedding some new light on the microscopical origin of pseudospin
effects.
