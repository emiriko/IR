During the past decade, long-baseline neutrino experiments played a
fundamental role in confirming neutrino flavor change and in measuring the
neutrino mixing matrix with high precision. This role will be amplified with
the next generation of experiments, which will begin probing the possibility of
CP violation in the leptonic sector and possibly pin down the neutrino mass
hierarchy. An account of the most recent results from the MINOS experiment is
presented, along with the earlier measurement from the K2K experiment. The next
generation projects, T2K and NOvA, are described and their current status,
schedule and physics reach discussed. Finally, we report on future efforts,
currently in the R&D stage, such as the LBNE and T2KK projects.
