We study Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the local density of states
(LDOS) for topological insulator (TI) and conventional metal Au(111) surfaces
with spin-orbit interaction, which can be probed by spin-polarized scanning
tunneling microscopy. We show that the spacial AB oscillatory period in the
total LDOS is a flux quantum $\Phi_{0}\mathtt{=}hc/e$ (weak localization) in
both systems. Remarkably, an analogous weak antilocalization with $\Phi_{0}/2$
periodic spacial AB oscillations in spin components of LDOS for TI surface is
observed, while it is absent in Au(111).
