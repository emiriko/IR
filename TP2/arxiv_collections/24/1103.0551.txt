Measuring dark matter substructure within galaxy cluster haloes is a
fundamental probe of the Lambda-CDM model of structure formation. Gravitational
lensing is a technique for measuring the total mass distribution which is
independent of the nature of the gravitating matter, making it a vital tool for
studying these dark-matter dominated objects. We present a new method for
measuring weak gravitational lensing flexions, the gradients of the lensing
shear field, to measure mass distributions on small angular scales. While
previously published methods for measuring flexions focus on measuring derived
properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface
brightness moments, our method instead fits a
mass-sheet-transformation-invariant Analytic Image Model (AIM) to the each
galaxy image. This simple parametric model traces the distortion of lensed
image isophotes and constrains the flexion fields. We test the AIM method using
simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image
properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields.
We also apply the AIM method for flexion measurement to Hubble Space Telescope
observations of Abell 1689, and detect mass structure in the cluster using
flexions measured with the AIM method.
