We compute the anomalous dimensions of the flavour non-singlet twist-2 Wilson
operators in the RI'/SMOM scheme at two loops in an arbitrary linear covariant
gauge. In addition we provide the full Green's function for these operators
inserted in a quark 2-point function at the symmetric subtraction point. The
three loop anomalous dimensions in the Landau gauge are also derived.
