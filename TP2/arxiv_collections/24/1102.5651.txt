In this paper we study the spheroidal cases of static charged fluid
configurations in general relativity. We consider the effect of the anisotropic
stresses of electromagnetic field on the shape of static charged self-graviting
objects. It is shown that electromagnetic fields can have significant effect on
the structure and properties of self-graviting objects.
