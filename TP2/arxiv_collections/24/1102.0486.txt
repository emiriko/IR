The goal of any cryptographic system is the exchange of information among the
intended users without any leakage of information to others who may have
unauthorized access to it. A common secret key could be created over a public
channel accessible to any opponent. Neural networks can be used to generate
common secret key. In case of neural cryptography, both the communicating
networks receive an identical input vector, generate an output bit and are
trained based on the output bit. The two networks and their weight vectors
exhibit a novel phenomenon, where the networks synchronize to a state with
identical time-dependent weights. The generated secret key over a public
channel is used for encrypting and decrypting the information being sent on the
channel. This secret key is distributed to the other vendor efficiently by
using an agent based approach.
