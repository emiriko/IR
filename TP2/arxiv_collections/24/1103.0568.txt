In this paper we define the canonical mixed extension of a decision form
game. We motivate the necessity to introduce this concept and we show several
examples about the new concept. In particular we focus our study upon the mixed
equilibria of a finite decision form game. Many developments appear possible
for applications to economics, physics, medicine and biology in those cases for
which the systems involved do not have natural utility functions but are only
capable to react versus the external actions.
