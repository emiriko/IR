The 2009 WZ104 asteroid was discovered with 68-cm Schmidt Catalina Sky Survey
telescope of Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona (USA) in 25 of November 2009.
The observations of the new object were confirmed with 60-cm reflector of
Schiaparelli observatory (Italy) and 35-cm Schmidt - Cassegrain telescope of
Alter Saltzberg observatory (Vienna, Austria). The asteroid was attributed as
potentially hazardous near Earth asteroid. The minimal orbit intersection
distance is 0.0304 a.e.
  The observations of the 2009 WZ104 asteroid were continued with MTM-500M
50-cm meniscus telescope and ZA-320M 32-cm mirror astrograph of Pulkovo
observatory (Russia) since late 2009. The observations were made in the
framework of NEOs investigation program. The following tasks were established
for the investigation: to get astrometric and photometric (in BVRI bands)
series of observations, to improve the asteroid orbit on the base of the
observational data, to determine its taxonomic class and absolute magnitude, to
investigate the dynamics of its rotation, to estimate its physical parameters.
The asteroid was attributed to Aten group among NEAs.
