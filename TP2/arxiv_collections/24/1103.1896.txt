It had been known since old times [MO, Da] that there exists a universal
finite type invariant ("an expansion") Z^{old} for Knotted Trivalent Graphs
(KTGs), and that it can be chosen to intertwine between some of the standard
operations on KTGs and their chord-diagrammatic counterparts (so that relative
to those operations, it is "homomorphic"). Yet perhaps the most important
operation on KTGs is the "edge unzip" operation, and while the behavior of
Z^{old} under edge unzip is well understood, it is not plainly homomorphic as
some "correction factors" appear.
  In this paper we present two (equivalent) ways of modifying Z^{old} into a
new expansion Z, defined on "dotted Knotted Trivalent Graphs" (dKTGs), which is
homomorphic with respect to a large set of operations. The first is to replace
"edge unzips" by "tree connect sums", and the second involves somewhat
restricting the circumstances under which edge unzips are allowed. As we shall
explain, the newly defined class dKTG of knotted trivalent graphs retains all
the good qualities that KTGs have - it remains firmly connected with the
Drinfel'd theory of associators and it is sufficiently rich to serve as a
foundation for an "Algebraic Knot Theory". As a further application, we present
a simple proof of the good behavior of the LMO invariant under the Kirby II
(band-slide) move [LMMO].
