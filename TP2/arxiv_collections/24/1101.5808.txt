We analyse the strength of CP violation in an extension of the standard model
with an extra $Q=-1/3$ vector-like singlet quark, in the framework of the
hypothesis of universality of strength of Yukawa couplings connecting standard
quarks. We show that the correct pattern of quark masses and mixing can be
obtained, including the observed strength of CP violation.
