We implement an algorithm which is aimed to reduce the dimensions of the
Hilbert space of quantum many-body systems by means of a renormalization
procedure. We test the role and importance of different representations on the
reduction process by working out and analyzing the spectral properties of
strongly interacting frustrated quantum spin systems.
