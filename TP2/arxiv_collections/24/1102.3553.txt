Using f (R) gravity in the Palatini formularism, the metric for a charged
spherically symmetric black hole is derived, taking the Ricci scalar curvature
to be constant. The generalized uncertainty principle is then used to calculate
the temperature of the resulting black hole, through this the entropy is found
correcting the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in this case. Using the entropy the
tunneling probability and heat capacity are calculated up to the order of the
Planck length, which produces an extra factor that becomes important as black
holes become small, such as in the case of mini black holes.
