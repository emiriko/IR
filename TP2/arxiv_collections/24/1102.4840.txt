In previous paper derivations of the Green function have been given for 5D
off-shell electrodynamics in the framework of the manifestly covariant
relativistic dynamics of Stueckelberg (with invariant evolution parameter
$\tau$). In this paper, we reconcile these derivations resulting in different
explicit forms, and relate our results to the conventional fundamental
solutions of linear 5D wave equations published in the mathematical literature.
We give physical arguments for the choice of the Green function retarded in the
fifth variable $\tau$.
