We study simple diffusion where a particle stochastically resets to its
initial position at a constant rate r. A finite resetting rate leads to a
nonequilibrium stationary state with non-Gaussian fluctuations for the particle
position. We also show that the mean time to find a stationary target by a
diffusive searcher is finite and has a minimum value at an optimal resetting
rate r^*. Resetting also alters fundamentally the late time decay of the
survival probability of a stationary target when there are multiple searchers:
while the typical survival probability decays exponentially with time, the
average decays as a power law with an exponent depending continuously on the
density of searchers.
