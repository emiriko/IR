The paper presents Multi-Level Steganography (MLS), which defines a new
concept for hidden communication in telecommunication networks. In MLS, at
least two steganographic methods are utilised simultaneously, in such a way
that one method (called the upper-level) serves as a carrier for the second one
(called the lower-level). Such a relationship between two (or more) information
hiding solutions has several potential benefits. The most important is that the
lower-level method steganographic bandwidth can be utilised to make the
steganogram unreadable even after the detection of the upper-level method:
e.g., it can carry a cryptographic key that deciphers the steganogram carried
by the upper-level one. It can also be used to provide the steganogram with
integrity. Another important benefit is that the lower-layer method may be used
as a signalling channel in which to exchange information that affects the way
that the upper-level method functions, thus possibly making the steganographic
communication harder to detect. The prototype of MLS for IP networks was also
developed, and the experimental results are included in this paper.
