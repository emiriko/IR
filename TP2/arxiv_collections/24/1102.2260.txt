The effects of hydrogen (H2) and deuterium (D2) absorption were studied in
two Co/Pd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) using
polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR). PNR was measured in an external magnetic
field H applied in the plane of the sample with the magnetization M confined in
the plane for {\mu}_o H= 6.0 T and partially out of plane at 0.65 T. Nominal
thicknesses of the Co and Pd layers were 2.5 {\AA} and 21 {\AA}, respectively.
Because of these small values, the actual layer chemical composition,
thickness, and interface roughness parameters were determined from the nuclear
scattering length density profile ({\rho}_n) and its derivative obtained from
both x-ray reflectivity and PNR, and uncertainties were determined using Monte
Carlo analysis. The PNR {\rho}_n showed that although D2 absorption occurred
throughout the samples, absorption in the multilayer stack was modest (0.02 D
per Pd atom) and thus did not expand. Direct magnetometry showed that H2
absorption decreased the total M at saturation and increased the component of M
in the plane of the sample when not at saturation. The PNR magnetic scattering
length density ({\rho}_m) revealed that the Pd layers in the multilayer stack
were magnetized and that their magnetization was preferentially modified upon
D2 absorption. In one sample, a modulation of M with twice the multilayer
period was observed at {\mu}_o H= 0.65 T, which increased upon D2 absorption.
These results indicate that H2 or D2 absorption decreases both the PMA and
total magnetization of the samples. The lack of measurable expansion during
absorption indicates that these changes are primarily governed by modification
of the electronic structure of the material.
