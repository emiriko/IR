Low-temperature specific heat of the monolayer high-Tc superconductor
Bi_2Sr_{2-x}La_xCuO_{6+\delta} has been measured close to the optimal doping
point (x ~ 0.4) in different magnetic fields. The identification of both a T^2
term in zero field and a \sqrt{H} dependence of the specific heat in fields is
shown to follow the theoretical prediction for d-wave pairing, which enables us
to extract the slope of the superconducting gap in the vicinity of the nodes
(v_{\Delta}, which is proportional to the superconducting gap \Delta_0 at the
antinodes according to the standard d_{x^2-y^2} gap function). The v_{\Delta}
or \Delta_0 (~ 12 meV) determined from this bulk measurement shows close
agreement with that obtained from spectroscopy or tunneling measurements, which
confirms the simple d-wave form of the superconducting gap.
