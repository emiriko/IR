We present a study of the inclusive J/psi cross section at 2.76 TeV and 5.5
TeV. The energy dependence of the cross section, rapidity and transverse
momentum distributions are evaluated phenomenologically. Their knowledge is
crucial as a reference for the interpretation of A-A and p-A J/psi results at
the LHC. Our approach is the following: first, we estimate the energy evolution
of the pt-integrated J/psi cross section at mid-rapidity; then, we evaluate the
rapidity dependence; finally, we study the transverse momentum distribution
trend. Whenever possible, both theory driven (based on pQCD predictions) and
functional form (data driven fits) calculations are discussed. Our predictions
are compared with the recently obtained results by the ALICE collaboration in
pp collisions at 2.76 TeV.
