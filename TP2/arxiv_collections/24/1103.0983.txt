In this PhD thesis I make use of the "Effective Field Theory of Gravity for
Extended Objects" by Goldberger and Rothstein in order to investigate theories
of gravity and to take a different point of view on the physical information
that can be extracted from experiments. In the first work I present, I study a
scalar-tensor theory of gravity and I address the renormalization of the
energy-momentum tensor for point-like and string-like sources. The second and
third study I report are set in the context of testing gravity. So far
experiments have probed dynamical regimes only up to order (v/c)^5 in the
post-Newtonian expansion, which corresponds to the very first term of the
radiative sector in General Relativity. In contrast, by means of
gravitational-wave astronomy, one aims at testing General Relativity up to
(v/c)^(12)! It is then relevant to envisage testing frameworks which are
appropriate to this strong-field/radiative regime. In the last two chapters of
this thesis a new such framework is presented. Using the effective field theory
approach, General Relativity non-linearities are described by Feynman diagrams
in which classical gravitons interact with matter sources and among themselves.
Tagging the self-interaction vertices of gravitons with parameters it is
possible, for example, to translate the measure of the period decay of
Hulse-Taylor pulsar in a constraint on the three-graviton vertex at the 0.1%
level; for comparison, LEP constraints on the triple-gauge-boson couplings of
weak interactions are accurate at 3%. With future observations of gravitational
waves, higher order graviton vertices can in principle be constrained through a
Fisher matrix analysis.
