We carry out the first time-dependent numerical MagnetoHydroDynamic modeling
of an extrasolar planetary system to study the interaction of the stellar
magnetic field and wind with the planetary magnetosphere and outflow. We base
our model on the parameters of the HD 189733 system, which harbors a close-in
giant planet. Our simulation reveals a highly structured stellar corona
characterized by sectors with different plasma properties. The star-planet
interaction varies in magnitude and complexity, depending on the planetary
phase, planetary magnetic field strength, and the relative orientation of the
stellar and planetary fields. It also reveals a long, comet-like tail which is
a result of the wrapping of the planetary magnetospheric tail by its fast
orbital motion. A reconnection event occurs at a specific orbital phase,
causing mass loss from the planetary magnetosphere that can generate a hot spot
on the stellar surface. The simulation also shows that the system has
sufficient energy to produce hot-spots observed in Ca II lines in giant planet
hosting stars. However, the short duration of the reconnection event suggests
that such SPI cannot be observed persistently.
