We consider the electromagnetic and transition pion form factors. Using
dispersion relations we simultaneously describe both the hadronic, time-like
region and the asymptotic region of large energy-momentum transfer. For the
latter we propose a novel mechanism of Regge fermion exchange. We find that
hadronic contributions dominate form factors at all currently available
energies.
