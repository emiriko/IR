The detection of small-amplitude nonradial modes in high-amplitude Delta Sct
(HADS) variables has been very elusive until at least five of them were
detected in the light curve of V974 Oph obtained from ground-based
observations. The combination of radial and nonradial modes has a high
asteroseismic potential, thanks to the strong constraints we can put in the
modelling. The continuous monitoring of ASAS 192647-0030.0=CoRoT 101155310
(P=0.1258 d, V=13.4) ensured from space by the CoRoT (Convection, Rotation and
planetary Transits) mission constitutes a unique opportunity to exploit such
potential. The 22270 CoRoT measurements were performed in the chromatic mode.
They span 152 d and cover 1208 consecutive cycles. After the correction for one
jump and the long-term drift, the level of the noise turned out to be 29
micromag. The phase shifts and amplitude ratios of the coloured CoRoT data, the
HARPS spectra, and the period-luminosity relation were used to determine a
self-consistent physical model. In turn, it allowed us to model the oscillation
spectrum, also giving feedback on the internal structure of the star. In
addition to the fundamental radial mode f1=7.949 c/d with harmonics up to 10f1,
we detected 12 independent terms. Linear combinations were also found and the
light curve was solved by means of 61 frequencies (smallest amplitude 0.10
mmag). The newest result is the detection of a periodic modulation of the f1
mode (triplets at +/-0.193 c/d centred on f1 and 2f1), discussed as a
rotational effect or as an extension of the Blazhko effect to HADS stars. The
physical model suggests that CoRoT 101155310 is an evolved star, with a slight
subsolar metallic abundance, close to the terminal age main sequence. All the
12 additional terms are identified with mixed modes in the predicted overstable
region.
