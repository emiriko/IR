We show that the topologically protected flat band emerging on a surface of a
nodal fermionic system promotes the surface superconductivity due to an
infinitely large density of states associated with the flat band. The critical
temperature depends linearly on the pairing interaction and can be thus
considerably higher than the exponentially small bulk critical temperature. We
discuss an example of surface superconductivity in multilayered graphene with
rhombohedral stacking.
