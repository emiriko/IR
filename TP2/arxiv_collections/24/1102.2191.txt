We introduce the new concept of binary particle as the basic matter unit that
participates in weak interactions and not any one fermion singly. We state the
quantum numbers of this binary particle, and show the concept leads us to a
natural explanation of the standard model puzzle of the origin of flavor mixing
and the CKM matrix. Certain other puzzles of the standard model such as the
absence of flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC), are also explained
naturally by the binary particle model. These puzzles are currently thought to
be esoteric properties of electro weak interactions that have origins in
physics beyond the standard model at some ultra high energy scales. We show
that this is not necessarily the case.
