In the present work we aim to characterize the lattice configurations and the
magnetic behavior in the incommensurate phase of spin-Peierls systems. This
phase emerges when the magnetic exchange interaction is coupled to the
distortions of an underlying triangular lattice and has its experimental
realization in the quasi-one dimensional compound family TiOX (X = Cl, Br).
With a simple model of spin-1/2 chains inserted in a planar triangular geometry
which couples them elastically, we are able to obtain the
uniform-incommensurate and incommensurate-dimerized phase transitions seen in
these compounds. Moreover, we follow the evolution of the wave-vector of the
distortions with temperature inside the incommensurate phase. Finally, we
predict gapless spin excitations for the intermediate phase of TiOX compounds
along with incommensurate spin-spin correlations. This exotic Luttinger
liquid-like behavior could be observed in future experiments.
