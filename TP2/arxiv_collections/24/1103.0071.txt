Similar to the well-known phases of SLE, the Loewner differential equation
with Lip(1/2) driving terms is known to have a phase transition at norm 4, when
traces change from simple to non-simple curves. We establish the deterministic
analog of the second phase transition of SLE, where traces change to
space-filling curves: There is a constant C>4 such that a Loewner driving term
whose trace is space filling has Lip(1/2) norm at least C. We also provide a
geometric criterion for traces to be driven by Lip(1/2) functions, and show
that for instance the Hilbert space filling curve and the Sierpinski gasket
fall into this class.
