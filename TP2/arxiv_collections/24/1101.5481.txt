Three subjects are considered here: the relativistic hydrodynamics equations
for a boost-invariant expanding fluid; the fuzzy bag model for the pressure
which recently appeared in QCD phenomenology; and the early space-time
evolution of the QCD matter, drawn from model studies, which can also be
expected to arise in realistic fluid dynamics relevant to heavy ion collisions
at LHC.
