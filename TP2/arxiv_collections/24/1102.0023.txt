The paper presents a new hidden data insertion procedure based on estimated
probability of the remaining time of the call for steganographic method called
LACK (Lost Audio PaCKets steganography). LACK provides hidden communication for
real-time services like Voice over IP. The analytical results presented in this
paper concern the influence of LACK's hidden data insertion procedures on the
method's impact on quality of voice transmission and its resistance to
steganalysis. The proposed hidden data insertion procedure is also compared to
previous steganogram insertion approach based on estimated remaining average
call duration.
