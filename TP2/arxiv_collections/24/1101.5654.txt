We report coherent operation of a singlet-triplet qubit controlled by the
arrangement of two electrons in an adjacent double quantum dot. The system we
investigate consists of two pairs of capacitively coupled double quantum dots
fabricated by electrostatic gates on the surface of a GaAs heterostructure. We
extract the strength of the capacitive coupling between qubit and double
quantum dot and show that the present geometry allows fast conditional gate
operation, opening pathways to multi-qubit control and implementation of
quantum algorithms with spin qubits.
