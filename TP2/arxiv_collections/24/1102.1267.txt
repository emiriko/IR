The experimental results of the \babar\ and Belle collaborations are
presented on the measurement of the branching ratio for the decay $B^\pm \to
\tau^\pm \nu$, and the limits set on the branching ratios for the decays $B^\pm
\to e^\pm \nu, B^\pm \to e^\pm \nu \gamma,B^\pm \to \mu^\pm \nu$ and $B^\pm \to
\mu^\pm \nu \gamma$
