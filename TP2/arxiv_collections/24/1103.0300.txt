We studied the singularity of the geodesic surface congruence for timelike
and null strings using the expansion of the universe in the string theory. We
had Raychaudhuri type equation for the expansion. Assuming the stringy strong
energy condition and initial convergence, we induced the existence of
singularity and got the same inequality equation of the string strong energy
condition for both timelike and null stringy congruence. In this paper we want
to study the twist and shear aspects of the stingy geodesic surface congruence.
Under some natural conditions we derive the equations of the twist and the
shear in terms of the expansion of the universe. In appendix we investigate the
geodesic surface congruence of the null strings.
