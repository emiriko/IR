Data taking at the LHC is the beginning of a new era in particle physics
which will lead us towards understanding the completion of the Standard Model
at and beyond the TeV scale. I discuss different approaches to new physics
searches: driven by experimental anomalies, driven by model building, or driven
by new analysis ideas. All of them have their place as long as we keep an open
mind and see their opportunities as well as their limitations.
