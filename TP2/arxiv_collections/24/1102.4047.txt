We study the dynamics of ultracold atoms in tailored bichromatic optical
lattices. By tuning the lattice parameters, one can readily engineer the band
structure and realize a Dirac point, i.e. a true crossing of two Bloch bands.
The dynamics in the vicinity of such a crossing is described by the
one-dimensional Dirac equation, which is rigorously shown beyond the
tight-binding approximation. Within this framework we analyze the effects of an
external potential and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to
demonstrate Klein tunneling with current experimental setups.
