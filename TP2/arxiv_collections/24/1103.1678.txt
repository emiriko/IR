A preliminary design of inclinometer for real-time monitoring system of soil
displacement is proposed. The system is developed using accelerometer sensor
with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device. The main apparatus consists
of a single MEMS sensor attached to a solid pipe and stucked pependicularly far
away below the soil surface. The system utilizes small fractions of electrical
signals from MEMS sensor induced by the pipe inclination due to soil
displacements below the surface. It is argued that the system is accurate
enough to detect soil displacements responsible for landslides, and then
realizes a simple and low cost landslide early warning system.
