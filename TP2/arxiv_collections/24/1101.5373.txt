A highly efficient, fully parallelized, six-dimensional tracking model for
simulating interactions of colliding hadron beams in high energy ring colliders
and simulating schemes for mitigating their effects is described. The model
uses the weak-strong approximation for calculating the head-on interactions
when the test beam has lower intensity than the other beam, a look-up table for
the efficient calculation of long-range beam-beam forces, and a self-consistent
Poisson solver when both beams have comparable intensities. A performance test
of the model in a parallel environment is presented. The code is used to
calculate beam emittance and beam loss in the Tevatron at Fermilab and compared
with measurements. We also present results from the studies of two schemes
proposed to compensate the beam-beam interactions: a) the compensation of
long-range interactions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN with a current-carrying
wire, b) the use of a low energy electron beam to compensate the head-on
interactions in RHIC.
