A serious objection made by Wallstrom against quantum interpretations based
flow variables, in particular Nelsonian stochastics, is their empirical
inequivalence with quantum theory: They are unable to obtain a quantization
condition for flows around zeros which is automatically fulfilled by the wave
function.
  It is found that the quantization condition follows from a simple additional
postulate: The Laplace operator of the density has to be finite and positive at
zeros of the density. This postulate is a quite natural consequence of
subquantum theories, as far as they conform to a simple principle of minimal
distortion of the quantum solutions.
