We correct two errors in our previous computation of one-loop corrections to
the vortex string tension: (i) the contribution of the longitudinal and
timelike modes of the gauge fields were forgotten and are included now; (ii) a
trivial error in the numerical code has led to considerable errors in the
subtracted integrals. We here present the corrected results.
