In the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT) the mirror quarks induce the
special flavor structures and some new flavor-changing (FC) couplings which
could greatly enhance the production rates of the FC processes. We in this
paper study some bottom and anti-strange production processes in the LHT model
at the International Linear Collider (ILC), i.e., $e^+e^-\rightarrow b\bar{s}$
and $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow b\bar{s}$. The results show that the production
rates of these processes are sizeable for the favorable values of the
parameters. Therefore, it is quite possible to test the LHT model or make some
constrains on the relevant parameters of the LHT through the detection of these
processes at the ILC.
