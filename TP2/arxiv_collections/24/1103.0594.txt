In this paper we report on internal conversion coefficients for Z = 111 to Z
= 126 superheavy elements obtained from relativistic Dirac-Fock (DF)
calculations. The effect of the atomic vacancy created during the conversion
process has been taken into account using the so called "Frozen Orbital"
approximation. The selection of this atomic model is supported by our recent
comparison of experimental and theoretical conversion coefficients across a
wide range of nuclei. The atomic masses, valence shell electron configurations,
and theoretical atomic binding energies required for the calculations were
adopted from a critical evaluation of the published data. The new conversion
coefficient data tables presented here cover all atomic shells, transition
energies from 1 keV up to 6000 keV, and multipole orders of 1 to 5. A similar
approach was used in our previous calculations [1] for Z = 5 - 110.
