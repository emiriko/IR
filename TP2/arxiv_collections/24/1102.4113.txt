Energy transport control in low dimensional nano-scale systems has attracted
much attention in recent years. In this paper, we investigate the energy
transport properties of Frenkel-Kontorova lattice subject to a periodic driving
force, in particular, the resonance behavior of the energy current by varying
the external driving frequency. It is discovered that in certain parameter
ranges, multiple resonance peaks, instead of a single resonance, emerge. By
comparing the nonlinear lattice model with a harmonic chain, we unravel the
underlying physical mechanism for such resonance phenomenon. Other parameter
dependencies of the resonance behavior are examined as well. Finally, we
demonstrate that heat pumping is actually absent in this force-driven model.
