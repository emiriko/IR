Thermo-optical effects cause a bifocusing of incoming beams in optical media,
due to the birefringence created by a thermal lens that can resolve the
incoming beams into two-component signals of different polarizations. We
propose a non-perturbative theoretical description of the process of formation
of double-pulse solitons in Kerr optical media with a thermally-induced
birefringence, based on solving simultaneously the heat equation and the
propagation equation for a beam in a one-dimensional medium with uniform heat
flux load. By means of a non-isospectral Inverse Scattering Transform assuming
an initial solution with a pulse shape, a one-soliton solution to the wave
equation is obtained that represents a double-pulse beam which characteristic
properties depend strongly on the profile of heat spatial distribution.
