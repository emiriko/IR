We consider the bottom-up holographic models for QCD which contain the
ultraviolet (UV) cutoff. Such models are supposed to describe exclusively the
low-energy sector of QCD. The introduction of UV cutoff in the soft wall model
is shown to result in a model with qualitatively different predictions. The
ensuing model seems to be able to incorporate the constituent quark mass. It is
also demonstrated that in order to reproduce the results of the usual soft wall
model for the vector and higher spin mesons in the presence of the UV cutoff
one can consider the flat bulk space with a modified dilaton background.
