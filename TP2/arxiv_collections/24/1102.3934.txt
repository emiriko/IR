We consider decay of a quasiparticle in a nearly-one-dimensional
quasicondensate of trapped atoms, where virtual excitations of transverse modes
break down one-dimensionality and integrability, giving rise to effective
three-body elastic collisions. We calculate the matrix element for the process
that involves one incoming quasiparticle and three outgoing quasiparticles.
Scattering that involves low-frequency modes with high thermal population
results in a diffusive dynamics of a bunch of quasiparticles created in the
system.
