The spherical symmetry Black holes are considered in expanding background.
The singularity line and the marginally trapped tube surface behavior are
discussed. In particular, we address the conditions of whether a dynamical
horizon forms for these cosmological black holes. We also discuss the
cosmological constant effect on these black holes and the redshift of the light
which comes from the marginally trapped tube surface.
