The importance of neutron scattering techniques for the characterization of
samples in soft condensed matter has been demonstrated all along the present
book. The fine understanding of the physical properties is closely linked to
progress in the field of instrumentation. This chapter describes the advances
over the last decade in technical domains, such as neutron detection,
electronics and sample environment. The news software for data reduction and
analysis are also discussed before to conclude with the ILL and LLB projects
for new instruments.
