Disorder-induced effects on plasmon coupling in chains of metallic
nanoparticles are studied within a dipole model, by considering two types of
disorder: fluctuations of the particles' shapes and fluctuations of their
positions. Typical localization effects are found both in the eigenmodes and in
the transport behavior of the system, and an estimate of the localization
length is made. It is argued that chains with deliberately introduced disorder
constitute promising systems for studying localization effects of
electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies under well controllable and
manipulable conditions.
