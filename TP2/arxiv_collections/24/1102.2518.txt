Fast thermalization and a strong build up of elliptic flow of QCD matter were
investigated within the pQCD based 3+1 dimensional parton transport model BAMPS
including bremsstrahlung $2 \leftrightarrow 3$ processes. Within the same
framework quenching of gluonic jets in Au+Au collisions at RHIC can be
understood. The development of conical structure by gluonic jets is
investigated in a static box for the regimes of small and large dissipation.
Furthermore we demonstrate two different approaches to extract the shear
viscosity coefficient $\eta$ from a microscopical picture.
