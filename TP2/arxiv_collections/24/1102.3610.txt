Modeling and understanding BitTorrent (BT) dynamics is a recurrent research
topic mainly due to its high complexity and tremendous practical efficiency.
Over the years, different models have uncovered various phenomena exhibited by
the system, many of which have direct impact on its performance. In this paper
we identify and characterize a phenomenon that has not been previously
observed: homogeneous peers (with respect to their upload capacities)
experience heterogeneous download rates. The consequences of this phenomenon
have direct impact on peer and system performance, such as high variability of
download times, unfairness with respect to peer arrival order, bursty
departures and content synchronization. Detailed packet-level simulations and
prototype-based experiments on the Internet were performed to characterize this
phenomenon. We also develop a mathematical model that accurately predicts the
heterogeneous download rates of the homogeneous peers as a function of their
content. Although this phenomenon is more prevalent in unpopular swarms (very
few peers), these by far represent the most common type of swarm in BT.
