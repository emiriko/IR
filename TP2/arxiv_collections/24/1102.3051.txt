Surface waves in classical fluids experience a rich array of black/white hole
horizon effects. The dispersion relation depends on the characteristics of the
fluid (in our case, water and silicon oil) as well as on the fluid depth and
the wavelength regime. In some cases, it can be tuned to obtain a relativistic
regime plus high-frequency dispersive effects. We discuss two types of ongoing
analogue white-hole experiments: deep water waves propagating against a
counter-current in a wave channel and shallow waves on a circular hydraulic
jump.
