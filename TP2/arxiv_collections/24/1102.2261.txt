We combine in a self-consistent way the constraints from both gravitational
lensing and stellar kinematics to perform a detailed investigation of the
internal mass distribution, amount of dark matter, and dynamical structure of
the 16 early-type lens galaxies from the SLACS Survey, at z = 0.08 - 0.33, for
which both HST/ACS and NICMOS high-resolution imaging and VLT VIMOS IFU
spectroscopy are available. Based on this data set, we analyze the inner
regions of the galaxies, i.e. typically within one (3D) effective radius r_e,
under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical models
supported by two-integral stellar DFs. For all systems, the total mass density
distribution is found to be well approximated by a simple power-law: this
profile is on average slightly super-isothermal, with a logarithmic slope
<gamma'> = 2.074^{+0.043}_{-0.041} (68% CL) and an intrinsic scatter
0.144^{+0.055}_{-0.014}, and is fairly round, with an average axial ratio <q> =
0.77+/-0.04. The lower limit for the dark matter fraction (fDM) inside r_e
ranges, in individual systems, from nearly zero to almost a half, with a median
value of 12%. By including stellar masses derived from SPS models with a
Salpeter IMF, we obtain an average fDM = 31%. The fDM rises to 61% if, instead,
a Chabrier IMF is assumed. For both IMFs, the dark matter fraction increases
with the total mass of the galaxy (3-sigma correlation). Based on the intrinsic
angular momentum parameter calculated from our models, we find that the
galaxies can be divided into two dynamically distinct groups, which are shown
to correspond to the usual classes of the slow and fast rotators. Overall, the
SLACS systems are structurally and dynamically very similar to their nearby
counterparts, indicating that the inner regions of early-type galaxies have
undergone little, if any, evolution since redshift z ~ 0.35. (Abridged)
