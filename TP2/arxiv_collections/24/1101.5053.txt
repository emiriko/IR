The dynamics and internal structure of doping fronts in organic
semiconductors are investigated theoretically using an extended drift-diffusion
model for ions, electrons and holes. The model also involves the injection
barriers for electrons and holes in the partially doped regions in the form of
the Nernst equation, together with a strong dependence of the electron and hole
mobility on concentrations. Closed expressions for the front velocities and the
ion concentrations in the doped regions are obtained. The analytical theory is
employed to describe the acceleration of the p- and n-fronts towards each
other. The analytical results show very good agreement with the experimental
data. Furthermore, it is shown that the internal structure of the doping fronts
is determined by the diffusion and mobility processes. The asymptotic behavior
of the concentrations and the electric field is studied analytically inside the
doping fronts. The numerical solution for the front structure confirms the most
important predictions of the analytical theory: a sharp head of the front in
the undoped region, a smooth relaxation tail in the doped region, and a plateau
at the critical point of transition from doped to undoped regions.
