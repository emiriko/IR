In a series of papers, George Andrews and various coauthors successfully
revitalized seemingly forgotten, powerful machinery based on MacMahon's
$\Omega$ operator to systematically compute generating functions $\sum_{\la \in
P} z_1^{\la_1}...z_n^{\la_n}$ for some set $P$ of integer partitions $\la =
(\la_1,..., \la_n)$. Our goal is to geometrically prove and extend many of the
Andrews et al theorems, by realizing a given family of partitions as the set of
integer lattice points in a certain polyhedron.
