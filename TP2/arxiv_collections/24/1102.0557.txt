Top partner searches are one of the key aspects of new physics analyses at
the LHC. We correct an earlier statement that supersymmetric top searches based
on decays to semileptonic tops are not promising. Reconstructing the direction
of the boosted leptonic top quark and correlating it with the measured missing
transverse energy vector allows us to reduce the top pair background to an
easily manageable level. In addition, reconstructing the full momentum of the
leptonic top quark determines the stop mass based on an M_{T2} endpoint.
