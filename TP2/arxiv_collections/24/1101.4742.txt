A characteristic of woodwind instruments is the cutoff frequency of their
tone-hole lattice. Benade proposed a practical definition using the measurement
of the input impedance, for which at least two frequency bands appear. The
first one is a stop band, while the second one is a pass band. The value of
this frequency, which is a global quantity, depends on the whole geometry of
the instrument, but is rather independent of the fingering. This seems to
justify the consideration of a woodwind with several open holes as a periodic
lattice. However the holes on a clarinet are very irregular. The paper
investigates the question of the acoustical regularity: an acoustically regular
lattice of tone holes is defined as a lattice built with T-shaped cells of
equal eigenfrequencies. Then the paper discusses the possibility of division of
a real lattice into cells of equal eigenfrequencies. It is shown that it is not
straightforward but possible, explaining the apparent paradox of Benade's
theory. When considering the open holes from the input of the instrument to its
output, the spacings between holes are enlarged together with their radii: this
explains the relative constancy of the eigenfrequencies.
