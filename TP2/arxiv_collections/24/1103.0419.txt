We study a quantum version of the SU(2) Hopf fibration $S^7 \to S^4$ and its
associated twistor geometry. Our quantum sphere $S^7_q$ arises as the unit
sphere inside a q-deformed quaternion space $\mathbb{H}^2_q$. The resulting
four-sphere $S^4_q$ is a quantum analogue of the quaternionic projective space
$\mathbb{HP}^1$. The quantum fibration is endowed with compatible non-universal
differential calculi. By investigating the quantum symmetries of the fibration,
we obtain the geometry of the corresponding twistor space $\mathbb{CP}^3_q$ and
use it to study a system of anti-self-duality equations on $S^4_q$, for which
we find an `instanton' solution coming from the natural projection defining the
tautological bundle over $S^4_q$.
