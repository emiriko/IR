We study blue horizontal branch (BHB) and RR Lyrae stars in the Rogers et al.
(1993a) fields and compare their velocity and density distributions with other
surveys in the same part of the sky. Photometric data are given for 176
early-type stars in the northern field. We identify fourteen BHB stars and four
possible BHB stars, and determine the selection efficiency of the Century
Survey, the HK Survey, and the SDSS survey for BHB stars. We give light curves
and \gamma -radial velocities for three type-ab RR Lyrae stars in the northern
field; comparison with the nearby LONEOS Survey shows that there is likely to
be an equal number of lower-amplitude type-ab RR Lyrae stars that we do not
find. There are therefore at least twice as many BHB stars as type-ab RR Lyrae
stars in the northern field--similar to the ratio in the solar neighborhood.
The velocity distribution of the southern field shows no evidence for an
anomalous thick disk that was found by Gilmore et al. (2002); the halo velocity
peaks at a slightly prograde rotational velocity but there is also a
significant retrograde halo component in this field. The velocity distribution
in the northern field shows no evidence of Galactic rotation for |Z|>4 kpc and
a slight prograde motion for |Z|<4 kpc. The space densities of BHB stars in the
northern field agree with an extrapolation of the power-law distribution
recently derived by de Propris et al. (2010). For |Z|<4 kpc, however, we
observe an excess of BHB stars compared with this power-law. We conclude that
these BHB stars mostly belong to a spatially flattened, non-rotating inner halo
component of the Milky Way in confirmation of the Kinman et al. (2009) analysis
of Century Survey BHB stars.
