Contribution from the irradiated secondary component is detected in the light
curves of five dwarf novae observed during superoutbursts. Their superhump
light curves show that irradiation is modulated with the superhump phase. This
strengthens the new interpretation of superhumps (Smak 2009) as being due to
irradiation controlled mass transfer rate resulting in modulated dissipation of
the kinetic energy of the stream.
