We report on the performance of an analog application-specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) developed aiming for the front-end electronics of the X-ray
CCDcamera system onboard the next X-ray astronomical satellite, ASTRO-H. It has
four identical channels that simultaneously process the CCD signals.
Distinctive capability of analog-to-digital conversion enables us to construct
a CCD camera body that outputs only digital signals. As the result of the
front-end electronics test, it works properly with low input noise of =<30 uV
at the pixel rate below 100 kHz. The power consumption is sufficiently low of
about 150 mW/chip. The input signal range of 720 mV covers the effective energy
range of the typical X-ray photon counting CCD (up to 20 keV). The integrated
non-linearity is 0.2% that is similar as those of the conventional CCDs in
orbit. We also performed a radiation tolerance test against the total ionizing
dose (TID) effect and the single event effect. The irradiation test using 60Co
and proton beam showed that the ASIC has the sufficient tolerance against TID
up to 200 krad, which absolutely exceeds the expected amount of dose during the
period of operating in a low-inclination low-earth orbit. The irradiation of Fe
ions with the fluence of 5.2x10^8 Ion/cm2 resulted in no single event latchup
(SEL), although there were some possible single event upsets. The threshold
against SEL is higher than 1.68 MeV cm^2/mg, which is sufficiently high enough
that the SEL event should not be one of major causes of instrument downtime in
orbit.
