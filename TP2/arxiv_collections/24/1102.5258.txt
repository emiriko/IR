The growth of single and multilayer graphene nano-flakes on MgO and ZrO2 at
low temperatures is shown through transmission electron microscopy. The
graphene nano-flakes are ubiquitously anchored at step edges on MgO (100)
surfaces. Density functional theory investigations on MgO (100) indicate C2H2
decomposition and carbon adsorption at step-edges. Hence, both the experimental
and theoretical data highlight the importance of step sites for graphene growth
on MgO.
