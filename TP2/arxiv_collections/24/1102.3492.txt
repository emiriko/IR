The lowest-lying negative-parity state of the Lambda is investigated in
(2+1)-flavour full-QCD on the PACS-CS configurations made available through the
ILDG. We show that a variational analysis using multiple source and sink
smearings can extract a state lying lower than that obtained by using a
standard fixed smeared source and sink operator alone.
