Kinesin-5, also known as Eg5 in vertebrates is a processive motor with 4
heads, which moves on filamentous tracks called microtubules. The basic
function of Kinesin-5 is to slide apart two anti-parallel microtubules by
simultaneously walking on both the microtubules. We develop an analytical
expression for the steady-state relative velocity of this sliding in terms of
the rates of attachments and detachments of motor heads with the ATPase sites
on the microtubules. We first analyse the motion of one pair of motor heads on
one microtubule and then couple it to the motion of the other pair of motor
heads of the same motor on the second microtubule to get the relative velocity
of sliding.
