Recent theoretical results on charged particle interaction with planarly
oriented thin bent crystals are reviewed, with the emphasis on dynamics in the
continuous potential. Influence of boundary conditions on the volume-reflected
beam profile is discussed. Basic properties of coherent bremsstrahlung in a
bent crystal are highlighted.
