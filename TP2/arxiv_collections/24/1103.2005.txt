Using the precise times of mid-egress of the eclipsing polar HU Aqr, we
discovered that this polar is orbited by two or more giant planets. The two
planets detected so far have masses of at least 5.9 and 4.5\,M_{Jup}. Their
respective distances from the polar are 3.6 AU and 5.4 AU with periods of 6.54
and 11.96 years, respectively. The observed rate of period decrease derived
from the downward parabolic change in O-C curve is a factor 15 larger than the
value expected for gravitational radiation. This indicates that it may be only
a part of a long-period cyclic variation, revealing the presence of one more
planet. It is interesting to note that the two detected circumbinary planets
follow the Titus-Bode law of solar planets with n=5 and 6. We estimate that
another 10 years of observations will reveal the presence of the predicted
third planet.
