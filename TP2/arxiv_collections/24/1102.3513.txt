In the present paper, a modification of the Index-less Indexed Flash Codes
(ILIFC) for flash memory storage system is presented. Although the ILIFC
proposed by Mahdavifar et al. has excellent worst case performance, the ILIFC
can be further improved in terms of the average case performance. The proposed
scheme, referred to as the {\em layered ILIFC}, is based on the ILIFC. However,
the primary focus of the present study is the average case performance. The
main feature of the proposed scheme is the use of the layer-based index coding
to represent indices of information bits. The layer index coding promotes the
uniform use of cell levels, which leads to better average case performance.
Based on experiments, the proposed scheme achieves a larger average number of
rewritings than the original ILIFC without loss of worst case performance.
