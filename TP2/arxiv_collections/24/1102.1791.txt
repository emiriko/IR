Here, a scenario is proposed, according to which a generic self-organized
critical (SOC) system can be looked upon as a Witten-type topological field
theory (W-TFT) with spontaneously broken Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)
symmetry. One of the conditions for the SOC is the slow driving noise, which
unambiguously suggests Stratonovich interpretation of the corresponding
stochastic differential equation (SDE). This, in turn, necessitates the use of
Parisi-Sourlas-Wu stochastic quantization procedure, which straightforwardly
leads to a model with BRST-exact action, i.e., to a W-TFT. In the parameter
space of the SDE, there must exist full-dimensional regions where the
BRST-symmetry is spontaneously broken by instantons, which in the context of
SOC are essentially avalanches. In these regions, the avalanche-type SOC
dynamics is liberated from overwise a rightful dynamics-less W-TFT, and a
Goldstone mode of Fadeev-Popov ghosts exists. Goldstinos represent modulii of
instantons (avalanches) and being gapless are responsible for the critical
avalanche distribution in the low-energy, long-wavelength limit. The above
arguments are robust against moderate variations of the SDE's parameters and
the criticality is "self-tuned". The proposition of this paper suggests that
the machinery of W-TFTs may find its applications in many different areas of
modern science studying various physical realizations of SOC. It also suggests
that there may in principle exist a connection between some of SOC's and the
concept of topological quantum computing.
