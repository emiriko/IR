The correspondence between theories in anti-de Sitter space and field
theories in physical space-time leads to an analytic, semiclassical model for
strongly-coupled QCD which has scale invariance at short distances and color
confinement at large distances. These equations, for both mesons and baryons,
give a very good representation of the observed hadronic spectrum, including a
zero mass pion. Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS
fifth dimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of
hadrons in physical space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of
hadrons at the amplitude level. The meson and baryon wavefunctions derived from
light-front holography and AdS/QCD also have remarkable phenomenological
features, including predictions for the electromagnetic form factors and decay
constants. The approach can be systematically improved using light-front
Hamiltonian methods. Some novel features of QCD for baryon physics are also
discussed.
