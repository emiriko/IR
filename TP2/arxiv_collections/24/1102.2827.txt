Colloidal solutions posses a wide range of time and length scales, so that it
is unfeasible to keep track of all of them within a single simulation. As a
consequence some form of coarse-graining must be applied. In this work we use
the Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics scheme. We describe a particular
implementation of no-slip boundary conditions upon a solid surface, capable of
providing correct force s on the solid bypassing the calculation of the
velocity profile or the stre ss tensor in the fluid near the surface. As an
application we measure the friction on a spherical particle, when it is placed
in a bulk fluid and when it is confined in a slit. We show that the
implementation of the no-slip boundary conditions leads to an enhanced Ensko g
friction, which can be understood analytically. Because of the long-range
nature of hydrodynamic interactions, the Stokes friction obtained from the
simulations is sensitive of the simulation box size. We address this topic for
the slit geometry, showing that that the dependence on the system size differs
very much from what is expected in a 3D system, where periodic boundary
conditions are used in all directions.
