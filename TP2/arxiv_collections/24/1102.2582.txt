In the framework of the classical Glauber approach, the analytical
expressions for the variance of the number of wounded nucleons and binary
collisions in AA interactions at a given centrality are presented. Along with
the optical approximation term, they contain additional contact terms arising
only in the case of nucleus-nucleus collisions. The magnitude of the additional
contributions, e.g., for PbPb collisions at SPS energies, is larger than the
contribution of the optical approximation at some values of the impact
parameter. The sum of the additional contributions is in good agreement with
the results of independent Monte Carlo simulations of this process. Due to
these additional terms, the variance of the total number of participants for
peripheral PbPb collisions and the variance of the number of collisions at all
values of the impact parameter exceed several multiples of the Poisson
variances. The correlator between the numbers of participants in colliding
nuclei at fixed centrality is also analytically calculated.
