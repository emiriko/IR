Although the autoparallel curves and the geodesics coincide in the Riemannian
geometry in which only the curvature is nonzero among the nonmetricity, the
torsion and the curvature, they define different curves in the non-Riemannian
ones. We give a novel approach to autoparallel curves and geodesics for
theories of the symmetric teleparallel gravity written in the coincident gauge.
