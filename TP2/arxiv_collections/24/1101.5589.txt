We present 16-GHz observations using the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI)
of 11 clusters with 7 x 10^{37}W < L_X < 11 x 10^{37}W (h_{50}=1.0) selected
from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) and compare them to X-ray
data. We use a fast, Bayesian cluster analysis to explore the high-dimensional
parameter space of the cluster-plus-sources model and obtain robust cluster
parameter estimates in the presence of radio point sources, receiver noise and
primordial CMB anisotropy. Our analysis fits a spherical, isothermal beta-model
to our data and assumes the cluster follows the theoretical mass-temperature
relation. Large-scale cluster parameters internal to r_{500} are derived under
the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Posterior distributions for the
large-scale parameters of 8 of our clusters are given; SZ effects towards Abell
1704 and Zw0857.9+2107 were not detected and our spherical beta-profile was
found to be an inadequate fit to the decrement on our map for Abell 2409.
