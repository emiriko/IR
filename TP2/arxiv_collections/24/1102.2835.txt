In a companion paper, we introduced a notion of multi-Dirac structures, a
graded version of Dirac structures, and we discussed their relevance for
classical field theories. In the current paper we focus on the geometry of
multi-Dirac structures. After recalling the basic definitions, we introduce a
graded multiplication and a multi-Courant bracket on the space of sections of a
multi-Dirac structure, so that the space of sections has the structure of a
Gerstenhaber algebra. We then show that the graph of a k-form on a manifold
gives rise to a multi-Dirac structure and also that this multi-Dirac structure
is integrable if and only if the corresponding form is closed. Finally, we show
that the multi-Courant bracket endows a subset of the ring of differential
forms with a graded Poisson bracket, and we relate this bracket to some of the
multisymplectic brackets found in the literature.
