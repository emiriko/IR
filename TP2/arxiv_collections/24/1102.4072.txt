The probability of observing "supernova - gamma-ray burst" (GRB) pair events
and recurrent GRBs from one galaxy in a time interval of several years has been
estimated. Supernova explosions in binary systems accompanied by the formation
of a short-lived pair of compact objects can be the sources of such events. If
a short GRB is generated during the collision of a pair, then approximately
each of ~300 short GRBs with redshift z must have an optical precursor - a
supernova in the observer's time interval <2(1+z)yr. If the supernova explosion
has the pattern of a hypernova, then a successive observation of long and short
GRBs is possible. The scenario for the generation of multiple GRBs in
collapsing galactic nuclei is also discussed.
