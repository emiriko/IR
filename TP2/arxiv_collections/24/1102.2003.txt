Existing technology can parse arbitrary context-free grammars, but only a
single, static grammar per input. In order to support more powerful
syntax-extension systems, we propose reflective grammars, which can modify
their own syntax during parsing. We demonstrate and prove the correctness of an
algorithm for parsing reflective grammars. The algorithm is based on Earley's
algorithm, and we prove that it performs asymptotically no worse than Earley's
algorithm on ordinary context-free grammars.
