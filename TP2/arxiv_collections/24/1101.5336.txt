An $(s,t)$-spread in a finite vector space $V=V(n,q)$ is a collection
$\mathcal F$ of $t$-dimensional subspaces of $V$ with the property that every
$s$-dimensional subspace of $V$ is contained in exactly one member of $\mathcal
F$. It is remarkable that no $(s,t)$-spreads has been found yet, except in the
case $s=1$. In this note, the concept $\alpha$-point to a $(2,3)$-spread
$\mathcal F$ in {$V=V(7,2)$} is introduced. A classical result of Thomas,
applied to the vector space $V$, states that all points of $V$ cannot be
$\alpha$-points to a given $(2,3)$-spread $\mathcal F$ in $V$. {In this note,
we strengthened this result by proving that} every 6-dimensional subspace of
$V$ must contain at least one point that is not an $\alpha$-point to a given
$(2,3)$-spread of $V$.
