We extract to high statistical precision an excited spectrum of
single-particle isoscalar mesons using lattice QCD, including states of high
spin and, for the first time, light exotic JPC isoscalars. The use of a novel
quark field construction has enabled us to overcome the long-standing challenge
of efficiently including quark-annihilation contributions. Hidden-flavor mixing
angles are extracted and while most states are found to be close to ideally
flavor mixed, there are examples of large mixing in the pseudoscalar and axial
sectors in line with experiment. The exotic JPC isoscalar states appear at a
mass scale comparable to the exotic isovector states.
