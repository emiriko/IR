Using the latest physical modeling and constrained by the most recent data,
we develop a phenomenological parameterized model of the contributions to
intensity and polarization maps at millimeter wavelengths from external
galaxies and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects. We find such modeling to be necessary
for estimation of cosmological parameters from Planck data. For example,
ignoring the clustering of the infrared background would result in a bias in
n_s of 7 sigma. We show that the simultaneous marginalization over a full
foreground model can eliminate such biases, while increasing the statistical
uncertainty in cosmological parameters by less than 20%. The small increases in
uncertainty can be significantly reduced with the inclusion of
higher-resolution ground-based data.
  The multi-frequency analysis we employ involves modeling 46 total power
spectra and marginalization over 17 foreground parameters. We show that we can
also reduce the data to a best estimate of the CMB power spectra, and just two
principal components (with constrained amplitudes) describing residual
foreground contamination.
