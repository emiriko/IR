We investigate quantum phase transitions occurring in a system of strongly
interacting ultracold bosons in a 1D optical lattice. After discussing the
commensurate-incommensurate transition, we focus on the phases appearing at
incommensurate filling. We find a rich phase diagram, with superfluid,
supersolid and solid (kink-lattice) phases. Supersolids generally appear in
theoretical studies of systems with long-range interactions; our results break
this paradigm and show that they may also emerge in models including only
short-range (contact) interactions, provided that quantum fluctuations are
properly taken into account.
