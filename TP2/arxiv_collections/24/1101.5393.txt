We have searched for compact stellar structures within 17 tidal tails in 13
different interacting galaxies using F606W- and F814W- band images from the
Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The
sample of tidal tails includes a diverse population of optical properties,
merging galaxy mass ratios, HI content, and ages. Combining our tail sample
with Knierman et al. (2003), we find evidence of star clusters formed in situ
with Mv < -8.5 and V-I < 2.0 in 10 of 23 tidal tails; we are able to identify
cluster candidates to Mv = -6.5 in the closest tails. Three tails offer clear
examples of "beads on a string" star formation morphology in V-I color maps.
Two tails present both tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG) candidates and cluster
candidates. Statistical diagnostics indicate that clusters in tidal tails may
be drawn from the same power-law luminosity functions (with logarithmic slopes
~ -2 - -2.5) found in quiescent spiral galaxies and the interiors of
interacting systems. We find that the tail regions with the largest number of
observable clusters are relatively young (< 250 Myr old) and bright (V < 24 mag
arcsec^(-2)), probably attributed to the strong bursts of star formation in
interacting systems soon after periapse. Otherwise, we find no statistical
difference between cluster-rich and cluster-poor tails in terms of many
observable characteristics, though this analysis suffers from complex,
unresolved gas dynamics and projection effects.
