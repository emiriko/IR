We calculate the asymptotic average rate at which a generic geodesic on a
finite area hyperbolic 2-orbifold returns to a subsurface with geodesic
boundary. As a consequence we get the average time a generic geodesic spends in
such a subsurface. Related results are obtained for excursions into a collar
neighborhood of a simple closed geodesic and the associated distribution of
excursion depths.
