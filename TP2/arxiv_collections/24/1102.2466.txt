The InAs/InGaAs DWELL solar cell grown by MBE is a standard pin diode
structure with six layers of InAs QDs embedded in InGaAs quantum wells placed
within a 200-nm intrinsic GaAs region. The GaAs control wafer consists of the
same pin configuration but without the DWELL structure. The typical DWELL solar
cell exhibits higher short current density while maintaining nearly the same
open-circuit voltage for different scales, and the advantage of higher short
current density is more obvious in the smaller cells. In contrast, the smaller
size cells, which have a higher perimeter to area ratio, make edge
recombination current dominant in the GaAs control cells, and thus their open
circuit voltage and efficiency severely degrade. The open-circuit voltage and
efficiency under AM1.5G of the GaAs control cell decrease from 0.914V and 8.85%
to 0.834V and 7.41%, respectively, as the size shrinks from 5*5mm2 to 2*2mm2,
compared to the increase from 0.665V and 7.04% to 0.675V and 8.17%,
respectively, in the DWELL solar cells.
