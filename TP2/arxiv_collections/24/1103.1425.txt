Electronic transport and magnetization measurements were performed on
La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (LCMO/YBCO) bilayers
below the superconducting transition temperature in order to study the
interaction between magnetism and superconductivity. This study shows that a
substantial number of weakly pinned vortices are induced in the YBCO layer by
the large out-of-plane stray field in the domain walls. Their motion gives rise
to large dissipation peaks at the coercive field. The angular dependent
magnetoresistance (MR) data reveal the interaction between the stripe domain
structure present in the LCMO layer and the vortices and anti-vortices induced
in the YBCO layer by the out-of-plane stray field. In addition, this study
shows that a superconducting surface spin valve effect is present in these
bilayers as a result of the relative orientation between the magnetization at
the LCMO/YBCO interface and the magnetization in the interior of the LCMO layer
that can be tuned by the rotation of a small $H$. This latter finding will
facilitate the development of superconductive magnetoresistive memory devices.
These low-magnetic field MR data, furthermore, suggest that triplet
superconductivity is induced in the LCMO layer, which is consistent with recent
reports of triplet superconductivity in LCMO/YBCO/LCMO trilayers and LCMO/YBCO
bilayers.
