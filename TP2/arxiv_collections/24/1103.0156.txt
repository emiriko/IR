This paper describes a particularly didactic and transparent derivation of
basic properties of the Lorentz group. The generators for rotations and boosts
along an arbitrary direction, as well as their commutation relations, are
written as functions of the unit vectors that define the axis of rotation or
the direction of the boost (an approach that can be compared with the one that
in electrodynamics, works with the electric and magnetic fields instead of the
Maxwell stress tensor). For finite values of the angle of rotation or the
boost's velocity, collectively denoted by V, the existence of an exponential
expansion for the coordinate transformation's matrix, M (in terms of GV where G
is the generator) requires that the matrix's derivative with respect to V, be
equal to GM. This condition can only be satisfied if the transformation is
additive as it is indeed the case for rotations, but not for velocities. If it
is assumed, however, that for boosts such an expansion exists, with V = V(v), v
being the velocity, and if the above condition is imposed on the boost's matrix
then its expression in terms of hyperbolic cosh(V) and sinh(V} is recovered,
and the expression for V(= arc tanh(v)) is determined. A general Lorentz
transformation can be written as an exponential containing the sum of a
rotation and a boost, which to first order is equal to the product of a boost
with a rotation. The calculations of the second and third order terms show that
the equations for the generators used in this paper, allow to reliably infer
the expressions for the higher order generators, without having recourse to the
commutation relations. The transformationmatrices for Weyl spinors are derived
for finite values of the rotation and velocity, and field representations,
leading to the expression for the angular momentum operator, are studied.
