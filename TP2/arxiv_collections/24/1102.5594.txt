Inclusive hadro production in e^+ e^- annihilation processes is examined to
study the fragmentation process. A broken SU(3) model is used to determine the
quark and gluon fragmentation functions of octet vector mesons, \rho and K^*,
in a simple way with an SU(3) breaking parameter \lambda. These are expressed
in terms of just two light quark fragmentation functions, V(x, Q2) and
\gamma(x, Q2) and the gluon fragmentation function Dg(x, Q2). These functions
are parameterized at the low input scale of Q0^2 = 1.5 GeV2, evolved through LO
DGLAP evolution including charm and bottom flavour at appropriate thresholds,
and fitted by comparison with data at the Z-pole. The model is extended with
the introduction of a few additional parameters to include a study of
singlet--octet mixing and hence \omega and \phi fragmentation. The model gives
good fits to the available data for x >~ 0.01, where x is the scaled energy of
the hadron. The model is then applied successfully to \omega, \phi production
in pp collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC; these data form
an important base-line for the study of Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy nucleus
collisions at RHIC, and also in future at the LHC.
