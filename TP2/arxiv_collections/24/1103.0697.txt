The problem of business-IT alignment is of widespread economic concern.
  As one way of addressing the problem, this paper describes an online system
that functions as a kind of Wiki -- one that supports the collaborative writing
and running of business and scientific applications, as rules in open
vocabulary, executable English, using a browser.
  Since the rules are in English, they are indexed by Google and other search
engines. This is useful when looking for rules for a task that one has in mind.
  The design of the system integrates the semantics of data, with a semantics
of an inference method, and also with the meanings of English sentences. As
such, the system has functionality that may be useful for the Rules, Logic,
Proof and Trust requirements of the Semantic Web.
  The system accepts rules, and small numbers of facts, typed or copy-pasted
directly into a browser. One can then run the rules, again using a browser. For
larger amounts of data, the system uses information in the rules to
automatically generate and run SQL over networked databases. From a few highly
declarative rules, the system typically generates SQL that would be too
complicated to write reliably by hand. However, the system can explain its
results in step-by-step hypertexted English, at the business or scientific
level
  As befits a Wiki, shared use of the system is free.
