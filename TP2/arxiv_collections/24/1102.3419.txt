We report the controllability of a gelation surface pattern formation.
Recently, we have found and studied a novel kind of pattern formation that
occurs during a radical polymerization (gelation) process. The pattern
formation is observed in an open top boundary of quasi two dimensional
gelation. In previous studies, we have used two dimensional photo based image
processing to analyze the patterns. However, the actual pattern is a three
dimensional surface deformation. Thus we develop a three dimensional
measurement system using a line laser displacement sensor and an automatic
x-stage. Patterns measured by the system are analyzed and discussed by means of
pattern controllability. In particular, we focus on the possibility of the
pattern control using an external temperature field. As a result, we reveal
that the global structure can be controlled, whereas the characteristic length
scales (wavelength and amplitude) are not controllable.
