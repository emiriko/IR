The present study deals with locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi
type II cosmological models representing massive string. The energy-momentum
tensor for such string as formulated by Letelier (1983) is used to construct
massive string cosmological models for which we assume that the expansion
($\theta$) in the models is proportional to the shear ($\sigma$). This
condition leads to $A = B^{m}$, where A and B are the metric coefficients and m
is constant. We have derived two types of models depending on different values
of m i.e. for $m\neq \sqrt{2}$ and $m = \sqrt{2}$ respectively. For suitable
choice of constant m (i.e. for $m = 1/2$), it is observed that in early stage
of the evolution of the universe, the universe is dominated by strings in both
cases. Our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent to the recent
observations of type Is supernovae. Some physical and geometric behaviour of
the models are also discussed.
