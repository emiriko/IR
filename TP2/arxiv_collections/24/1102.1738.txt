A theoretical realization of an all-optical quantum ratchet is proposed in a
medium composed of an array of coupled waveguides. By coupling light into two
adjacent waveguides, and calculating the expectation value for the position
space operator, we demonstrate the quantum ratchet like behavior of this
optical system.
