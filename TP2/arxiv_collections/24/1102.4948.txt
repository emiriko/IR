In this paper we study Open Wilson Lines (OWL's) in the context of two
Supersymmetric Yang Mills theories. First we consider four dimensional N=2
Supersymmetric Yang Mills Theory with hypermultiplets transforming in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group, and find supersymmetric OWL's
only in the superconformal versions of these theories. We then consider four
dimensional N=4 SYM coupled to a three dimensional defect hypermultiplet. Here
there is a semi-circular supersymmetric OWL, which is related to the ray by a
conformal transformation. We perform a perturbative calculation of the
operators in both theories, and discuss using localization to compute them
non-perturbatively.
