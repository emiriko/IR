Recent work shows that a quantum spin liquid can arise in realistic fermionic
models on a honeycomb lattice. We study the quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg
honeycomb model, considering couplings J1, J2, and J3 up to third nearest
neighbors. We use an unbiased pseudofermion functional renormalization group
method to compute the magnetic susceptibility and determine the ordered and
disordered states of the model. Aside from antiferromagnetic, collinear, and
spiral order domains, we find a large paramagnetic region at intermediate J2
coupling. For larger J2 within this domain, we find a strong tendency to
staggered dimer ordering, while the remaining paramagnetic regime for low J2
shows only weak plaquet and staggered dimer response. We suggest this regime to
be a promising region to look for quantum spin liquid states when charge
fluctuations would be included.
