With the help of two new intrinsic tensor fields associated with the
$SL(2,R)$ quadratic Casimir of Killing fields, we uncover the $SL(2,R)$
symmetry satisfied by the solutions to the equations of motion for various
fields in the BTZ black hole in a uniform way by performing tensor and spinor
analysis without resorting to any specific coordinate system. Then with the
standard algebraic method developed recently, we determine the quasi-normal
modes for various fields in the BTZ black hole. As a result, the quasi-normal
modes are given by the infinite tower of descendants of the chiral highest
weight mode, which is in good agreement with the previous analytic result
obtained by exactly solving equations of motion instead.
