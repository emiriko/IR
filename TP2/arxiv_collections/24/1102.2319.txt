We present the results of an automated variability analysis of the Kepler
public data measured in the first quarter (Q1) of the mission. In total, about
150 000 light curves have been analysed to detect stellar variability, and to
identify new members of known variability classes. We also focus on the
detection of variables present in eclipsing binary systems, given the important
constraints on stellar fundamental parameters they can provide. The methodology
we use here is based on the automated variability classification pipeline which
was previously developed for and applied successfully to the CoRoT exofield
database and to the limited subset of a few thousand Kepler asteroseismology
light curves. We use a Fourier decomposition of the light curves to describe
their variability behaviour and use the resulting parameters to perform a
supervised classification. Several improvements have been made, including a
separate extractor method to detect the presence of eclipses when other
variability is present in the light curves. We also included two new
variability classes compared to previous work: variables showing signs of
rotational modulation and of activity. Statistics are given on the number of
variables and the number of good candidates per class. A comparison is made
with results obtained for the CoRoT exoplanet data. We present some special
discoveries, including variable stars in eclipsing binary systems. Many new
candidate non-radial pulsators are found, mainly Delta Sct and Gamma Dor stars.
We have studied those samples in more detail by using 2MASS colours. The full
classification results are made available as an online catalogue.
