We revisit the relation between H2O maser detection rate and nuclear
obscuration for a sample of 114 Seyfert galaxies, drawn from the CfA, 12um and
IRAS F25/F60 catalogs. These sources have mid-infrared spectra from the Spitzer
Space Telescope and they are searched for X-ray and [O III], 5007Angstrom
fluxes from the literature. We use the strength of the [O IV], 25.9um emission
line as tracer for the intrinsic AGN strength. After normalization by [O IV]
the observed X-ray flux provides information about X-ray absorption. The
distribution of X-ray / [O IV] flux ratios is significantly different for
masers and non-masers: The maser detected Seyfert-2s (Sy 1.8-2.0) populate a
distinct X-ray / [O IV] range which is, on average, about a factor four lower
than the range of Seyfert-2 non-masers and about a factor of ten lower than the
range of Seyfert-1s (Sy 1.0-1.5). Non-masers are almost equally distributed
over the entire X-ray / [O IV] range. This provides evidence that high nuclear
obscuration plays a crucial role for the probability of maser detection.
Furthermore, after normalization with [O IV], we find a similar but weaker
trend for the distribution of the maser detection rate with the absorption of
the 7um dust continuum. This suggests that the obscuration of the 7 um
continuum occurs on larger spatial scales than that of the X-rays. Hence, in
the AGN unified model, at moderate deviation from edge-on, the 7um dust
absorption may occur without proportionate X-ray absorption. The absorption of
[O III] appears unrelated to maser detections. The failure to detect masers in
obscured AGN is most likely due to insufficient observational sensitivity.
