We report on the first Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) observations of
damped and sub-damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems discovered in a new survey of
the gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies. From observations of 37 sightlines,
we have discovered three DLAs and four sub-DLAs. We measure the neutral gas
density Omega(HI), and redshift density dN/dz, of DLA and sub-DLA systems at
z<0.35. We find dN/dz=0.25 and Omega(HI)=1.4x10^-3 for DLAs, and dN/dz=0.08
with Omega(HI)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-DLAs over a redshift path delta z=11.9. To
demonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailed
analysis of the DLA at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of SDSS J1009+0713. Profile
fits to the absorption lines determine log N(H I)=20.68pm0.10 with a
metallicity determined from the undepleted element Sulfur of [S/H]=-0.62pm0.18.
The abundance pattern of this DLA is similar to that of higher z DLAs, showing
mild depletion of the refractory elements Fe and Ti with [S/Fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and
[S/Ti]=+0.28pm0.15. Nitrogen is underabundant in this system with
[N/H]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this DLA below the plateau of the [N/alpha]
measurements in the local Universe at similar metallicities. This DLA has a
simple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit the
profiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. Imaging of the QSO field with WFC3
reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the QSO and several
galaxies within 10". Followup spectra with LRIS reveal that none of the nearby
galaxies are at the redshift of the DLA. The spiral galaxy is identified as the
host galaxy of the QSO based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus and
disk of the galaxy as well as spectra of an H II region showing emission lines
at the QSO redshift. A small feature appears 0.70" from the nucleus of the QSO
after PSF subtraction, providing another candidate for the host galaxy of the
DLA. (abb)
