We present results from continued Chandra X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of a
flux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-like
extended structure. X-rays are detected from 24 of the 39 jets observed so far.
We compute the distribution of alpha_rx, the spectral index between the X-ray
and radio bands, showing that it is broad, extending at least from 0.8 to 1.2.
While there is a general trend that the radio brightest jets are detected most
often, it is clear that predicting the X-ray flux from the radio knot flux
densities is risky so a shallow X-ray survey is the most effective means for
finding jets that are X-ray bright. We test the model in which the X-rays
result from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons by relativistic electrons in the jet moving with high bulk
Lorentz factor nearly along the line of sight. Depending on how the jet
magnetic fields vary with z, the observed X-ray to radio flux ratios do not
follow the redshift dependence expected from the IC-CMB model. For a subset of
our sample with known superluminal motion based on VLBI observations, we
estimate the angle of the kpc-scale jet to the line of sight by considering the
additional information in the bends observed between pc- and kpc-scale jets.
These angles are sometimes much smaller than estimates based on the IC-CMB
model with a Lorentz factor of 15, indicating that these jets may decelerate
significantly from pc scales to kpc scales.
