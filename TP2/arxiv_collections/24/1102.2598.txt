In this work we investigate the behavior of the minimal rate needed in order
to guarantee a given probability that the distortion exceeds a prescribed
threshold, at some fixed finite quantization block length. We show that the
excess coding rate above the rate-distortion function is inversely proportional
(to the first order) to the square root of the block length. We give an
explicit expression for the proportion constant, which is given by the inverse
Q-function of the allowed excess distortion probability, times the square root
of a constant, termed the excess distortion dispersion. This result is the dual
of a corresponding channel coding result, where the dispersion above is the
dual of the channel dispersion. The work treats discrete memoryless sources, as
well as the quadratic-Gaussian case.
