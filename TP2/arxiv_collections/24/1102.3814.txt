Analytical solutions of variable coefficient nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equations having four-dimensional symmetry groups which are in fact the next
closest to the integrable ones occurring only when the Lie symmetry group is
five-dimensional are obtained using two different tools. The first tool is to
use one dimensional subgroups of the full symmetry group to generate solutions
from those of the reduced ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations), namely group
invariant solutions. The other is by truncation in their Painlev\'e expansions.
