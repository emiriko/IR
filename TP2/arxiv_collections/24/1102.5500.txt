Currently, experts from IT industry are closely monitoring the soaring total
volume of digital data. Moreover the problem is not purely technical, it
directly affects human civilization as a whole. The growth rate of the all
increasing and is already very large. Began is actively appear apocalyptic
scenarios of development IT technology, and humanity as a whole. In this paper
we propose a constructive alternative to these emotional ideas. Invited to
consider the digital industry as a complete system that is developing in close
connection with human civilization. Moreover, system self-organizing and
essentially nonlinear in its behavior. To study this system is applied
system-cybernetic approach. The mathematical model is developed, shows that in
the future rate of production of digital data is stabilize at 13.2 ZB per year.
