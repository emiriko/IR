The kinetics of chiral transitions in quark matter is studied in a two flavor
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We focus on the phase ordering dynamics subsequent to
a temperature quench from the massless quark phase to the massive quark phase.
We study the dynamics by considering a phenomenological model (Ginzburg-Landau
free-energy functional). The morphology of the ordering system is characterized
by the scaling of the order-parameter correlation function.
