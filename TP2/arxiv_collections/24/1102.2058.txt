The driving force in the pursuit for quantum computation is the exciting
possibility that quantum algorithms can be more efficient than their classical
analogues. Research on the subject has unraveled several aspects of how that
can happen. Clever quantum algorithms have been discovered in recent years,
although not systematically, and the field remains under active investigation.
This article is an introduction to the quantum database search algorithm. Its
extension to the quantum spatial search algorithm is also described.
