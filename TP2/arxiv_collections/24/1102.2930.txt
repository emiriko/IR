We show that the linearized equations of the incompressible elastic medium
admit a `Maxwell form' in which the shear component of the stress vector plays
the role of the electric field, and the vorticity plays the role of the
magnetic field. Conversely, the set of dynamic Maxwell equations are strict
mathematical corollaries from the governing equations of the incompressible
elastic medium. This suggests that the nature of `electromagnetic field' may
actually be related to an elastic continuous medium. The analogy is complete if
the medium is assumed to behave as fluid in shear motions, while it may still
behave as elastic solid under compressional motions. Then the governing
equations of the elastic fluid are re-derived in the Eulerian frame by
replacing the partial time derivatives by the properly invariant (frame
indifferent) time rates. The `Maxwell from' of the frame indifferent
formulation gives the frame indifferent system that is to replace the Maxwell
system. This new system comprises terms already present in the classical
Maxwell equations, alongside terms that are the progenitors of the
Biot--Savart, Oersted--Ampere's, and Lorentz--force laws. Thus a frame
indifferent (truly covariant) formulation of electromagnetism is achieved from
a single postulate that the electromagnetic field is a kind of elastic (partly
liquid partly solid) continuum.
