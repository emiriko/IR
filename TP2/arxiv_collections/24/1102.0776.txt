We survey geometrical and especially combinatorial aspects of generalized
Donaldson-Thomas invariants (also called BPS invariants) for toric Calabi-Yau
manifolds, emphasizing the role of plane partitions and their generalizations
in the recently proposed crystal melting model. We also comment on equivalence
with a vicious walker model and the matrix model representation of the
partition function.
