We discuss the feasibility of seeing a Higgs boson which decays to four
partons through a pair of (pseudo-)scalars at the LHC. We restrict our search
to Higgs bosons produced in association with a W/Z boson at high transverse
momentum. We argue that subjet analysis techniques are a good discriminant
between such events and W/Z plus jets and top-antitop production. For light
scalar masses (below 30 GeV), we find evidence that a flavor-independent search
for such a non-standard Higgs boson is plausible with 100 fb^-1 of data, while
a Higgs decaying to heavier scalars is only likely to be visible in models
where scalar decays to b quarks dominate.
