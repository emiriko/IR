The entanglement entropy in Kondo impurity systems is studied analytically
using conformal field theory. From the impurity contribution to the scaling
corrections of the entanglement entropy we extract information about the
screening cloud profile for general non-Fermi-liquid fixed points. By also
considering the finite-temperature corrections to scaling of the von Neumann
entropy we point out a direct connection between the large-distance screening
cloud profile and thermodynamic observables such as the specific heat.
