In the series of our earlier papers on the subject, we proposed a novel
statistical hypothesis testing method for detection of objects in noisy images.
The method uses results from percolation theory and random graph theory. We
developed algorithms that allowed to detect objects of unknown shapes in the
presence of nonparametric noise of unknown level and of unknown distribution.
No boundary shape constraints were imposed on the objects, only a weak bulk
condition for the object's interior was required. Our algorithms have linear
complexity and exponential accuracy. In the present paper, we describe an
implementation of our nonparametric hypothesis testing method. We provide a
program that can be used for statistical experiments in image processing. This
program is written in the statistical programming language R.
