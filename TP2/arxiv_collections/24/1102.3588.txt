A novel experiment for direct searches of the Dark Matter with liquid argon
double-phase chamber with a mass of liquid Ar up to several hundred tons is
proposed. To suppress the b-, g- and n0- backgrounds, the comparison of
scintillation and ionization signals for every event is suggested. The addition
in liquid Ar of photosensitive Ge(CH3)4 or C2H4 and suppression of triplet
component of scintillation signals ensures the detection of scintillation
signals with high efficiency and provides a complete suppression of the
electron background. For the detection of photoelectrons and ionization
electrons, highly stable and reliable GEM detectors must be used.
