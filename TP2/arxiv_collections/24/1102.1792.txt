We study the spontaneous formation of vortices during the superfluid
condensation in a trapped fermionic gas subjected to a rapid thermal quench via
evaporative cooling. Our work is based on the numerical solution of the time
dependent crossover Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled to the heat diffusion
equation. We quantify the evolution of condensate density and vortex length as
a function of a crossover phase parameter from BCS to BEC. The more interesting
phenomena occur somewhat nearer to the BEC regime and should be experimentally
observable; during the propagation of the cold front, the increase in
condensate density leads to the formation of supercurrents towards the center
of the condensate as well as possible condensate volume oscillations.
