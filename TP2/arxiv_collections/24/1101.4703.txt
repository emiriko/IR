We consider in this paper the possibility of embedding a quantum search
algorithm within a classical binary search framework. The result appears
promising: taking full advantage of quantum parallelism, we show that it may
actually be possible to search an unstructured list in O(lg(N)), provided we
are willing to restart the quantum search multiple times with a different
sequence of qubits and perform a series of non-unitary measurements at the end
of each.
