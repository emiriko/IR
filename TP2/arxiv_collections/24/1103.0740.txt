A detailed description of the conformational plasticity of double stranded
DNA (ds) is a necessary framework for understanding protein-DNA interactions.
Until now, however structure and kinetics of the transition from the basic
conformation of ds-DNA (B state) to the 1.7 times longer and partially unwound
conformation (S state) have not been defined. The force-extension relation of
the ds-DNA of lambda-phage is measured here with unprecedented resolution using
a dual laser optical tweezers that can impose millisecond force steps of 0.5-2
pN (25 C). This approach reveals the kinetics of the transition between
intermediate states of ds-DNA and uncovers the load-dependence of the rate
constant of the unitary reaction step. DNA overstretching transition results
essentially a two-state reaction composed of 5.85 nm steps, indicating
cooperativity of ~25 base pairs. This mechanism increases the free energy for
the unitary reaction to ~94 kBT, accounting for the stability of the basic
conformation of DNA, and explains the absence of hysteresis in the
force-extension relation at equilibrium. The novel description of the kinetics
and energetics of the B-S transition of ds-DNA improves our understanding the
biological role of the S state in the interplay between mechanics and
enzymology of the DNA-protein machinery.
