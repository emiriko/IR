We compute the matrix elements of the electromagnetic (EM) operator between
kaon and pion states, using lattice QCD with maximally twisted-mass fermions
and two flavors of dynamical quarks (Nf = 2). The EM operator is renormalized
non-perturbatively in the RI'/MOM scheme and our simulations cover pion masses
as light as 260 MeV and three values of the lattice spacing, ranging from ~
0.07 up to ~ 0.1 fm. At the physical point our preliminary result for the K ->
pion tensor form factor at zero-momentum transfer is fT[K\pi](0) =
0.42(2_stat), which differs significantly from the old quenched result
fT[K\pi](0) = 0.78(6) obtained by the SPQcdR Collaboration with pion masses
above 500 MeV. We investigate the source of this difference and conclude that
it is mainly related to the chiral extrapolation of the quenched data. For the
case of the tensor charge of the pion we obtain the preliminary value
fT[\pi\pi](0) = 0.200(14_stat), which can be compared with the result
fT[\pi\pi](0) = 0.216(34) obtained at Nf = 2 by the QCDSF Collaboration using
higher pion masses.
