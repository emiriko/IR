We argue the existence of fundamental particles in nature, neutral
Light-Particles with spin 1, and rest mass $m=1.8\cdot 10^{-4} m_e$, in
addition to electrons, neutrons and protons. We call these particles Light
Bosons because they create the electromagnetic field which represents Planck's
gas of massless photons together with a gas of Light Particles in the
condensate. In this respect, the condensed Light Particles, having no magnetic
field, represent the constant electric field. In this context, we predict a
existence of plasmon-polariton and resonance-polariton Bose-quasiparticles with
effective masses $m_l\approx 10^{-6} m_e$ and $m_r=0.5m_e$, which are induced
by interaction of the plasmon field and the resonance Fr$\ddot o$lich-
Schafroth charged bosons with electromagnetic wave in metal. Also, we prove
that the enhancement optical transmission into nanoholes in metal films and
Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy are provided by a new resonance-polariton
Bose-quasiparticles but not model of surface plasmon-polariton. In this letter,
the quantization Fresnel's equations is presented which confirms that Light
Particles in the condensate are concentrated near on the wall of grooves in
metallic grating and, in turn, represent as the constant electric field which
provides the launching of the surface Fr\"olich- Schafroth bosons on the
surface metal holes.
