Thermal fluctuations of the granular gas under the homogeneous cooling state
(HCS) are estimated using two-point kinetic theory by Tsuge-Sagara. Thermal
fluctuations of the elastic gas are modified for the granular gas by
nonequilibrium moments, which defines the distribution function under the HCS.
The deviations of thermal fluctuations for the granular gas from those for the
elastic gas obtained by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem are calculated as a
function of the restitution coefficient.
