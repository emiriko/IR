We investigate the non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic fields
and gravity through the natural logarithm of the curvature scalar. After we
give the Lagrangian formulation of the non-minimally coupled theory, we derive
field equations by a first order variational principle using the method of
Lagrange multipliers. We look at static, spherically symmetric solutions that
are asymptotically flat. We discuss the nature of horizons for some candidate
black hole solutions according to various values of the parameters $R_0 $ and
$a_1$.
