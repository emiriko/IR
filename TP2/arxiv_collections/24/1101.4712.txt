Graphene field-effect transistors are fabricated utilizing single-crystal
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), an insulating isomorph of graphene, as the gate
dielectric. The devices exhibit mobility values exceeding 10,000 cm2/V-sec and
current saturation down to 500 nm channel lengths with intrinsic
transconductance values above 400 mS/mm. The work demonstrates the favorable
properties of using h-BN as a gate dielectric for graphene FETs.
