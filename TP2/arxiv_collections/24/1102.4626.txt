We extract a sample of disc stars within 200 pc of the Sun from the RAVE and
SDSS surveys. Distances are estimated photometrically and proper motions are
from ground-based data. We show that the velocity-space substructure first
revealed in the Geneva-Copenhagen sample is also present in this completely
independent sample. We also evaluate action-angle variables for these stars and
show that the Hyades stream stars in these data are again characteristic of
having been scattered at a Lindblad resonance. Unfortunately, analysis of such
local samples can determine neither whether it is an inner or an outer Lindblad
resonance, nor the multiplicity of the pattern.
