In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of a mixture of mutually
interacting spherical molecules of different masses and sizes. From an analysis
of the microscopic laws governing the motion of the molecules we derive a set
of non-local self-consistent equations for the singlet phase-space distribution
functions. The theory is shown to reproduce the hydrodynamic equations for the
densities of each species, the total momentum and the local temperature. The
non ideal gas interaction term is separated into a contribution due to the
repulsive part, which is treated by means of the revised Enskog theory for hard
spheres, and an attractive contribution treated within the random phase
approximation. The present formulation accounts for the effects of the density
and velocity inhomogeneities both on the thermodynamic and transport properties
of the fluid. In a special limit, where one species is massive and diluted, the
theory leads to a description which is formally identical to the dynamic
density functional equation governing the time evolution of a colloidal system.
  The derivation also determines the dependence of the friction coefficient,
appearing in the dynamic density functional theory, on the microscopic
parameters of the solvent. However, the predicted value takes into account only
the collisional contributions to the friction and not the Stokes friction of
hydrodynamic origin, suggesting that velocity correlations should be
incorporated in a more complete treatment.
