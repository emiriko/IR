We report the detection of thermal emission at 4.5 and 8 micron from the
planet WASP-17b. We used Spitzer to measure the system brightness at each
wavelength during two occultations of the planet by its host star. By combining
the resulting light curves with existing transit light curves and radial
velocity measurements in a simultaneous analysis, we find the radius of
WASP-17b to be 2.0 Rjup, which is 0.2 Rjup larger than any other known planet
and 0.7 Rjup larger than predicted by the standard cooling theory of irradiated
gas giant planets. We find the retrograde orbit of WASP-17b to be slightly
eccentric, with 0.0012 < e < 0.070 (3 sigma). Such a low eccentricity suggests
that, under current models, tidal heating alone could not have bloated the
planet to its current size, so the radius of WASP-17b is currently unexplained.
From the measured planet-star flux-density ratios we infer 4.5 and 8 micron
brightness temperatures of 1881 +/- 50 K and 1580 +/- 150 K, respectively,
consistent with a low-albedo planet that efficiently redistributes heat from
its day side to its night side.
