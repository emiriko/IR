The analysis of the light curves of 48 B-type stars observed by Kepler is
presented. Among these are 15 pulsating stars, all of which show low
frequencies characteristic of SPB stars. Seven of these stars also show a few
weak, isolated high frequencies and they could be considered as SPB/beta Cep
hybrids. In all cases the frequency spectra are quite different from what is
seen from ground-based observations. We suggest that this is because most of
the low frequencies are modes of high degree which are predicted to be unstable
in models of mid-B stars. We find that there are non-pulsating stars within the
beta Cep and SPB instability strips. Apart from the pulsating stars, we can
identify stars with frequency groupings similar to what is seen in Be stars but
which are not Be stars. The origin of the groupings is not clear, but may be
related to rotation. We find periodic variations in other stars which we
attribute to proximity effects in binary systems or possibly rotational
modulation. We find no evidence for pulsating stars between the cool edge of
the SPB and the hot edge of the delta Sct instability strips. None of the stars
show the broad features which can be attributed to stochastically-excited modes
as recently proposed. Among our sample of B stars are two chemically peculiar
stars, one of which is a HgMn star showing rotational modulation in the light
curve.
