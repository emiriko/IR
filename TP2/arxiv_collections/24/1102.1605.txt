Recent experiments have demonstrated single-site resolved observation of cold
atoms in optical lattices. Thus, in the future it may be possible to take
repeated snapshots of an interacting quantum many-body system during the course
of its evolution. Here we address the impact of the resulting Quantum
(anti-)Zeno physics on the many-body dynamics. We use the time-dependent
density-matrix renormalization group to obtain the time evolution of the full
many-body wave function, which is then periodically projected in order to
simulate realizations of stroboscopic measurements. For the example of a
one-dimensional lattice of spin-polarized fermions with nearest-neighbor
interactions, we find regimes for which many-particle configurations are
stabilized and destabilized depending on the interaction strength and the time
between observations.
