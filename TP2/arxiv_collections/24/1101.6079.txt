We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) in ppbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV in events containing a charged lepton (ell),
missing transverse energy, and at least two jets, using 5.4 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.
This analysis is sensitive primarily to Higgs bosons produced through the
fusion of two gluons or two electroweak bosons, with subsequent decay
H->WW->ell+nu+q'qbar, where ell is an electron or muon. The search is also
sensitive to contributions from other production channels, such as
WH->ell+nu+bbbar In the absence of signal, we set limits at the 95% C.L. on the
cross section for H production sigma(ppbar->H+X) in these final states. For a
mass of MH=160 GeV, the limit is a factor of 3.9 larger than the cross section
in the standard model, and consistent with expectation.
