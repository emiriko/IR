In this work, it is analyzed the ability of split-ring metamaterial slabs
with zero/high permeability to reject/confine the radiofrequency magnetic field
in magnetic resonance imaging systems. Using an homogenization procedure,
split-ring slabs have been designed and fabricated to work in a 1.5T system.
Active elements consisting of pairs of crossed diodes are inserted in the
split-rings. With these elements, the permeability of the slabs can be
automatically switched between a unity value when interacting with the strong
excitation field of the transmitting body coil, and zero or high values when
interacting with the weak field produced by protons in tissue. Experiments are
shown for different configurations where these slabs can help to locally
increase the signal-to-noise-ratio.
