We investigate the formation of bow shocks around exoplanets as a result of
the interaction of the planet with the coronal material of the host star,
focusing on physical causes that can lead to temporal variations in the shock
characteristics. We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock
around its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For
WASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.
Observational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal
variations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock
and the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's
magnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding
ambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the
known eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance
from the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock
characteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between
the beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,
less than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in
eccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different
orbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.
However, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and
planet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of
the shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a
non-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of
the stellar magnetic field. Such variations do not depend on the system
eccentricity. We conclude that, for systems where a shock is detectable through
transit light curve observations, shock variations should be a common
occurrence. (Abridged)
