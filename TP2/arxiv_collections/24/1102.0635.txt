A giant Skyrmion collapses to a singular point by emitting spin waves in a
thin ferromagnetic film, when external magnetic field is increased beyond the
critical one. The remnant is a single-spin flipped (SSF) point. The SSF point
has a quantum diffusion dynamics governed by the Heisenberg model. We determine
its time evolution and show the diffusion process is a continuous-time quantum
walk. We also analyze an interference of two SSF points after two Skyrmion
bursts. Quantum walks for $S=1/2$ and 1 are exact solvable. The system presents
a new type of quantum walk for $S>1/2$, where a SSF point breaks into 2S
quantum walkers. It is interesting that we can create quantum walkers
experimentally at any points in a magnetic thin film, first by creating
Skyrmions sequentially and then by letting them collapse simultaneously.
