We prove the sharp estimate on the first nonzero eigenvalue of the
p-laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature
and possibly with convex boundary (in this case we assume Neumann b.c. on the
p-laplacian). The proof is based on a gradient comparison theorem. We will also
charachterize the equality case in the estimate.
