Peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is a key step in proteome
research. Especially de novo sequencing, the identification of a peptide from
its spectrum alone, is still a challenge even for state-of-the-art algorithmic
approaches. In this paper we present Antilope, a new fast and flexible approach
based on mathematical programming. It builds on the spectrum graph model and
works with a variety of scoring schemes. Antilope combines Lagrangian
relaxation for solving an integer linear programming formulation with an
adaptation of Yen's k shortest paths algorithm. It shows a significant
improvement in running time compared to mixed integer optimization and performs
at the same speed like other state-of-the-art tools. We also implemented a
generic probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a
dataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type.
Evaluations on benchmark data show that Antilope is competitive to the popular
state-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and
accuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of
considered ion types. Antilope will be freely available as part of the open
source proteomics library OpenMS.
