We present a quantitative study of the markets and models evolution across
the credit crunch crisis. In particular, we focus on the fixed income market
and we analyze the most relevant empirical evidences regarding the divergences
between Libor and OIS rates, the explosion of Basis Swaps spreads, and the
diffusion of collateral agreements and CSA-discounting, in terms of credit and
liquidity effects. We also review the new modern pricing approach prevailing
among practitioners, based on multiple yield curves reflecting the different
credit and liquidity risk of Libor rates with different tenors and the
overnight discounting of cash flows originated by derivative transactions under
collateral with daily margination. We report the classical and modern
no-arbitrage pricing formulas for plain vanilla interest rate derivatives, and
the multiple-curve generalization of the market standard SABR model with
stochastic volatility. We then report the results of an empirical analysis on
recent market data comparing pre- and post-credit crunch pricing methodologies
and showing the transition of the market practice from the classical to the
modern framework. In particular, we prove that the market of Interest Rate
Swaps has abandoned since March 2010 the classical Single-Curve pricing
approach, typical of the pre-credit crunch interest rate world, and has adopted
the modern Multiple-Curve CSA approach, thus incorporating credit and liquidity
effects into market prices. The same analysis is applied to European
Caps/Floors, finding that the full transition to the modern Multiple-Curve CSA
approach has retarded up to August 2010. Finally, we show the robustness of the
SABR model to calibrate the market volatility smile coherently with the new
market evidences.
