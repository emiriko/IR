Excited states in the very neutron-rich nuclei 35Mg and 33Na were populated
in the fragmentation of a 38Si projectile beam on a Be target at 83 MeV/u beam
energy. We report on the first observation of gamma-ray transitions in 35Mg,
the odd-N neighbor of 34Mg and 36Mg, which are known to be part of the "Island
of Inversion" around N = 20. The results are discussed in the framework of
large- scale shell-model calculations. For the A = 3Z nucleus 33Na, a new
gamma-ray transition was observed that is suggested to complete the gamma-ray
cascade 7/2+ --> 5/2+ --> 3/2+ gs connecting three neutron 2p-2h intruder
states that are predicted to form a close-to-ideal K = 3/2 rotational band in
the strong-coupling limit.
