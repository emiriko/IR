We examine holographic entanglement entropy with higher curvature gravity in
the bulk. We show that in general Wald's formula for horizon entropy does not
yield the correct entanglement entropy. However, for Lovelock gravity, there is
an alternate prescription which involves only the intrinsic curvature of the
bulk surface. We verify that this prescription correctly reproduces the
universal contribution to the entanglement entropy for CFT's in four and six
dimensions. We also make further comments on gravitational theories with more
general higher curvature interactions.
