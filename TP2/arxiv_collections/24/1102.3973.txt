Recent observations of the strong dominance of proton-neutron (pn) relative
to pp and nn short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei indicate on possibility
of unique new condition for asymmetric high density nuclear matter, in which
the pp and nn interactions are suppressed while the pn interactions are
enhanced due to tensor interaction. We demonstrate that for sufficiently
asymmetric case and high densities the momentum distribution of the smaller
p-component is strongly deformed with protons increasingly populating the
momentum states beyond the Fermi surface. This result is obtained by extracting
the probabilities of two-nucleon (2N) SRCs from the analysis of the
experimental data on high momentum transfer inclusive electro-nuclear
reactions. We fitted the extracted probabilities as a function of nuclear
density and asymmetry and used the fit to estimate the fractions of the
off-Fermi shell nucleons in the superdense nuclear matter relevant to neutron
stars. Our results indicate that starting at three nuclear saturation densities
the protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high
momentum tail of the momentum distribution while only 2% of the neutrons will
do so. We discuss the implications of this condition for neutron stars and
emphasize that it may be characteristic to any asymmetric two component Fermi
system with suppressed central and enhanced short-range tensor interactions
between the two components.
