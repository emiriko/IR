We investigate the thermal QCD transition with two flavors of maximally
twisted mass fermions for a set of pion masses, 300 MeV \textless $m_\pi$
\textless 500 MeV, and lattice spacings $a$ \textless 0.09 fm. We determine the
pseudo-critical temperatures and discuss their extrapolation to the chiral
limit using scaling forms for different universality classes, as well as the
scaling form for the magnetic equation of state. For all pion masses considered
we find resonable consistency with O(4) scaling plus leading corrections.
However, a true distinction between the O(4) scenario and a first order
scenario in the chiral limit requires lighter pions than are currently in use
in simulations of Wilson fermions.
