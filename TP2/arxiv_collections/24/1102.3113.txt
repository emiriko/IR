We investigate tunneling properties of collective excitations in the
ferromagnetic phase of a spin-1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In
addition to the Bogoliubov mode, this superfluid phase has two spin
excitations, namely, the gapless transverse spin wave and the quadrupolar mode
with a finite excitation gap. In the mean-field theory at T=0, we examine how
these collective modes tunnel through a barrier potential that couples to the
local density of particles. In the presence of supercurrent with a finite
momentum $q$, while the Bogoliubov mode shows the so-called anomalous tunneling
behavior (which is characterized by perfect transmission) in the low energy
limit, the transverse spin-wave transmits perfectly only when the momentum $k$
of this mode coincides with $\pm q$. At $k=\pm q$, the wave function of this
spin wave has the same form as the condensate wave function in the current
carrying state, so that the mechanism of this perfect transmission is found to
be the same as tunneling of supercurrent. Using this fact, the perfect
transmission of the spin wave is proved for a generic barrier potential. We
show that such perfect transmission does not occur in the quadrupolar mode.
Further, we consider the effects of potentials breaking U(1) and spin rotation
symmetries on the transmission properties of excitations. Our results would be
useful for understanding excitation properties of spinor BECs, as well as the
anomalous tunneling phenomenon in Bose superfluids.
