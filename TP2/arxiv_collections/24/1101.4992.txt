We examine the full counting statistics of electron transport through double
quantum dots coupled in series, with particular attention being paid to the
unique features originating from level renormalization. It is clearly
illustrated that the energy renormalization gives rise to a dynamic charge
blockade mechanism, which eventually results in super-Poissonian noise.
Coupling of the double dots to an external heat bath leads to dephasing and
relaxation mechanisms, which are demonstrated to suppress the noise in a unique
way.
