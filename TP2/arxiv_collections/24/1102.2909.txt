We describe exchange-only universal quantum computation and leakage reduction
in the 3-qubit decoherence free subsystem (DFS). We discuss the angular
momentum structure of the DFS, the proper forms for the DFS CNOT and leakage
reduction operators in the total angular momentum basis, and new exchange-only
pulse sequences for the CNOT and leakage reduction operators. Our new DFS CNOT
sequence requires 22 pulses in 13 time steps. The DFS leakage reduction
sequence, the first explicit leakage reduction sequence of its kind, requires
30 pulses in 20 time steps. Although the search for sequences was performed
numerically using a genetic algorithm, the solutions presented here are exact,
with closed-form expressions.
