We defend a natural division of the energy density, energy flux and momentum
density of electromagnetic waves in linear media in electromagnetic and
material parts. In this division, the electromagnetic part of these quantities
have the same form as in vacuum when written in terms of the macroscopic
electric and magnetic fields, the material momentum is calculated directly from
the Lorentz force that acts on the charges of the medium, the material energy
is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the charges of the medium
and the material energy flux results from the interaction of the electric field
with the magnetized medium. We present reasonable models for linear dispersive
non-absorptive dielectric and magnetic media that agree with this division. We
also argue that the electromagnetic momentum of our division can be associated
with the electromagnetic relativistic momentum, inspired on the recent work of
Barnett [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 070401 (2010)] that showed that the Abraham
momentum is associated with the kinetic momentum and the Minkowski momentum is
associated with the canonical momentum.
