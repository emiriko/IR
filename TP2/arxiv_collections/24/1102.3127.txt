The cognitive interference channel with unidirectional destination
cooperation (CIFC-UDC) is a cognitive interference channel (CIFC) where the
cognitive (secondary) destination not only decodes the information sent from
its sending dual but also helps enhance the communication of the primary user.
This channel model is an extension of the original CIFC to achieve a win-win
solution under the coexistence condition. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the CIFC-UDC comprises a broadcast channel (BC), a relay channel
(RC) and a partially cooperative relay broadcast channel (PCRBC), and can be
degraded to any one of them. Our main result is the establishment of a new
unified achieva-ble rate region for the CIFC-UDC which is the largest known to
date and can be explicitly shown to include the previous result proposed by Chu
and the largest known rate regions for the BC, the RC and the PCRBC. In
addition, an interesting viewpoint on the unidirectional destination
cooperation in the CIFC-UDC is discussed: to enable the decoder of the primary
user to perform interference mitigation can be considered as a complementary
idea to the interference mitigation via Gel'fand-Pinsker precod-ing in the CIFC
proposed by Devroye et al. Henceforth, by com-bing these two ideas, the
interferences caused at both the desti-nations can be alleviated. Lastly, an
outer bound is presented and proved to be tight for a class of the CIFC-UDC,
resulting in the characterization of the capacity region for this class.
