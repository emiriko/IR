A theoretical model is proposed to describe asymmetric gate-voltage
dependence of conductance and noise in two-terminal ballistic graphene devices.
The model is analyzed independently within the self-consistent Hartree and
Thomas-Fermi approximations. Our results justify the prominent role of metal
contacts in recent experiments with suspended graphene flakes. The
contact-induced electrostatic potentials in graphene demonstrate a power-law
decay with the exponent varying from -1 to -0.5. Within our model we explain
electron-hole asymmetry and strong Fabri-Perot oscillations of the conductance
and noise at positive doping, which were observed in many experiments with
submicrometer samples. Limitations of the Thomas-Fermi approximation in a
vicinity of the Dirac point are discussed.
