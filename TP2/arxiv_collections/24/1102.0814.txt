We examine the brightness of the Cosmic Radio Background (CRB) by comparing
the contribution from individual source counts to absolute measurements. We use
a compilation of radio counts to estimate the contribution of detected sources
to the CRB in several different frequency bands.We apply a Monte Carlo Markov
Chain technique to estimate the brightness values and uncertainties, paying
attention to various sources of systematic error. We compare our results to
absolute measurements from the ARCADE 2 experiment. At v = 150 MHz, 325 MHz,
408 MHz, 610 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 4.8 GHz, and 8.4 GHz our calculated contributions to
the background sky temperature are 18, 2.8, 1.6, 0.71, 0.11, 0.0032, 0.0059 K,
respectively. If the ARCADE 2 measurements are correct and come from sources,
then there must be an additional population of radio galaxies, fainter than
where current data are probing. More specifically, the Euclidean-normalized
counts at 1.4 GHz have to have an additional bump below about 10 {\mu}Jy.
