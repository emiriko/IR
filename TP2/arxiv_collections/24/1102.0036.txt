We define the periodic Full Kostant-Toda on every simple Lie algebra, and
show its Liouville integrability. More precisely we show that this lattice is
given by a Hamiltonian vector field, associated to a Poisson bracket which
results from an R-matrix. We construct a large family of constant of motion
which we use to prove the Liouville integrability of the system with the help
of several results on simple Lie algebras, R-matrix, invariant functions and
root systems.
