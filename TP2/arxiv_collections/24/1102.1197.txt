We ask whether the scaling exponents or the Kolmogorov constants depend on
the anisotropy of the velocity fluctuations in a turbulent flow with no shear.
According to our experiment, the answer is no for the Eulerian second-order
transverse velocity structure function. The experiment consisted of 32
loudspeaker-driven jets pointed toward the centre of a spherical chamber. We
generated anisotropy by controlling the strengths of the jets. We found that
the form of the anisotropy of the velocity fluctuations was the same as that in
the strength of the jets. We then varied the anisotropy, as measured by the
ratio of axial to radial root-mean-square (RMS) velocity fluctuations, between
0.6 and 2.3. The Reynolds number was approximately constant at around
$R_\lambda$ = 481. In a central volume with a radius of 50 mm, the turbulence
was approximately homogeneous, axisymmetric, and had no shear and no mean flow.
We observed that the scaling exponent of the structure function was $0.70 \pm
0.03$, independent of the anisotropy and regardless of the direction in which
we measured it. The Kolmogorov constant, $C_2$, was also independent of
direction and anisotropy to within the experimental error of 4%.
