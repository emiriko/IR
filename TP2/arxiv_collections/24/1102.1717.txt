Here we survey several results and conjectures on the cohomology of the total
space of the Hitchin system: the moduli space of semi-stable rank n and degree
d Higgs bundles on a complex algebraic curve C. The picture emerging is a
dynamic mixture of ideas originating in theoretical physics such as gauge
theory and mirror symmetry, Weil conjectures in arithmetic algebraic geometry,
representation theory of finite groups of Lie type and Langlands duality in
number theory.
