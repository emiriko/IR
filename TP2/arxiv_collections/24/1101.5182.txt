A theory for thermomechanical behavior of homogeneous DNA at thermal
equilibrium predicts critical temperatures for denaturation under torque and
stretch, phase diagrams for stable B--DNA, supercoiling, optimally stable
torque, and the overstretching transition as force-induced DNA melting.
Agreement with available single molecule manipulation experiments is excellent.
