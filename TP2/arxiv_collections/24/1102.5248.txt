We present a high-speed, visible-wavelength imaging instrument: MORIS (the
MIT Optical Rapid Imaging System). MORIS is mounted on the 3-m Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, HI. Its primary component is an Andor
iXon camera, a nearly 60 arcsec square field of view with high quantum
efficiency, low read noise, low dark current, and full-frame readout rates
ranging from as slow as desired to a maximum of between 3.5 Hz and 35 Hz
(depending on the mode; read noise of 6e-/pixel and 49 e-/pixel with
electron-multiplying gain=1, respectively). User-selectable binning and
subframing can increase the cadence to a few hundred Hz. An
electron-multiplying mode can be employed for photon counting, effectively
reducing the read noise to sub-electron levels at the expense of dynamic range.
Data cubes, or individual frames, can be triggered to several nanosecond
accuracy using the Global Positioning System. MORIS is mounted on the
side-facing exit window of SpeX (Rayner et al. 2003), allowing simultaneous
near-infrared and visible observations. Here we describe the components, setup,
and measured characteristics of MORIS. We also report results from the first
science observations: the 24 June 2008 stellar occultation by Pluto and an
extrasolar planetary transit by XO-2b. The Pluto occultation, of a 15.8 R
magnitude star, has signal-to-noise ratio of 35 per atmospheric scale height
and a midtime error of 0.32 s. The XO-2b transit reaches photometric precision
of 0.5 millimagnitudes in 2 minutes and has a midtime timing precision of 23
seconds.
