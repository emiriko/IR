We report on a search for anomalous production of Z boson pairs through a
massive resonance decay in data corresponding to 2.5-2.9 fb^-1 of integrated
luminosity in p pbar collisions at 1.96 TeV using the CDF II detector at the
Fermilab Tevatron. This analysis, with more data and channels where the Z
bosons decay to muons or jets, supersedes the 1.1 fb^-1 four-electron channel
result previously published by CDF. In order to maintain high efficiency for
muons, we use a new forward tracking algorithm and muon identification
requirements optimized for these high signal-to-background channels. Predicting
the dominant backgrounds in each channel entirely from sideband data samples,
we observe four-body invariant mass spectra above 300 GeV/c^2 that are
consistent with background. We set limits using the acceptance for a massive
graviton resonance that are 7-20 times stronger than the previously published
direct limits on resonant ZZ production.
