We present our second paper on the Allen Telescope Array Twenty-centimeter
Survey (ATATS), a multi-epoch, ~700 sq. deg. radio image and catalog at 1.4
GHz. The survey is designed to detect rare, bright transients as well as to
commission the ATA's wide-field survey capabilities. ATATS explores the
challenges of multi-epoch transient and variable source surveys in the domain
of dynamic range limits and changing (u,v) coverage.
  Here we present images made using data from the individual epochs, as well as
a revised image combining data from all ATATS epochs. The combined image has
RMS noise 3.96 mJy / beam, with a circular beam of 150 arcsec FWHM. The
catalog, generated using a false detection rate algorithm, contains 4984
sources, and is >90% complete to 37.9 mJy. The catalogs generated from snapshot
images of the individual epochs contain between 1170 and 2019 sources over the
564 sq. deg. area in common to all epochs. The 90% completeness limits of the
single epoch catalogs range from 98.6 to 232 mJy.
  We compare the catalog generated from the combined image to those from
individual epochs, and from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), a legacy survey at
the same frequency. We are able to place new constraints on the transient
population: fewer than 6e-4 transients / sq. deg., for transients brighter than
350 mJy with characteristic timescales of minutes to days. This strongly rules
out an astronomical origin for the ~1 Jy sources reported by Matsumura et al.
(2009), based on their stated rate of 3.1e-3 / sq. deg.
