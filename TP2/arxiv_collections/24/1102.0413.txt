Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the phase behavior of a
single linear multiblock copolymer with blocks of A- and B-type monomers under
poor solvent conditions, varying the block length $N$, number of blocks $n$,
and the solvent quality (by variation of the temperature $T$). The fraction $f$
of A-type monomers is kept constant and equal to 0.5, and always the lengths of
A and B blocks were equal ($N_{A}=N_{B}=N$), as well as the number of blocks
($n_{A}=n_{B}=n$). We identify the three following regimes where: (i) full
microphase separation between blocks of different type occurs (all blocks of
A-type monomers form a single cluster, while all blocks of B-type monomers form
another), (ii) full microphase separation is observed with a certain
probability, and (iii) full microphase separation can not take place. For very
high number of blocks $n$ and very high $N$ (not accessible to our simulations)
further investigation is needed.
