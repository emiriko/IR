In this work, angular distribution measurements for the elastic channel were
performed for the 9Be+12C reaction at the energies ELab=13.0, 14.5, 17.3, 19.0
and 21.0 MeV, near the Coulomb barrier. The data have been analyzed in the
framework of the double folding S\~ao Paulo potential. The experimental elastic
scattering angular distributions were well described by the optical potential
at forward angles for all measured energies. However, for the three highest
energies, an enhancement was observed for intermediate and backward angles.
This can be explained by the elastic transfer mechanism.
