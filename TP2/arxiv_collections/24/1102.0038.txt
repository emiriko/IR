We study the structure and internal kinematics of the "star pile" in Abell
545 - a low surface brightness structure lying in the center of the cluster.We
have obtained deep long-slit spectroscopy of the star pile using VLT/FORS2 and
Gemini/GMOS, which is analyzed in conjunction with deep multiband CFHT/MEGACAM
imaging. As presented in a previous study the star pile has a flat luminosity
profile and its color is consistent with the outer parts of elliptical
galaxies. Its velocity map is irregular, with parts being seemingly associated
with an embedded nucleus, and others which have significant velocity offsets to
the cluster systemic velocity with no clear kinematical connection to any of
the surrounding galaxies. This would make the star pile a dynamically defined
stellar intra-cluster component. The complicated pattern in velocity and
velocity dispersions casts doubts on the adequacy of using the whole star pile
as a dynamical test for the innermost dark matter profile of the cluster. This
status is fulfilled only by the nucleus and its nearest surroundings which lie
at the center of the cluster velocity distribution.
