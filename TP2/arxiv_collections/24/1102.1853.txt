Recently, several complex network approaches to time series analysis have
been developed and applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as
real-world data, e.g., geophysical or financial time series. Among these
techniques, recurrence-based concepts and prominently $\epsilon$-recurrence
networks, most faithfully represent the geometrical fine structure of the
attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestingly non-chaotic) time series.
In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graph theoretical properties
local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity can meaningfully
be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimension
in phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global
upper and lower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as
numerical results for self-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems
suggest that these measures are well-behaved in most non-pathological
situations and that they can be estimated reasonably well using
$\epsilon$-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short time series.
Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity
dimensions on the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension
or local Lyapunov dimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence
that the local clustering coefficients, or equivalently the local clustering
dimensions, are useful for identifying unstable periodic orbits and other
dynamically invariant objects from time series. Our results demonstrate that
$\epsilon$-recurrence networks exhibit an important link between dynamical
systems and graph theory.
