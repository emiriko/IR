The authors define some secondary characteristic homomorphism for the triple
(A,B,\bigtriangledown), in which B\subset A is a pair of regular Lie algebroids
over the same foliated manifold and \bigtriangledown:L\rightarrow A is a
homomorphism of Lie algebroids (i.e. a flat L-connection in A) where L is an
arbitrary (not necessarily regular) Lie algebroid and show that characteristic
classes from its image generalize known exotic characteristic classes for flat
regular Lie algebroids (Kubarski) and flat principal fibre bundles with a
reduction (Kamber, Tondeur). The generalization includes also the one given by
Crainic for representations of Lie algebroids on vector bundles. For a pair of
regular Lie algebroids B \subset A and for the special case of the flat
connection id:A\rightarrow A we obtain a characteristic homomorphism which is
universal in the sense that it is a factor of any other one for an arbitrary
flat L-connection \bigtriangledown:L\rightarrow A.
