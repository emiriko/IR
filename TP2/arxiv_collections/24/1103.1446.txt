The Born-Jordan method for constructing the quantum condition of the Matrix
Mechanics is pointed out to be inappropriate in the present work. We modify
this method and reconstruct the quantum condition by setting up a new
expression for the Bohr quantum condition with the help of the (n,n) elements
of the matrix $\oint\hat{p}(t){\rm d}\hat{x}(t)$.
