The purpose of this work is to review the observational properties of
Be/X-ray binaries. The open questions in Be/X-ray binaries include those
related to the Be star companion, that is, the so-called "Be phenomenon", such
as, timescales associated to the formation and dissipation of the equatorial
disc, mass-ejection mechanisms, V/R variability, and rotation rates; those
related to the neutron star, such as, mass determination, accretion physics,
and spin period evolution; but also, those that result from the interaction of
the two constituents, such as, disc truncation and mass transfer. Until
recently, it was thought that the Be stars' disc was not significantly affected
by the neutron star. In this review, I present the observational evidence
accumulated in recent years on the interaction between the circumstellar disc
and the compact companion. The most obvious effect is the tidal truncation of
the disc. As a result, the equatorial discs in Be/X-ray binaries are smaller
and denser than those around isolated Be stars.
