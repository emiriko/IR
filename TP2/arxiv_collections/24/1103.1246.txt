We evaluate Shannon entropy for the position and momentum eigenstates of some
conditionally exactly solvable potentials which are isospectral to harmonic
oscillator and whose solutions are given in terms of exceptional orthogonal
polynomials. The Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski (BBM) inequality has also been
tested for a number of states.
