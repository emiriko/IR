The decomposition of Fe-Cr solid solutions during thermal aging is modeled by
Atomistic Kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) simulations, using a rigid lattice
approximation with composition dependant pair interactions that can reproduce
the change of sign of the mixing energy with the alloy composition. The
interactions are fitted on ab initio mixing energies and on the experimental
phase diagram, as well as on the migration barriers in iron and chromium rich
phases. Simulated kinetics is compared with 3D atom probe and neutron
scattering experiments.
