We develop here a general formalism for multi-orbital Mott systems which can
be used to understand dynamical and static spectral weight transfer. We find
that the spectral weight transferred from the high energy scales is greatly
increased as a result of the multi-orbital structure. As a consequence
certainly dynamically generated symmetries obtain at lower values of doping
than in the single-band Hubbard model. For example, in the atomic limit, the
particle-hole symmetric condition in the lower band shifts from the one-band
result of $x=1/3$ to $x=1/(2n_o+1)$, where $n_o$ is the number of orbitals with
an unpaired spin. Transport properties computed from effective low-energy
theories which forbid double occupancy of bare electrons, such as the
multi-orbital t-J generalization, should all be be sensitive to this
particle-hole symmetric condition. Away from the atomic limit, the dynamical
contributions increase the transferred spectral weight. Consequently, any
phenomena which are sensitive to an emergent particle-hole symmetry should
obtain at $x<(1/(2n_o+1)$.
