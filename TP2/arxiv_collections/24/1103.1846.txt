Recent {\em Kepler} observations revealed an unexpected abundance of "hot"
Earth-size to Neptune-size planets in the inner $0.02-0.2$ AU from their parent
stars. We propose that these smaller planets are the remnants of massive giant
planets that migrated inward quicker than they could contract. We show that
such disruptions naturally occur in the framework of the Tidal Downsizing
hypothesis for planet formation. We find that the characteristic planet-star
separation at which such "hot disruptions" occur is $R \approx 0.03-0.2$ AU.
This result is independent of the planet's embryo mass but is dependent on the
accretion rate in the disc. At high accretion rates, $\dot M \simgt
10^{-6}\msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryo is unable to contract quickly enough and is
disrupted. At late times, when the accretion rate drops to $\dot M \simlt
10^{-8} \msun$ yr$^{-1}$, the embryos migrate sufficiently slow to not be
disrupted. These "late arrivals" may explain the well known population of hot
jupiters. If type I migration regime is inefficient, then our model predicts a
pile-up of planets at $R\sim 0.1$ AU as the migration rate suddenly switches
from the type II to type I in that region.
