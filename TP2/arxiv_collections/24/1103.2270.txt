We investigate how distinguishability of a "noise" particle degrades
interference of the "signal" particle. The signal, represented by an equatorial
state of a photonic qubit, is mixed with noise, represented by another photonic
qubit, via linear coupling on the beam splitter. We report on the degradation
of the "signal" photon interference depending on the degree of
indistinguishability between "signal" and "noise" photon. When the photons are
principally completely distinguishable but technically indistinguishable the
visibility drops to the value 1/sqrt(2). As the photons become more
indistinguishable the maximal visibility increases and reaches the unit value
for completely indistinguishable photons. We have examined this effect
experimentally using setup with fiber optics two-photon Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.
