We present the first attempt at measuring the production rate of tidal dwarf
galaxies (TDGs) and estimating their contribution to the overall dwarf
population. Using HST/ACS deep imaging data from GOODS and GEMS surveys in
conjunction with photometric redshifts from COMBO-17 survey, we performed a
morphological analysis for a sample of merging/interacting galaxies in the
Extended Chandra Deep Field South and identified tidal dwarf candidates in the
rest-frame optical bands. We estimated a production rate about 1.4 {\times}
10^{-5} per Gyr per comoving volume for long-lived TDGs with stellar mass 3
{\times} 10^{8-9} solar mass at 0.5<z<1.1. Together with galaxy merger rates
and TDG survival rate from the literature, our results suggest that only a
marginal fraction (less than 10%) of dwarf galaxies in the local universe could
be tidally-originated. TDGs in our sample are on average bluer than their host
galaxies in the optical. Stellar population modelling of optical to
near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for two TDGs favors a burst
component with age 400/200 Myr and stellar mass 40%/26% of the total,
indicating that a young stellar population newly formed in TDGs. This is
consistent with the episodic star formation histories found for nearby TDGs.
