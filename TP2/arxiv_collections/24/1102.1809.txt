We study a variant of the univariate approximate GCD problem, where the
coefficients of one polynomial f(x)are known exactly, whereas the coefficients
of the second polynomial g(x)may be perturbed. Our approach relies on the
properties of the matrix which describes the operator of multiplication by gin
the quotient ring C[x]=(f). In particular, the structure of the null space of
the multiplication matrix contains all the essential information about GCD(f;
g). Moreover, the multiplication matrix exhibits a displacement structure that
allows us to design a fast algorithm for approximate GCD computation with
quadratic complexity w.r.t. polynomial degrees.
