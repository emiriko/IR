InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) have been studied by using
cathodoluminescence hyperspectral imaging with high spatial resolution.
Variations in peak emission energies and intensities across trench-like
features and V-pits on the surface of the MQWs are investigated. The MQW
emission from the region inside trench-like features is red-shifted by
approximately 45 meV and more intense than the surrounding planar regions of
the sample, whereas emission from the V-pits is blue-shifted by about 20 meV
and relatively weaker. By employing this technique to the studied
nanostructures it is possible to investigate energy and intensity shifts on a
10 nm length scale.
