Interface specifications play an important role in component-based software
development. An interface theory is a formal framework supporting composition,
refinement and compatibility of interface specifications. We present different
interface theories which use modal I/O-transition systems as their underlying
domain for interface specifications: synchronous interface theories, which
employ a synchronous communication schema, as well as a novel interface theory
for asynchronous communication where components communicate via FIFO-buffers.
