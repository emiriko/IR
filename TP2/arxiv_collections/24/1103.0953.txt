A search for supersymmetry in the context of general gauge-mediated (GGM)
breaking with the lightest neutralino as the next-to-lightest supersymmetric
particle and the gravitino as the lightest is presented. The data sample
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns recorded by the
CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed using events containing two
or more isolated photons, at least one hadronic jet, and significant missing
transverse energy. No excess of events at high missing transverse energy is
observed. Upper limits on the signal cross section for GGM supersymmetry
between 0.3 and 1.1 pb at the 95% confidence level are determined for a range
of squark, gluino, and neutralino masses, excluding supersymmetry parameter
space that was inaccessible to previous experiments.
