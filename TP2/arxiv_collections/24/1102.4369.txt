We address an old problem in lattice gauge theory - the computation of the
spectrum and wave functions of excited states. Our method is based on the
Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory. As strategy, we propose to
construct a stochastic basis of Bargmann link states, drawn from a physical
probability density distribution. Then we compute transition amplitudes between
stochastic basis states. From a matrix of transition elements we extract energy
spectra and wave functions. We apply this method to U(1)$_{2+1}$ lattice gauge
theory. We test the method by computing the energy spectrum, wave functions and
thermodynamical functions of the electric Hamiltonian of this theory and
compare them with analytical results. We observe a reasonable scaling of
energies and wave functions in the variable of time. We also present first
results on a small lattice for the full Hamiltonian including the magnetic
term.
