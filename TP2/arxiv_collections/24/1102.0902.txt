We propose a model of continuous opinion dynamics, where mutual interactions
can be both positive and negative. Different types of distributions for the
interactions, all characterized by a single parameter $p$ denoting the fraction
of negative interactions, are considered. Results from exact calculation of a
discrete version and numerical simulations of the continuous version of the
model indicate the existence of a universal continuous phase transition at
p=p_c below which a consensus is reached. Although the order-disorder
transition is analogous to a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition with
comparable critical exponents, the model is characterized by some distinctive
features relevant to a social system.
