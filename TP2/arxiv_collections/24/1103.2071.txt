In this paper, we study multibeam satellite secure communication through
physical (PHY) layer security techniques, i.e., joint power control and
beamforming. By first assuming that the Channel State Information (CSI) is
available and the beamforming weights are fixed, a novel secure satellite
system design is investigated to minimize the transmit power with individual
secrecy rate constraints. An iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain an
optimized power allocation strategy. Moreover, sub-optimal beamforming weights
are obtained by completely eliminating the co-channel interference and nulling
the eavesdroppers' signal simultaneously. In order to obtain jointly optimized
power allocation and beamforming strategy in some practical cases, e.g., with
certain estimation errors of the CSI, we further evaluate the impact of the
eavesdropper's CSI on the secure multibeam satellite system design. The
convergence of the iterative algorithm is proven under justifiable assumptions.
The performance is evaluated by taking into account the impact of the number of
antenna elements, number of beams, individual secrecy rate requirement, and
CSI. The proposed novel secure multibeam satellite system design can achieve
optimized power allocation to ensure the minimum individual secrecy rate
requirement. The results show that the joint beamforming scheme is more
favorable than fixed beamforming scheme, especially in the cases of a larger
number of satellite antenna elements and higher secrecy rate requirement.
Finally, we compare the results under the current satellite air-interface in
DVB-S2 and the results under Gaussian inputs.
