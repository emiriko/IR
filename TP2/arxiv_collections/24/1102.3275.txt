In order to understand how electron effective mass is enhanced by anharmonic
local oscillation of an atom in a cage composed of other atoms, i.e., {\it
rattling}, we analyze anharmonic Holstein model by using a Green's function
method. Due to the evaluation of an electron mass enhancement factor $Z$, we
find that $Z$ becomes maximum when zero-point energy is comparable with
potential height at which the amplitude of oscillation is rapidly enlarged.
Cooperation of such quantum and rattling effects is considered to be a key
issue to explain the electron mass enhancement in electron-rattling systems.
