We establish the existence of weak solutions $u$ of the semilinear wave
equation $\partial_t^2 u-\textrm{div}_x(a(t,x)\nabla_xu)=f_k(u)$ where $a(t,x)$
is equal to $1$ outside a compact set with respect to $x$ and a non-linear term
$f_k$ which satisfies $\vert f_k(u)\vert\leq C\vert u\vert^k$. For some
non-trapping time-periodic perturbations $a(t,x)$, we obtain the long time
existence of solution for small initial data.
