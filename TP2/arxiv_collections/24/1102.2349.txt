We prove that under any projective embedding of an abelian variety A of
dimension g, a complete system of addition laws has cardinality at least g+1,
generalizing of a result of Bosma and Lenstra for the Weierstrass model of an
elliptic curve in P^2. In contrast with this geometric constraint, we moreover
prove that if k is any field with infinite absolute Galois group, then there
exists, for every abelian variety A/k, a projective embedding and an addition
law defined for every pair of k-rational points. For an abelian variety of
dimension 1 or 2, we show that this embedding can be the classical Weierstrass
model or embedding in P^15, respectively, up to a finite number of
counterexamples for |k| less or equal to 5.
