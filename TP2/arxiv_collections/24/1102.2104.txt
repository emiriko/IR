We describe a model of dynamic Bose-Einstein condensates near a Feshbach
resonance that is computationally feasible under assumptions of spherical or
cylindrical symmetry. Simulations in spherical symmetry approximate the
experimentally measured time to collapse of an unstably attractive condensate
only when the molecular binding energy in the model is correct, demonstrating
that the quantum fluctuations and atom-molecule pairing included in the model
are the dominant mechanisms during collapse. Simulations of condensates with
repulsive interactions find some quantitative disagreement, suggesting that
pairing and quantum fluctuations are not the only significant factors for
condensate loss or burst formation. Inclusion of three-body recombination was
found to be inconsequential in all of our simulations, though we do not
consider recent experiments [1] conducted at higher densities.
