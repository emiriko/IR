We present absolute parallaxes and proper motions for seven members of the
Hyades open cluster, pre-selected to lie in the core of the cluster. Our data
come from archival astrometric data from FGS 3, and newer data for 3 Hyads from
FGS 1R, both white-light interferometers on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
We obtain member parallaxes from six individual Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS)
fields and use the field containing van Altena 622 and van Altena 627 (= HIP
21138) as an example. Proper motions, spectral classifications and VJHK
photometry of the stars comprising the astrometric refer- ence frames provide
spectrophotometric estimates of reference star absolute parallaxes. Introducing
these into our model as observations with error, we determine absolute
parallaxes for each Hyad. The parallax of vA 627 is significantly improved by
including a perturbation orbit for this previously known spectroscopic binary,
now an astrometric binary. Compared to our original (1997) determina- tions, a
combination of new data, updated calibration, and improved analysis lowered the
individual parallax errors by an average factor of 4.5. Comparing parallaxes of
the four stars contained in the Hipparcos catalog, we obtain an average factor
of 11 times improvement with the HST . With these new results, we also have
better agreement with Hipparcos for the four stars in common. These new
parallaxes provide an average distance for these seven members, < D > = 47.5
pc, for the core a \pm 1 - {\sigma} dispersion depth of 3.6 pc, and a minimum
depth from individual components of 16.0 \pm 0.9 pc. Absolute magnitudes for
each member are compared to established main sequences, with excellent
agreement. We obtain a weighted average distance modulus for the core of the
Hyades of m-M=3.376 \pm 0.01, a value close to the previous Hipparcos values,
m-M=3.33\pm 0.02.
