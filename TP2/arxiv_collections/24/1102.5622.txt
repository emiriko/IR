Coherence dynamics of two-species Bose-Einstein condensates in double wells
is investigated in mean field approximation. We show that the system can
exhibit decoherence phenomena even without the condensate-environment coupling
and the variation tendency of the degree of coherence depends on not only the
parameters of the system but also the initial states. We also investigate the
time evolution of the degree of coherence for a Rosen-Zener form of tunneling
strength, and propose a method to get a condensate system with certain degree
of coherence through a time-dependent tunneling strength.
