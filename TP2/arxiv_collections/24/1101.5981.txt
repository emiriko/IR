We present an approach to higher point loop integrals using Chinese magic in
the virtual loop integration variable. We show, using the five point function
in the important e^+e^-\to f\bar{f}+\gamma process for ISR as a pedagogical
vehicle, that we get an expression for it directly reduced to one scalar
5-point function and 4-, 3-, and 2- point integrals, thereby avoiding the
computation of the usual three tensor 5-pt Passarino-Veltman reduction. We
argue that this offers potential for greater numerical stability.
