We investigate Meissner effect in normal metal/superconductor junctions where
the interface is spin-active. We find that orbital magnetic susceptibility of
the normal metal shows highly nontrivial behaviors. In particular, the magnetic
susceptibility depends on the temperature in an oscillatory fashion,
accompanied by its sign change. Correspondingly, magnetic field and current
density can spatially oscillate in the normal metal. The possible spontaneous
formation of the current pattern is also discussed. These results are
attributed to the generation of odd-frequency pairing due to the spin-active
interface.
