A method for a time-dependent search for flaring astrophysical sources which
can be potentially detected by large neutrino experiments is presented. The
method uses a time-clustering algorithm combined with an unbinned likelihood
procedure. By including in the likelihood function a signal term which
describes the contribution of many small clusters of signal-like events, this
method provides an effective way for looking for weak neutrino flares over
different time-scales. The method is sensitive to an overall excess of events
distributed over several flares which are not individually detectable. For
standard cases (one flare) the discovery potential of the method is about 15%
worse than a standard time-dependent point source analysis with unknown
duration of the flare. However, for flares sufficiently shorter than the total
observation period, the method is more sensitive than a time-integrated
analysis.
