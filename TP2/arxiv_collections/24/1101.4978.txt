We study the Haffnian and Haldane-Rezayi quantum Hall wave functions and
their quasihole excitations by means of their `root configurations', and point
out a close connection between these seemingly different states. For both
states, we formulate a `generalized Pauli-principle', which allows to count the
degeneracies of these states. The connection between these states might
elucidate the underlying theory describing the `irrational' Haffnian state.
