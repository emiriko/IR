We study the resonant effects produced when a Feshbach dimer crosses a
scattering continuum band of atoms in an optical lattice. We numerically obtain
the exact spectrum of two particles in a one-dimensional lattice and develop an
effective atom-dimer Hamiltonian that accurately captures resonant effects. The
lattice-induced resonances lead to the formation of bound states simultaneously
above and below the scattering continuum and significantly modify the curvature
of the dimer dispersion relation. The nature of the atom-dimer coupling depends
strongly on the parity of the dimer state leading to a novel coupling in the
case of negative parity dimers. From the exact solutions we extract the dimer
Wannier function from which we quantitatively determine the effective
Hamiltonian parameters for a many-body description.
