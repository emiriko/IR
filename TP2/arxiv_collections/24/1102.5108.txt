Recent studies demonstrated that there may appear different novel states in
correlated systems close to localized-itinerant crossover. Especially
favourable conditions for that are met in low-dimensional and in frustrated
systems. In this paper I discuss on concrete examples some of such novel
states. In particular, for some spinels and triangular systems there appears a
"partial Mott transition", in which first some finite clusters (dimers, trimes,
tetramers, heptamers) go over to the itinerant regime, and the real bulk Mott
transition occurs only later. Also some other specific possibilities in this
crossover regime are shortly discussed, such as spin-Peierls-Peierls transition
in TiOCl, spontaneous charge disproportionation in some cases, etc.
