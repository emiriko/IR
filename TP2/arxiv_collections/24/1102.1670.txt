Matter waves can be coherently and adiabatically loaded and controlled in
strongly driven optical lattices. This coherent control is used in order to
modify the modulus and the sign of the tunneling matrix element in the
tunneling Hamiltonian. Our findings pave the way for studies of driven quantum
systems and new methods for engineering Hamiltonians that are impossible to
realize with static techniques.
