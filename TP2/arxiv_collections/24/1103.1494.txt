We present results for the masses of pseudoscalar mesons in twisted mass
lattice QCD with a degenerate doublet of u and d quarks and a non-degenerate
doublet of s and c quarks in the framework of next-to-leading order chiral
perturbation theory, including lattice effects up to O(a^2). The masses depend
on the two twist angles for the light and heavy sectors. For maximal twist in
both sectors, O(a)-improvement is explicitly exhibited. The mixing of
flavour-neutral mesons is also discussed, and results in the literature for the
case of degenerate s and c quarks are corrected.
