A 2-D Riemann problem is designed to study the development and dynamics of
the slow shocks that are thought to form at the boundaries of reconnection
exhausts. Simulations are carried out for varying ratios of normal magnetic
field to the transverse upstream magnetic field (i.e., propagation angle with
respect to the upstream magnetic field). When the angle is sufficiently
oblique, the simulations reveal a large firehose-sense
(P_parallel>P_perpendicular) temperature anisotropy in the downstream region,
accompanied by a transition from a coplanar slow shock to a non-coplanar
rotational mode. In the downstream region the firehose stability parameter
epsilon=1-mu_0(P_parallel-P_perpendicular)/ B^2 tends to lock in to 0.25. This
balance arises from the competition between counterstreaming ions, which drives
epsilon down, and the scattering due to ion inertial scale waves, which are
driven unstable by the downstream rotational wave. At very oblique propagating
angles, 2-D turbulence also develops in the downstream region.
