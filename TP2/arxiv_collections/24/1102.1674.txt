For two derived equivalent $k$-algebras $\bar\Lambda$ and $\bar\Gamma$, we
introduce a correspondence between $\OO$-orders reducing to $\bar\Lambda$ and
$\OO$-orders reducing to $\bar\Gamma$. We outline how this may be used to
transfer properties like uniqueness (or non-existence) of a lift between
$\bar\Lambda$ and $\bar\Gamma$. As an application, we look at tame algebras of
dihedral type with two simple modules, where, most notably, we are able to show
that among those algebras only the algebras $\mathcal D^{\kappa,0}(2A)$ and
$\mathcal D^{\kappa,0}(2B)$ can actually occur as basic algebras of blocks of
group rings of finite groups.
