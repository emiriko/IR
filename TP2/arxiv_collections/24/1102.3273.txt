We report the observation and characterization of field emission current from
individual single- and few-layer graphene flakes laid on a flat SiO2/Si
substrate. Measurements were performed in a scanning electron microscope
chamber equipped with nanoprobes, used as electrodes to realize local
measurements of the field emission current. We achieved field emission currents
up to 1 {\mu}A from the flat part of graphene flakes at applied fields of few
hundred V/{\mu}m. We found that emission process is stable over a period of
several hours and that it is well described by a Fowler-Nordheim model for
currents over 5 orders of magnitude.
