Simultaneous measurements of tunneling currents and atomic forces on surfaces
and adsorbates provide new insights into the electronic and structural
properties of matter on the atomic scale. We report on experimental
observations and calculations of a strong impact the tunneling current can have
on the measured force, which arises when the resistivity of the sample cannot
be neglected. We present a study on Si(111)-7\times7 with various doping
levels, but this effect is expected to occur on other low-conductance samples
like adsorbed molecules, and is likely to strongly affect Kelvin probe
measurements on the atomic scale.
