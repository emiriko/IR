We study the energetic properties of finite but internally homogeneous
D-dimensional electron droplets in the strict-correlation limit. The indirect
Coulomb interaction is found to increase as a function of the electron number,
approaching the tighter forms of the Lieb-Oxford bound recently proposed by
Rasanen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 206406 (2009)]. The bound is satisfied in
three-, two-, and one-dimensional droplets, and in the latter case it is
reached exactly - regardless of the type of interaction considered. Our results
provide useful reference data for delocalized strongly correlated systems, and
they can be used in the development and testing of exchange-correlation density
functionals in the framework of density-functional theory.
