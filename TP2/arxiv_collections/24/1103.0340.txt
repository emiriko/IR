Measurements of neutrino oscillations using the disappearance of muon
neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI neutrino beam as observed by the two MINOS
detectors are reported. New analysis methods have been applied to an enlarged
data sample from an exposure of $7.25 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target. A fit
to neutrino oscillations yields values of $|\Delta m^2| =
(2.32^{+0.12}_{-0.08})\times10^{-3}$\,eV$^2$ for the atmospheric mass splitting
and $\rm \sin^2\!(2\theta) > 0.90$ (90%\,C.L.) for the mixing angle. Pure
neutrino decay and quantum decoherence hypotheses are excluded at 7 and 9
standard deviations, respectively.
