We study numerically the effects of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction on the
model of electrons in n-doped semiconductors of Matsubara and Toyozawa (MT). We
focus on the analysis of the density of states (DOS) and the inverse
participation ratio (IPR) of the spin-orbit perturbed states in the MT set of
energy eigenstates in order to characterize the eigenstates with respect to
their extended or localized nature. The finite sizes that we are able to
consider necessitate an enhancement of the spin-orbit coupling strength in
order to obtain a meaningful perturbation. The IPR and DOS are then studied as
a function of the enhancement parameter.
