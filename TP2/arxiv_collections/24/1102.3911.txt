We present new measures of the evolving scaling relations between stellar
mass, luminosity and rotational velocity for a morphologically-inclusive sample
of 129 disk-like galaxies with z_AB<22.5 in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.3, based
on spectra from DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope, multi-color HST ACS
photometry, and ground-based Ks-band imaging. A unique feature of our survey is
the extended spectroscopic integration times, leading to significant
improvements in determining characteristic rotational velocities for each
galaxy. Rotation curves are reliably traced to the radius where they begin to
flatten for ~90% of our sample, and we model the HST-resolved bulge and disk
components in order to accurately de-project our measured velocities,
accounting for seeing and dispersion. We demonstrate the merit of these
advances by recovering an intrinsic scatter on the stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation a factor of 2-3 less than in previous studies at intermediate redshift
and comparable to that of locally-determined relations. With our increased
precision, we find the relation is well-established by <z>~1, with no
significant evolution to <z>~0.3, \DeltaM_stellar ~ 0.04+/-0.07 dex. A clearer
trend of evolution is seen in the B-band Tully-Fisher relation corresponding to
a decline in luminosity of \DeltaM_B ~ 0.85+/-0.28 magnitudes at fixed velocity
over the same redshift range, reflecting the changes in star formation over
this period. As an illustration of the opportunities possible when gas masses
are available for a sample such as ours, we show how our dynamical and stellar
mass data can be used to evaluate the likely contributions of baryons and dark
matter to the assembly history of spiral galaxies.
