Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are one of the leading
candidates for Dark Matter. For understanding the nature of WIMPs and
identifying them among new particles produced at colliders (hopefully in the
near future), determinations of their mass and couplings on nucleons from
direct Dark Matter detection experiments are essential. Based on our
model-independent method for determining the WIMP mass from experimental data,
I present a way to also estimate the spin-independent (SI) WIMP-nucleon
coupling by using measured recoil energies directly. This method is independent
of the velocity distribution of halo WIMPs as well as (practically) of the as
yet unknown WIMP mass. In a background-free environment, for a WIMP mass of ~
100 GeV the SI WIMP-nucleon coupling could in principle be estimated with an
uncertainty of ~ 15% by using 2 (or 3) x 50 events from experiments.
