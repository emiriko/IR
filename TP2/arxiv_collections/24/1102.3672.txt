The original littlest Higgs model with universal fermion couplings is found
to be consistent with precision electroweak data but is strongly constrained by
Tevatron limits on the predicted centi-weak Z' boson. A possible signal
observed by CDF at 240 GeV is consistent with the predicted Z' and a region
below 150 GeV is largely unconstrained by collider data.
