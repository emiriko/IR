We present a theory for the construction of renormalized kinetic equations to
describe the dynamics of classical systems of particles in or out of
equilibrium. A closed, self-consistent set of evolution equations is derived
for the single-particle phase-space distribution function $f$, the correlation
function $C=<\delta f\delta f >$, the retarded and advanced density response
functions $\chi^{R,A}=\delta f/\delta\phi$ to an external potential $\phi$, and
the associated memory functions $\Sigma^{R,A,C}$. The basis of the theory is an
effective action functional $\Omega$ of external potentials $\phi$ that
contains all information about the dynamical properties of the system. In
particular, its functional derivatives generate successively the
single-particle phase-space density $f$ and all the correlation and density
response functions, which are coupled through an infinite hierarchy of
evolution equations. Traditional renormalization techniques are then used to
perform the closure of the hierarchy through memory functions. The latter
satisfy functional equations that can be used to devise systematic
approximations. The present formulation can be equally regarded as (i) a
generalization to dynamical problems of the density functional theory of fluids
in equilibrium and (ii) as the classical mechanical counterpart of the theory
of non-equilibrium Green's functions in quantum field theory. It unifies and
encompasses previous results for classical Hamiltonian systems with any initial
conditions. For equilibrium states, the theory reduces to the equilibrium
memory function approach. For non-equilibrium fluids, popular closures (e.g.
Landau, Boltzmann, Lenard-Balescu) are simply recovered and we discuss the
correspondence with the seminal approaches of Martin-Siggia-Rose and of
Rose.and we discuss the correspondence with the seminal approaches of
