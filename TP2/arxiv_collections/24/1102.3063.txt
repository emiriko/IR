In this paper we present a constructive method to control the bilinear
Schr\"odinger equation via two controls. The method is based on adiabatic
techniques and works if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian admits eigenvalue
intersections, and if the latter are conical (as it happens generically). We
provide sharp estimates of the relation between the error and the
controllability time.
