Low-energy structures of a hybrid system consisting of a polymer and an
attractive nanowire substrate as well as the thermodynamics of the adsorption
transition are studied by means of Monte Carlo computer simulations. Depending
on structural and energetic properties of the substrate, we find different
adsorbed polymer conformations, amongst which are spherical droplets attached
to the wire and monolayer tubes surrounding it. We identify adsorption
temperatures and the type of the transition between adsorbed and desorbed
structures depending on the substrate attraction strength.
