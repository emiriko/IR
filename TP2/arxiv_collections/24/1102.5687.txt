Recent experiments on atom loss in ultra-cold Fermi gases all show a maximum
at a magnetic field below Feshbach resonance, where the s-wave scattering
length is large (close to inter-particle distance) and positive. These
experiments have been performed over a wide range of conditions, with
temperatures and trap depths spanning over three decades. Different groups have
come up with different explanations, among them the emergence of Stoner
ferromagnetism. Here, we show that this maximum is a consequence of two major
steps. The first is the establishment of a population of shallow dimers, which
is the combined effect of dimer formation through three-body recombination, and
the dissociation of shallow dimers back to atoms through collisions. The
dissociation process will be temperature dependent, and is affected by Pauli
blocking at low temperatures. The second is the relaxation of shallow dimers
into tightly bound dimers through atom-dimer and dimer-dimer collisions.
  We have constructed a simple set of rate equations describing these
processes. Remarkably, even with only a few parameters, these equations
reproduce the loss rate observed in all recent experiments, despite their
widely different experimental conditions. Our studies show that the location of
the maximum loss rate depends crucially on experimental parameters such as trap
depth and temperature. These extrinsic characters show that this maximum is not
a reliable probe of the nature of the underlying quantum states. The physics of
our equations also explains some general trends found in current experiments.
