We simulate Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a ring employing stochastic
Gross-Pitaevskii equation and show that cooling through the critical
temperature can generate spontaneous quantized circulation around the ring of
the newborn condensate. Dispersion of the resulting winding numbers follows
scaling law predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). Density growth also
exhibits scaling behavior consistent with KZM. This paves a way towards
experimental verification of KZM scalings, and experimental determination of
critical exponents for the BEC transition.
