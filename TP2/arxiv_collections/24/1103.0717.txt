We address the problem of banking system resilience by applying
off-equilibrium statistical physics to a system of particles, representing the
economic agents, modelled according to the theoretical foundation of the
current banking regulation, the so called Merton-Vasicek model. Economic agents
are attracted to each other to exchange `economic energy', forming a network of
trades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the
economic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent
affects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible
to insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We
show that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose
exponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence
that under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be
avoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels,
while keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative
assumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to
the unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability.
