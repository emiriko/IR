We draw motivation from recent experimental studies and present a
comprehensive study of magnetothermoelectric transport in a graphene monolayer
within the linear response regime. We employ the modified Kubo formalism
developed for thermal transport in a magnetic field. Thermopower as well as
thermal conductivity as a function of the gate voltage of a graphene monolayer
in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene plane is
determined for low magnetic fields (~1 Tesla) as well as high fields (~8
Tesla). We include the effects of screened charged impurities on thermal
transport. We find good, qualitative as well as quantitative, agreement with
recent experimental work on the subject. In addition, in order to analyze the
effects of modulation, which can be induced by various means, on the thermal
transport in graphene, we evaluate the thermal transport coefficients for a
graphene monolayer subjected to a periodic electric modulation in a magnetic
field. The results are presented as a function of the magnetic field and the
gate voltage.
