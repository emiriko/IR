The study of the formation of massive stars presents complex challenges from
both theoretical and observational points of view. The initial phases of
evolution, for instance, remain almost hidden except at radio and IR
wavelengths. In this article, after stating some of the problems of massive
star formation, the role of radio observations to disclose the involved physics
is discussed. Historical observational findings are briefly outlined, and the
connection between low energy and high energy aspects of the phenomenon is
addressed. Finally, data availability in the form of some new surveys is
reported.
