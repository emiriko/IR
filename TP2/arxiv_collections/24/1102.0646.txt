We present results of a combined density functional and many-body
calculations for the electronic and magnetic properties of the defect-free
digital ferromagnetic heterostructures obtained by doping GaAs with Cr and Mn.
While local density approximation/(+U) predicts half-metallicity in these
defect-free delta-doped heterostructures, we demonstrate that local many-body
correlations captured by Dynamical Mean Field Theory induce within the minority
spin channel non-quasiparticle states just above $E_F$. As a consequence of the
existence of these many-body states the half-metallic gap is closed and the
carriers spin polarization is significantly reduced. Below the Fermi level the
minority spin highest valence states are found to localize more on the GaAs
layers being independent of the type of electronic correlations considered.
Thus, our results confirm the confinement of carriers in these delta-doped
heterostructures, having a spin-polarization that follow a different
temperature dependence than magnetization. We suggest that polarized
hot-electron photoluminescence experiments might bring evidence for the
existence of many-body states within the minority spin channel and their finite
temperature behavior.
