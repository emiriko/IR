We prove a conjecture of Mills, Robbins and Rumsey [Alternating sign matrices
and descending plane partitions, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 34 (1983), 340-359]
that, for any n, k, m and p, the number of nxn alternating sign matrices (ASMs)
for which the 1 of the first row is in column k+1 and there are exactly m -1's
and m+p inversions is equal to the number of descending plane partitions (DPPs)
for which each part is at most n and there are exactly k parts equal to n, m
special parts and p nonspecial parts. The proof involves expressing the
associated generating functions for ASMs and DPPs with fixed n as determinants
of nxn matrices, and using elementary transformations to show that these
determinants are equal. The determinants themselves are obtained by standard
methods: for ASMs this involves using the Izergin-Korepin formula for the
partition function of the six-vertex model with domain-wall boundary
conditions, together with a bijection between ASMs and configurations of this
model, and for DPPs it involves using the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot theorem,
together with a bijection between DPPs and certain sets of nonintersecting
lattice paths.
