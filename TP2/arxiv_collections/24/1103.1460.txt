The {\em drawdown} process $Y$ of a completely asymmetric L\'{e}vy process
$X$ is equal to $X$ reflected at its running supremum $\bar{X}$: $Y = \bar{X} -
X$. In this paper we explicitly express in terms of the scale function and the
L\'{e}vy measure of $X$ the law of the sextuple of the first-passage time of
$Y$ over the level $a>0$, the time $\bar{G}_{\tau_a}$ of the last supremum of
$X$ prior to $\tau_a$, the infimum $\unl X_{\tau_a}$ and supremum $\ovl
X_{\tau_a}$ of $X$ at $\tau_a$ and the undershoot $a - Y_{\tau_a-}$ and
overshoot $Y_{\tau_a}-a$ of $Y$ at $\tau_a$. As application we obtain explicit
expressions for the laws of a number of functionals of drawdowns and rallies in
a completely asymmetric exponential L\'{e}vy model.
