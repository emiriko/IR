We give another proof of a theorem of Fife - understood broadly as providing
a finite automaton that gives a complete description of all infinite binary
overlap-free words. Our proof is significantly simpler than those in the
literature. As an application we give a complete characterization of the
overlap-free words that are 2-automatic.
