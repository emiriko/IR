In this work, I propose a statistical mechanical framework, for the
evaluation of the free energy in molecular systems, by "deleting" all the
molecules in a "single" step. The approach can be considered as the statistical
mechanics equivalent of the evaluation of the potential energy in classical
mechanics by accounting for the necessary work to transfer all molecules one by
one to infinite distance. As a result, the free energy of an atomistic system,
can now be expressed, as an ensample average over a configurational function
that we shall call "configuretional free energy" and correspondent to the
contribution of each configurational microstate, to the free energy of the
system, provided that the microstates are sampled according to the equilibrium
statistics. Moreover, the proposed method is capable of evaluating, the free
energy as a function of the density, from the simulated density down to zero.
