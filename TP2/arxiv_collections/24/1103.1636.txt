We compute the von Neumann and generalized R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies
in the ground-state of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
square lattice using the modified spin-wave theory for finite lattices. The
addition of a staggered magnetic field to regularize the Goldstone modes
associated with symmetry-breaking is shown to be essential for obtaining
well-behaved values for the entanglement entropy. The von Neumann and R\'{e}nyi
entropies obey an area law with additive logarithmic corrections, and are in
good quantitative agreement with numerical results from valence bond quantum
Monte Carlo and density matrix renormalization group calculations. We also
compute the spin fluctuations and observe a multiplicative logarithmic
correction to the area law in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo
calculations.
