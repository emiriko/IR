We present a formulation of the nanoscale radiative heat transfer (RHT) using
concepts of mesoscopic physics. We introduce the analog of the Sharvin
conductance using the quantum of thermal conductance. The formalism provides a
convenient framework to analyse the physics of RHT at the nanoscale. Finally,
we propose a RHT experiment in the regime of quantized conductance.
