Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics close to equilibrium is a physically
satisfactory theory centered on the linear response formula of Green-Kubo. This
formula results from a formal first order perturbation calculation without
rigorous justification. A rigorous derivation of Fourier's law for heat
conduction from the laws of mechanics remains thus a major unsolved problem. In
this note we present a deterministic mechanical model of a heat-conducting
chain with nontrivial interactions, where kinetic energy fluctuations at the
nodes of the chain are removed. In this model the derivation of Fourier's law
can proceed rigorously.
