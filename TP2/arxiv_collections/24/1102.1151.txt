We study Poisson-noise induced switching between coexisting vibrational
states in driven nonlinear micromechanical resonators. In contrast to Gaussian
noise induced switching, the measured logarithm of the switching rate is
proportional not to the reciprocal noise intensity, but to its logarithm, for
fixed pulse area. We also find that the switching rate logarithm varies as a
square root of the distance to the bifurcation point, instead of the
conventional scaling with exponent 3/2.
