Fermi has shown GRBs to be a source of >10 GeV photons. We present an
estimate of the detection rate of GRBs with a next generation Cherenkov
telescope. Our predictions are based on the observed properties of GRBs
detected by Fermi, combined with the spectral properties and redshift
determinations for the bursts population by instruments operating at lower
energies. While detection of VHE emission from GRBs has eluded ground-based
instruments thus far, our results suggest that ground-based detection may be
within reach of the proposed Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), albeit with a low
rate, 0.25 - 0.5/yr. Such a detection would help constrain the emission
mechanism of gamma-ray emission from GRBs. Photons at these energies from
distant GRBs are affected by the UV-optical background light, and a
ground-based detection could also provide a valuable probe of the Extragalactic
Background Light (EBL) in place at high redshift.
