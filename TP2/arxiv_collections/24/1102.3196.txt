A multiple quantum well (MQW) transistor vertical-cavity surface-emitting
laser (T-VCSEL) is designed and numerically modeled. The important physical
models and parameters are discussed and validated by modeling a conventional
VCSEL and comparing the results with the experiment. The quantum capture/escape
process is simulated using the quantum-trap model and shows a significant
effect on the electrical output of the T-VCSEL. The parameters extracted from
the numerical simulation are imported into the analytic modeling to predict the
frequency response and simulate the large-signal modulation up to 40 Gbps.
