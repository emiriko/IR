We present the first upper limit on gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds at an
unexplored frequency of 0.2 Hz using a torsion-bar antenna (TOBA). A TOBA was
proposed to search for low-frequency GWs. We have developed a small-scaled TOBA
and successfully found {\Omega}gw(f) < 4.3 \times 1017 at 0.2 Hz as
demonstration of the TOBA's capabilities, where {\Omega}gw (f) is the GW energy
density per logarithmic frequency interval in units of the closure density. Our
result is the first nonintegrated limit to bridge the gap between the LIGO band
(around 100 Hz) and the Cassini band (10-6 - 10-4 Hz).
