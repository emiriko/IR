We prove that if $\phi: {\Bbb R}^d \times {\Bbb R}^d \to {\Bbb R}$, $d \ge
2$, is a homogeneous function, smooth away from the origin and having non-zero
Monge-Ampere determinant away from the origin, then $$ R^{-d} # \{(n,m) \in
{\Bbb Z}^d \times {\Bbb Z}^d: |n|, |m| \leq CR; R \leq \phi(n,m) \leq R+\delta
\} \lesssim \max \{R^{d-2+\frac{2}{d+1}}, R^{d-1} \delta \}.$$
  This is a variable coefficient version of a result proved by Lettington in
\cite{L10}, extending a previous result by Andrews in \cite{A63}, showing that
if $B \subset {\Bbb R}^d$, $d \ge 2$, is a symmetric convex body with a
sufficiently smooth boundary and non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, then $$ #
\{k \in {\mathbb Z}^d: dist(k, R \partial B) \leq \delta \} \lesssim \max
\{R^{d-2+\frac{2}{d+1}}, R^{d-1} \delta \}. (*)$$
  Furthermore, we shall see that the same argument yields a non-isotropic
analog of $(*)$, one for which the exponent on the right hand side is, in
general, sharp, even in the infinitely smooth case. This sheds some light on
the nature of the exponents and their connection with the conjecture due to
Wolfgang Schmidt on the distribution of lattice points on dilates of smooth
convex surfaces in ${\Bbb R}^d$.
