We fabricate nanoscale lamps which have a filament consisting of a single
multiwalled carbon nanotube. After determining the nanotube geometry with a
transmission electron microscope, we use Joule heating to bring the filament to
incandescence, with peak temperatures in excess of 2000 K. We image the thermal
light in both polarizations simultaneously as a function of wavelength and
input electrical power. The observed degree of polarization is typically of the
order of 75%, a magnitude predicted by a Mie model of the filament that assigns
graphene's optical conductance $\pi e^2/2 h$ to each nanotube wall.
