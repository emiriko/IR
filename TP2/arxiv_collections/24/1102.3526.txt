We consider rate R = k/n causal linear codes that map a sequence of
k-dimensional binary vectors {b_t} to a sequence of n-dimensional binary
vectors {c_t}, such that each c_t is a function of {b_1,b_2,...,b_t}. Such a
code is called anytime reliable, for a particular binary-input memoryless
channel, if at each time, probability of making an error about a source bit
that was sent d time instants ago decays exponentially in d. Anytime reliable
codes are useful in interactive communication problems and, in particular, can
be used to stabilize unstable plants across noisy channels. Schulman proved the
existence of such codes which, due to their structure, he called tree codes;
however, to date, no explicit constructions and tractable decoding algorithms
have been devised. In this paper, we show the existence of anytime reliable
"linear" codes with "high probability", i.e., suitably chosen random linear
causal codes are anytime reliable with high probability. The key is to consider
time-invariant codes (i.e., ones with Toeplitz generator and parity check
matrices) which obviates the need to union bound over all times. For the binary
erasure channel we give a simple ML decoding algorithm whose average complexity
is constant per time iteration and for which the probability that complexity at
a given time t exceeds KC^3 decays exponentially in C. We show the efficacy of
the method by simulating the stabilization of an unstable plant across a BEC,
and remark on the tradeoffs between the utilization of the communication
resources and the control performance.
