A dynamical symmetry breaking model of electroweak interactions is
investigated based on strongly interacting fermions. Vector-like fermions of
different representations of the weak SU(2) form a symmetry breaking condensate
and generate the lepton and quark masses. The weak gauge bosons get their usual
standard model masses from a gauge invariant effective Lagrangian of a doublet
scalar field composed of the new fermion fields. Gap equations are derived and
the conditions for finding a symmetry breaking solution are presented. The
parameters of the model are constrained further by perturbative unitarity. The
oblique electroweak corrections only slightly constrain the model. It is shown
that the new charged fermions are produced at the next linear colliders in
large number and the cross section for the LHC is presented.
