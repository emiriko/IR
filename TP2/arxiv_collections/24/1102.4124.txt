In this paper, we take dust matter and investigate static spherically
symmetric solution of the field equations in metric f(R) gravity. The solution
is found with constant Ricci scalar curvature and its energy distribution is
evaluated by using Landau-Lifshitz energy-momentum complex. We also discuss the
stability condition and constant scalar curvature condition for some specific
popular choices of f(R) models in addition to their energy distribution.
