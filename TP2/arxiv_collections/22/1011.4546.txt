By systematically applying ten well-known and inequivalent two-part relations
between hypergeometric sums 3F2(...|1) to the published database of all such
sums, 62 new sums are obtained. The existing literature is summarized, and many
purportedly novel results extracted from that literature are shown to be
special cases of these new sums. The general problem of finding elements
contiguous to Watson's, Dixon's and Whipple's theorems is reduced to a simple
algorithm suitable for machine computation. Several errors in the literature
are corrected or noted. The present paper both summarizes and extends a
previous work on this subject.
