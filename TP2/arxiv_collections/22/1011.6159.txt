Recent BABAR results on two-photon processes are presented. A high statistics
study of the two-photon production of the charmonium states eta_c and eta_c(2S)
is performed. The mass and width of eta_c and eta_c(2S) are measured; the ratio
of the decay probabilities to KS K+pi- and K+K-pi+pi-pi0 are determined. The
latter mode is studied for the first time. The reactions e+e- --> e+e- gamma*
gamma* --> e+e- + pseudoscalar meson are studied in the single-tag mode for
pi0, eta, eta', and eta_c. From the measured differential cross sections the
Q^2 dependencies of the photon-meson transition form factors are extracted.
From these measurements we conclude that the pion distribution amplitude
strongly differs from the distribution amplitudes of eta and eta' mesons.
