We present the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), a 1.1 mm continuum
survey at 33" effective resolution of 170 square degrees of the Galactic Plane
visible from the northern hemisphere. The survey is contiguous over the range
-10.5 < l < 90.5, |b| < 0.5 and encompasses 133 square degrees, including some
extended regions |b| < 1.5. In addition to the contiguous region, four targeted
regions in the outer Galaxy were observed: IC1396, a region towards the Perseus
Arm, W3/4/5, and Gem OB1. The BGPS has detected approximately 8400 clumps over
the entire area to a limiting non-uniform 1-sigma noise level in the range 11
to 53 mJy/beam in the inner Galaxy. The BGPS source catalog is presented in a
companion paper (Rosolowsky et al. 2010). This paper details the survey
observations and data reduction methods for the images. We discuss in detail
the determination of astrometric and flux density calibration uncertainties and
compare our results to the literature. Data processing algorithms that separate
astronomical signals from time-variable atmospheric fluctuations in the data
time-stream are presented. These algorithms reproduce the structure of the
astronomical sky over a limited range of angular scales and produce artifacts
in the vicinity of bright sources. Based on simulations, we find that extended
emission on scales larger than about 5.9' is nearly completely attenuated (>
90%) and the linear scale at which the attenuation reaches 50% is 3.8'.
Comparison with other millimeter-wave data sets implies a possible systematic
offset in flux calibration, for which no cause has been discovered. This
presentation serves as a companion and guide to the public data release through
NASA's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) Infrared Science Archive
(IRSA). New data releases will be provided through IPAC IRSA with any future
improvements in the reduction.
