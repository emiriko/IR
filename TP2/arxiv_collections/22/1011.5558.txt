Single Co atoms, which exhibit a Kondo effect on Cu(111), are contacted with
Cu and Fe tips in a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. With Fe
tips, the Kondo effect persists with the Abrikosov-Suhl resonance significantly
broadened. In contrast, for Cu-covered W tips, the resonance width remains
almost constant throughout the tunneling and contact ranges. The distinct
changes of the line width are interpreted in terms of modifications of the Co d
state occupation owing to hybridization with the tip apex atoms.
