In the algorithm presented here, the ME+PS approach to merge samples of
tree-level matrix elements into inclusive event samples is combined with the
POWHEG method, which includes exact next-to-leading order matrix elements in
the parton shower. The advantages of the method are discussed and the quality
of its implementation in Sherpa is exemplified by results for e+e- annihilation
into hadrons at LEP, for deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering at HERA, for
Drell-Yan lepton-pair production at the Tevatron and for W+W- production at LHC
energies.
