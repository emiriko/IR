We propose a scheme for realizing a two-qubit controlled phase gate via an
unconventional geometric phase with two nonresonant quantum dots trapped in a
photonic crystal cavity. In this system, the quantum dots simultaneously
interact with a large detuned cavity mode and strong driving classical light
fields. During the gate operation, the quantum dots undergo no transitions,
while the cavity mode is displaced along a closed path in the phase space. In
this way, the system can acquire geometric phases conditional upon the states
of the quantum dots. After implementing single-qubit operations, a two-qubit
controlled phase gate can be constructed.
