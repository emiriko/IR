In the paper by B\'arta et al. (arXive:astro-ph:/1011.4035, 2010) the authors
addressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of
high-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of
energy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet
(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are
formed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence
processes. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly
fragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective
energy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether
this mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation
by deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The
results of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a
specific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded
in the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of
energetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission
regions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of
diffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and
dynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the
results of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of
ribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled
bright kernels. Comparing the predicted emission and its properties with the
observed ones we obtain a good agreement of the two.
