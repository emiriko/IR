Miniaturised sensors and networking are technical proven concepts. Both the
technologies are proven and various components e.g., sensors, controls, etc.
are commercially available. Technology scene in above areas presents enormous
possibilities for developing innovative applications for real life situations.
Mining operations in many countries have lot of scope for improving
environmental and safety measures. Efforts have been made to develop a system
to efficiently monitor a particular environment by deploying a wireless sensor
network using commercially available components. Wireless Sensor Network has
been integrated with telecom network through a gateway using a suitable
topology which can be selected at the application layer. The developed system
demonstrates a way to connect wireless sensor network to external network which
enables the distant administrator to access real time data and act expediently
from long-distance to improve the environmental situation or prevent a
disaster. Potentially, it can be used to avoid the awful situations leading to
terrible environment in underground mines. Keywords: Wireless sensor network,
