In this paper we discuss a class of normal forms of the completely resonant
non--linear Schr\"odinger equation on a torus. We stress the geometric and
combinatorial constructions arising from this study. Further analytic
considerations and applications to quasi--periodic solutions will appear in a
forthcoming article. This paper replaces a previous version correcting some
mistakes.
