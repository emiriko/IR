A comprehensive understanding of the solar magnetic cycle requires detailed
modeling of the solar interior including the maintenance and variation of large
scale flows (differential rotation and meridional flow), the solar dynamo and
the flux emergence process connecting the magnetic field in the solar
convection zone with magnetic field in the photosphere and above. Due to the
vast range of time and length scales encountered, a single model of the entire
convection zone is still out of reach. However, a variety of aspects can be
modeled through a combined approach of 3D MHD models and simplified
descriptions. We will briefly review our current theoretical understanding of
these processes based on numerical models of the solar interior.
