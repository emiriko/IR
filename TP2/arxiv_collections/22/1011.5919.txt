For the standard Quantum Brownian Motion (QBM) model, we point out the
occurrence of simultaneous (parallel), mutually irreducible and autonomous
decoherence processes. Besides the standard, one Brownian particle, we show
there is at least another one system undergoing the dynamics described by the
QBM effect. We do this by selecting the two mutually irreducible, global
structures (decompositions into subsystems) of the composite system of the QBM
model. A generalization of this observation is a new, challenging task in the
foundations of the decoherence theory. We do not place our findings in any
interpretational context.
