We have studied the shock-excited molecular regions associated with four
supernova remnants (SNRs) - IC443C, W28, W44 and 3C391 - and two Herbig-Haro
objects, HH7 and HH54, using Spitzer's Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). The
physical conditions within the observed areas are inferred from spectroscopic
data obtained from IRS and from SWS and LWS onboard ISO, together with
photometric data from Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). Adopting a
power-law distribution for the gas temperature in the observed region, the H2
S(0) to S(7) spectral line maps obtained with IRS were used to constrain the
gas density, yielding estimated n(H2) in the range 2-4*10^3 cm^-3. The
excitation of H2 S(9) to S(12) and high-J CO pure rotational lines, however,
require environments several times denser. The inconsistency among the best-fit
densities estimated from different species can be explained by density
fluctuations within the observed regions. The best-fit power-law index b is
smaller than the value 3.8 predicted for a paraboloidal C-type bow shock,
suggesting that the shock front has a "flatter" shape than that of a
paraboloid. The best-fit parameters for SNRs and Herbig-Haro objects do not
differ significantly between the two classes of sources, except that for the
SNRs the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of hot gas (T> 1000 K) is close to the LTE
value 3, while for HH7 and HH54 even the hottest gas exhibits an OPR smaller
than 3. Finally, we mapped the physical parameters within the regions observed
with IRS and found that the mid-lying H2 emissions - S(3) to S(5) - tend to
trace the hot component of the gas, while the intensities of S(6) and S(7) are
more sensitive to the density of the gas compared to S(3) to S(5).
