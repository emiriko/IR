The Planetary and Lunar ephemerides INPOP10a version has several improvements
in the fitting process, the data sets used in the fit and in the general
features of the solution. No big change was brought in the dynamics. As a
consequence of these changes, the extrapolation capabilities of INPOP10a are
improved compared to INPOP08, especially for the Earth, Mars, Mercury and
Saturn orbits. As for INPOP08, INPOP10a provides to the user, positions,
velocities of the planets and the moon and TT-TDB chebychev polynomials at
