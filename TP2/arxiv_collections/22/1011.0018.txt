The vibrational properties of graphene fluoride and graphane are studied
using ab initio calculations. We find that both sp3 bonded derivatives of
graphene have different phonon dispersion relations and phonon density of
states as expected from the different masses associated with the attached atoms
fluorine and hydrogen, respectively. These differences manifest themselves in
the predicted temperature behavior of the constant-volume specific heat of both
compounds.
