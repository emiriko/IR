The Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism provides a simple and insightful way for
investigating many phenomena in mesoscopic physics. By this approach we derive
general formulas for the energy properties and apply them to the basic setups.
Of particular interest are the noise properties. We show that energy current
fluctuations can be induced by zero-point fluctuations and we discuss the
implications of this result.
