We study scenarios where a finite set of non-demolition von-Neumann
measurements are available. We note that, in some situations, repeated
application of such measurements allows estimating an infinite number of
parameters of the initial quantum state, and illustrate the point with a
physical example. We then move on to study how the system under observation is
perturbed after several rounds of projective measurements. While in the finite
dimensional case the effect of this perturbation always saturates, there are
some instances of infinite dimensional systems where such a perturbation is
accumulative, and the act of retrieving information about the system increases
its energy indefinitely (i.e., we have `Heat Vision'). We analyze this effect
and discuss a specific physical system with two dichotomic von-Neumann
measurements where Heat Vision is expected to show.
