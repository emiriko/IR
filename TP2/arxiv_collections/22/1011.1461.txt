We present results of models of the physical space and parameters of the
accretion disk of Sagittarius A*, as well as simulations of its emergent
spectrum. This begins with HARM, a 2D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic
(GRMHD) model, specifically set up to evolve the space around a black hole.
Data from HARM are then fed into a 2D Monte-Carlo (MC) code which generates and
tracks emitted photons, allowing for absorption and scattering before they
escape the volume.
