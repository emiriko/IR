Steady-state turbulence is generated in a tank of water and the trajectories
of particles forming a compressible system on the surface are tracked in time.
The initial uniformly distributed floating particles coagulate and form a
fractal distribution, a rare manifestation of a fractal object observable in
real-space. The surface pattern reaches a steady state in approximately 1 s.
Measurements are made of the fractal dimensions $D_q(t)$ ($q=1$ to $6$) of the
floating particles starting with the uniform distribution $D_q(0)$ = 2 for
Taylor Microscale Reynolds number $Re_{\lambda} \simeq 160$. Focus is on the
the time-evolution of the correlation dimension $D_2(t)$ as the steady state is
approached. This steady state is reached in several large eddy turnover times
and does so at an exponential rate.
