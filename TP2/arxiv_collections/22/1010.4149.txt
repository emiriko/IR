Superhydrophobic surfaces play an important role in the development of new
product coatings such as cars, but also in mechanical engineering, especially
design of turbines and compressors. Thus a vital part of the design of these
surfaces is the computational simulation of such with a special interest on
variation of shape and size of minor pits grooved into plane surfaces. In the
present work, the dependence of the contact angle on the fluid-wall dispersive
energy is determined by molecular simulation and static as well as dynamic
properties of unpolar fluids in contact with extremely rough surfaces are
obtained.
