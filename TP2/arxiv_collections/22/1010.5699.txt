We prove that the linear matroid that defines generic rigidity of
$d$-dimensional body-rod-bar frameworks (i.e., structures consisting of
disjoint bodies and rods mutually linked by bars) can be obtained from the
union of ${d+1 \choose 2}$ graphic matroids by applying variants of Dilworth
truncation $n_r$ times, where $n_r$ denotes the number of rods. This leads to
an alternative proof of Tay's combinatorial characterizations of generic
rigidity of rod-bar frameworks and that of identified body-hinge frameworks.
