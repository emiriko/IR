Local helioseismology provides unique information about the subsurface
structure and dynamics of sunspots and active regions. However, because of
complexity of sunspot regions local helioseismology diagnostics require careful
analysis of systematic uncertainties and physical interpretation of the
inversion results. We present new results of comparison of the ring-diagram
analysis and time-distance helioseismology for active region NOAA 9787, for
which a previous comparison showed significant differences in the subsurface
sound-speed structure, and discuss systematic uncertainties of the measurements
and inversions. Our results show that both the ring-diagram and time-distance
techniques give qualitatively similar results, revealing a characteristic
two-layer seismic sound-speed structure consistent with the results for other
active regions. However, a quantitative comparison of the inversion results is
not straightforward. It must take into account differences in the sensitivity,
spatial resolution and the averaging kernels. In particular, because of the
acoustic power suppression, the contribution of the sunspot seismic structure
to the ring-diagram signal can be substantially reduced. We show that taking
into account this effect reduces the difference in the depth of transition
between the negative and positive sound-speed variations inferred by these
methods. Further detailed analysis of the sensitivity, resolution and averaging
properties of the local helioseismology methods is necessary for consolidation
of the inversion results. It seems to be important that both methods indicate
that the seismic structure of sunspots is rather deep and extends to at least
20 Mm below the surface, putting constraints on theoretical models of sunspots.
