In order to group the functional requirements for support to operations by
modern information systems systematically, the NATO Code of best Practise
(COBP) for C2 Assessment defines three domain areas: Battlespace Visualization,
Decision Making, and Battle Management Functions. In addition, within an domain
overlapping information grid of the information system, necessary functions for
assessing and disseminating the information are capsulated. For all three
domains, including the overlapping information grid, the respective
requirements for functional support have to be met be future command, control,
communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems.
  The paper describes the functional categories of the three domains having
been defined for article 5 operations, extends them to meet the requirements
for operations other than war (OOTW), and gives some examples how modules of
simulation systems can deliver respective support functions. In addition,
references defining migration procedures for legacy systems to enable a smooth
change from the old to the new C3I paradigm are given.
