We give a supergravity treatment of the set of bosonic and fermionic
T-dualities in the AdS_4 x CP^3 background. We consider T-dualities along three
flat AdS_4 directions, three complexified isometries of CP^3, and six fermionic
T-dualities. Concentrating on the transformation of the dilaton, we give
description of the singularity that arises in the transformation.
