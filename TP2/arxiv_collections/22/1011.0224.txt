We investigate the presence of spatial localization in nuclei using a method
that maps the nucleon same-spin pair probability and is based on the
density-matrix. The method is used to study spatial localization of light
nuclei within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We show that the method provides
an alternative tool for studying spatial localization in comparison to the
localization observed from maxima in the nuclear mass density.
