Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main paradigms,
namely the core accretion model and the gravitational instability model. These
two formation scenarios support the hypothesis that the giant planet
metallicities should be higher or equal to that of the parent star. Meanwhile,
spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen
abundances range from depleted to enriched with respect to the star. Here,
using a model describing the formation sequence and composition of
planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, we determine the range of volatile
abundances in the envelope of HD189733b that is consistent with the 20--80
Earth-masses of heavy elements estimated to be present in the planet's
envelope. We then compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those
retrieved from spectroscopy and we find a range of supersolar values that
directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some cases, we find
that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar elemental abundances and
the {mass of heavy elements predicted in HD189733b by internal structure
models} can be explained by the presence of large amounts of carbon molecules
in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers
of the envelope, as suggested by recent photochemical models. A diagnostic test
that would confirm the presence of these compounds in the envelope is the
detection of acetylene.
