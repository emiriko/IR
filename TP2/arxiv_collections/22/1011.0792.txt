Spam messages muddle up users inbox, consume network resources, and build up
DDoS attacks, spread malware. Our goal is to present a definite figure about
the characteristics of spam and spam vulnerable email accounts. These
evaluations help us to enhance the existing technology to combat spam
effectively. We collected 400 thousand spam mails from a spam trap set up in a
corporate mail server for a period of 14 months form January 2006 to February
2007. Spammers use common techniques to spam end users regardless of corporate
server and public mail server. So we believe that our spam collection is a
sample of world wide spam traffic. Studying the characteristics of this sample
helps us to better understand the features of spam and spam vulnerable e-mail
accounts. We believe that this analysis is highly useful to develop more
efficient anti spam techniques. In our analysis we classified spam based on
attachment and contents. According to our study the four years old heavy users
email accounts attract more spam than four years oldlight users mail accounts.
The 14 months old relatively new email accounts don't receive spam. In some
special cases like DDoS attacks, the new email accounts receive spam. During
DDoS attack 14 months old heavy users email accounts have attracted more number
of spam than 14 months old light users mail accounts.
