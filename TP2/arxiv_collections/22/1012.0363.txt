We characterize conjugate nonparametric Bayesian models as projective limits
of conjugate, finite-dimensional Bayesian models. In particular, we identify a
large class of nonparametric models representable as infinite-dimensional
analogues of exponential family distributions and their canonical conjugate
priors. This class contains most models studied in the literature, including
Dirichlet processes and Gaussian process regression models. To derive these
results, we introduce a representation of infinite-dimensional Bayesian models
by projective limits of regular conditional probabilities. We show under which
conditions the nonparametric model itself, its sufficient statistics, and -- if
they exist -- conjugate updates of the posterior are projective limits of their
respective finite-dimensional counterparts. We illustrate our results both by
application to existing nonparametric models and by construction of a model on
infinite permutations.
