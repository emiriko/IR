We list here the contents of the Proceedings of the "Wide Field X-ray
Telescope" conference held in Bologna, Italy on 25-26 Nov 2009. The conference
highlighted the scientific potential and discovery space provided by an X-ray
mission concept characterized by a wide field-of-view (1 sq.deg.), large
effective area (1 sq.mt.) and approximately constant PSF (~5 arcsec HEW) across
the whole FOV. The index is in html form with clickable links to the individual
contributions.
