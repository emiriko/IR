We investigate the dynamics of a quantum oscillator, whose evolution is
monitored by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped in a symmetric double
well potential. It is demonstrated that the oscillator may experience various
degrees of decoherence depending on the variable being measured and the state
in which the BEC is prepared. These range from a `coherent' regime in which
only the variances of the oscillator position and momentum are affected by
measurement, to a slow (power law) or rapid (Gaussian) decoherence of the mean
values themselves.
