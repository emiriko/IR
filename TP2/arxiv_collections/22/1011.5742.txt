The spin dynamics of a quasi one dimensional $S=1$ bond alternating spin-gap
antiferromagnet Ni(C$_9$H$_{24}$N$_4$)NO$_2$(ClO$_4$) (abbreviated as NTENP) is
studied by means of electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. Five modes of ESR
transitions are observed and identified: transitions between singlet ground
state and excited triplet states, three modes of transitions between spin
sublevels of collective triplet states and antiferromagnetic resonance
absorption in the field-induced antiferromagnetically ordered phase.
Singlet-triplet and intra-triplet modes demonstrate a doublet structure which
is due to two maxima in the density of magnon states in the low-frequency
range. A joint analysis of the observed spectra and other experimental results
allows to test the applicability of the fermionic and bosonic models. We
conclude that the fermionic approach is more appropriate for the particular
case of NTENP.
