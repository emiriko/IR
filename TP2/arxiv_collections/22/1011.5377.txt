We consider a type of stochastic nonlinear beam equation driven by L\'{e}vy
noise. By using a suitable Lyapunov function and applying the Khasminskii test
we show the nonexplosion of the mild solutions. In addition, under some
additional assumptions we prove the exponential stability of the solutions.
