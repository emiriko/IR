We show that the Kulikov surfaces form a connected component of the moduli
space of surfaces of general type with p_g=0 and K^2=6. We also give a new
description for the surfaces, extending ideas of Inoue. Finally we calculate
the bicanonical degree of a Kulikov surface, and prove that they verify the
Bloch conjecture.
