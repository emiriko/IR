We consider the problem of quantifying the Pareto optimal boundary in the
achievable rate region over multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference
channels, where the problem boils down to solving a sequence of convex
feasibility problems after certain transformations. The feasibility problem is
solved by two new distributed optimal beamforming algorithms, where the first
one is to parallelize the computation based on the method of alternating
projections, and the second one is to localize the computation based on the
method of cyclic projections. Convergence proofs are established for both
algorithms.
