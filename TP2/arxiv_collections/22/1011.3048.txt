We measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z < 0.5)
far-IR selected galaxies in the SDP field of the Herschel-ATLAS (H-ATLAS)
survey and optically selected galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)
redshift survey. In order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrict
the analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 H-ATLAS galaxies, which have
reliable optical counterparts with r<19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopic
redshifts. The overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; the
matched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. The cross-correlation of GAMA
and H-ATLAS galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, with
correlation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 Mpc. Comparing with the corresponding
auto-correlation function of GAMA galaxies within the SDP field yields a
relative bias (averaged over 2-8 Mpc) of H-ATLAS and GAMA galaxies of b_H/b_G ~
0.6. Combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, this
indicates that most of the low redshift H-ATLAS sources are hosted by halos
with masses comparable to that of the Milky Way. The correlation function
appears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, L_250, with bright (median
luminosity \nu L_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 L_sun) objects being somewhat more strongly
clustered than faint (\nu L_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 L_sun) objects. This implies that
galaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by more
massive halos.
