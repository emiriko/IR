The results of a recent fluid theory for the multipole modes of a Yukawa
plasma in a spherical confinement [H. K\"{a}hlert and M. Bonitz, Phys. Rev. E
\textbf{82}, 036407 (2010)] are compared with molecular dynamics simulations
and the exact $N$-particle eigenmodes in the crystalline phase. Simulations
confirm the existence of high order modes found in cold fluid theory. We
investigate the influence of screening, coupling and friction on the mode
spectra in detail. Good agreement between theory and simulation is found for
weak to moderate screening and low order modes. The relations between the
breathing mode in the fluid theory, simulation and the crystal eigenmode are
investigated in further detail.
