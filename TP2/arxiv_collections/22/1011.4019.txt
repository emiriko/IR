We develop an integrated system of holographic optical trapping and
multimodal nonlinear microscopy and perform simultaneous three-dimensional
optical manipulation and non-invasive structural imaging of composite
soft-matter systems. We combine different nonlinear microscopy techniques such
as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, multi-photon excitation fluorescence
and multi-harmonic generation, and use them for visualization of long-range
molecular order in soft materials by means of their polarized excitation and
detection. The combined system enables us to accomplish both, manipulation in
composite soft materials such as colloidal inclusions in liquid crystals as
well as imaging of each separate constituents of the composite material in
different nonlinear optical modalities. We also demonstrate optical generation
and control of topological defects and simultaneous reconstruction of their
three-dimensional long-range molecular orientational patterns from the
nonlinear optical images.
