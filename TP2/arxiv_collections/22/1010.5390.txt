The generic acceleration model for ultra high energy cosmic rays, which has
been introduced in {\tt 1006.5708 [astro-ph.HE]}, suggests various types of
electromagnetic interactions between cosmic charged particles and the different
types of the plasma fields, which are assumed to have general configurations,
spatially and temporally. The well-known Fermi acceleration mechanisms are also
included in the model. Meanwhile Fermi mechanisms in non-relativistic limit
adhere first- and second-order of $\beta$, the ratio of particle's velocity
relative to the velocity of the stellar magnetic cloud, in the plasma field
sector, $\beta$ does not play any role, i.e. zero-order. In the relativistic
limit, the orders of Fermi acceleration are only possible, when applying the
corresponding conditions, either elastic scatterings or shock waves.
Furthermore, it is found that the coefficients of $\beta$ are functions of the
initial and final velocities and the characteristic Larmor radius.
