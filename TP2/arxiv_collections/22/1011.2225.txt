We explore the existence of time reparametrization symmetry in p-spin models.
Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional, we analytically probe the
long-time dynamics. We perform a renormalization group analysis where we
systematically integrate over short timescale fluctuations. We find three
families of stable fixed points and study the symmetry of those fixed points
with respect to time reparametrizations. One of those families is composed
entirely of symmetric fixed points, which are associated with the low
temperature dynamics. The other two families are composed entirely of
non-symmetric fixed points. One of these two non-symmetric families corresponds
to the high temperature dynamics.
  Time reparametrization symmetry is a continuous symmetry that is
spontaneously broken in the glass state and we argue that this gives rise to
the presence of Goldstone modes. We expect the Goldstone modes to determine the
properties of fluctuations in the glass state, in particular predicting the
presence of dynamical heterogeneity.
