I analyze a fourth generation lepton sector in which the lightest particle is
a stable Majorana neutrino. In this scenario fourth generation neutrinos have
both a Dirac and Majorana mass, resulting in two Majorana neutrino mass
eigenstates. A reanalysis of LEP's lower mass bound is performed on stable
Majorana neutrinos from the Z width and the lower mass bound is loosened. I
also extrapolate LEP's SUSY squark search with a 2 jet plus missing missing
energy final state to the production and decay of a pair of heavy Majorana
neutrinos; here it is expected that significant regions of the neutrino mass
plane may be ruled out. Finally, a search strategy is proposed for heavy fourth
generation neutrino pairs at LHC in the four lepton plus missing energy
channel. Exclusions are set in the neutrino mass plane for 30 inverse fb of
data at LHC for 13 TeV.
