An interpretation of the ridge phenomenon found in pp collisions at 7 TeV is
given in terms of enhancement of soft partons due to energy loss of semihard
jets. A description of ridge formation in nuclear collisions can directly be
extended to pp collisions, since hydrodynamics is not used, and azimuthal
anisotropy is generated by semihard scattering. Both the p_T and multiplicity
dependencies are well reproduced. Some suggestions are made about other
observables.
