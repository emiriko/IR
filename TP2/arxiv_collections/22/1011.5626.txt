We show that finite-temperature deconfinement and chiral transitions can
split in a strong enough magnetic field. The splitting in critical temperatures
of these transitions in a constant magnetic field of a typical LHC magnitude is
of the order of 10 MeV. A new deconfined phase with broken chiral symmetry
appears.
