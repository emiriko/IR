We report remarkable similarities in the output signal of two distinct
out-of- equilibrium physical systems - earthquakes and the intermittent
acoustic noise emitted by crum- pled plastic sheets - Biaxially Oriented
Polypropylene (BOPP) films. We show that both signals share several statistical
properties including the distribution of energy, distribution of energy in-
crements for distinct time scales, distribution of return intervals and
correlations in the magnitude and sign of energy increments. This analogy is
consistent with the concept of universality in com- plex systems and could
provide some insight on the mechanisms behind the complex behavior of
earthquakes.
