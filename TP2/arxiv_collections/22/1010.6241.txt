The effect of conductivity switching of wideband polymers -plasticized PVC
films under the influence of mono axial pressure is experimentally
investigated. For various plasticizers the value of monoaxial pressure, causing
jumps of conductivity on four and more orders, changes from units to hundreds
bars, and the effect remains at a thickness of films of an order of hundreds
micron, that is on two orders more than critical thickness for others wideband
polymers. In addition to the reasons stated earlier on the interpretation of
anomalies of plastic compounds conductivity, the phenomenological
electron-molecular model of dynamic traps is considered, in which local
transfer of charges is carried out by mobile segments of the plasticized
polymer molecules.
