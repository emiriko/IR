A function $\mathfrak{F}$ with simple and nice algebraic properties is
defined on a subset of the space of complex sequences. Some special functions
are expressible in terms of $\mathfrak{F}$, first of all the Bessel functions
of first kind. A compact formula in terms of the function $\mathfrak{F}$ is
given for the determinant of a Jacobi matrix. Further we focus on the
particular class of Jacobi matrices of odd dimension whose parallels to the
diagonal are constant and whose diagonal depends linearly on the index. A
formula is derived for the characteristic function. Yet another formula is
presented in which the characteristic function is expressed in terms of the
function $\mathfrak{F}$ in a simple and compact manner. A special basis is
constructed in which the Jacobi matrix becomes a sum of a diagonal matrix and a
rank-one matrix operator. A vector-valued function on the complex plain is
constructed having the property that its values on spectral points of the
Jacobi matrix are equal to corresponding eigenvectors.
