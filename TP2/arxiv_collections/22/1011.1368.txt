This paper addresses the question of automatic data extraction from the
Wiktionary, which is a multilingual and multifunctional dictionary. Wiktionary
is a collaborative project working on the same principles as the Wikipedia. The
Wiktionary entry is a plain text from the text processing point of view.
Wiktionary guidelines prescribe the entry layout and rules, which should be
followed by editors of the dictionary. The presence of the structure of a
Wiktionary article and formatting rules allows transforming the Wiktionary
entry structure into tables and relations in a relational database schema,
which is a part of a machine-readable dictionary (MRD). The paper describes how
the flat text of the Wiktionary entry was extracted, converted, and stored in
the specially designed relational database. The MRD contains the definitions,
semantic relations, and translations extracted from the English and Russian
Wiktionaries. The parser software is released under the open source license
agreement (GPL), to facilitate its dissemination, modification and upgrades, to
draw researchers and programmers into parsing other Wiktionaries, not only
Russian and English.
