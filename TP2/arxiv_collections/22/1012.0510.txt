In this paper we calculate the contribution to the ponderomotive force in a
plasma from the electron spin using a recently developed model. The spin-fluid
model used in the present paper contains spin-velocity correlations, in
contrast to previous models used for the same purpose. Is its then found that
previous terms for the spin-ponderomotive force are recovered, but also that
additional terms appear. Furthermore, the results due to the spin-velocity
correlations are confirmed using the spin-kinetic theory. The significance of
our results is discussed.
