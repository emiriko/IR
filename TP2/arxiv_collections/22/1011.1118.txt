We study the fractal properties of the 2d discrete scale invariant (DSI)
rough surfaces. The contour lines of these rough surfaces show clear DSI. In
the appropriate limit the DSI surfaces converge to the scale invariant rough
surfaces. The fractal properties of the 2d DSI rough surfaces apart from
possessing the discrete scale invariance property follow the properties of the
contour lines of the corresponding scale invariant rough surfaces. We check
this hypothesis by calculating numerous fractal exponents of the contour lines
by using numerical calculations. Apart from calculating the known scaling
exponents some other new fractal exponents are also calculated.
