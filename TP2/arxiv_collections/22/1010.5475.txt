We report the observation of a colossal, narrow resistance peak that arises
in ultraclean (mobility 3X10^7cm^2/Vs) GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells (QWs) under
millimeterwave irradiation and a weak magnetic field. Such a spike is
superposed on the 2nd harmonic microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO)
but having an amplitude > 300% of the MIRO, and a typical FWHM ~50 mK,
comparable with the Landau level width. Systematic studies show a correlation
between the spike and a pronounced negative magnetoresistance in these QWs,
suggesting a mechanism based on the interplay of strong scatterers and smooth
disorder. Alternatively, the spike may be interpreted as a manifestation of
quantum interference between the quadrupole resonance and the higher-order
cyclotron transition in well-separated Landau levels.
