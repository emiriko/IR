AXPs and SGRs constitute a special population of young neutron stars, which
are thought to be magnetars, i.e., neutron stars with super-strong magnetic
fields (10^14 - 10^15 G). Assuming that AXPs and SGRs accrete matter from a
fallback disk, we attempt to explain the energy-dependent pulse profiles of AXP
4U 0142+61, as well as its phase-dependent energy spectra. In the fallback disk
model, the Thomson optical depth along the accretion funnel is significant and
bulk-motion Comptonization operates efficiently. This is enhanced by resonant
cyclotron scattering. The thus scattered photons escape mainly sideways and
produce a fan beam, which is detected as a main pulse up to energies of ~160
keV. The approximately isotropic emission from the stellar surface (soft
thermal photons and reflected hard X-ray ones) is detected as a secondary
pulse. This secondary pulse shows a bump at an energy of ~60 keV, which may be
interpreted as resonant cyclotron scattering of fan-beam photons at the
neutron-star surface, implying a dipole magnetic field strength B ~7 x 10^12
(1+z) G, where z is the gravitational redshift. Our model explains the soft and
hard X-ray spectra of 4U 0142+61 and its energy dependent pulse profiles of the
quiescent emission, while the short bursts are due to magnetar-type processes
taking place in superstrong multiple fields.
