Few-layer graphene (FLG) has been predicted to exist in various
crystallographic stacking sequences, which can strongly influence the
electronic properties of FLG. We demonstrate an accurate and efficient method
to characterize stacking order in FLG using the distinctive features of the
Raman 2D-mode. Raman imaging allows us to visualize directly the spatial
distribution of Bernal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stacking in tri- and
tetra-layer graphene. We find that 15% of exfoliated graphene tri- and
tetra-layers is comprised of micron-sized domains of rhombohedral stacking,
rather than of usual Bernal stacking. These domains are stable and remain
unchanged for temperatures exceeding $800^{\circ}$C.
