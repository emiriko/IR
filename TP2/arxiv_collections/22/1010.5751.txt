Usual analyses based on scans of the seesaw parameter-space can be biassed
since they do not cover in a fair way the complete parameter-space. More
precisely, we show that in the common "R-parametrization", many acceptable
R-matrices, compatible with the perturbativity of Yukawa couplings, are
normally disregarded from the beginning, which produces biasses in the results.
We give a straightforward procedure to scan the space of complex R-matrices in
a complete way, giving a very simple rule to incorporate the perturbativity
requirement as a condition for the entries of the R-matrix, something not
considered before. As a relevant application of this, we show that the extended
believe that BR(mu --> e, gamma) in supersymmetric seesaw models depends
strongly on the value of theta_13 is an "optical effect" produced by such
biassed scans, and does not hold after a careful analytical and numerical
study. When the complete scan is done, BR(mu --> e, gamma) gets very
insensitive to theta_13. Moreover, the values of the branching ratio are
typically larger than those quoted in the literature, due to the large number
of acceptable points in the parameter-space which were not considered before.
Including (unflavoured) leptogenesis does not introduce any further dependence
on theta_13, although decreases the typical value of BR(mu --> e, gamma).
