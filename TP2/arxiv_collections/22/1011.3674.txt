We study a complementarity game as a systematic tool for the investigation of
the interplay between individual optimization and population effects and for
the comparison of different strategy and learning schemes. The game randomly
pairs players from opposite populations. The game is symmetric at the
individual level, but has many equilibria that are more or less favorable to
the members of the two populations. Which of these equilibria then is attained
is decided by the dynamics at the population level. Players play repeatedly,
but in each round with a new opponent. They can learn from their previous
encounters and translate this into their actions in the present round on the
basis of strategic schemes. The schemes can be quite simple, or very elaborate.
We can then break the symmetry in the game and give the members of the two
populations access to different strategy spaces. Typically, simpler strategy
types have an advantage because they tend to go more quickly towards a
favorable equilibrium which, once reached, the other population is forced to
accept. Also, populations with bolder individuals that may not fare so well at
the level of individual performance may obtain an advantage towards ones with
more timid players. By checking the effects of parameters such as the
generation length or the mutation rate, we are able to compare the relative
contributions of individual learning and evolutionary adaptations.
