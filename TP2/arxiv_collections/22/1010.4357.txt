Gaugino AMSB models-- wherein scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms
are suppressed at the GUT scale while gaugino masses adopt the AMSB form--
yield a characteristic SUSY particle mass spectrum with light sleptons along
with a nearly degenerate wino-like lightest neutralino and quasi-stable
chargino. The left- sleptons and sneutrinos can be pair produced at
sufficiently high rates to yield observable signals at the Fermilab Tevatron.
We calculate the rate for isolated single and dilepton plus missing energy
signals, along with the presence of one or two highly ionizing chargino tracks.
We find that Tevatron experiments should be able to probe gravitino masses into
the ~55 TeV range for inoAMSB models, which corresponds to a reach in gluino
mass of over 1100 GeV.
