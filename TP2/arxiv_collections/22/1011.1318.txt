As we approach the 125th anniversary of the Michelson-Morley experiment in
2012, we review experiments that test the isotropy of the speed of light.
Previous measurements are categorized into one-way (single-trip) and two-way
(round-trip averaged or over closed paths) approaches and the level of
experimental verification that these experiments provide is discussed. The
isotropy of the speed of light is one of the postulates of the Special Theory
of Relativity (STR) and, consequently, this phenomenon has been subject to
considerable experimental scrutiny. Here, we tabulate significant experiments
performed since 1881 and attempt to indicate a direction for future
investigation.
