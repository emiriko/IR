The 6.7 GHz methanol maser is exclusively associated with high-mass star
formation. However, it remains unclear what structures harbour the methanol
masers. Cepheus A is one of the closest regions of massive star formation,
making it an excellent candidate for detailed studies. We determine the
dynamics of maser spots in the high-mass star-forming region Cepheus A in order
to infer where and when the maser emission occurs. Very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol masers
allows for mapping their spatial and velocity distribution. Phase-referencing
is used to determine the astrometric positions of the maser emission, and
multi-epoch observations can reveal 3D motions. The 6.7 GHz methanol masers are
found in a filamentary structure over ~1350 AU, straddling the waist of the
radio jet HW2. The positions agree well with previous observations of both the
6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol masers. The velocity field of the maser spots does
not show any sign of rotation, but is instead consistent with an infall
signature. The 12.2 GHz methanol masers are closely associated with the 6.7 GHz
methanol masers, and the parallax that we derive confirms previous
measurements. We show that the methanol maser emission very likely arises in a
shock interface in the equatorial region of Cepheus A HW2 and presents a model
in which the maser emission occurs between the infalling gas and the accretion
disk/process.
