Exclusive J/\Psi photo- and electroproduction is studied in the framework of
the analytic S-matrix theory. The differential and integrated elastic cross
sections are calculated using the Modified Dual Amplitude with Mandelstam
Analyticity (M-DAMA) model. The model is applied to the description of the
available experimantal data and proves to be valid in a wide region of the
kinematical variables s, t, and Q^2. Our amplitude can be used also as a
universal background parametrization for the extraction of tiny resonance
signals.
