We take the recently published data of twin kHz quasi-period oscillations
(QPOs) in neutron star (NS) lowmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) as the samples, and
investigate the morphology of the samples, which focuses on the quality factor,
peak frequency of kHz QPOs, and try to infer their physical mechanism. We
notice that: (1) The quality factors of upper kHz QPOs are low (2 ~ 20 in
general) and increase with the kHz QPO peak frequencies for both Z and Atoll
sources. (2) The distribution of quality factor versus frequency for the lower
kHz QPOs are quite different between Z and Atoll sources. For most Z source
samples, the quality factors of lower kHz QPOs are low (usually lower than 15)
and rise steadily with the peak frequencies except for Sco X-1, which drop
abruptly at the frequency of about 750 Hz. While for most Atoll sources, the
quality factors of lower kHz QPOs are very high (from 2 to 200) and usually
have a rising part, a maximum and an abrupt drop. (3) There are three Atoll
sources (4U 1728-34, 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1608-52) of displaying very high quality
factors for lower kHz QPOs. These three sources have been detected with the
spin frequencies and sidebands, in which the source with higher spin frequency
presents higher quality factor of lower kHz QPOs and lower difference between
sideband frequency and lower kHz QPO frequency.
