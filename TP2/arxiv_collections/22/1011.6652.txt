The gravitational lens system MG J0414+0534 is formed by an elliptical galaxy
at redshift ~0.96 and a quasar at z~2.64. The system geometry is typical of
lensing by an elliptical galaxy with the QSO close to and inside a fold
caustic. It shows 4 images of the background source, and a partial Einstein
ring is visible at optical wavelengths. It was observed with a global-VLBI
array at 18 cm in June 2008. We present here the imaging results and a
preliminary lens model constrained by these observations.
