The recent argue about the existence of an instability in the definition of
the mean value appearing in the Tsallis non extensive Statistical Mechanic is
reconsidered. Here, it is simply underlined that the pair of probability
distributions employed in constructing the instability statement have a
discontinuous limit when the number of states tends to infinity. That is,
although for an arbitrary but finite number of states W, both probability
distributions are normalized to the unit, their limits W tending to infinity do
not satisfy the normalization condition and thus are not allowed "escort"
probabilities for the q-mean value. However, similar distributions converging
to the former ones when a parameter W_o is tending to infinity are defined
here. They both satisfy the normalization to the unity in the limit W tending
to infinity. This simple change allows to show that the stability condition
becomes satisfied, for whatever large but fixed value of W_o is chosen.
