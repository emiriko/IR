We study the geometry and dynamics of the Vela complex including the Vela
supernova remnant (SNR), the binary system gamma2 Velorum and the Gum nebula.
We show that the Vela SNR belongs to a subclass of non-Sedov adiabatic remnants
in a cloudy interstellar medium (ISM), the dynamics of which is determined by
the heating and evaporation of ISM clouds. We explain observable
characteristics of the Vela SNR with a SN explosion with energy 1.4 x 10^50
ergs near the step-like boundary of the ISM with low intercloud densities (~
10^{-3} cm^{-3}) and with a volume-averaged density of clouds evaporated by
shock in the north-east (NE) part about four times higher than the one in the
south-west (SW) part. The observed asymmetry between the NE and SW parts of the
Vela SNR could be explained by the presence of a stellar wind bubble (SWB)
blown by the nearest-to-the Earth Wolf-Rayet (WR) star in the gamma2 Velorum
system. We show that the size and kinematics of gamma2 Velorum SWB agree with
predictions of numerical calculations for the evolution of the SWB of M_ini =
35M* star. The low initial mass of the WR star in gamma2 Velorum implies that
the luminosity of the nuclear line of 26Al, produced by gamma2 Velorum, is
below the sensitivity of existing gamma-ray telescopes.
