This work represents the final year project for BSc Physics with Astrophysics
degree and it mainly focuses on empirical investigation of the photometry of
quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the UK Infrared Telescope
(UKIRT) Infrared Sky Survey (UKIDSS) systems. The studies include 5730 quasars
matched from both surveys and examine UV/optical/near-IR properties of the
population. The sample covers the redshift and absolute magnitude ranges 0.01 <
z < 3 and -29.3 < M i < -13.8 and 17 per cent of the SDSS quasars have matching
success to the UKIDSS data. The combination of SDSS ugriz with the JHK near-IR
photometry from UKIDSS over large areas of the sky has enormous potential for
advancing our understanding of quasar population, keeping in mind that these
surveys have not reached their terminations.
