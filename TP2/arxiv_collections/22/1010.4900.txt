We propose a mechanism of spin Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gas
with spatially random Rashba spin-orbit interaction. The calculations based on
the Kubo formalism and kinetic equation show that in contrast to the constant
spin-orbit coupling, spin Hall conductivity in the random spin-orbit field is
not totally suppressed by the potential impurity scattering. Even if the
regular contribution is removed by the vertex corrections, the terms we
consider, remain. Therefore, the intrinsic spin-Hall effect exists being,
however, non-universal.
