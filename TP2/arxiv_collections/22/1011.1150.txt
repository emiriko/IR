The strong coupling treatment of the Fr\"ohlich-type polaronic system, based
on a canonical transformation and a standard Landau-Pekar type variational wave
function, is applied to the polaronic system consisting of an impurity in a
condensate. Within this approach the Relaxed Excited States are retrieved as a
typical polaronic feature in the energy spectrum. For these states we calculate
the corresponding effective mass and the minimal coupling constant required for
them to occur. The present approach allows to derive approximate expressions
for the transition energies between different Relaxed Excited States in a much
simpler way than with the full Mori-Zwanzig approach, and with a good accuracy,
which improves with increasing coupling. The transition energies obtained here
can be used as the spectroscopic fingerprint for the experimental observation
of Relaxed Excited States of impurities in a condensate.
