Let $E(k, \ell)$ denote the smallest integer such that any set of at least
$E(k, \ell)$ points in the plane, no three on a line, contains either an empty
convex polygon with $k$ vertices or an empty pseudo-triangle with $\ell$
vertices. The existence of $E(k, \ell)$ for positive integers $k, \ell\geq 3$,
is the consequence of a result proved by Valtr [Discrete and Computational
Geometry, Vol. 37, 565--576, 2007]. In this paper, following a series of new
results about the existence of empty pseudo-triangles in point sets with
triangular convex hulls, we determine the exact values of $E(k, 5)$ and $E(5,
\ell)$, and prove bounds on $E(k, 6)$ and $E(6, \ell)$, for $k, \ell\geq 3$. By
dropping the emptiness condition, we define another related quantity $F(k,
\ell)$, which is the smallest integer such that any set of at least $F(k,
\ell)$ points in the plane, no three on a line, contains a convex polygon with
$k$ vertices or a pseudo-triangle with $\ell$ vertices. Extending a result of
Bisztriczky and T\'oth [Discrete Geometry, Marcel Dekker, 49--58, 2003], we
obtain the exact values of $F(k, 5)$ and $F(k, 6)$, and obtain non-trivial
bounds on $F(k, 7)$.
