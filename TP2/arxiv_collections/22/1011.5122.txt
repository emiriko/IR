In this paper we consider the issue of energy efficiency in random access
networks and show that optimizing transmission probabilities of nodes can
enhance network performance in terms of energy consumption and fairness. First,
we propose a heuristic power control method that improves throughput, and then
we model the Utility Constrained Energy Minimization (UCEM) problem in which
the utility constraint takes into account single and multi node performance.
UCEM is modeled as a convex optimization problem and Sequential Quadratic
Programming (SQP) is used to find optimal transmission probabilities. Numerical
results show that our method can achieve fairness, reduce energy consumption
and enhance lifetime of such networks.
