I present improved predictions for the total hadronic cross section of
stop-antistop production at hadron colliders including
next-to-next-to-leading-order threshold corrections and approximated Coulomb
corrections. The results are based on soft corrections, which are
logarithmically enhanced near threshold. I present analytic formulas for the
NNLO scaling functions at threshold and explicit numbers for the total hadronic
cross sections for the Tevatron and the LHC. Finally I discuss the systematic
error, the scale uncertainty and the PDF error of the hadronic cross section.
