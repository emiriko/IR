We investigated the magnetotransport of InAs nanowires grown by selective
area metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. In the temperature range between 0.5
and 30 K reproducible fluctuations in the conductance upon variation of the
magnetic field or the back-gate voltage are observed, which are attributed to
electron interference effects in small disordered conductors. From the
correlation field of the magnetoconductance fluctuations the phase-coherence
length l_phi is determined. At the lowest temperatures l_phi is found to be at
least 300 nm, while for temperatures exceeding 2 K a monotonous decrease of
l_phi with temperature is observed. A direct observation of the weak
antilocalization effect indicating the presence of spin-orbit coupling is
masked by the strong magnetoconductance fluctuations. However, by averaging the
magnetoconductance over a range of gate voltages a clear peak in the
magnetoconductance due to the weak antilocalization effect was resolved. By
comparison of the experimental data to simulations based on a recursive
two-dimensional Green's function approach a spin-orbit scattering length of
approximately 70 nm was extracted, indicating the presence of strong spin-orbit
coupling.
