We report on low temperature conductance measurements of gold nanogaps
fabricated by controlled electromigration. Fluctuations of the conductance due
to quantum interferences and depending both on bias voltage and magnetic field
are observed. By analyzing the voltage and magnetoconductance correlation
functions we determine the type of electron trajectories generating the
observed quantum interferences and the effective characteristic time of phase
coherence in our device.
