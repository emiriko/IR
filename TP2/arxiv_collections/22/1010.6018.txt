Using effective field theory methods, we discuss the extraction of the mass
and width of the scalar mesons f0(980) and a0(980) from the finite-volume
spectrum in lattice QCD. In particular, it is argued that the nature of these
states can be studied by invoking twisted boundary conditions, as well as
investigating the quark mass dependence of the spectrum.
