We analyze the surface plasmons (SPs) propagating along the optically pumped
single-graphene layer (SGL) and multiple-graphene layer (MGL) structures. It is
shown that at sufficiently strong optical pumping when the real part of dynamic
conductivity of SGL and MGL structures becomes negative in the terahertz (THz)
range of frequencies due to the interband population inversion, the damping of
the THz SPs can give way to their amplification. This effect can be used in
graphene-based THz lasers and other devices. Due to relatively small SP group
velocity, the absolute value of their absorption coefficient (SP gain) can be
large, substantially exceeding that of the optically pumped structures with the
dielectric waveguide. The comparison of the SGL and MGL structures shows that
to maximize the SP gain the number of GL layers should be properly choosen.
