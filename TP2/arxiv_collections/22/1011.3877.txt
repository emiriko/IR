We report the discovery of a pair of infrared, axisymmetric rings in the
planetary nebula NGC 1514 during the course of the WISE all-sky mid-infrared
survey. Similar structures are seen at visible wavelengths in objects such as
the "Engraved Hourglass Nebula" (MyCn 18) and the "Southern Crab Nebula" (Hen
2-104). However, in NGC 1514 we see only a single pair of rings and they are
easily observed only in the mid-infrared. These rings are roughly 0.2 pc in
diameter, are separated by 0.05 pc, and are dominated by dust emission with a
characteristic temperature of 160 K. We compare the morphology and color of the
rings to the other nebular structures seen at visible, far-infrared, and radio
wavelengths, and close with a discussion of a physical model and formation
scenario for NGC 1514.
