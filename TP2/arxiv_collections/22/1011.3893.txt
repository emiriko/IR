The heat conduction in an open transverse-field Ising chain is studied by
using quantization in the Fock space of operators in the weak coupling regimes,
i.e. the coupling is much smaller than the transverse field. The
non-equilibrium steady state is obtained for large size systems coupled to
Markovian baths at its ends. The ballistic transport is observed in the uniform
chain and normal diffusion in the random-exchange chain. {In addition, the
ballistic-diffusive transition is found at the intermediate disorder regime.}
The thermal conductivity $\kappa$ is also calculated in the low and high
temperature regimes. It is shown that $\kappa$ decays as $\kappa\sim T^{-2}$ at
high temperatures.
