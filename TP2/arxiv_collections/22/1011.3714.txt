In this paper we define the formal and tempered Deligne cohomology groups,
that are obtained by applying the Deligne complex functor to the complexes of
formal differential forms and tempered currents respectively. We then prove the
existence of a duality between them, a vanishing theorem for the former and a
semipurity property for the latter. The motivation of these results comes from
the study of covariant arithmetic Chow groups. The semi-purity property of
tempered Deligne cohomology implies, in particular, that several definitions of
covariant arithmetic Chow groups agree for projective arithmetic varieties.
