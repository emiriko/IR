We study graphical representations for two related models. The first model is
the transverse field quantum Ising model, an extension of the original Ising
model which was introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis in the 1960's. The
second model is the space-time percolation process, which is closely related to
the contact model for the spread of disease. We consider a `space-time'
random-cluster model and explore a range of useful probabilistic techniques for
studying it. The space-time Potts model emerges as a natural generalization of
the quantum Ising model. The basic properties of the phase transitions in these
models are treated, such as the fact that there is at most one unbounded
FK-cluster, and the resulting lower bound on the critical value in $\ZZ$. We
also develop an alternative graphical representation of the quantum Ising
model, called the random-parity representation. This representation is based on
the random-current representation of the classical Ising model, and allows us
to study in much greater detail the phase transition and critical behaviour.
The random-parity representation is used to prove sharpness of the phase
transition in the quantum Ising model, and to establish bounds on some critical
exponents. We address these issues by using the random-parity representation to
establish certain differential inequalities, integration of which give the
results. Finally we explore some consequences and possible extensions of the
results mentioned. For example, we determine the critical point for the quantum
Ising model in $\ZZ$ and in `star-like' geometries.
