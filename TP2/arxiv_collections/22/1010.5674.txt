We examine the contribution of Multiple Parton Interactions to Z+n-jets
production at the LHC, n=2,3,4, where the Z boson is assumed to decay
leptonically. We compare the results obtained with the correlated GS09 double
parton distribution function with those obtained with two instances of fully
factorized single parton distribution functions: MSTW2008LO and CTEQ6LO. It
appears quite feasible to measure the MPI contribution to Z+2/3/4 jets already
in the first phase of the LHC with a total luminosity of one inverse femtobarn
at 7 TeV. If as expected the trigger threshold for single photons is around 80
GeV, Z+2-jets production may well turn out to be more easily observable than
the gamma+3-jets channel. The MPI cross section is dominated by relatively soft
events with two jets balancing in transverse momentum.
