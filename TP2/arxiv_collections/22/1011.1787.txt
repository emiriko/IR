In this paper we present a new method, which allows for the construction of
triangular isosurfaces from three-dimensional data sets, such as 3D image data
and/or numerical simulation data that are based on regularly shaped, cubic
lattices. This novel volume-enclosing surface extraction technique, which has
been named VESTA, can produce up to six different results due to the nature of
the discretized 3D space under consideration. VESTA is neither template-based
nor it is necessarily required to operate on 2x2x2 voxel cell neighborhoods
only. The surface tiles are determined with a very fast and robust construction
technique while potential ambiguities are detected and resolved. Here, we
provide an in-depth comparison between VESTA and various versions of the
well-known and very popular Marching Cubes algorithm for the very first time.
In an application section, we demonstrate the extraction of VESTA isosurfaces
for various data sets ranging from computer tomographic scan data to simulation
data of relativistic hydrodynamic fireball expansions.
