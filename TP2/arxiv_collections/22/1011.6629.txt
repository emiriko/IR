In the two-impurity Anderson model, the inter-impurity spin exchange
interaction favors a spin singlet state between two impurities leading to the
breakdown of the Kondo effect. We show that a local uniform magnetic field can
delocalize the quasiparticles to restore the Kondo resonance. This transition
is found to be continuous, accompanied by not only the divergence of the
staggered (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, but also the divergence of the
uniform spin susceptibility. This may imply that the magnetic field induced
quantum phase transitions in Kondo systems are in favor of the local critical
type.
