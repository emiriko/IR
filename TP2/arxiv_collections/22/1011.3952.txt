We have studied the dynamics of chloride and potassium ions in the interior
of the OmpF porin under the influence of an external electric field. From the
results of extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the system we
computed several first passage time (FPT) quantities to characterize the
dynamics of the ions in the interior of the channel. Such FPT quantities
obtained from MD simulations demonstrate that it is not possible to describe
the dynamics of chloride and potassium ions inside the whole channel with a
single constant diffusion coefficient. However, we showed that a valid,
statistically rigorous, description in terms of a constant diffusion
coefficient D and an effective deterministic force Feff can be obtained after
appropriate subdivison of the channel in different regions suggested by the
X-ray structure. These results have important implications for popular
simplified descriptions of channels based on the 1D Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
equations. Also, the effect of entropic barriers on the diffusion of the ions
is identified and briefly discussed.
