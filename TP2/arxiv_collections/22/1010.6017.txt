At the LHC, for the first time, laboratory energies are sufficiently large to
reproduce the kind of reactions that occur when energetic cosmic rays strike
the top of the atmosphere. The reaction products of interest for cosmic ray
studies are produced at small angles, even with colliding beams. Most of the
emphasis at the LHC is on rare processes that are studied with detectors at
large angles. It is precision measurements at large angles that are expected to
lead to discoveries of Higgs bosons and super symmetric particles. CMS
currently has two small angle detectors, CASTOR and a Zero Degree Calorimeter
(ZDC). CASTOR, at $0.7^{\circ}$ down to $0.08^{\circ}$, is designed to study
"Centauro" and "long penetrating" events, observed in VHE cosmic-ray data. As a
general purpose detector it also makes measurements of reaction products at
forward angles from p-p collisions, which provide input for cosmic ray shower
codes. The ZDC is small, 9 cm. wide, between the incoming and outgoing beam
pipes out at a distance of 140 m. The ZDC measures neutral objects that follow
the direction of the beam at the interaction point. If the long penetrating
objects are spectators they could be seen in the ZDC if their charge to mass
ratio, Z/A, is less than 0.2.
