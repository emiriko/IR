Let $L=\Delta-\nabla\varphi\cdot\nabla$ be a symmetric diffusion operator
with an invariant measure $d\mu=e^{-\varphi}dx$ on a complete Riemannian
manifold. In this paper we prove Li-Yau gradient estimates for weighted
elliptic equations on the complete manifold with $|\nabla \varphi|\leq\theta$
and $\infty$-dimensional Bakry-\'{E}mery Ricci curvature bounded below by some
negative constant. Based on this, we give an upper bound on the first
eigenvalue of the diffusion operator $L$ on this kind manifold, and thereby
generalize a Cheng's result on the Laplacian case (Math. Z., 143 (1975)
289-297).
