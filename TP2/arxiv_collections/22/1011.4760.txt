The CALICE collaboration is currently developing an engineering prototype of
an analog hadron calorimeter for a future linear collider detector. It is based
on scintillating tiles that are individually read out by silicon
photomultipliers. The prototype will contain about 2500 detector channels,
which corresponds to one calorimeter layer and aims at demonstrating the
feasibility of building a detector with fully integrated front-end electronics.
The concept and engineering status of the prototype, as well as results from
the DESY test setups are reported here.
