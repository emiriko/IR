We consider the problem of digital halftoning from the view point of
statistical mechanics. The digital halftoning is a sort of image processing,
namely, representing each grayscale in terms of black and white binary dots.
The digital halftoning is achieved by making use of the threshold mask, namely,
for each pixel, the halftoned binary pixel is determined as black if the
original grayscale pixel is greater than or equal to the mask value and is
determined as white vice versa. To determine the optimal value of the mask on
each pixel for a given original grayscale image, we first assume that the
human-eyes might recognize the black and white binary halftoned image as the
corresponding grayscale one by linear filters. The Hamiltonian is constructed
as a distance between the original and the recognized images which is written
in terms of the threshold mask. We are confirmed that the system described by
the Hamiltonian is regarded as a kind of antiferromagnetic Ising model with
quenched disorders. By searching the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we obtain
the optimal threshold mask and the resulting halftoned binary dots
simultaneously. From the power-spectrum analysis, we find that the binary dots
image is physiologically plausible from the view point of human-eyes modulation
properties. We also propose a theoretical framework to investigate statistical
performance of inverse digital halftoning, that is, the inverse process of
halftoning. From the Bayesian inference view point, we rigorously show that the
Bayes-optimal inverse-halftoning is achieved on a specific condition which is
very similar to the so-called Nishimori line in the research field of spin
glasses.
