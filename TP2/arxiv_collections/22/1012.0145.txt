In this paper we continue to develop an alternative viewpoint on recent
studies of Navier-Stokes regularity in critical spaces, a program which was
started in the recent work by C. Kenig and the second author (Ann Inst H
Poincar\'e Anal Non Lin\'eaire 28(2):159-187, 2011). Specifically, we prove
that strong solutions which remain bounded in the space $L^3(R^3)$ do not
become singular in finite time, a known result established by Escauriaza,
Seregin and Sverak (Uspekhi Mat Nauk 58(2(350)):3-44, 2003) in the context of
suitable weak solutions. Here, we use the method of "critical elements" which
was recently developed by Kenig and Merle to treat critical dispersive
equations. Our main tool is a "profile decomposition" for the Navier-Stokes
equations in critical Besov spaces which we develop here. As a byproduct of
this tool, assuming a singularity-producing initial datum for Navier-Stokes
exists in a critical Lebesgue or Besov space, we show there is one with minimal
norm, generalizing a result of Rusin and Sverak (J Funct Anal 260(3):879-891,
2011).
