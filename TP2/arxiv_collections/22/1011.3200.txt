In this article, we study the $B \to K^*_2(1430)$, $a_2(1320)$, $f_2(1270)$
form-factors with the light-cone QCD sum rules, where the $B$-meson light-cone
distribution amplitudes are used. In calculations, we observe that the
line-shapes of the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude $\phi_+(\omega)$
have significant impacts on the values of the form-factors, and expect to
obtain severe constraints on the parameters of the $B$-meson light-cone
distribution amplitudes from the experimental data in the future.
