We present a single solid-state laser system to cool, coherently manipulate
and detect $^{25}$Mg$^+$ ions. Coherent manipulation is accomplished by
coupling two hyperfine ground state levels using a pair of far-detuned Raman
laser beams. Resonant light for Doppler cooling and detection is derived from
the same laser source by means of an electro-optic modulator, generating a
sideband which is resonant with the atomic transition. We demonstrate
ground-state cooling of one of the vibrational modes of the ion in the trap
using resolved-sideband cooling. The cooling performance is studied and
discussed by observing the temporal evolution of Raman-stimulated sideband
transitions. The setup is a major simplification over existing state-of-the-art
systems, typically involving up to three separate laser sources.
