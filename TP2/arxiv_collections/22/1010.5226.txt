In attempts to combine non-commutative geometry and quantum gravity,
Aastrup-Grimstrup-Nest construct a semi-finite spectral triple, modeling the
space of G-connections for G=U(1) or SU(2). AGN show that the interaction
between the algebra of holonomy loops and the Dirac-type operator D reproduces
the Poisson structure of General Relativity in Ashtekar's loop variables. This
article generalizes AGN's construction to any connected compact Lie group G. A
construction of AGN's semi-finite spectral triple in terms of an inductive
limit of spectral triples is formulated. The refined construction permits the
semi-finite spectral triple to be even when G is even dimensional. The
Dirac-type operator D in AGN's semi-finite spectral triple is a weighted sum of
a basic Dirac operator on G. The weight assignment is a diverging sequence that
governs the "volume" associated to each copy of G. The JLO cocycle of AGN's
triple is examined in terms of the weight assignment. An explicit condition on
the weight assignment perturbations is given, so that the associated JLO class
remains invariant. Such a condition leads to a functoriality property of AGN's
construction.
