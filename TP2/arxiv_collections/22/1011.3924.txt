We investigate the spin-dependent transport properties of a two-dimensional
electron gas formed at oxides' interface in the presence of a magnetic field.
We consider several scenarios for the oxides' properties, including oxides with
co-linear or spiral magnetic and ferroelectric order. For spiral multiferroic
oxides, the magnetoelectric coupling and the topology of the localized magnetic
moments introduce additional, electric field controlled spin-orbit coupling
that affects the magneto-oscillation of the current. An interplay of this
spin-orbit coupling, the exchange field, and of the applied magnetic field
results in a quantum, gate-controlled spin and charge Hall conductance.
