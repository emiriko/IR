We present evidence that electrical transport studies of epitaxial p-type
GeMn thin films fabricated on high resistivity Ge substrates are severely
influenced by parallel conduction through the substrate, related to the large
intrinsic conductivity of Ge due to its small bandgap. Anomalous Hall
measurements and large magneto resistance effects are completely understood by
taking a dominating substrate contribution as well as the measurement geometry
into account. It is shown that substrate conduction persists also for well
conducting, degenerate, p-type thin films, giving rise to an effective
two-layer conduction scheme. Using n-type Ge substrates, parallel conduction
through the substrate can be reduced for the p-type epi-layers, as a
consequence of the emerging pn-interface junction. GeMn thin films fabricated
on these substrates exhibit a negligible magneto resistance effect. Our study
underlines the importance of a thorough characterization and understanding of
possible substrate contributions for electrical transport studies of GeMn thin
films.
