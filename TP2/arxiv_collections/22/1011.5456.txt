This paper demonstrates the existence of topological models with gapped edge
states but protected extended bulk states against disorder. Such systems will
be labeled as trivial by the current classification of topological insulators.
Our finding calls for a re-examination of the definition of a topological
insulator. The analysis is supported by extensive numerical data for a model of
non-interacting electrons in the presence of strong disorder. In the clean
limit, the model displays a topological insulating phase with spin-Chern number
$C_s$=2 and gapped edge states. In the presence of disorder, level statistics
on energy spectrum reveals regions of extended states displaying levitation and
pair annihilation. Therefore, the extended states carry a topological invariant
robust against disorder. By driving the Fermi level over the mobility edges, it
is shown that this invariant is precisely the spin-Chern number. The protection
mechanism for the extended state is explained.
