In the space environment, instruments onboard of spacecrafts can be affected
by displacement damage due to radiation. The differential scattering cross
section for screened nucleus--nucleus interactions - i.e., including the
effects due to screened Coulomb nuclear fields -, nuclear stopping powers and
non-ionization energy losses are treated from about 50 keV/nucleon up to
relativistic energies.
