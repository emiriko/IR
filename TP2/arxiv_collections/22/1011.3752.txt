The CHIMERA code is a multi-dimensional multi-physics engine dedicated
primarily to the simulation of core collapse supernova explosions. One of the
most important aspects of these explosions is their capacity to produce
gravitational radiation that is detectable by Earth-based laser-interferometric
gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO and VIRGO. We present here
preliminary gravitational signatures of two-dimensional models with
non-rotating progenitors. These simulations exhibit explosions, which are
followed for more than half a second after stellar core bounce.
