In this video, the mechanism followed to disperse an oil phase in water using
a Scaba impeller in a cylindrical tank is presented. Castor oil (viscosity =
500 mPas) is used and the Reynolds number was fixed to 24,000. The process was
recorded with a high-speed camera. Initially, the oil is at the air water
interface. At the beginning of the stirring, the oil is dragged into the liquid
bulk and rotates around the impeller shaft, then is pushed radially into the
flow ejected by the impeller. In this region, the flow is turbulent and
exhibits velocity gradients that contribute to elongate the oil phase. Viscous
thin filaments are generated and expelled from the impeller. Thereafter, the
filaments are elongated and break to form drops. This process is repeated in
all the oil phase and drops are incorporated into the dispersion. Two main
zones can be identified in the tank: the impeller discharge characterized by
high turbulence and the rest of the flow where low velocity gradients appear.
In this region surface forces dominate the inertial ones, and drops became
spheroidal.
