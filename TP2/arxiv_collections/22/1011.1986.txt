We propose a procedure for light-curve solution of eclipsing binary stars in
the Small Magellanic Cloud for which photometric data have been obtained in the
framework of the OGLE project as well as way of determination of the global
stellar parameters on the basis of the obtained solutions, some empirical
relations as well as the distance to the SMC. Several examples illustrate this
procedure.
