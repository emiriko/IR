We develop the notion of the composition of two coalgebras, which arises
naturally in higher category theory and the theory of species. We prove that
the composition of two cofree coalgebras is cofree and give conditions which
imply that the composition is a one-sided Hopf algebra. These conditions hold
when one coalgebra is a graded Hopf operad D and the other is a connected
graded coalgebra with coalgebra map to D. We conclude by discussing these
structures for compositions with bases the vertices of multiplihedra,
composihedra, and hypercubes.
