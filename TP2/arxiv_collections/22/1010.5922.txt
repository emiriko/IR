The Wide Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) is a proposed mission with a high
survey speed, due to the combination of large field of view (FOV) and effective
area, i.e. grasp, and sharp PSF across the whole FOV. These characteristics
make it suitable to detect a large number of variable and transient X-ray
sources during its operating lifetime. Here we present estimates of the WFXT
capabilities in the time domain, allowing to study the variability of thousand
of AGNs with significant detail, as well as to constrain the rates and
properties of hundreds of distant, faint and/or rare objects such as X-ray
Flashes/faint GRBs, Tidal Disruption Events, ULXs, Type-I bursts etc. The
planned WFXT extragalactic surveys will thus allow to trace variable and
transient X-ray populations over large cosmological volumes.
