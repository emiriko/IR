We report on four $\Sigma$'s and three $\Lambda$'s, in the 1500 - 1800 MeV
region, as two meson - one baryon S-wave $(1/2)^+$ resonances found by solving
the Faddeev equations in the coupled channel approach, which can be associated
to the existing $S$ = -1, $J^P= 1/2^+$ low lying baryon resonances. On the
other hand we also report on a new, hidden strangeness $N^*$ state, mostly made
of $K \bar{K} N$, with mass around 1920 MeV, which we think could be
responsible for the peak seen in the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$ around this
energy. Finally we address a very novel topic in which we show how few body
systems of several $\rho$ mesons can be produced, with their spins aligned up
to J=6, and how these states found theoretically can be associated to several
known mesons with spins J=2,3,4,5,6.
