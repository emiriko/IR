Supersymmetric (SUSY) Grand Unified theories (GUTs) generally predict FCNC
and CP violating processes to occur both in the leptonic and hadronic sectors.
Assuming an underlying SU(5) group plus right-handed neutrinos (RN), we perform
an extensive study of FCNC and CP violation, analyzing the correlations between
leptonic and hadronic processes like mu-> e gamma and K-Kbar mixing, tau->mu
gamma and b -> s transitions such as B_d -> phi K_s and Bs-Bsbar mixing.
Moreover, we examine the impact of the considered scenario on the UT analyses,
monitoring the low energy consequences implied by possible solutions to the
various tensions in the present UT analyses. We compare the phenomenological
implications of this NP scenario with the ones of supersymmetric flavour models
finding a few striking differences that could allow to distinguish these
different NP models.
