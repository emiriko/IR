The helioseismic Global Oscillation at Low Frequency (GOLF) and the
Variability of solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instruments
onboard SoHO, have been observing the Sun continuously for the last 14 years.
In this preliminary work, we characterize the acoustic modes over the entire
p-mode range in both, Doppler velocity and luminosity, with a special care for
the low-frequency modes taking advantage of the stability and the high duty
cycle of space observations.
