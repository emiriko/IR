We examine different topological phases in three-dimensional
non-centrosymmetric superconductors with time-reversal symmetry by using three
different types of topological invariants. Due to the bulk boundary
correspondence, a non-zero value of any of these topological numbers indicates
the appearance of zero-energy Andreev surface states. We find that some of
these boundary modes in nodal superconducting phases are dispersionless, i.e.,
they form a topologically protected flat band. The region where the zero-energy
flat band appears in the surface Brillouin zone is determined by the projection
of the nodal lines in the bulk onto the surface. These dispersionless Andreev
surface bound states have many observable consequences, in particular, a
zero-bias conductance peak in tunneling measurements. We also find that in the
gapless phase there appear Majorana surface modes at time-reversal invariant
momenta which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant.
