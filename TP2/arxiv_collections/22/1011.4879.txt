Analyzing the relationships among the parameters for quantifying the quality
of research published in journals is a challenging task. In this paper, we
analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a
journal. To keep our analysis simple and easy to understand, we consider a
generalized version of the impact factor where there is no time window. In the
absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of
citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor,
it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a
time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too. We
derive the expressions for the relationships among impact factor, h-index, and
g-index and validate them using a given set of publication-citation data.
