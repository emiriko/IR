We present an empirical study of user activity in online BBC discussion
forums, measured by the number of posts written by individual debaters and the
average sentiment of these posts. Nearly 2.5 million posts from over 18
thousand users were investigated. Scale free distributions were observed for
activity in individual discussion threads as well as for overall activity. The
number of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with
thread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions
rather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that
most posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual
threads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average
emotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by
negative comments. An agent based computer simulation model has been used to
reproduce several essential characteristics of the analyzed system. The model
stresses the role of discussions between users, especially emotionally laden
quarrels between supporters of opposite opinions, and represents many observed
statistics of the forum.
