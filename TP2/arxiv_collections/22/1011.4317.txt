Recent progress in superconducting qubits has demonstrated the potential of
these devices for the future of quantum information processing. One desirable
feature for quantum computing is independent control of qubit interactions as
well as qubit energies. We demonstrate a new type of superconducting charge
qubit that has a V-shaped energy spectrum and uses quantum interference to
provide independent control over the qubit energy and dipole coupling to a
superconducting cavity. We demonstrate dynamic access to the strong coupling
regime by tuning the coupling strength from less than 200 kHz to more than 40
MHz. This tunable coupling can be used to protect the qubit from cavity-induced
relaxation and avoid unwanted qubit-qubit interactions in a multi-qubit system.
