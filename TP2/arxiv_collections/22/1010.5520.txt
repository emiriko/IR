A fully relativistic description of the spin-orbit induced spin Hall effect
is presented that is based on Kubo's linear response formalism. Using an
appropriate operator for the spin current density a Kubo-St\v{r}eda-like
equation for the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) is obtained. An implementation
using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) band structure method in combination
with the Coherent Potential Approximation (CPA) allow detailed investigations
on various alloy systems. A decomposition of the SHC into intrinsic and
extrinsic contributions is suggested. Accompanying calculations for the
skew-scattering contribution of the SHC using the Boltzmann equation
demonstrate the equivalence to the Kubo formalism in the dilute alloy regime
and support the suggested decomposition scheme.
