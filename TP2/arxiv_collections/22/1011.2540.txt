The implementation of a spin qubit in a quantum ring occupied by one or a few
electrons is proposed. Quantum bit involves the Zeeman sublevels of the highest
occupied orbital. Such a qubit can be initialized, addressed, manipulated, read
out and coherently coupled to other quantum rings. An extensive discussion of
relaxation and decoherence is presented. By analogy with quantum dots, the spin
relaxation times due to spin-orbit interaction for experimentally accessible
quantum ring architectures are calculated. The conditions are formulated under
which qubits build on quantum rings can have long relaxation times of the order
of seconds. Rapidly improving nanofabrication technology have made such ring
devices experimentally feasible and thus promising for quantum state
engineering.
