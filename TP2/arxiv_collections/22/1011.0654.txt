We study the correspondence between the non-trivial topological properties
associated with the individual valleys of gapped bilayer graphene (BLG), as a
prototypical multi-valley system, and the gapless modes at its edges and other
interfaces. We find that the exact connection between the valley-specific Hall
conductivity and the number of gapless edge modes does not hold in general, but
is dependent on the boundary conditions, even in the absence of intervalley
coupling. This non-universality is attributed to the absence of a well-defined
topological invariant within a given valley of BLG; yet, a more general
topological invariant may be defined in certain cases, which explains the
distinction between the BLG-vacuum and BLG-BLG interfaces.
