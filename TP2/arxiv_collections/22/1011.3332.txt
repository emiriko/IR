The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of hydrogen adatoms on graphene are
important to the materials and devices based on hydrogenated graphene. Hydrogen
dimers on graphene with coverages varying from 0.040 to 0.111 ML (1.0 ML $=
3.8\times10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$) were considered in this report. The thermodynamic
and kinetic properties of H, D and T dimers were studied by ab initio
simulations. The vibrational zero-point energy corrections were found to be not
negligible in kinetics, varying from 0.038 (0.028, 0.017) to 0.257 (0.187,
0.157) eV for H (D, T) dimers. The isotope effect exhibits as that the kinetic
mobility of a hydrogen dimer decreases with increasing the hydrogen mass. The
simulated thermal desorption spectra with the heating rate $\alpha = 1.0$ K/s
were quite close to experimental measurements. The effect of the interaction
between hydrogen dimers on their thermodynamic and kinetic properties were
analyzed in detail.
