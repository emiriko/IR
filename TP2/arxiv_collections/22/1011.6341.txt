We have measured the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect for a sample of ten
strong lensing selected galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev Zel'dovich Array
(SZA). The SZA is sensitive to structures on spatial scales of a few
arcminutes, while the strong lensing mass modeling constrains the mass at small
scales (typically < 30"). Combining the two provides information about the
projected concentrations of the strong lensing clusters. The Einstein radii we
measure are twice as large as expected given the masses inferred from SZ
scaling relations. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates that a sample randomly
drawn from the expected distribution would have a larger median Einstein radius
than the observed clusters about 3% of the time. The implied overconcentration
has been noted in previous studies with smaller samples of lensing clusters. It
persists for this sample, with the caveat that this could result from a
systematic effect such as if the gas fractions of the strong lensing clusters
are substantially below what is expected.
