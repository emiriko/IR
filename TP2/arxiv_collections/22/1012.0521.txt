We investigate the dynamical evolution of double-sided jets and present
detailed numerical studies on the emission from the receding jet of gamma-ray
bursts. It is found that the receding jet emission is generally very weak and
only manifests as a plateau in the late time radio afterglow light curves.
Additionally, we find that the effect of synchrotron self-absorption can
influence the peak time of the receding jet emission significantly.
