We study a combinatorial problem arising from microarrays synthesis. The
synthesis is done by a light-directed chemical process. The objective is to
minimize unintended illumination that may contaminate the quality of
experiments. Unintended illumination is measured by a notion called border
length and the problem is called Border Minimization Problem (BMP). The
objective of the BMP is to place a set of probe sequences in the array and find
an embedding (deposition of nucleotides/residues to the array cells) such that
the sum of border length is minimized. A variant of the problem, called P-BMP,
is that the placement is given and the concern is simply to find the embedding.
Approximation algorithms have been previously proposed for the problem but it
is unknown whether the problem is NP-hard or not. In this paper, we give a
thorough study of different variations of BMP by giving NP-hardness proofs and
improved approximation algorithms. We show that P-BMP, 1D-BMP, and BMP are all
NP-hard. Contrast with the previous result that 1D-P-BMP is polynomial time
solvable, the interesting implications include (i) the array dimension (1D or
2D) differentiates the complexity of P-BMP; (ii) for 1D array, whether
placement is given differentiates the complexity of BMP; (iii) BMP is NP-hard
regardless of the dimension of the array. Another contribution of the paper is
improving the approximation for BMP from $O(n^{1/2} \log^2 n)$ to $O(n^{1/4}
\log^2 n)$, where $n$ is the total number of sequences.
