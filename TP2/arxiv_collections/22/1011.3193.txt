We consider the effect of Gaussian white noise on fast-slow dynamical systems
with one fast and two slow variables, containing a folded-node singularity. In
the absence of noise, these systems are known to display mixed-mode
oscillations, consisting of alternating large- and small-amplitude
oscillations. We quantify the effect of noise and obtain critical noise
intensities above which the small-amplitude oscillations become hidden by
fluctuations. Furthermore we prove that the noise can cause sample paths to
jump away from so-called canard solutions with high probability before
deterministic orbits do. This early-jump mechanism can drastically influence
the local and global dynamics of the system by changing the mixed-mode
patterns.
