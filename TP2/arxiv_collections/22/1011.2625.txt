We report a computationally tractable approach to first principles
investigation of time-dependent current of molecular devices under a step-like
pulse. For molecular devices, all the resonant states below Fermi level
contribute to the time-dependent current. Hence calculation beyond wideband
limit must be carried out for a quantitative analysis of transient dynamics of
molecules devices. Based on the exact non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formalism of calculating the transient current in Ref.\onlinecite{Maciejko}, we
develop two approximate schemes going beyond the wideband limit, they are all
suitable for first principles calculation using the NEGF combined with density
functional theory. Benchmark test has been done by comparing with the exact
solution of a single level quantum dot system. Good agreement has been reached
for two approximate schemes. As an application, we calculate the transient
current using the first approximated formula with opposite voltage
$V_L(t)=-V_R(t)$ in two molecular structures: Al-${\rm C}_{5}$-Al and Al-${\rm
C}_{60}$-Al. As illustrated in these examples, our formalism can be easily
implemented for real molecular devices. Importantly, our new formula has
captured the essential physics of dynamical properties of molecular devices and
gives the correct steady state current at $t=0$ and $t\rightarrow \infty$.
