An approximate solution of the position-dependent mass Dirac equation with
the Hulthen potential is obtained in $D$-dimensions within frame work of an
exponential approximation of the centrifugal term. The relativistic energy
spectrum is worked out using direct transformation method; the two-component
spinor wavefunctions are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.
Dependence of the energy levels on some parameters is discussed. The results
obtained are in good agreement with previous works.
