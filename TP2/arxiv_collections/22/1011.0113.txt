Aims: GRB 050502B is well known for the very bright flare displayed in its
X-ray light curve. Despite extensive studies, however, the optical light curve
has never been discussed and its redshift is unconstrained. Possible
correlations between optical and X-ray data are analysed. Methods: Photometric
data from TNG in the R and I bands were used to compare the optical afterglow
with the X-ray light curve. The HyperZ package and a late time VLT host
observation were used to derive redshift estimates. Results: The I-band
afterglow decay followed a power-law of index {\alpha} = 2.1 $\pm$ 0.6, after a
late break at ~ $1.3 \times 10^5$ s. The R - I color is remarkably red and the
broadband spectral index {\beta}_OX = $0.9 \pm 0.1$ is consistent with the
X-ray spectral slope {\beta}_X. Although a photometric redshift of z > 4 is the
most conservative result to consider, a photometric redshift of z = 5.2 $\pm$
0.3 is suggested with no extinction in the host, based on which an isotropic
energy E_{\gamma},iso = $(3.8 \pm 0.7) \times 10^52$ erg and a jet opening
angle {\theta} ~ $3.7^{\circ}$ are subsequently derived.
  Conclusions: The combined X-ray and optical data suggest an achromatic break,
which we interpret as a jet break. The post jet break slope obeys roughly the
closure relation for the jet slow cooling model. Because of the afterglow's
very red color, in order for the redshift to be low (z < 1), extinction, if
present in the host, must be significantly high. Since the optical-to-X-ray
index is consistent with the X-ray spectrum, and there is no XRT evidence for
excess N_H, GRB 050502B was likely at high redshift.
