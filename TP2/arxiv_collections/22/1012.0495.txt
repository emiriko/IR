When observing an extrasolar planetary system, the most luminous component
after the star itself is generally the light scattered and/or thermally emitted
by a population of micron-sized dust grains. These grains are expected to be
continuously replenished by the collisions and evaporation of larger bodies
just as in our solar zodiacal cloud. Exozodiacal clouds ("exozodis") must
therefore be seriously taken into account when attempting to directly image
faint Earth-like planets (exoEarths, for short). This paper summarizes the oral
contributions and discussions that took place during the Satellite Meeting on
exozodiacal dust disks, in an attempt to address the following two questions:
Do we need to solve the exozodi question? If yes, how to best solve it?
