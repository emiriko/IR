The vacuum stability bounds on flavour-violating trilinear soft terms are
revisited from the viewpoint that one should not ban a standard-model-like
false vacuum as long as it is long-lived on a cosmological timescale. The
vacuum transition rate is evaluated numerically by searching for the bounce
configuration. Like stability, a metastability bound does not decouple even if
sfermion masses grow. Apart from being more generous than stability, the new
bounds are largely independent of Yukawa couplings except for the stop
trilinears. With vacuum longevity imposed on otherwise arbitrary LR insertions,
it is found that a super flavour factory has the potential to probe sparticle
masses up to a few TeV through B and tau physics whereas the MEG experiment
might cover a far wider range. In the stop sector, metastability is more
restrictive than any existing experimental constraint such as from electroweak
precision data. Also discussed are dependency on other parameters and
reliability under radiative corrections.
