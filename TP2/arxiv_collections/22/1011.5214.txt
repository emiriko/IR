The Stellar Imager mission concept is a space-based UV/Optical interferometer
designed to resolve surface magnetic activity and subsurface structure and
flows of a population of Sun-like stars, in order to accelerate the development
and validation of a predictive dynamo model for the Sun and enable accurate
long-term forecasting of solar/stellar magnetic activity.
