A wide variety of coupled harmonic oscillators exist in nature1. Coupling
between different oscillators allows for the possibility of mutual energy
transfer between them2-4 and the information-signal propagation5,6. Low-energy
input signals and their transport with low-energy dissipation are the key
technical factors in the design of information processing devices7. Here,
utilizing the concept of coupled oscillators, we experimentally demonstrated a
robust new mechanism for energy transfer between spatially separated
dipolar-coupled magnetic disks - stimulated vortex gyration. Direct
experimental evidence was obtained by time-resolved soft X-ray microscopy. The
rate of energy transfer from one disk to the other was deduced from the two
normal modes' frequency splitting caused by dipolar interaction. This mechanism
provides the advantages of tunable energy transfer rate, low-power input
signal, and low-energy dissipation for magnetic elements with negligible
damping. Coupled vortex-state disks are promising candidates for
information-signal processing devices that operate above room temperature.
