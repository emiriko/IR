The relativistic four-quark equations are found in the framework of
coupled-channel formalism. The dynamical mixing of the meson-meson states with
the four-quark states is considered. The four-quark amplitudes of the negative
parity tetraquarks including the quarks of three flavors (u, d, s) and the
charmed quark are constructed. The poles of these amplitudes determine the
masses of tetraquarks. The mass values of low-lying tetraquarks with the
spin-parity JP=0-,1-,2-,3- are calculated.
