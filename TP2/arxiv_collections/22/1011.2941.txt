From photoelectric observations of night sky brightness carried out at
Abu-Simbel, Asaad et al. (1979) have obtained values of integrated starlight
brightness at different Galactic latitudes. These data have been used in the
present work to obtain the brightness and color of the integrated starlight at
North and South Celestial, Ecliptic and Galactic Poles. The present values of
the brightness are expressed in S10 units and mag/arcsec2. Our results have
been compared with that obtained by other investigators using photometric and
star counts techniques. The B-V and B-R have been calculated and the results
are compared with that obtained by other investigators.
