In addition to the `facular' brightening of active regions, the quiet Sun
also contains a small scale magnetic field with associated brightenings in
continuum radiation. We measure this contribution of quiet regions to the Sun's
brightness from high spatial resolution (0"16-0"32) observations of the Swedish
1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and Hinode satellite. The line-of-sight magnetic
field and continuum intensity near \ion{Fe}{i} 6302.5 \AA\ are used to quantify
the correlation between field strength and brightness. The data show that
magnetic flux density contains a significant amount of intrinsically weak
fields that contribute little to brightness. We show that with data of high
spatial resolution a calibration of magnetic flux density as a proxy for
brightness excess is possible. In the SST data, the magnetic brightening of a
quiet region with an average (unsigned) flux density of 10 G is about 0.15%. In
the Hinode data, and in SST data reduced to Hinode resolution, the measured
brightening is some 40% lower. With appropriate correction for resolution,
magnetic flux density can be used as a reliable proxy in regions of small scale
mixed polarity. The measured brightness effect is larger than the variation of
irradiance over a solar cycle. It is not clear, however, if this quiet Sun
contribution actually varies significantly. \keywords{Sun: surface magnetism --
