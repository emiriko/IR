Hiyama et al. [PRL 104 (2010) 212502] have recently reported on a pioneering
five-body alpha-alpha-n-Lambda-Lambda cluster-model calculation of
Lambda-Lambda-11Be in order to confront a possible interpretation of the
KEK-E373 HIDA event. Unfortunately, a six-body alpha-alpha-n-n-Lambda-Lambda
calculation of Lambda-Lambda-12Be to confront another possible interpretation
is beyond reach at present. Using experimental B-Lambda values with small
corrections based on recently determined Lambda-N spin-dependent interaction
parameters, we obtain binding-energy shell-model estimates for both
Lambda-Lambda hypernuclei, concluding that neither Lambda-Lambda-11Be nor
Lambda-Lambda-12Be provide satisfactory interpretation of the HIDA event. The
shell model approach is tested by reproducing the measured double-Lambda
binding energy of the double-Lambda hypernucleus Lambda-Lambda-13B.
