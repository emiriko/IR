We analyze a flux-limited sample of persistent and bright (with 2-10 keV
fluxes exceeding 1.4e-10 erg/s/cm2) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in our
Galaxy. It is demonstrated that the majority of binary systems with X-ray
luminosities below logL(erg/sec)~37.3 have unevolved secondary companions
(except for those with white dwarf donors), while systems with higher X-ray
luminosity predominantly harbor giant donors. Mass transfer in binary systems
with giants significantly shortens their life time thus steepening the X-ray
luminosity function of LMXBs at high luminosity. We argue that this is the
reason why the LMXB luminosity function constructed in the last years from
observations of sources in our and distant galaxies demonstrates a break at
logL(erg/sec)~37.3.
