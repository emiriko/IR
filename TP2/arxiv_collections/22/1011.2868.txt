Quantum secret sharing is one of the most important and interesting quantum
information processing task. In quantum secret sharing, information is split
among several parties such that only one of them is able to recover the qubit
exactly provided all the other parties agree to cooperate. To achieve this
task, all the parties need to share entangled state. As far as my knowledge,
all the previous quantum secret sharing protocol used either pure tripartite or
pure bipartite entangled state. In this work we use for the first time
bipartite two qubit mixed state (formed due to noisy environment) in quantum
secret sharing scheme. We further show that one party cannot extract the
information without the collaboration of other party. We also study the
property of the shared mixed state used in the quantum secret sharing scheme.
