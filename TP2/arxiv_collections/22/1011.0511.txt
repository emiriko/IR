We apply the supernova(SN) extinction curves to reproduce the observed
properties of SST J1604+4304 which is a young infrared (IR) galaxy at z = 1.
The SN extinction curves used in this work were obtained from models of unmixed
ejecta of type II supernovae(SNe II) for the Salpeter initial mass function
(IMF) with a mass range from 8 to 30 M_sun or 8 to 40 M_sun.
  The effect of dust distributions on the attenuation of starlight is
investigated by performing the chi-square fitting method against various dust
distributions. These are the commonly used uniform dust screen, the clumpy dust
screen, and the internal dust geometry. We add to these geometries three
scattering properties, namely, no-scattering, isotropic scattering, and
forward-only scattering. Judging from the chi-square values, we find that the
uniform screen models with any scattering property provide good approximations
to the real dust geometry. Internal dust is inefficient to attenuate starlight
and thus cannot be the dominant source of the extinction.
  We show that the SN extinction curves reproduce the data of SST J1604+4304
comparable to or better than the Calzetti extinction curve. The Milky Way
extinction curve is not in satisfactory agreement with the data unless several
dusty clumps are in the line of sight. This trend may be explained by the
abundance of SN-origin dust in these galaxies; SN dust is the most abundant in
the young IR galaxy at z = 1, abundant in local starbursts, and less abundant
in the Galaxy. If dust in SST J1604+4304 is dominated by SN dust, the dust
production rate is about 0.1 M_sun per SN.
