This note is a physics manual for a recent numerical implementation of
k_t-factorization with running-coupling BK unintegrated gluon distributions. We
also compile some results for Pb+Pb collisions at \sqrt{s} = 2.75 TeV, such as
predictions for the centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity
and transverse energy. The model can further be used to obtain initial
conditions for hydrodynamic simulations of A+A collisions at the LHC.
