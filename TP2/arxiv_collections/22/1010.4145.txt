The nonlinear properties of the dendrites in prepositus hypoglossi neurons
are involved in maintenance of eye position. The biophysical properties of
these neurons are essential for the operation of the vestibular neural
integrator that converts a head velocity signal to one that controls eye
position. A novel method named QSA (quadratic sinusoidal analysis) for voltage
clamped neurons was used to quantify nonlinear responses that are dominated by
dendrites. The voltage clamp currents were measured at harmonic and interactive
frequencies using specific stimulation frequencies, which act as frequency
probes of the intrinsic nonlinear neuronal behavior. These responses to paired
frequencies form a matrix that can be reduced by eigendecomposition to provide
a very compact piecewise quadratic analysis at different membrane potentials
that otherwise is usually described by complex differential equations involving
a large numbers of parameters and dendritic compartments. Moreover, the QSA
matrix can be interpolated to capture most of the nonlinear neuronal behavior
like a Volterra kernel. The interpolated quadratic functions of the two major
prepositus hypoglossi neurons, namely type B and D, are strikingly different. A
major part of the nonlinear responses is due to the persistent sodium
conductance, which appears to be essential for sustained nonlinear effects
induced by NMDA activation and thus would be critical for the operation of the
neural integrator. Finally, the dominance of the nonlinear responses by the
dendrites supports the hypothesis that persistent sodium conductance channels
and NMDA receptors act synergistically to dynamically control the influence of
individual synaptic inputs on network behavior.
