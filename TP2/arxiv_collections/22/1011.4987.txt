The inspiral and merger of a binary black hole system generally leads to an
asymmetric distribution of emitted radiation, and hence a recoil of the remnant
black hole directed opposite to the net linear momentum radiated. The recoil
velocity is generally largest for comparable mass black holes and particular
spin configurations, and approaches zero in the extreme mass ratio limit. It is
generally believed that for extreme mass ratios eta<<1, the scaling of the
recoil velocity is V {\propto} eta^2, where the proportionality coefficient
depends on the spin of the larger hole and the geometry of the system (e.g.
orbital inclination). Here we show that for low but nonzero inclination
prograde orbits and very rapidly spinning large holes (spin parameter
a*>0.9678) the inspiralling binary can pass through resonances where the
orbit-averaged radiation-reaction force is nonzero. These resonance crossings
lead to a new contribution to the kick, V {\propto} eta^{3/2}. For these
configurations and sufficiently extreme mass ratios, this resonant recoil is
dominant. While it seems doubtful that the resonant recoil will be
astrophysically significant, its existence suggests caution when extrapolating
the results of numerical kick results to extreme mass ratios and near-maximal
spins.
