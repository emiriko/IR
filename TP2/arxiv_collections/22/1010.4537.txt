Ultrathin magnetic films can be modeled as an anisotropic Heisenberg model
with long-range dipolar interactions. It is believed that the phase diagram
presents three phases: An ordered ferromagnetic phase I, a phase characterized
by a change from out-of-plane to in-plane in the magnetization II, and a
high-temperature paramagnetic phase III. It is claimed that the border lines
from phase I to III and II to III are of second order and from I to II is first
order. In the present work we have performed a very careful Monte Carlo
simulation of the model. Our results strongly support that the line separating
phases II and III is of the BKT type.
