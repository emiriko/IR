Streamer electrical discharges are often investigated with computer
simulations of density models (also called drift-diffusion-reaction models). We
review these models, detailing their physical foundations, their range of
validity and the most relevant numerical algorithms employed in solving them.
We focus particularly on schemes of adaptative refinement, used to resolve the
multiple length scales in a streamer discharge without a high computational
cost. We then report recent results from these models, emphasizing developments
that go beyond cylindrically symmetrical streamers propagating in homogeneous
media.
