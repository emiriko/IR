In this work we provide a systematic explanation to the unusual non-monotonic
behavior of the Hall resistance observed at two-dimensional electron systems.
We use a semi-analytical model based on the interaction theory of the integer
quantized Hall effect to investigate the existence of the anomalous, \emph{i.e}
overshoot, Hall resistance $R_{H}$. The observation of the overshoot resistance
at low magnetic field edge of the plateaus is elucidated by means of
overlapping evanescent incompressible strips, formed due to strong magnetic
fields and interactions. Utilizing a self-consistent numerical scheme we also
show that, if the magnetic field is decreased the $R_{H}$ decreases to its
expected value. The effects of the sample width, temperature, disorder strength
and magnetic field on the overshoot peaks are investigated in detail. Based on
our findings, we predict a controllable procedure to manipulate the maxima of
the peaks, which can be tested experimentally. Our model does not depend on
specific and intrinsic properties of the material, provided that a single
particle gap exists.
