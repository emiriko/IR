We generalize the binary quantum counting algorithm of Lesovik, Suslov, and
Blatter [Phys. Rev. A 82, 012316 (2010)] to higher counting bases. The
algorithm makes use of qubits, qutrits, and qudits to count numbers in a base
2, base 3, or base d representation. In operating the algorithm, the number n <
N = d^K is read into a K-qudit register through its interaction with a stream
of n particles passing in a nearby wire; this step corresponds to a quantum
Fourier transformation from the Hilbert space of particles to the Hilbert space
of qudit states. An inverse quantum Fourier transformation provides the number
n in the base d representation; the inverse transformation is fully quantum at
the level of individual qudits, while a simpler semi-classical version can be
used on the level of qudit registers. Combining registers of qubits, qutrits,
and qudits, where d is a prime number, with a simpler single-shot measurement
allows to find the powers of 2, 3, and other primes d in the number n. We show,
that the counting task naturally leads to the shift operation and an algorithm
based on the quantum Fourier transformation. We discuss possible
implementations of the algorithm using quantum spin-d systems, d-well systems,
and their emulation with spin-1/2 or double-well systems. We establish the
analogy between our counting algorithm and the phase estimation algorithm and
make use of the latter's performance analysis in stabilizing our scheme.
Applications embrace a quantum metrological scheme to measure a voltage (analog
to digital converter) and a simple procedure to entangle multi-particle states.
