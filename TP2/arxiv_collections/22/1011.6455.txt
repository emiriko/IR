Recent BES results on light scalars are reported in this talk, including the
observation of a charged kappa decaying to K pi0 with 5.8 * 10^7 J/psi data at
BES II and the direct measurements of a0(980)-f0(980) mixing in the processes
J/psi --> phi f0(980) --> phi a0(980) --> phi eta pi0 and chi_c1 --> pi0
a0(980) --> pi0 f0(980) --> pi0 pi+ pi- with 2.26 * 10^8 J/psi data and 1.06 *
10^8 psi' data at BES III.
