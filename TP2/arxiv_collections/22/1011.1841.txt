In this book we introduce a mathematically formalized concept of emotion,
robot's education and other psychological parameters of intelligent robots. We
also introduce unitless coefficients characterizing an emotional memory of a
robot. Besides, the effect of a robot's memory upon its emotional behavior is
studied, and theorems defining fellowship and conflicts in groups of robots are
proved. Also unitless parameters describing emotional states of those groups
are introduced, and a rule of making alternative (binary) decisions based on
emotional selection is given. We introduce a concept of equivalent educational
process for robots and a concept of efficiency coefficient of an educational
process, and suggest an algorithm of emotional contacts within a group of
robots. And generally, we present and describe a model of a virtual reality
with emotional robots. The book is meant for mathematical modeling specialists
and emotional robot software developers.
