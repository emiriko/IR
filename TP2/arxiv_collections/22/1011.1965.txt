We study the Holstein polaron in transverse magnetic field using
non-perturbational methods. At strong fields and large coupling, we show that
the polaron has a Hofstadter spectrum, however very distorted and of lower
symmetry than that of a (heavier) bare particle. For weak magnetic fields, we
identify non-perturbational behaviour of the Landau levels not previously
known.
