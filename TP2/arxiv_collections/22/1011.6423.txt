Heat capacity and susceptibility measurements have been performed on the
diluted spin dimer compound Ba3(Mn1-xVx)2O8. The parent compound Ba3Mn2O8 is a
spin dimer system based on pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1, 3d2
Mn5+ ions such that the zero field groundstate is a product of singlets.
Substitution of non-magnetic S = 0, 3d0 V5+ ions leads to an interacting
network of unpaired Mn moments, the low temperature properties of which are
explored in the limit of small concentrations, 0<x<0.05. The zero-field heat
capacity of this diluted system reveals a progressive removal of magnetic
entropy over an extended range of temperatures, with no evidence for a phase
transition. The concentration dependence does not conform to expectations for a
spin glass state. Rather, the data suggest a low temperature random singlet
phase, reflecting the hierarchy of exchange energies found in this system.
