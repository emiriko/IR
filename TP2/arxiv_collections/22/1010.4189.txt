For any operator $M$ acting on an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $H_N$ we
introduce its numerical shadow, which is a probability measure on the complex
plane supported by the numerical range of $M$. The shadow of $M$ at point $z$
is defined as the probability that the inner product $(Mu,u)$ is equal to $z$,
where $u$ stands for a random complex vector from $H_N$, satisfying $||u||=1$.
In the case of N=2 the numerical shadow of a non-normal operator can be
interpreted as a shadow of a hollow sphere projected on a plane. A similar
interpretation is provided also for higher dimensions. For a hermitian $M$ its
numerical shadow forms a probability distribution on the real axis which is
shown to be a one dimensional $B$-spline. In the case of a normal $M$ the
numerical shadow corresponds to a shadow of a transparent solid simplex in
$R^{N-1}$ onto the complex plane. Numerical shadow is found explicitly for
Jordan matrices $J_N$, direct sums of matrices and in all cases where the
shadow is rotation invariant. Results concerning the moments of shadow measures
play an important role. A general technique to study numerical shadow via the
Cartesian decomposition is described, and a link of the numerical shadow of an
operator to its higher-rank numerical range is emphasized.
