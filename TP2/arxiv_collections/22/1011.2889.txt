Galaxies are essential building blocks in the Universe. However they are
faint and complex X-ray sources and require high performance instrumentation to
be properly studied. Yet they are fundamental for our understanding of the
Universe, and a detailed knowledge of the local structures is mandatory to
explain the deep and far Universe. We make a few examples, and discuss how well
suited WFXT is to address this issue.
