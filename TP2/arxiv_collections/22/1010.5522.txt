The evolution of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and the quark Yukawa
couplings is performed for the one-loop renormalization group equations in the
universal extra dimension model. It is found that the evolution of mixing
angles and the CP violation measure J may rapidly vary in the presence of the
Kaluza-Klein modes, and this variation becomes dramatic as the energy
approaches the unification scale.
