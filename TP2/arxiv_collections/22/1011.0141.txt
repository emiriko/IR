In this paper we consider the classification of dispersive linearizable
partial difference equations defined on a quad-graph by the multiple scale
reduction around their harmonic solution. We show that the A_1, A_2 and A_3
linearizability conditions restrain the number of the parameters which enter
into the equation. A subclass of the equations which pass the A_3
C-integrability conditions can be linearized by a Mobius transformation.
