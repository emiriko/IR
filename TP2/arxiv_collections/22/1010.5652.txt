Based on the diffusion-halo model for cosmic-ray (CR) propagation, including
stochastic reacceleration due to collisions with hydromagnetic turbulence, we
study the behavior of the electron component and the diffuse $\gamma$-rays
(D$\gamma$'s) induced by them. The galactic parameters appearing in these
studies are essentially the same as those appearing in the hadronic CR
components, while we additionally need information on the interstellar
radiation field, taking into account dependences on both the photon energy,
$E_{\scriptsize {ph}}$, and the position, $\vct{r}$. We compare our numerical
results with the data on hadrons, electrons and D$\gamma$'s, including the most
recent results from FERMI, which gives two remarkable results; 1) the electron
spectrum falls with energy as $E_e^{-3}$ up to 1\,TeV, and does not exhibit
prominent spectral features around 500\,GeV, in contrast to the dramatic excess
appearing in both ATIC and PPB-BETS spectra, and 2) the EGRET GeV-excess in the
D$\gamma$ spectrum is due neither to an astronomical origin (much harder CR
spectrum in the galactic center) nor a cosmological one (dark matter
annihilation or decay), but due to an instrumental problem. In the present
paper, however, we focus our interest rather conservatively upon the internal
relation between these three components, using {\it common} galactic
parameters. We find that they are in reasonable harmony with each other within
both the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, apart from the
electron-anomaly problem, while some enhancement of D$\gamma$'s appears in the
high galactic latitude with $|b| > 60^\circ$ in the GeV region.
