This paper provides a full geometric development of a new technique called
un-reduction, for dealing with dynamics and optimal control problems posed on
spaces that are unwieldy for numerical implementation. The technique, which was
originally concieved for an application to image dynamics, uses Lagrangian
reduction by symmetry in reverse. A deeper understanding of un-reduction leads
to new developments in image matching which serve to illustrate the
mathematical power of the technique.
