When a planet falls onto the surface of its host star, the added
high-metallicity material does not remain in the surface layers, as often
assumed, but is diluted into the interior through fingering (thermohaline)
convection. Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens
remained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing
rates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and
semi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain
into the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall
drops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure
of the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from
about 1Gyr for a 1.3M_sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M_sun star). This result
offers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity
and convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars. More crucially, it strongly
suggests that the statistically-higher metallicity of planet-bearing stars must
be of primordial origin. Finally, the fingering region is found to extend
deeply into the star, a result which would provide a simple theoretical
explanation to the measurements of higher lithium depletion rates in
planet-bearing stars.
