This chapter derives the properties of light from the properties of
processing, including its ability to be both a wave and a particle, to respond
to objects it doesn't physically touch, to take all paths to a destination, to
choose a route after it arrives, and to spin both ways at once as it moves.
Here a photon is an entity program spreading as a processing wave of instances.
It becomes a "particle" if any part of it overloads the grid network that runs
it, causing the photon program to reboot and restart at a new node. The
"collapse of the wave function" is how quantum processing creates what we call
a physical photon. This informational approach gives insights into issues like
the law of least action, entanglement, superposition, counterfactuals, the
holographic principle and the measurement problem. The conceptual cost is that
physical reality is a quantum processing output, i.e. virtual.
