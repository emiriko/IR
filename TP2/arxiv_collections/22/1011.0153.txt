A search for 6 arcsec to 15 arcsec image separation lensing in the Jodrell
Bank-Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS) and the Cosmic Lens All-Sky
Survey (CLASS) by Phillips et al. found thirteen group and cluster
gravitational lens candidates. Through radio and optical imaging and
spectroscopy, Phillips et al. ruled out the lensing hypothesis for twelve of
the candidates. In this paper, new optical imaging and spectroscopy of
J0122+427, the final lens candidate from the JVAS/CLASS 6 arcsec to 15 arcsec
image separation lens search, are presented. This system is found not to be a
gravitational lens, but is just two radio-loud active galactic nuclei that are
separated by ~10 arcsec on the sky and are at different redshifts. Therefore,
it is concluded that there are no gravitational lenses in the JVAS and CLASS
surveys with image separations between 6 arcsec to 15 arcsec. This result is
consistent with the expectation that group- and cluster-scale dark matter
haloes are inefficient lenses due to their relatively flat inner density
profiles.
