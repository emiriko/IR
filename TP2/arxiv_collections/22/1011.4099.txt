In this work we consider a flat cosmological model with a set of fluids in
the framework of supersymmetric cosmology. The obtained supersymmetric algebra
allowed us to take quantum solutions. It is shown that only in the case of a
cosmological constant we have a condition between the density of dark energy
$\rho_\Lambda$ and density energy of matter $\rho_M$, $\rho_\Lambda > 2\rho_M$.
