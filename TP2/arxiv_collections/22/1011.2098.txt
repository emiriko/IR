Transformational optics allow for a markedly enhanced control of the
electromagnetic wave trajectories within metamaterials with interesting
applications ranging from perfect lenses to invisibility cloaks, carpets,
concentrators and rotators. Here, we present a review of curved anisotropic
heterogeneous meta-surfaces designed using the tool of transformational
plasmonics, in order to achieve a similar control for surface plasmon
polaritons in cylindrical and conical carpets, as well as cylindrical cloaks,
concentrators and rotators of a non-convex cross-section. Finally, we provide
an asymptotic form of the geometric potential for surface plasmon polaritons on
such surfaces in the limit of small curvature.
