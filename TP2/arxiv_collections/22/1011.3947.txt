The paper develops theory of covariant transform, which is inspired by the
wavelet construction. It was observed that many interesting types of wavelets
(or coherent states) arise from group representations which are not square
integrable or vacuum vectors which are not admissible. Covariant transform
extends an applicability of the popular wavelets construction to classic
examples like the Hardy space H_2, Banach spaces, covariant functional calculus
and many others.
