We investigate the wavelength dependent ionization, heating, and expansion
dynamics of medium-sized rare-gas clusters (Ar$_{923}$) under intense
femtosecond short-wavelength free electron laser pulses by quasi-classical
molecular dynamics simulations. A comparison of the interaction dynamics for
pulses with $\hbar\omega$=20, 38, and 90\,eV photon energy at fixed total
excitation energy indicates a smooth transition from plasma-driven cluster
expansion, where predominantly surface ions are expelled by hydrodynamic
forces, to quasi-electrostatic behavior with almost pure Coulomb explosion.
Corresponding signatures in the time-dependent cluster dynamics as well as in
the final ion and electron spectra support that this transition is linked to a
crossover in the electron emission processes. The resulting signatures in the
electron spectra are shown to be even more reliable for identifying the cluster
expansion mechanisms than ion energy spectra itself.
