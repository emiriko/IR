We investigate the representations of the exotic conformal Galilei algebra.
This is done by explicitly constructing all singular vectors within the Verma
modules, and then deducing irreducibility of the associated highest weight
quotient modules. A resulting classification of infinite dimensional
irreducible modules is presented.
