We have selected a sample of 30 normal (non-cD) early type galaxies, for all
of which optical spectroscopy is available, and which have been observed with
Chandra to a depth such to insure the detection of bright low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) with Lx>1e38 erg/s. This sample includes a larger fraction of
gas-poor galaxies than previously studied samples, and covers a wide range of
stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, GC specific frequency, and stellar
age. We derive X-ray luminosities (or upper limits) from the different
significant X-ray components of these galaxies: nuclei, detected and undetected
LMXBs, coronally active binaries (ABs), cataclysmic variables (CVs), and hot
gas. The ABs and CVs contribution is estimated from the Lx-LK scaling relation
of M31 and M32. The contribution of undetected LMXBs is estimated both by
fitting the spectra of the unresolved X-ray emission and by extrapolating the
LMXB X-ray luminosity function. The results for the nuclei are consistent with
those discussed by Pellegrini (2010). We derive a revised scaling relation
between the integrated X-ray luminosity of LMXBs in a galaxy and the LK
luminosity of the host galaxy: Lx(LMXB)/LK ~ 1e29 erg s-1 LK-1 with 50% 1sigma
rms; moreover, we also obtain a tighter LX(LMXB)/LK - SN relation than
previously published. We revisit the relations between hot gas content and
other galaxy parameters. finding a steeper LX(gas)-LK relation with larger
scatter than reported in the literature. We find a positive correlation between
the luminosity and temperature of the hot ISM, significantly tighter than
reported by earlier studies.[abridged]
