Nearly free electron (NFE) state has been widely studied in low dimensional
systems. Based on first-principles calculations, we identify two types of NFE
states in graphane nanoribbon superlattice, similar to those of graphene
nanoribbons and boron nitride nanoribbons. Effect of electron doping on the NFE
states in graphane nanoribbon superlattice has been studied, and it is possible
to open a vacuum transport channel via electron doping.
