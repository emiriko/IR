A complete parton level analysis of 2l2v2j and 4l2j, l = mu,e production at
the LHC is presented, including all processes at order alpha^6,
alpha^4*alpha_s^2. The infinite Higgs mass scenario, which is considered as a
benchmark for strong scattering theories and is the limiting case for composite
Higgs models, and one example of Strongly Interacting Light Higgs models are
confronted with the Standard Model light Higgs predictions. This analysis is
combined with the results in the lv4j, the ll4j and the 3lv2j channels
presented in previous papers, in order to determine whether these alternative
Higgs frameworks can be detected as an excess of events in boson--boson
scattering.
