The paper is concerned with a system consisting of two coupled nonlinear
parabolic equations with a cross-diffusion term, where the solutions at
positive times define the initial states. The equations arise as steady state
equations of an age-structured predator-prey system with spatial dispersion.
Based on unilateral global bifurcation methods for Fredholm operators and on
maximal regularity for parabolic equations, global bifurcation of positive
solutions is derived.
