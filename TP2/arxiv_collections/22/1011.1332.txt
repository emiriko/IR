A graph is said to be a segment graph if its vertices can be mapped to line
segments in the plane such that two vertices have an edge between them if and
only if their corresponding line segments intersect. Kratochv\'{i}l and
Kub\v{e}na [``On intersection representations of co-planar graphs'', Discrete
Mathematics, 178(1-3):251-255, 1998] asked the question of whether the
complements of planar graphs are segment graphs. We show here that the
complements of all partial 2-trees are segment graphs.
