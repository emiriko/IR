In this note we discuss a couple of technical issues relevant to solving the
Dyson-Schwinger equation for the gluon propagator in Landau gauge Yang-Mills
theory. In the deep infrared functional methods extract a one-parameter family
of solutions generically showing a massive behavior referred to as 'decoupling'
but also including the so-called 'scaling' solution with a conformal infrared
behavior as a limiting case. We emphasize that the latter cannot be ruled out
by technical arguments related to the removal of quadratic divergencies and
transversality.
