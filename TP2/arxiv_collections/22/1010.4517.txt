Learning and decision making in the brain are key processes critical to
survival, and yet are processes implemented by non-ideal biological building
blocks which can impose significant error. We explore quantitatively how the
brain might cope with this inherent source of error by taking advantage of two
ubiquitous mechanisms, redundancy and synchronization. In particular we
consider a neural process whose goal is to learn a decision function by
implementing a nonlinear gradient dynamics. The dynamics, however, are assumed
to be corrupted by perturbations modeling the error which might be incurred due
to limitations of the biology, intrinsic neuronal noise, and imperfect
measurements. We show that error, and the associated uncertainty surrounding a
learned solution, can be controlled in large part by trading off
synchronization strength among multiple redundant neural systems against the
noise amplitude. The impact of the coupling between such redundant systems is
quantified by the spectrum of the network Laplacian, and we discuss the role of
network topology in synchronization and in reducing the effect of noise. A
range of situations in which the mechanisms we model arise in brain science are
discussed, and we draw attention to experimental evidence suggesting that
cortical circuits capable of implementing the computations of interest here can
be found on several scales. Finally, simulations comparing theoretical bounds
to the relevant empirical quantities show that the theoretical estimates we
derive can be tight.
