The dynamic properties and independence structure of stochastic kinetic
models (SKMs) are analyzed. An SKM is a highly multivariate jump process used
to model chemical reaction networks, particularly those in biochemical and
cellular systems. We identify SKM subprocesses with the corresponding counting
processes and propose a directed, cyclic graph (the kinetic independence graph
or KIG) that encodes the local independence structure of their conditional
intensities. Given a partition $[A,D,B]$ of the vertices, the graphical
separation $A\perp B|D$ in the undirected KIG has an intuitive chemical
interpretation and implies that $A$ is locally independent of $B$ given $A\cup
D$. It is proved that this separation also results in global independence of
the internal histories of $A$ and $B$ conditional on a history of the jumps in
$D$ which, under conditions we derive, corresponds to the internal history of
$D$. The results enable mathematical definition of a modularization of an SKM
using its implied dynamics. Graphical decomposition methods are developed for
the identification and efficient computation of nested modularizations.
Application to an SKM of the red blood cell advances understanding of this
biochemical system.
