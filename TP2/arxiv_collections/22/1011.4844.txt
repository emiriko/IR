We show that the Weyl structure of an almost-Hermitian Weyl manifold of
dimension at least 6 is trivial if the associated curvature operator satisfies
the Kaehler identity. Similarly if the curvature of an almost para-Hermitian
Weyl manifold of dimension at least 6 satisfies the para-Kaehler identity, then
the Weyl structure is trivial as well.
