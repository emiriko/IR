We present a short overview of recent work on the topic of flavour violation
in the presence of a sequential fourth generation (4G) of quarks and leptons.
We discuss the implications of this simple extension of the Standard Model
(SM3) for rare decays and CP violating observables. The observables of interest
were chosen with the start of the LHC, the approval of SuperBelle and the
upcoming NA62 experiment in mind. A special emphasis is placed on the
importance of epsilon-prime/epsilon as a constraint for this model.
