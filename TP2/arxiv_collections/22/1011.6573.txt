Progress in calculating the spectrum of excited baryons and mesons in lattice
QCD is described. Correlation matrices of sets of spatially-extended hadron
operators have been studied and their effectiveness in facilitating the
extraction of excited-state energies is demonstrated. First applications of the
stochastic LapH method, a new method of estimating the low-lying effects of
quark propagation, are presented.
