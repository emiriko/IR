We prove that the spatial coagulation equation with bounded coagulation rate
is well-posed for all times in a given class of kernels if the convection term
of the underlying particle dynamics has divergence bounded below by a positive
constant. Multiple coagulations, fragmentation and scattering are also
considered.
