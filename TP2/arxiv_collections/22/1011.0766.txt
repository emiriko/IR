We develop some techniques for studying various versions of the function
space BMO. Special cases of one of our results give alternative proofs of the
celebrated John- Nirenberg inequality and of related inequalities due to John
and to Wik. Our approach enables us to pose a simply formulated "geometric"
question, for which an affirmative answer would lead to a version of the
John-Nirenberg inequality with dimension free constants. A more detailed
summary of the main ideas and results of this paper can be found at
