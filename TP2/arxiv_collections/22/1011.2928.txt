We present a novel method to study the dynamics of bulk fermion systems such
as the neutron-star crust. By introducing periodic boundary conditions into
Fermionic Molecular Dynamics, it becomes possible to examine the long-range
many-body correlations induced by antisymmetrisation in bulk fermion systems.
The presented technique treats the spins and the fermionic nature of the
nucleons explicitly and permits investigating the dynamics of the system.
Despite the increased complexity related to the periodic boundary conditions,
the proposed formalism remains computationally feasible.
