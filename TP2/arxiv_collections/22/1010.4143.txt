We investigate the non-equilibrium behavior of the spin-ice material
Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by studying its magnetization as a function of the rate at
which an external field is swept. At temperatures below the enigmatic
"freezing" temperature $T_{\rm equil}\approx600$ mK, we find that even the
slowest sweeps fail to yield the equilibrium magnetization curve and instead
give a smooth, initially much flatter curve. For higher sweep rates, the
magnetization develops sharp steps accompanied by similarly sharp peaks in the
temperature of the sample. We ascribe the former behavior to the energy
barriers encountered in the magnetization process, which proceeds via flipping
of spins on filaments traced out by the field-driven motion of the gapped,
long-range interacting magnetic monopole excitations. In contrast, the peaks in
temperature result from the released Zeeman energy not being carried away
efficiently into the bath, with the resulting heating triggering a chain
reaction.
