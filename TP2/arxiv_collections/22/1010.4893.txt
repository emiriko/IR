A collaborative framework for detecting the different sources in mixed
signals is presented in this paper. The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a
convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First,
we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of
sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of
possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by
efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard
sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are
identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the
coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the
temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of
samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual
samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration
is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in
particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the
sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of
C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the
sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each
individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument
identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use
sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic
sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number
of sources on a recording.
