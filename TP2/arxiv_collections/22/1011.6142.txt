We propose that the observed cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is
due to enhanced neutrino emission from the recent onset of the breaking and
formation of neutron Cooper pairs in the 3P2 channel. We find that the critical
temperature for this superfluid transition is ~0.5x10^9 K. The observed
rapidity of the cooling implies that protons were already in a superconducting
state with a larger critical temperature. Our prediction that this cooling will
continue for several decades at the present rate can be tested by continuous
monitoring of this neutron star.
