We use Jones-Wenzl idempotents to construct bases for the relative Kauffman
bracket skein module of a square with n points colored 1 and one point colored
h. We consider a natural bilinear form on this skein module. We calculate the
determinant of the matrix for this form with respect to the natural basis. We
reduce the computation to count some steps in generalized Dyck paths. Moreover,
we relate our determinant to a determinant on semi-meanders.
