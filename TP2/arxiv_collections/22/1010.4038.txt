I study the mutual information between spatial subsystems in a variety of
scale invariant quantum field theories. While it is derived from the bare
entanglement entropy, the mutual information offers a more refined probe of the
entanglement structure of quantum field theories because it remains finite in
the continuum limit. I argue that the mutual information has certain universal
singularities that are a manifestation of the idea of "entanglement per scale".
Moreover, I propose a method, based on an ansatz for higher dimensional twist
operators, to compute the entanglement entropy, Renyi entropy, and mutual
information in a general quantum field theory. The relevance of these results
to the search for renormalization group monotones, to holographic duality, and
to entanglement based simulation methods for many body systems are all
discussed.
