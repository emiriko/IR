We find that the majority of systems hosting multiple tidal disruptions are
likely to contain hard binary SMBH systems, and also show that the rates of
these repeated events are high enough to be detected by LSST over its lifetime.
Therefore, these multiple tidal disruption events provide a novel method to
identify super-massive black hole (SMBH) binary systems with parsec to
sub-parsec separations. The rates of tidal disruptions are investigated using
simulations of non-interacting stars initially orbiting a primary SMBH and the
potential of the model stellar cusp. The stars are then evolved forward in time
and perturbed by a secondary SMBH inspiraling from the edge of the cusp to its
stalling radius. We find with conservative magnitude estimates that the next
generation transient survey LSST should detect multiple tidal disruptions in
approximately 3 galaxies over 5 years of observation, though less conservative
estimates could increase this rate by an order of magnitude.
