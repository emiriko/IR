The surface quantum Hall state, magneto-electric phenomena and their
connection to axion electrodynamics have been studied intensively for
topological insulators. One of the obstacles for observing such effects comes
from nonzero conductivity of the bulk. To overcome this obstacle we propose to
use an external magnetic field to suppress the conductivity of the bulk
carriers. The magnetic field dependence of galvanomagnetic and electromagnetic
responses of the whole system shows anomalies due to broken time-reversal
symmetry of the surface quantum Hall state, which can be used for its
detection. In particular, we find linear bulk dc magnetoresistivity and a
quadratic field dependence of the Hall angle, shifted rf cyclotron resonance,
nonanalytic microwave transmission coefficient and saturation of the Faraday
rotation angle with increasing magnetic field or wave frequency.
