Two new approaches to the infinitesimal characterisation of quantum
stochastic cocycles are reviewed. The first concerns mapping cocycles on an
operator space and demonstrates the role of H\"older continuity; the second
concerns contraction operator cocycles on a Hilbert space and shows how
holomorphic assumptions yield cocycles enjoying an infinitesimal
characterisation which goes beyond the scope of quantum stochastic differential
equations.
