Superconducting single crystals of pure FeTe1 xSex and FeTe0.65Se0.35 doped
with Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn, Mo, Cd, In, Pb, Hg, V, Ga, Mg, Al, Ti, Cr, Sr or Nd
into Fe ions site have been grown applying Bridgman's method. It has been found
that the sharpness of transition to the superconducting state in FeTe1 xSex is
evidently inversely correlated with crystallographic quality of the crystals.
Among all of the studied dopants only Co, Ni and Cu substitute Fe ions in
FeTe0.65Se0.35 crystals. The remaining examined ions do not incorporate into
the crystal structure. Nevertheless, they form inclusions together with
selenium, tellurium and/or iron, what changes the chemical composition of host
matrix and therefore influences Tc value. Small disorder introduced into
magnetic sublattice, by partial replacement of Fe ions by slight amount of
nonmagnetic ions of Cu (~ 1.5 at%) or by magnetic ions of Ni (~ 2 at%) and Co
(~5 at%) with spin value different than that of Fe ion, completely suppresses
superconductivity in FeTe1 xSex system. This indicates that even if
superconductivity is observed in the system containing magnetic ions it can not
survive when the disorder in magnetic ions sublattice is introduced, most
likely because of magnetic scattering of Cooper pairs.
