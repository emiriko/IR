The real physical space is derived from a mathematical space constructed as a
tessellation lattice of primary balls, or superparticles. Mathematical
characteristics, such as distance, surface and volume, generate in the fractal
tessellation lattice the basic physical notions (mass, particle, the particle's
de Broglie wavelength and so on) and the corresponding fundamental physical
laws. The submicroscopic mechanics developed in the tessellattice easily
results in the conventional quantum mechanical formalism at a larger atomic
scale and Newton's gravitational law at a macroscopic scale.
