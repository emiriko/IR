The associated production of a Higgs boson with a b quark is a discovery mode
for an MSSM Higgs boson at large tan beta. We present updates on the production
rate at the LHC, along with a discussion of the importance of the SQCD
corrections from squark and gluino loops. We also discuss the purely
electroweak contributions.
