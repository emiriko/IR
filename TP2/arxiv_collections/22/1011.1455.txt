The integer hull of a polyhedron is the convex hull of the integer points
contained in it. We show that the vertices of the integer hulls of a rational
family of polyhedra of size O(n) have quasipolynomial coordinates. As a
corollary, we show that the stable commutator length of elements in a surgery
family is a ratio of quasipolynomials, and that unit balls in the scl norm
quasi-converge in finite dimensional surgery families.
