Examination of ambient thermodynamic conditions suggest that clathrate
hydrates could exist in the martian permafrost, on the surface and in the
interior of Titan, as well as in other icy satellites. Clathrate hydrates
probably formed in a significant fraction of planetesimals in the solar system.
Thus, these crystalline solids may have been accreted in comets, in the forming
giant planets and in their surrounding satellite systems. In this work, we use
a statistical thermodynamic model to investigate the composition of clathrate
hydrates that may have formed in the primordial nebula. In our approach, we
consider the formation sequence of the different ices occurring during the
cooling of the nebula, a reasonable idealization of the process by which
volatiles are trapped in planetesimals. We then determine the fractional
occupancies of guests in each clathrate hydrate formed at given temperature.
The major ingredient of our model is the description of the guest-clathrate
hydrate interaction by a spherically averaged Kihara potential with a nominal
set of parameters, most of which being fitted on experimental equilibrium data.
Our model allows us to find that Kr, Ar and N$_2$ can be efficiently encaged in
clathrate hydrates formed at temperatures higher than $\sim$ 48.5 K in the
primitive nebula, instead of forming pure condensates below 30 K. However, we
find at the same time that the determination of the relative abundances of
guest species incorporated in these clathrate hydrates strongly depends on the
choice of the parameters of the Kihara potential and also on the adopted size
of cages. Indeed, testing different potential parameters, we have noted that
even minor dispersions between the different existing sets can lead to
non-negligible variations in the determination of the volatiles trapped in
clathrate hydrates formed in the primordial nebula.
