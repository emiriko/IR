We propose a new scheme for observing Josephson oscillations and macroscopic
quantum self-trapping phenomena in a toroidally confined Bose-Einstein
condensate: a dipolar self-induced Josephson junction. Polarizing the atoms
perpendicularly to the trap symmetry axis, an effective ring-shaped,
double-well potential is achieved which is induced by the dipolar interaction.
By numerically solving the three-dimensional time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation we show that coherent tunneling phenomena such as Josephson
oscillations and quantum self-trapping can take place. The dynamics in the
self-induced junction can be qualitatively described by a two-mode model taking
into account both s-wave and dipolar interactions.
