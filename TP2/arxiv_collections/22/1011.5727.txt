We develop superspace techniques to construct general off-shell N=1,2,3,4
superconformal sigma-models in three space-time dimensions. The most general
N=3 and N=4 superconformal sigma-models are constructed in terms of N=2 chiral
superfields. Several superspace proofs of the folklore statement that N=3
supersymmetry implies N=4 are presented both in the on-shell and off-shell
settings. We also elaborate on (super)twistor realisations for (super)manifolds
on which the three-dimensional N-extended superconformal groups act
transitively and which include Minkowski space as a subspace.
