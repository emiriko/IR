The conductance of systems containing two tunnel point-contacts and a single
subsurface scatterer is investigated theoretically. The problem is solved in
the approximation of s-wave scattering giving analytical expressions for the
wave functions and for the conductance of the system. Conductance oscillations
resulting from the interference of electron waves passing through different
contacts and their interference with the waves scattered by the defect are
analyzed. The prospect for determining the depth of the impurity below the
metal surface by using the dependence of the conductance as a function of the
distance between the contacts is discussed. It is shown that the application of
an external magnetic field results in Aharonov-Bohm type oscillations in the
conductance, the period of which allows detection of the depth of the defect in
a double tip STM experiment.
