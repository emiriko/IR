We study cascade hierarchy in supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory. The
neutrino Dirac mass matrix of the cascade form can lead to the tri-bimaximal
generation mixing at the leading order in the seesaw mechanism while the down
quark mass matrix of a hybrid cascade form naturally gives the CKM structure.
We embed such experimentally favored mass textures into supersymmetric SU(5)
GUT, which gives a relation between the down quark and charged lepton mass
matrices. Related phenomenologies, such as lepton flavor violating processes
and leptogenesis, are also investigated in addition to lepton mixing angles.
