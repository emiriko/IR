In this video, we present the dynamics of an array of falling particles at
intermediate Reynolds numbers. The film shows the vorticity plots of 3, 4, 7,
16 falling particles at $Re = 200$. We highlight the effect of parity on the
falling configuration of the array. In steady state, an initially uniformly
spaced array forms a convex shape when $n=3$, i.e the middle particle leads,
but forms a concave shape when $n = 4$. For larger odd numbers of particles,
the final state consists of a mixture of concave and convex shapes. For larger
even numbers of particles, the steady state remains a concave shape. Below a
threshold of initial particle spacing, particles cluster in groups of 2 to 3.
