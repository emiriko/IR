The interaction of electrical fields and liquids can lead to phenomena that
defies intuition. Some famous examples can be found in Electrohydrodynamics as
Taylor cones, whipping jets or non-coalescing drops. A less famous example is
the Floating Water Bridge: a slender thread of water held between two glass
beakers in which a high voltage difference is applied. Surprisingly, the water
bridge defies gravity even when the beakers are separated at distances up to 2
cm. In the presentation, experimental measurements and simple models are
proposed and discussed for the stability of the bridge and the source of the
flow, revealing an important role of polarization forces on the stability of
the water bridge. On the other hand, the observed flow can only be explained
due to the non negligible free charge present in the surface. In this sense,
the Floating Water Bridge can be considered as an extreme case of a leaky
dielectric liquid (J. R. Melcher and G. I. Taylor, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.,
1:111, 1969).
