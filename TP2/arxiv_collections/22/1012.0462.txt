We first derive an integrable deformed hierarchy of short pulse equation and
their Lax representation. Then we concentrated on the solution of integrable
deformed short pulse equation (IDSPE). By proposing a generalized reciprocal
transformation, we find a new integrable deformed sine-Gordon equation (IDSGE)
and its Lax representation. The multisoliton solutions, negaton solutions and
positon solutions for the IDSGE and the N-loop soliton solutions, N-negaton and
N-positon solutions for the IDSPE are presented. In the reduced case the new
N-positon solutions and N-negaton solutions for short pulse equation are
obtained.
