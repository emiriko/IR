Loveland complexity is a variant of Kolmogorov complexity, where it is asked
to output separately the bits of the desired string, instead of the string
itself. Similarly to the resource-bounded Kolmogorov sets we define Loveland
sets. We highlight a structural connection between resource-bounded Loveland
sets and some advice complexity classes. This structural connection enables us
to map to advice complexity classes some properties of Kolmogorov sets first
noticed by Hartmanis and thoroughly investigated in Longpr\'e's thesis: 1.
Non-inclusion properties of Loveland sets result in hierarchy properties on the
corresponding advice complexity classes; 2. Immunity properties of Loveland
sets result in the non-existence of natural proofs between the corresponding
advice complexity classes, in the sense of Razborov & Rudich.
