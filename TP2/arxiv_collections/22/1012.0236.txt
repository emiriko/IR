As can be inferred from present experiments in ultracold gases, the
scattering length is a quantity that determines the thermodynamic state of the
gas. As such, there exists a conjugate thermodynamic to it. Here, we show that
the recently introduced "contact" is the conjugate of the inverse of the
scattering length. We find that this identification allows for a derivation of
essentially all the known results regarding the contact. Using the mean-field
theory for the Bose-Einstein (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schriefer (BCS) crossover,
we also find that the contact is proportional to the square of the gap. We
analyze in detail both a homogenous balanced mixture of fermions and its
inhomogenous counterpart in a harmonic trap.
