Peer-to-peer systems have gained a lot of attention as information sharing
systems for the widespread exchange of resources and voluminous information
that is easily accessible among thousands of users. However, current
peer-to-peer information sharing systems work mostly on wired networks. With
the growing number of communication-equipped mobile devices that can
self-organize into infrastructure-less communication platform, namely mobile ad
hoc networks (MANETs), peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs becomes a
promising research area. In this paper, we propose a Region-Based structure
that enables efficient and secure peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs.
The implementation shows that the proposed scheme is Secure, scalable,
efficient, and adaptive to node mobility and provides Reliable information
sharing.
