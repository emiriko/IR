In the left-right symmetric models, we can take the left-right symmetry to be
the charge-conjugation and then impose a global symmetry under which the left-
and right-handed fermion doublets carry equal but opposite charges.
Consequently, we may introduce two Higgs bi-doublets to give the desired
fermion mass spectrum. The global symmetry is identified to a Peccei-Quinn
symmetry. We can introduce a complex scalar singlet to break the global
Peccei-Quinn symmetry at a high scale. This symmetry breaking is also
responsible for generating the heavy Majorana masses of the fermion singlets
which have Yukawa couplings with the lepton and Higgs doublets. In this
context, we can realize the double and linear seesaw to naturally explain the
small neutrino masses. Our scenario can be embedded in the SO(10) grand
unification theories.
