We present a model based on the A4 non-abelian discrete symmetry leading to a
predictive five-parameter neutrino mass matrix and providing a stable dark
matter candidate. We found an interesting correlation among the atmospheric and
the reactor angles which predicts theta_23 ~ pi/4 for very small reactor angle
and deviation from maximal atmospheric mixing for large theta_13. Only normal
neutrino mass spectrum is possible and the effective mass entering the
neutrinoless double beta decay rate is constrained to be |m_ee| > 4 10^{-4} eV.
