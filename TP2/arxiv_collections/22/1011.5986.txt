Set-valued risk measures on $L^p_d$ with $0 \leq p \leq \infty$ for conical
market models are defined, primal and dual representation results are given.
The collection of initial endowments which allow to super-hedge a multivariate
claim are shown to form the values of a set-valued sublinear (coherent) risk
measure. Scalar risk measures with multiple eligible assets also turn out to be
a special case within the set-valued framework.
