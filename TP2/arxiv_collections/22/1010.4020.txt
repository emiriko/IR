In a previous paper (arXiv:1008.3661v1[quant-ph] 21 Aug 2010), we have given
a purely logical proof of the Conway and Kochen Free Will theorem in QM: the
freedom of the observer implies the freedom of the observed particle. Here we
show that the hypothesis of the observer's freedom is not necessary: the
assumption of the (informal) consistency (non contradiction) of QM implies its
non-determinism relative to physical events (the freedom of observed
particles).
