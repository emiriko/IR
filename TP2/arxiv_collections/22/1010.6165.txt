Sampling and reconstruction of functions is a central tool in science. A key
result is given by the sampling theorem for bandlimited functions attributed to
Whittaker, Shannon, Nyquist, and Kotelnikov. We develop an analogous sampling
theory for operators which we call bandlimited if their Kohn-Nirenberg symbols
are bandlimited. We prove sampling theorems for such operators and show that
they are extensions of the classical sampling theorem.
