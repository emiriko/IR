In this paper, we describe a reliable symbolic computational algorithm for
inverting general cyclic heptadiagonal matrices by using parallel computing
along with recursion. The algorithm is implementable to the Computer Algebra
System(CAS) such as MAPLE, Matlab and Mathematica . An example is presented for
the sake of illustration.
