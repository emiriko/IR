The aim of this study is to make a bibliometric comparison of the performance
of research astronomers in the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA)
with astronomers elsewhere by using the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). We
use various indices for bibliometric performance for a sample of NOVA
astronomers to compare to samples of astronomers worldwide, and from the United
States. We give much weight to normalising bibliometric measures by number of
authors, and number of years since first publication. In particular we
calculate the `Hirsh-index' normalized to number of authors and for
first-author papers. Secondly, we consider the results of the 'Nederlands
Observatorium van Wetenschap en Technologie' (NOWT; Netherlands Observatory of
Science and Technology), which regularly publishes a report 'Science and
Technology Indicators'. We reproduce those results using publication lists from
institutions in the Netherlands, again using ADS, and examine and discuss the
conclusions and indications in these reports. We find that the NOVA researchers
perform much better in bibliometric measures than samples drawn from IAU or AAS
membership lists. A more suitable comparison is one with the (tenured) staff of
the top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects
as good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation
analysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch
astronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by
NOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy
and physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more
citations in conference proceedings, while the inclusion of citations to
articles with their pre-print identifier could also help explain the difference
(especially since the citation windows in the reports are short).
