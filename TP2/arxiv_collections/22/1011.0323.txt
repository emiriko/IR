We define zeta-functions of weight lattices of compact connected semisimple
Lie groups. If the group is simply-connected, these zeta-functions coincide
with ordinary zeta-functions of root systems of associated Lie algebras. In
this paper we consider the general connected (but not necessarily
simply-connected) case, prove the explicit form of Witten's volume formulas for
these zeta-functions, and further prove functional relations among them which
include their volume formulas.
