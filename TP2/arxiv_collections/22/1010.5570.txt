We investigate how contracts can be used to regulate the interaction between
processes. To do that, we study a variant of the concurrent constraints
calculus presented in [1], featuring primitives for multi-party synchronization
via contracts. We proceed in two directions. First, we exploit our primitives
to model some contract-based interactions. Then, we discuss how several models
for concurrency can be expressed through our primitives. In particular, we
encode the pi-calculus and graph rewriting.
