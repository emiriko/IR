We pointed out that the main claim of Ref.[1] that the presence of the
orbital degree of freedom is essential to describe the correct impurity effects
for Iron-based superconductors is incorrect and demonstrated the equivalent
results of Tc suppression due to impurities by both the band basis model and
the orbital basis model.
