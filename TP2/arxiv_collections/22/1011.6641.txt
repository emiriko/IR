It is shown that the flow diagrams for the conductivities in the quantum Hall
effect, arising from two ostensibly very different proposals based on modular
symmetry, are in fact identical. The beta-functions are different, the rate at
which the flow lines are traversed are different, but the tangents to the flow
lines are the same in both cases, hence the flow diagrams are same in all
aspects.
