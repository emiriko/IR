We give a purely algebro-geometric proof that if the alpha-invariant of a
Q-Fano variety X is greater than dim X/(dim X+1), then (X,O(-K_X)) is K-stable.
The key of our proof is a relation among the Seshadri constants, the
alpha-invariant and K-stability. It also gives applications concerning the
automorphism group.
