We identified 24 SiIV absorption systems with z <~ 1 from a blind survey of
49 low-redshift quasars with archival Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet
spectra. We relied solely on the characteristic wavelength separation of the
doublet to automatically detect candidates. After visual inspection, we defined
a sample of 20 definite (group G = 1) and 4 "highly-likely" (G = 2) doublets
with rest equivalent widths W_r for both lines detected at > 3 sigma. The
absorber line density of the G = 1 doublets was dN_SiIV/dX = 1.4+0.4/-0.3 for
log N(Si+3) > 12.9. The best-fit power law to the G = 1 frequency distribution
of column densities f(N(Si+3)) had normalization k = (1.2+0.5/-0.4) x 10^-14
cm2 and slope alpha = -1.6+0.3/-0.3. Using the power-law model of f(N(Si+3)),
we measured the Si+3 mass density relative to the critical density: Omega(Si+3)
= (3.7+2.8/-1.7) x 10^-8 for 13 < log N(Si+3) < 15. From Monte Carlo sampling
of the distributions, we estimated our value to be a factor of 4.8+3.0/-1.9
higher than the 2 < z < 4.5 <Omega(Si+3)>. From a simple linear fit to
Omega(Si+3) over the age of the Universe, we estimated a slow and steady
increase from z = 5.5 --> 0 with dOmega/dt_age = (0.61+/-0.23) x 10^-8 Gyr^-1.
We compared our ionic ratios N(Si+3)/N(C+3) to a 2 < z < 4.5 sample and
concluded, from survival analysis, that the two populations are similar, with
median <N(Si+3)/N(C+3)> = 0.16.
