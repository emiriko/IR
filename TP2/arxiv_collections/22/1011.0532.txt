We study a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation driven by a
stable L\'evy process of order $\alpha$ with drift and diffusion coefficients
$b,\sigma$. When $\alpha\in (1,2)$, we investigate pathwise uniqueness for this
equation. When $\alpha\in (0,1)$, we study another stochastic differential
equation, which is equivalent in law, but for which pathwise uniqueness holds
under much weaker conditions. We obtain various results, depending on whether
$\alpha\in (0,1)$ or $\alpha \in (1,2)$ and on whether the driving stable
process is symmetric or not. Our assumptions involve the regularity and
monotonicity of $b$ and $\sigma$.
