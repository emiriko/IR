Non-Markovian processes can often be turned Markovian by enlarging the set of
variables. Here we show, by an explicit construction, how this can be done for
the dynamics of a Brownian particle obeying the generalized Langevin equation.
Given an arbitrary bath spectral density $J_{0}$, we introduce an orthogonal
transformation of the bath variables into effective modes, leading stepwise to
a semi-infinite chain with nearest-neighbor interactions. The transformation is
uniquely determined by $J_{0}$ and defines a sequence
$\{J_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ of residual spectral densities describing the
interaction of the terminal chain mode, at each step, with the remaining bath.
We derive a simple, one-term recurrence relation for this sequence, and show
that its limit is the quasi-Ohmic expression provided by the Rubin model of
dissipation. Numerical calculations show that, irrespective of the details of
$J_{0}$, convergence is fast enough to be useful in practice for an effective
Markovian reduction of quantum dissipative dynamics.
