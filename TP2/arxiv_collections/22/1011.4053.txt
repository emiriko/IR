The Solar Spectroscopy Explorer (SSE) concept is conceived as a scalable
mission, with two to four instruments and a strong focus on coronal
spectroscopy. In its core configuration it is a small strategic mission
($250-500M) built around a microcalorimeter (an imaging X-ray spectrometer) and
a high spatial resolution (0.2 arcsec) EUV imager. SSE puts a strong focus on
the plasma spectroscopy, balanced with high resolution imaging - providing for
break-through imaging science as well as providing the necessary context for
the spectroscopy suite. Even in its smallest configuration SSE provides
observatory class science, with significant science contributions ranging from
basic plasma and radiative processes to the onset of space weather events. The
basic configuration can carry an expanded instrument suite with the addition of
a hard X-ray imaging spectrometer and/or a high spectral resolution EUV
instrument - significantly expanding the science capabilities. In this
configuration, it will fall at the small end of the medium class missions, and
is described below as SSE+. This scalable mission in its largest configuration
would have the full complement of these instruments and becomes the RAM
(Reconnection And Microscale) mission. This mission has been designed to
address key outstanding issues in coronal physics, and to be highly
complementary to missions such as Solar Probe Plus, Solar Orbiter, and Solar-C
as well as ground-based observatories.
