It is shown that when the initial particles probability density is
discontinuous the emerging currents appear instantaneously, and although the
density beyond the discontinuity is initially negligible the currents there
have a finite value. It is shown that this non-equilibrium effect can be
measured in real experiments (such as cooled Rubidium atoms), where the
discontinuity is replaced with finite width (hundreds of nanometers) gradient.
