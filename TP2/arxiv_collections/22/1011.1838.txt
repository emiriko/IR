We present an ab-initio based kinetic Monte Carlo model for ionic
conductivity in single crystal yttria-stabilized zirconia. Ionic interactions
are taken into account by combining density functional theory calculations and
the cluster expansion method and are found to be essential in reproducing the
effective activation energy observed in experiments. The model predicts that
the effective energy barrier can be reduced by 0.15-0.25 eV by arranging the
dopant ions into a super-lattice.
