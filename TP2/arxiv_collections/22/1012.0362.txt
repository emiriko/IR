Full jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is a promising tool for the
quantitative study of properties of the dense medium produced at RHIC. In
addition to baseline measurements in p+p, results from d+Au collisions are
needed to disentangle initial state nuclear effects from medium-induced k_T
broadening and jet quenching. We present mid-rapidity inclusive jet p_T spectra
and di-jet correlations (k_T) in 200~GeV p+p and d+Au collisions from the
2007-2008 RHIC run.
