Proposed is a new laser material for the making of active elements of tunable
lasers for mid IR region (4-5 mkm) - Zn1-xMgxSe (0.11<x<0.42) single crystals
doped with Fe2+ ions. The optical transmission spectra of Fe2+:Zn0.89Mg0.11Se
and Fe2+:Zn0.69Mg0.31Se samples contain strong absorption bands with maxima at
3.212 and 3.374 mkm, respectively. The generation band maximum of the wide-gap
semiconductor laser material Fe2+ :Zn1-xMgxSe shifts towards longer wavelengths
with the rise of the concentration of Mg in the crystalline matrix.
