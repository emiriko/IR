We propose a concept of a low-symmetry three-dimensional metamaterial
exhibiting a Double- Continuum Fano (DCF) optical resonance. Such metamaterial
is described as a birefringent medium supporting a discrete "dark"
electromagnetic state weakly coupled to the continua of two nondegen- erate
"bright" bands of orthogonal polarizations. It is demonstrated that light
propagation through such DCF metamaterial can be slowed down over a broad
frequency range when the medium param- eters (e.g. frequency of the "dark"
mode) are adiabatically changed along the optical path. Using a specific
metamaterial implementation, we demonstrate that the DCF approach to slow light
(SL) is superior to that of the EIT because it enables spectrally uniform group
velocity and transmission coefficient.
