Any practical attempt to solve the Regge equations, these being a large
system of non-linear algebraic equations, will almost certainly employ a
Newton-Raphson like scheme. In such cases it is essential that efficient
algorithms be used when computing the defect angles and their derivatives with
respect to the leg-lengths. The purpose of this paper is to present details of
such an algorithm.
