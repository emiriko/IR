In this work we present a new formalism to evaluate the nuclear spin dynamics
driven by hyperfine interaction with non-equilibrium electron spins. To
describe the dynamics up to second order in the hyperfine coupling, it suffices
to evaluate the susceptibility and fluctuations of the electron spin. Our
approach does not rely on a separation of electronic energy scales or the
specific choice of electronic basis states, thereby overcoming practical
problems which may arise in certain limits when using a more traditional
formalism based on rate equations.
