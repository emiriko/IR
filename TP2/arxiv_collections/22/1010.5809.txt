With the advent of the LHC, it is important to devise clear tests for Physics
  Beyond the Standard Model. Such physics could manifest itself in the form of
new charged bosons, whose presence is most naturally occurring in left-right
symmetric models (LRSM). We analyze the single $W_R$ boson production in an
asymmetric left-right model, where the left and right quark mixing matrices are
not constrained to be equal. We investigate the cross sections as well as
branching ratios of $W_R$ bosons at the LHC, including constraints from low
energy phenomenology. We then look for most likely signals in $pp \to W_R\ t
\to t ~(dijet)$ production. Including the background, we find that LHC could
show significant signals for the new charged bosons. We compare our results
throughout with the manifest left-right symmetric model and comment on
similarities and differences.
