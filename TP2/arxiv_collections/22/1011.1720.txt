In this article, we discuss the Lefschetz trace formula for an adic space
which is separated smooth of finite type but not necessarily proper over an
algebraically closed non-archimedean field. Under a certain condition on the
absence of set-theoretical fixed points on the boundary, we obtain a fixed
point formula. As an application, we can establish a trace formula for some
formal schemes, which is applicable to the Rapoport-Zink tower for GSp(4). A
partial generalization of Fujiwara's trace formula for contracting morphisms is
also given.
