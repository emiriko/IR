We examine the evolution of the spatial counts-in-cells distribution of
galaxies and show that the form of the galaxy distribution function does not
change significantly as galaxies merge and evolve. In particular, bound merging
pairs follow a similar distribution to that of individual galaxies. From the
adiabatic expansion of the universe we show how clustering, expansion and
galaxy mergers affect the clustering parameter b. We also predict the evolution
of b with respect to redshift.
