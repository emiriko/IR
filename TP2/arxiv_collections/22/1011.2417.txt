The main purpose of this paper is to construct not only generating functions
of the new approach Genocchi type numbers and polynomials but also
interpolation function of these numbers and polynomials which are related to a,
b, c arbitrary positive real parameters. We prove multiplication theorem of
these polynomials. Furthermore, we give some identities and applications
associated with these numbers, polynomials and their interpolation functions.
