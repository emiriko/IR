The basic ideas of second quantization and Fock space are extended to density
operator states, used in treatments of open many-body systems. This can be done
for fermions and bosons. While the former only requires the use of a
non-orthogonal basis, the latter requires the introduction of a dual set of
spaces. In both cases an operator algebra closely resembling the canonical one
is developed and used to define the dual sets of bases. We here concentrated on
the bosonic case where the unboundedness of the operators requires the
definitions of dual spaces to support the pair of bases. Some applications,
mainly to non-equilibrium steady states, will be mentioned.
