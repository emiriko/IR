In order to gain a better understanding of the Ising model in higher
dimensions we have made a comparative study of how the boundary, open versus
cyclic, of a d-dimensional simple lattice, for d=1,...,5, affects the behaviour
of the specific heat C and its microcanonical relative, the entropy derivative
-dS/dU. In dimensions 4 and 5 the boundary has a strong effect on the critical
region of the model and for cyclic boundaries in dimension 5 we find that the
model displays a quasi first order phase transition with a bimodal energy
distribution. The latent heat decreases with increasing systems size but for
all system sizes used in earlier papers the effect is clearly visible once a
wide enough range of values for K is considered. Relations to recent rigorous
results for high dimensional percolation and previous debates on simulation of
Ising models and gauge fields are discussed.
