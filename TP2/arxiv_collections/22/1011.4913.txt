In topological insulators (TI), strong spin-orbit coupling results in
non-trivial scattering processes of the surface states, whose effects include
suppressed back scattering1, 2, 3, 4 weak anti-localization5, 6 and the
possibility of an exotic Kondo effect that mimics graphene7. Introducing time
reversal breaking perturbations and establishing long-range magnetic order has
been theorized to lead to the formation of quantized magnetoelectric
phenomena8, fractionalized charge excitations, and the appearance of quantum
wire states9. A key, elusive, step in exploring these and other novel
electronic phases is the experimental observation of charge backscattering due
to spin-flip processes at the surface of a magnetically-doped TI. Here we
utilize Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to probe the
surface of a magnetically doped TI, Bi2-xFexTe3+d. Our measurements show the
appearance of a hitherto unobserved channel of electronic backscattering along
surface q-vector \Gamma\kappa. By combining FT-STS with angle-resolved
photoemission data, we identify the momentum space origins of the observed
q-vectors, which on comparison to a model calculation are enhanced by spin-flip
scattering. Our findings present compelling evidence for the first spatial and
momentum resolved measurements of magnetic impurity induced backscattering in a
prototypical TI.
