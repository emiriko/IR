Photothermal effects allow very efficient optomechanical coupling between
mechanical degrees of freedom and photons. In the context of cavity cooling of
a mechanical oscillator, the question of if the quantum ground state of the
oscillator can be reached using photothermal back-action has been debated and
remains an open question. Here we address this problem by complementary
classical and quantum calculations. Both lead us to conclude that: first, the
ground-state can indeed be reached using photothermal cavity cooling, second,
it can be reached in a regime where the cavity detuning is small allowing a
large amount of photons to enter the cavity.
