Motivated by the increasing need for observational resources for the study of
time varying astronomy, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) is
a private foundation, whose goal is to build a global network of robotic
telescopes for scientific research and education. Once completed, the network
will become a unique tool, capable of continuous monitoring from both the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The network currently includes 2 x 2.0 m
telescopes, already making an impact in the field of exoplanet research. In the
next few years they will be joined by at least 12 x 1.0 m and 20 x 0.4 m
telescopes. The increasing amount of LCOGT observational resources in the
coming years will be of great service to the astronomical community in general,
and the exoplanet community in particular.
