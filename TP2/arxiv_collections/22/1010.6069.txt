Using primarily experimental inputs for S(B -> psi Ks), Delta M_Bs, Delta
M_Bd, BR(B -> tau nu) and epsilon_K along with necessary inputs from the
lattice, we find that the measured value of sin(2 beta) is smaller than
expectations of the Standard Model by as much as 3.3 sigma, and also that the
measured value of the BR(B -> tau nu) seems to be less than the predicted value
by about 2.8 sigma. However, through a critical study we show that most likely
the dominant source of these deviations is in B_d(s) mixings and in sin(2 beta)
and less so in B -> tau nu, and also that the bulk of the problem persists even
if input from epsilon_K is not used. The fact that kaon mixing and epsilon_K
are not the dominant source of the deviation from the Standard Model has the
very important consequence that model independent considerations imply that the
scale of the relevant new CP-violating physics is below O(2 TeV), thus
suggesting that direct signals of the new particle(s) may well be accessible in
collider experiments at the LHC and perhaps even at the Tevatron.
