Within the framework of Skyrme energy density formalism, we investigate the
role of surface corrections on the fusion of colliding nuclei. For this, the
coefficient of surface correction was varied between 1/36 and 4/36, and its
impact was studied on about 180 reactions. Our detailed investigations indicate
a linear relationship between the fusion barrier heights and strength of the
surface corrections. Our analysis of the fusion barriers advocate the strength
of surface correction of 1/36.
