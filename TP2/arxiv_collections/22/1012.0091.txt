Conan is a C++ library created for the accurate and efficient modelling,
inference and analysis of complex networks. It implements the generation and
modification of graphs according to several published models, as well as the
unexpensive computation of global and local network properties. Other features
include network inference and community detection. Furthermore, Conan provides
a Python interface to facilitate the use of the library and its integration in
currently existing applications.
