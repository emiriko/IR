We study the interplay of the Kondo effect and spin-polarized tunneling in a
class of systems exhibiting uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, such as magnetic
molecules, magnetic adatoms, or quantum dots coupled to a single localized
magnetic moment. Using the numerical renormalization group method we calculate
the spectral functions and linear conductance in the Kondo regime. We show that
the exchange coupling between conducting electrons and localized magnetic core
generally leads to suppression of the Kondo effect. We also predict a
nontrivial dependence of the tunnel magnetoresistance on the strength of
exchange coupling and on the anisotropy constant.
