In this paper we study recovery conditions of weighted $\ell_1$ minimization
for signal reconstruction from compressed sensing measurements when partial
support information is available. We show that if at least 50% of the (partial)
support information is accurate, then weighted $\ell_1$ minimization is stable
and robust under weaker conditions than the analogous conditions for standard
$\ell_1$ minimization. Moreover, weighted $\ell_1$ minimization provides better
bounds on the reconstruction error in terms of the measurement noise and the
compressibility of the signal to be recovered. We illustrate our results with
extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data and real audio and video
signals.
