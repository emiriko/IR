Topological insulators in three dimensions are nonmagnetic insulators that
possess metallic surface states as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of
electronic wavefunctions in the bulk of the material. They are the first known
examples of topological order in bulk solids. We review the basic phenomena and
experimental history, starting with the observation of topological insulator
behavior in Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$ by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and continuing through measurements on other materials and by
other probes. A self-contained introduction to the single-particle theory is
then given, followed by the many-particle definition of a topological insulator
as a material with quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The last section
reviews recent work on strongly correlated topological insulators and new
effects that arise from the proximity effect between a topological insulator
and a superconductor. While this article is not intended to be a comprehensive
review of what is already a rather large field, we hope that it will serve as a
useful introduction, summary of recent progress, and guideline to future
directions.
