We show how recent data from observations of the cosmic microwave background
may suggest the presence of additional radiation density which appeared after
big bang nucleosynthesis. We propose a general scheme by which this radiation
could be produced from the decay of non-relativistic matter, we place
constraints on the properties of such matter, and we give specific examples of
scenarios in which this general scheme may be realized.
