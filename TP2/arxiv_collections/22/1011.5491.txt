Every word has a shape determined by its image under the
Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. We show that when a word w contains a
separable (i.e., 3142- and 2413-avoiding) permutation \sigma\ as a pattern, the
shape of w contains the shape of \sigma. As an application, we exhibit lower
bounds for the lengths of supersequences of sets containing separable
permutations.
