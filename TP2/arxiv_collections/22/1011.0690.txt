We present a survey of interstellar O VI absorption in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) towards 70 lines of sight based on Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer (FUSE) observations. The survey covers O VI absorption in a large
number of objects in different environmental conditions of the LMC. Overall, a
high abundance of O VI is present in active and inactive regions of the LMC
with mean log[N(O VI)] = 14.23 atoms cm$^{-2}$. There is no correlation
observed between O VI absorption and emissions from the hot gas (X-ray surface
brightness) or the warm gas (H$_{\alpha}$ surface brightness). O VI absorption
in the LMC is patchy and the properties are similar to that of the Milky Way
(MW). In comparison to the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), O VI is lower in
abundance even though SMC has a lower metallicity compared to the LMC and the
MW. We present observations in 10 superbubbles of the LMC of which we detect O
VI absorption in 5 superbubbles for the first time and the superbubbles show an
excess O VI absorption of about 40% compared to non-superbubble lines of sight.
We have also studied the properties of O VI absorption in the 30 Doradus
region. Even though O VI does not show any correlation with X-ray emission for
the LMC, a good correlation between log[N(O VI)] and X-ray surface brightness
for 30 Doradus region is present. We also find that O VI abundance decreases
with increasing distance from the star cluster R136.
