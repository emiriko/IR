We obtain the output and transfer characteristics of graphene field-effect
transistors by using the charge-control model for the current, based on the
solution of the Boltzmann equation in the field-dependent relaxation time
approximation. Closed expressions for the conductance, transconductance and
saturation voltage are derived. We found good agreement with the experimental
data of Meric et al. [Nature Nanotechnology 3, 684 (2008)] without assuming
carrier density-dependent velocity saturation.
