We study numerically the influence of density and strain rate on the
diffusion and mobility of a single tagged particle in a sheared colloidal
suspension. We determine independently the time-dependent velocity
autocorrelation functions and, through a novel method, the response functions
with respect to a small force. While both the diffusion coefficient and the
mobility depend on the strain rate the latter exhibits a rather weak
dependency. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the initial decay of response
and correlation functions coincide, allowing for an interpretation in terms of
an 'effective temperature'. Such a phenomenological effective temperature
recovers the Einstein relation in nonequilibrium. We show that our data is well
described by two expansions to lowest order in the strain rate.
