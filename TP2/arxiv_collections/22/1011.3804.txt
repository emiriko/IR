Inspired by the "generalized t-designs" defined by Cameron [P. J. Cameron, A
generalisation of t-designs, Discrete Math. 309 (2009), 4835--4842], we define
a new class of combinatorial designs which simultaneously provide a
generalization of both covering designs and covering arrays. We then obtain a
number of bounds on the minimum sizes of these designs, and describe some
methods of constructing them, which in some cases we prove are optimal. Many of
our results are obtained from an interpretation of these designs in terms of
clique coverings of graphs.
