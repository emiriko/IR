Hawking radiation from black holes has been studied as a phenomenon of
quantum tunneling of particles through their horizons. We have extended this
approach to study the tunneling of Dirac particles from a large class of black
holes which includes those with acceleration and rotation as well. We have
calculated the tunneling probability of incoming and outgoing particles, and
recovered the correct Hawking temperature by this method.
