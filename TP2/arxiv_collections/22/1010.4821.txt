We present spectra of Eris from the MMT 6.5 meter telescope and Red Channel
Spectrograph (5700-9800 angstroms; 5 angstroms per pix) on Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and
of Pluto from the Steward Observatory 2.3 meter telescope and Boller and
Chivens spectrograph (7100-9400 angstroms; 2 angstroms per pix) on Kitt Peak,
AZ. In addition, we present laboratory transmission spectra of methane-nitrogen
and methane-argon ice mixtures. By anchoring our analysis in methane and
nitrogen solubilities in one another as expressed in the phase diagram of
Prokhvatilov and Yantsevich (1983), and comparing methane bands in our Eris and
Pluto spectra and methane bands in our laboratory spectra of methane and
nitrogen ice mixtures, we find Eris' bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are
about 10% and about 90%, and Pluto's bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are
about 3% and about 97%. Such abundances for Pluto are consistent with values
reported in the literature. It appears that the bulk volatile composition of
Eris is similar to the bulk volatile composition of Pluto. Both objects appear
to be dominated by nitrogen ice. Our analysis also suggests, unlike previous
work reported in the literature, that the methane and nitrogen stoichiometry is
constant with depth into the surface of Eris. Finally, we point out that our
Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of
40% methane and 60% argon. Although we cannot rule out an argon rich surface,
it seems more likely that nitrogen is the dominant species on Eris because the
nitrogen ice 2.15 micron band is seen in spectra of Pluto and Triton.
