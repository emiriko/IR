This book is about the transformation of screen objects into movable and
resizable and about the design of applications entirely on the basis of such
elements. The screen objects have a wide variety of shapes; they can be either
graphical objects or controls; there are solitary objects and very complex
objects parts of which are involved in individual, synchronous, and related
movements. Objects can be involved in forward movements and rotation; they can
be resized and reconfigured; all these movements and situations are considered.
On the basis of total movability, the new type of programs - user-driven
applications - are designed. These applications continue to work according to
their main purposes, but the whole control of WHAT, WHEN, and HOW must appear
on the screen is passed from designers to users. Due to the size restriction
used on CoRR, the book is divided here into two parts and one appendix is
deleted. At www.sourceforge.net in the project MoveableGraphics the whole book
is available in a single file together with the accompanying application and
source codes.
