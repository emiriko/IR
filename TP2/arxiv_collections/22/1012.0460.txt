Graphene stacked in a Bernal configuration (60 degrees relative rotations
between sheets) differs electronically from isolated graphene due to the broken
symmetry introduced by interlayer bonds forming between only one of the two
graphene unit cell atoms. A variety of experiments have shown that non-Bernal
rotations restore this broken symmetry; consequently, these stacking varieties
have been the subject of intensive theoretical interest. Most theories predict
substantial changes in the band structure ranging from the development of a Van
Hove singularity and an angle dependent electron localization that causes the
Fermi velocity to go to zero as the relative rotation angle between sheets goes
to zero. In this work we show by direct measurement that non-Bernal rotations
preserve the graphene symmetry with only a small perturbation due to weak
effective interlayer coupling. We detect neither a Van Hove singularity nor any
significant change in the Fermi velocity. These results suggest significant
problems in our current theoretical understanding of the origins of the band
structure of this material.
