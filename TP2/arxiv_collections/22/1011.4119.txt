We show the following symmetry property of a bounded Reinhardt domain
$\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$: let $M=\partial\Omega$ be the smooth boundary
of $\Omega$ and let $h$ be the Second Fundamental Form of $M$; if the
coefficient $h(T,T)$ related to the characteristic direction $T$ is constant
then $M$ is a sphere. In Appendix we state the result from an hamiltonian point
of view.
