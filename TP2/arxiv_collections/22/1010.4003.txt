Chirally stacked N-layer graphene systems with N >= 2 exhibit a variety of
distinct broken symmetry states in which charge density contributions from
different spins and valleys are spontaneously transferred between layers. We
explain how these states are distinguished by their charge, spin, and valley
Hall conductivities, by their orbital magnetizations, and by their edge state
properties. We argue that valley Hall states have [N/2] edge channels per
spin-valley.
