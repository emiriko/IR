We present the first three-dimensional simulations of fingering convection
performed in a parameter regime close to the one relevant for astrophysics, and
reveal the existence of simple asymptotic scaling laws for turbulent heat and
compositional transport. These laws can straightforwardly be extrapolated to
the true astrophysical regime. Our investigation also indicates that
thermocompositional "staircases," a key consequence of fingering convection in
the ocean, cannot form spontaneously in the fingering regime in stellar
interiors. Our proposed empirically-determined transport laws thus provide
simple prescriptions for mixing by fingering convection in a variety of
astrophysical situations, and should, from here on, be used preferentially over
older and less accurate parameterizations. They also establish that fingering
convection does not provide sufficient extra mixing to explain observed
chemical abundances in RGB stars.
