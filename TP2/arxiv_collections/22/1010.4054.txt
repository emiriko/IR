A brief review of the extremal projectors for contragredient Lie
(super)symmetries (finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, basic classical Lie
superalgebras, infinite-dimensional affine Kac-Moody algebras and
superalgebras, as well as their quantum $q$-analogs) is given. Some
bibliographic comments on the applications of extremal projectors are
presented.
