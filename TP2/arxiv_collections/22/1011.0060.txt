We introduce a mathematical framework for the analysis of the input-output
dynamics of externally driven memristors. We show that, under general
assumptions, their dynamics comply with a Bernoulli differential equation and
hence can be nonlinearly transformed into a formally solvable linear equation.
The Bernoulli formalism, which applies to both charge- and flux-controlled
memristors when either current- or voltage-driven, can, in some cases, lead to
expressions of the output of the device as an explicit function of the input.
We apply our framework to obtain analytical solutions of the i-v
characteristics of the recently proposed model of the Hewlett-Packard memristor
under three different drives without the need for numerical simulations. Our
explicit solutions allow us to identify a dimensionless lumped parameter that
combines device-specific parameters with properties of the input drive. This
parameter governs the memristive behavior of the device and, consequently, the
amount of hysteresis in the i-v. We proceed further by defining formally a
quantitative measure for the hysteresis of the device for which we obtain
explicit formulas in terms of the aforementioned parameter and we discuss the
applicability of the analysis for the design and analysis of memristor devices.
