The creation of partons with transverse momenta around 10 GeV/c in Pb-Pb
collisions at LHC is expected to be so copious that the parton density may be
high enough for neighboring jet cones to overlap. If the shower partons in
adjacent jets can recombine to form trigger particles, the distribution of
hadrons on the away side should be distinguishable from that due to the recoil
of a single harder parton that can produce a similar trigger particle by
fragmentation. The two-particle azimuthal correlation on the away side is
generated by simulation of the two trigger types. Moments of the correlation
distributions are calculated to exhibit their differences. A measure that can
be determined by suitable analysis of the LHC data is suggested. It may reveal
the footprint of two-jet recombination.
