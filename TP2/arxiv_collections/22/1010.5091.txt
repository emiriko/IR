Under complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), robust tests often have greater
power than Pearson's chi-square test and trend tests for the analysis of
case-control genetic association studies. Robust statistics have been used in
candidate-gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) when the genetic
model is unknown. We consider here a more general incomplete LD model, and
examine the impact of penetrances at the marker locus when the genetic models
are defined at the disease locus. Robust statistics are then reviewed and their
efficiency and robustness are compared through simulations in GWAS of 300,000
markers under the incomplete LD model. Applications of several robust tests to
the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium [Nature 447 (2007) 661--678] are
presented.
