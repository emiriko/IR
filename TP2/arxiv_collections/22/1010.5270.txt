Spectroscopy is one of the most important tools that an astronomer has for
studying the universe. This chapter begins by discussing the basics, including
the different types of optical spectrographs, with extension to the ultraviolet
and the near-infrared. Emphasis is given to the fundamentals of how
spectrographs are used, and the trade-offs involved in designing an
observational experiment. It then covers observing and reduction techniques,
noting that some of the standard practices of flat-fielding often actually
degrade the quality of the data rather than improve it. Although the focus is
on point sources, spatially resolved spectroscopy of extended sources is also
briefly discussed. Discussion of differential extinction, the impact of
crowding, multi-object techniques, optimal extractions, flat-fielding
considerations, and determining radial velocities and velocity dispersions
provide the spectroscopist with the fundamentals needed to obtain the best
data. Finally the chapter combines the previous material by providing some
examples of real-life observing experiences with several typical instruments.
