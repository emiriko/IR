We study a class of Hamiltonian deformations of the massless
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system in spherical symmetry for which the Dirac
constraint algebra closes. The system may be regarded as providing effective
equations for quantum gravitational collapse. Guided by the observation that
scalar field fluxes do not follow metric null directions due to the
deformation, we find that the equations take a simple form in characteristic
coordinates. We analyse these equations by a unique combination of numerical
methods and find that Choptuik's mass scaling law is modified by a mass gap as
well as jagged oscillations. Furthermore, the results are universal with
respect to different initial data profiles and robust under changes of the
deformation.
