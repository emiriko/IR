We consider a hidden sector with new vectorlike confining gauge theories like
QCD. Then a scale $\Lambda_H$ would be generated in the hidden sector by
dimensional transmutation, and chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the hidden
sector. Then this scale $\Lambda_H$ can play a role of the SM Higgs mass
parameter, triggering electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Thus all the mass
scales of the SM sector can arise from the hidden sector. Furthermore the
lightest hadrons in the hidden sector is stable by the flavor conservation of
the hidden sector strong interaction, and could be the cold dark matter (CDM).
We study collider phenomenology, and relic density and direct detection rates
of the CDM of this model.
