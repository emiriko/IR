The properties of the low-lying 2^+ states in the even-even nuclei around
132Sn are studied within the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Starting
from a Skyrme interaction in the particle-hole channel and a density-dependent
zero-range interaction in the particle-particle channel, we use the finite rank
separable approach in our investigation. It is found that the fourth 2^+ state
in 132Te could be a good candidate for a mixed-symmetry state.
