We give a necessary and sufficient condition in order for a hyperplane
arrangement to be of Torelli type, namely that it is recovered as the set of
unstable hyperplanes of its Dolgachev sheaf of logarithmic differentials.
Decompositions and semistability of non-Torelli arrangements are investigated.
