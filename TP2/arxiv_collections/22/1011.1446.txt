We study quantum discord, in addition to entanglement, of bipartite
pseudo-entanglement in noninertial frames. It is shown that the entanglement
degrades from its maximum value in a stationary frame to a minimum value in an
infinite accelerating frame. There is a critical region found in which, for
particular cases, entanglement of states vanishes for certain accelerations.
The quantum discord of pseudo-entanglement decreases by increasing the
acceleration. Also, for a physically inaccessible region, entanglement and
nonclassical correlation are evaluated and shown to match the corresponding
values of the physically accessible region for an infinite acceleration.
