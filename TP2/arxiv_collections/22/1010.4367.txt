The X-ray edge singularity of bilayer graphene is studied by generalizing the
path integral approach based on local action which was employed for monolayer
graphene. In sharp contrast to the case of monolayer graphene, the bilayer
graphene is found to exhibit the edge singularity even at half-filling and its
characteristics are determined by interlayer coupling. At finite bias the
singular behaviors sensitively depend on the relative magnitude of fermi energy
and applied bias, which is due to the peculiar shape of energy band at finite
bias.
