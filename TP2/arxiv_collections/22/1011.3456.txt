In the present work, we present a novel numerical algorithm to couple the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) for the solution of the Boltzmann
equation with a finite volume like method for the solution of the Euler
equations. Recently we presented in [14],[16],[17] different methodologies
which permit to solve fluid dynamics problems with localized regions of
departure from thermodynamical equilibrium. The methods rely on the
introduction of buffer zones which realize a smooth transition between the
kinetic and the fluid regions. In this paper we extend the idea of buffer zones
and dynamic coupling to the case of the Monte Carlo methods. To facilitate the
coupling and avoid the onset of spurious oscillations in the fluid regions
which are consequences of the coupling with a stochastic numerical scheme, we
use a new technique which permits to reduce the variance of the particle
methods [11]. In addition, the use of this method permits to obtain estimations
of the breakdowns of the fluid models less affected by fluctuations and
consequently to reduce the kinetic regions and optimize the coupling. In the
last part of the paper several numerical examples are presented to validate the
method and measure its computational performances.
