The XMM-Newton survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) was performed to
study the population of X-ray sources in this neighbouring galaxy. During one
of the observations, the symbiotic binary SMC3 was found at its highest X-ray
luminosity observed until now. In SMC3 wind accretion from a giant donor star
onto a white dwarf is believed to cause steady hydrogen burning on the white
dwarf surface, making such systems candidates for supernova type Ia
progenitors. It was suggested that the X-ray source is eclipsed every ~4.5
years by the companion star and its stellar wind to explain the large X-ray
variability seen in ROSAT data. We use the available X-ray data to test this
scenario. We present the ~20 year X-ray light curve of SMC3 and study the
spectral evolution as seen with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn to investigate possible
scenarios which can reproduce the high X-ray variability. We did not find
significant variations in the photo-electric absorption, as it would be
expected during eclipse ingress and egress. Instead, the X-ray spectra from
different intensity levels, when modelled by black-body emission, can be better
explained by variations either in normalisation (by a factor of ~50) or in
temperature (kT between 24 eV and 34 eV). The light curve shows maxima and
minima with slow transitions between them. To explain the gradual variations in
the X-ray light curve and to avoid changes in absorption by neutral gas, a
predominant part of the stellar wind must be ionised by the X-ray source.
Compton scattering with variable electron column density (of the order of 5 x
10^24 cm^-2) along the line of sight could then be responsible for the
intensity changes. The X-ray variability of SMC3 could also be caused by
temperature changes in the hydrogen burning envelope of the white dwarf, an
effect which could even dominate if the stellar wind density is not
sufficiently high.
