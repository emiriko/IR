We have investigated the conduction over a wide range of temperature of
$\lambda$ DNA molecules deposited across slits etched through a few nanometers
thick platinum film. The slits are insulating before DNA deposition but contain
metallic Ga nanoparticles, a result of focused ion beam etching. When these
nanoparticles are superconducting we find that they can induce
superconductivity through the DNA molecules, even though the main electrodes
are non superconducting. These results indicate that minute metallic particles
can easily transfer charge carriers to attached DNA molecules and provide a
possible reconciliation between apparently contradictory previous experimental
results concerning the length over which DNA molecules can conduct electricity.
