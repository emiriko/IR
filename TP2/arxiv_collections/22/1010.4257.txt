The two current models for giant planet formation are core accretion and disk
instability. We discuss the core masses and overall planetary enrichment in
heavy elements predicted by the two formation models, and show that both models
could lead to a large range of final compositions. For example, both can form
giant planets with nearly stellar compositions. However, low-mass giant
planets, enriched in heavy elements compared to their host stars, are more
easily explained by the core accretion model. The final structure of the
planets, i.e., the distribution of heavy elements, is not firmly constrained in
either formation model.
