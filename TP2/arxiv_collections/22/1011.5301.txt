The present paper examines the possibility of asymmetric effect of the
adjacent to barrier physically different media, or anisotropic structure of the
barrier itself, on probability of the oppositely directed transitions of
current carriers through the potential barrier. It is shown, that in the above
cases transparency of the barrier can be anisotropic. Consequently, there is a
possibility that the chaotic thermal motion of particles may self-transform
into the ordered motion. Stationary state of such systems turns to be different
from thermodynamical equilibrium, which, in its turn, results in possibility of
the effective work due to spontaneous cooling of the barrier region.
Thermodynamics of these processes is being considered herein.
