We derive formulas for the cd-index and the toric h-vector of a convex
polytope P from a sweeping by a hyperplane. These arise from interpreting the
corresponding S-shelling of the dual of P. We describe a partition of the faces
of the complete truncation of P to reflect explicitly the nonnegativity of its
cd-index and what its components are counting. One corollary is a quick way to
compute the toric h-vector directly from the cd-index. We also propose an
"extended toric" h-vector that fully captures the information in the flag
h-vector.
