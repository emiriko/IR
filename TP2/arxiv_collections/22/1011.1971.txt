Here we prove that for a smooth projective variety $X$ of arbitrary dimension
and for a vector bundle $E$ over $X$, the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of a
Frobenius pull back of $E$ is a refinement of the Frobenius pull-back of the
Harder-Narasimhan filtration of $E$, provided there is a lower bound on the
characteristic $p$ (in terms of rank of $E$ and the slope of the destabilising
sheaf of the cotangent bundle of $X$). We also recall some examples, due to
Raynaud and Monsky,to show that some lower bound on $p$ is necessary. We
further prove an analogue of this result for principal $G$-bundles over $X$. We
also give a bound on the instability degree of the Frobenius pull back of $E$
in terms of the instability degree of $E$ and well defined invariants ot $X$
and $E$.
