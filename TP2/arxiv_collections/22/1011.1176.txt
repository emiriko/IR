In this work we present the computer algebra package HarmonicSums and its
theoretical background for the manipulation of harmonic sums and some related
quantities as for example Euler-Zagier sums and harmonic polylogarithms.
Harmonic sums and generalized harmonic sums emerge as special cases of
so-called d'Alembertian solutions of recurrence relations. We show that
harmonic sums form a quasi-shuffle algebra and describe a method how we can
find algebraically independent harmonic sums. In addition, we define a
differentiation on harmonic sums via an extended version of the Mellin
transform. Along with that, new relations between harmonic sums will arise.
Furthermore, we present an algorithm which rewrites certain types of nested
sums into expressions in terms of harmonic sums. We illustrate by nontrivial
examples how these algorithms in cooperation with the summation package Sigma
support the evaluation of Feynman integrals.
