We find two two-qubit states such that any number of copies of one state or
the other cannot violate the CHSH Bell inequality. However, their tensor
product can produce a CHSH violation of at least 2.023. We also identify a
CHSH-local state such that two copies of it are CHSH-violating. The tools
employed here can be easily adapted to find instances of non-locality
activation in arbitrary Bell scenarios.
