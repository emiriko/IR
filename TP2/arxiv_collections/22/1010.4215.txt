Supersymmetric (SUSY) grand unified theories based on exceptional gauge
groups such as E6 have recently triggered a lot of interest. Aside from
top-down motivations, they contain phenomenologically interesting states with
leptoquark quantum numbers. Their SUSY partners, leptoquarkinos, will appear
similar to all R-odd particles in decay cascades, but mass edges in kinematic
distributions- originating from the same semiexclusive final states-will
however have major differences to the corresponding edges of ordinary squarks.
This distortion of standard observables bears the opportunity to detect them at
the LHC, but may also pose significant confusion of underlying model
assumptions, which should be handled with care and, if interpreted falsely,
might even prevent a possible discovery.
