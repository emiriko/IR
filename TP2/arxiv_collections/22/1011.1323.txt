Hadronic scattering mediated through the strong interaction has been an area
of great interest for both theory and experiment. Recently, lattice QCD
calculations of scattering processes from first principles have seen remarkable
progress, including multiple calculations of two-pion scattering lengths that
agree with experiment to within a few percent. However, there exists a certain
class of scattering processes, such as pion-nucleon scattering, that contain
annihilation diagrams, which are often prohibitively expensive to simulate on
the lattice. In this talk, I will present a method to extract certain
parameters from this class of scattering processes by employing an isospin
chemical potential, which can be simulated on the lattice as a result of its
positive-definite fermion determinant.
