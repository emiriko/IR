We consider the recursion relation for loop integrands in planar N = 4 SYM
generated by an all-line shift of momentum twistors. We examine the behaviour
of the rational loop integrands when the shift parameter becomes large, and
find that a valid recursion relation may be obtained in all cases. The
recursion relation is then formulated both in region momentum space and in
momentum twistor space, and solved in detail for some one and two-loop
examples. Finally, we show that the general iterative solution of the recursion
relation generates the MHV vertex expansion for all loop integrands, providing
a proof of the MHV diagram formalism for all loop amplitudes in planar N = 4
SYM.
