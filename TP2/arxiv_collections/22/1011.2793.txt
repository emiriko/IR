We present calculated, electronic and related properties of wurtzite cadmium
sulfide (w-CdS). Our ab-initio, non-relativistic calculations employed a local
density functional approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of
atomic orbitals (LCAO). Following the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams (BZW)
method, we solved self-consistently both the Kohn-Sham equation and the
equation giving the ground state density in terms of the wave functions of the
occupied states. Our calculated, direct band gap of 2.47 eV, at the point, is
in excellent agreement with experiment. So are the calculated density of states
and the electron effective mass. In particular, our results reproduce the peaks
in the conduction band density of states, within the experimental
uncertainties.
