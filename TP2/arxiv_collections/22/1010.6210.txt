For the non-perturbative analysis of the topological content of Yang-Mills
theories, it is essential to disentangle long-range structures from short-range
fluctuations. Some time ago, one of us proposed to use the adjoint modes of the
Dirac operator for this purpose. In this talk we analyse an implementation of
this idea that associates two Weyl fermionic modes in the adjoint
representation to every gauge field configuration. The densities of these modes
provide a filtered image of the self-dual and anti self-dual parts of the gauge
action density. We present successful tests on the performance of this proposal
on a set of initial gauge field configurations.
