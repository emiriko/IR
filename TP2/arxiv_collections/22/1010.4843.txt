Nowadays, many scientific areas share the same need of being able to deal
with massive and distributed datasets and to perform on them complex knowledge
extraction tasks. This simple consideration is behind the international efforts
to build virtual organizations such as, for instance, the Virtual Observatory
(VObs). DAME (DAta Mining & Exploration) is an innovative, general purpose,
Web-based, VObs compliant, distributed data mining infrastructure specialized
in Massive Data Sets exploration with machine learning methods. Initially fine
tuned to deal with astronomical data only, DAME has evolved in a general
purpose platform which has found applications also in other domains of human
endeavor. We present the products and a short outline of a science case,
together with a detailed description of main features available in the beta
release of the web application now released.
