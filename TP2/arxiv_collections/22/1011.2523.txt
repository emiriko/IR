We study a system of ultra-cold atoms possessing long range interaction (e.g.
dipole-dipole interaction) in a one dimensional optical lattice in the presence
of a confining harmonic trap. We have shown that for large enough on-site and
nearest neighbor interaction a supersolid phase can be stabilized, consistent
with the previous Quantum Monte Carlo and DMRG results for the homogeneous
system. Due to the external harmonic trap potential the supersolid phase
coexists with other phases. We emphasize on the experimental signatures of the
various ground state phases in the presence of a trap.
