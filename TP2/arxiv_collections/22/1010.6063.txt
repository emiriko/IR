Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators have a wide range of
applications due to the combination of their planar geometry and high quality
factors relative to normal metals. However, their performance is sensitive to
both the details of their geometry and the materials and processes that are
used in their fabrication. In this paper, we study the dependence of SCPW
resonator performance on materials and geometry as a function of temperature
and excitation power. We measure quality factors greater than $2\times10^6$ at
high excitation power and $6\times10^5$ at a power comparable to that generated
by a single microwave photon circulating in the resonator. We examine the
limits to the high excitation power performance of the resonators and find it
to be consistent with a model of radiation loss. We further observe that while
in all cases the quality factors are degraded as the temperature and power are
reduced due to dielectric loss, the size of this effect is dependent on
resonator materials and geometry. Finally, we demonstrate that the dielectric
loss can be controlled in principle using a separate excitation near the
resonance frequencies of the resonator.
