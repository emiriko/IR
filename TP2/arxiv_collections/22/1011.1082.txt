We consider a lattice gas on the discrete d-dimensional torus
$(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^d$ with a generic translation invariant, finite range
interaction satisfying a uniform strong mixing condition. The lattice gas
performs a Kawasaki dynamics in the presence of a weak external field E/N. We
show that, under diffusive rescaling, the hydrodynamic behavior of the lattice
gas is described by a nonlinear driven diffusion equation. We then prove the
associated dynamical large deviation principle. Under suitable assumptions on
the external field (e.g., E constant), we finally analyze the variational
problem defining the quasi-potential and characterize the optimal exit
trajectory. From these results we deduce the asymptotic behavior of the
stationary measures of the stochastic lattice gas, which are not explicitly
known. In particular, when the external field E is constant, we prove a
stationary large deviation principle for the empirical density and show that
the rate function does not depend on E.
