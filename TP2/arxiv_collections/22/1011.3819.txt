In high energy hadronic collisions a scalar or pseudoscalar Higgs boson,
Phi=H,A, can be efficiently produced via gluon fusion, which is mediated by
heavy quark loops. We here consider double real emission corrections to Phi=A
production, which lead to a Higgs plus two-jet final state, at order alpha_s^4.
Full quark mass effects are considered in the calculation of scattering
amplitudes for the CP-odd Higgs boson A, as induced by quark triangle-, box-
and pentagon-diagrams. They complement the analogous results for a CP-even
Higgs boson H in Ref.[1]. Interference effects between loops with top and
bottom quarks as well as between CP-even and CP-odd couplings of the heavy
quarks are fully taken into account.
