In this work a model is going to be used which develops data distributed over
a identified value which is used as nonce (IV). The model considers an
equilibrium equation which is a function of non linear relationships, time
variant and nonce variant values and takes the feed back of earlier round as
input to the present round. The process is repeated for different timings which
are used as time stamps in the encryption mechanism. Thus this model generates
a distributed sequence which is used as sub key. This model supports very
important parameters in symmetric data encryption schemes like non linear
relationships between different values used in the model, variable key length,
timeliness of encryption mechanism and also acknowledgement between the
participating parties. It also supports feed back mode which provides necessary
strength against crypto analysis.
