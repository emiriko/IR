Following Richardson and using results of Kesten on First-passage
percolation, we obtain an upper bound on the expected perimeter in an Eden
Growth Process. Using results of the author from a problem in Statistical
Mechanics, we show that the average perimeter of the lattice animals resulting
from a very natural family of "growth histories" does not obey a similar bound.
