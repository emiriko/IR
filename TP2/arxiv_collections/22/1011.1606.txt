We extend the definition of a quantum analogue of the Caldero-Chapoton map
defined in \cite{rupel}. When $Q$ is a quiver of finite type, we prove that the
algebra $\mathcal{AH}_{|k|}(Q)$ generated by all cluster characters (see
Definition \ref{def}) is exactly the quantum cluster algebra
$\mathcal{EH}_{|k|}(Q)$.
