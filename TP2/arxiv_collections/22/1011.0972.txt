In this paper we show how we can compute in a deterministic way the
decomposition of a multivariate rational function with a recombination
strategy. The key point of our recombination strategy is the used of Darboux
polynomials. We study the complexity of this strategy and we show that this
method improves the previous ones. In appendix, we explain how the strategy
proposed recently by J. Berthomieu and G. Lecerf for the sparse factorization
can be used in the decomposition setting. Then we deduce a decomposition
algorithm in the sparse bivariate case and we give its complexity
