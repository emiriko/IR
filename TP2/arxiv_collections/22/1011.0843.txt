We propose the method of investigation of radial motions for charged and
neutral test particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m field by means of mass
potential. In this context we analyze special features of interaction of
charges and their motions in General Relativity and construct the radial motion
classification. For test particles and a central source with charges $q$ and
$Q$, respectively, the conditions of attraction (when $qQ>0$) and repulsion
(when $qQ<0$) are obtained. The conditions of motionless test particle states
with respect to the central source are investigated and, in addition, stability
conditions for such static equilibrium states are found. It is shown that
stable states are possible only for the bound states of weakly charged
particles in the field of a naked singularity. Frequencies of small
oscillations of test particles near their equilibrium positions are also found.
