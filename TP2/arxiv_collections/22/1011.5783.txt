We study the azimuthal scatter in the radial profiles of X-ray luminous
galaxy clusters, with two sets of high-resolution cosmological re-simulations
obtained with the codes ENZO and GADGET2. The average gas profiles are computed
for different angular sectors of the cluster projected volume, and compared
with the mean cluster profiles at each radius from the center. We report that
in general the level of azimuthal scatter is found to be about 10 per cent for
gas density, temperature and entropy inside R200, and about 25 per cent for
X-ray luminosity for the same volume. These values generally doubles going to 2
R200 from the cluster center, and are generally found to be higher (by about
20-40 percent) in the case of perturbed systems. A comparison with results from
recent SUZAKU observations is discussed, showing the possibility to simply
interpret the large azimuthal scatter of observables in light of our simulated
results.
