We introduce a probabilistic approach to the problem of counting dwarf
satellites around host galaxies in databases with limited redshift information.
This technique is used to investigate the occurrence of satellites with
luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds around hosts with properties
similar to the Milky Way in the object catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
Our analysis uses data from SDSS Data Release 7, selecting candidate
Milky-Way-like hosts from the spectroscopic catalog and candidate analogs of
the Magellanic Clouds from the photometric catalog. Our principal result is the
probability for a Milky-Way-like galaxy to host N_{sat} close satellites with
luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that 81 percent of
galaxies like the Milky Way are have no such satellites within a radius of 150
kpc, 11 percent have one, and only 3.5 percent of hosts have two. The
probabilities are robust to changes in host and satellite selection criteria,
background-estimation technique, and survey depth. These results demonstrate
that the Milky Way has significantly more satellites than a typical galaxy of
its luminosity; this fact is useful for understanding the larger cosmological
context of our home galaxy.
