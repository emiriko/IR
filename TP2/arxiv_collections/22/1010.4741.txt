I give an elementary introduction to the study of gauge theories coupled to
fermions with many degrees of freedom. Besides their intrinsic interest, these
theories are candidates for nonperturbative extensions of the Higgs sector of
the Standard Model. While related to QCD, these systems can exhibit very
different behavior from it: they can possess a running gauge coupling with an
infrared attractive fixed point (IRFP). I briefly survey recent lattice work in
this area.
