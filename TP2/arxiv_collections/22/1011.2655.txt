In our latest paper "Search for anomalous top-gluon couplings at LHC
revisited" in Eur. Phys. J. C65 (2010), 127-135 (arXiv:0910.3049 [hep-ph]), we
studied possible effects of nonstandard top-gluon couplings through the
chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments of the top quark using the total
cross section of ppbar/pp --> ttbar X at Tevatron/LHC. There we pointed out
that LHC data could give a stronger constraint on those two parameters, which
would be hard to obtain from Tevatron data alone. We show here the first CMS
measurement of this cross section actually makes it possible.
