We investigate qubit-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmons supported by
one-dimensional waveguides. We explore both the situation of spontaneous
formation of entanglement from an unentangled state and the emergence of driven
steady-state entanglement under continuous pumping. In both cases, we show that
large values for the concurrence are attainable for qubit-qubit distances
larger than the operating wavelength by using plasmonic waveguides that are
currently available.
