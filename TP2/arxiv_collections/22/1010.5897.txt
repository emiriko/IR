We present the first observation of Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg (LZS)
interference of the dressed states arising from an artificial atom, a
superconducting phase qubit, interacting with a microwave field. The dependence
of LZS interference fringes on various external parameters and the initial
state of the qubit agrees quantitatively very well with the theoretical
prediction. Such LZS interferometry between the dressed states enables us to
control the quantum states of a tetrapartite solid-state system with ease,
demonstrating the feasibility of implementing efficient multipartite quantum
logic gates with this unique approach.
