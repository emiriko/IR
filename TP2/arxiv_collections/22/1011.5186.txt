The interdisciplinary topic of archaeo-astronomy links science subjects such
as astronomy with archaeology and sociology to explore how ancient societies
perceived the heavens above. This is achieved by analysing ancient sites such
as megalithic monuments (e.g. Stonehenge), since they are the most common
remains of these societies and are wide spread in Europe. We discuss how
archaeo-astronomy and ancient sites can be transversal to many topics in
school. The links to the science curricula in different countries are
highlighted. However, especially the subject of citizenship can be supported by
exploring the diversity of culture, ideas, and identities including the
changing nature of society in the past millennia. We conclude that
archaeo-astronomy offers many opportunities for citizenship. Learning more
about megalithic monuments in different countries (e.g. England, Portugal, and
Germany) supports tolerance and understanding. Furthermore, the distribution of
these sites lends itself to explore beyond borders, introduce international
networking, and truly develop students into global citizens.
