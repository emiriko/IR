The strong interaction shift $\epsilon$ and broadening {\Gamma} in pionic
deuterium have been determined in a high statistics study of the {\pi}D(3p -
1s) X-ray transition using a high-resolution crystal spectrometer. The pionic
deuterium shift will provide constraints for the pion-nucleon isospin
scattering lengths extracted from measurements of shift and broadening in
pionic hydrogen. The hadronic broadening is related to pion absorption and
production at threshold. The results are \epsilon = (-2356 {\pm} 31)meV
(repulsive) and {\Gamma}1s = (1171+23/-49) meV yielding for the complex {\pi}D
scattering length a = [-(24.99 {\pm} 0.33) + i (6.22+0.12/-0.26)]x10-3/m{\pi}.
From the imaginary part, the threshold parameter for pion production is
obtained to be {\alpha} = (251 +5/-11) {\mu}b. This allows, in addition, and by
using results from pion absorption in 3He at threshold, the determination of
the effective couplings g0 and g1 for s-wave pion absorption on isoscalar and
isovector NN pairs.
