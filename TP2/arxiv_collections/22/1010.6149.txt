In this paper, we study the motion of photons around a Kehagias-Sfetsos (KS)
black hole and obtain constraints on IR modified Ho$\check{r}$ava gravity
without cosmological constant ($\sim \Lambda_{W}$). An analytic formula for the
light deflection angle is obtained. For a propagating photon, the deflection
angle $\delta \phi$ increases with large values of the Ho$\check{r}$ava gravity
parameter $\omega$. Under the UV limit $\omega \longrightarrow \infty$,
deflection angle reduces to the result of usual Schwarzschild case, $4GM/R$. It
is also found that with increasing scale of astronomical observation system the
Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity should satisfy $|\omega M^2|>1.1725
\times10^{-16}$ with 12% precision for Earth system, $|\omega M^2| > 8.27649
\times 10^{-17}$ with 17% precision for Jupiter system and $|\omega M^2| >
8.27650\times 10^{-15}$ with 0.17% precision for solar system.
