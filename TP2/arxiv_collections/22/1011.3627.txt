We report results of fully non-perturbative calculations, based on Auxiliary
Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach, for the dilute neutron matter at
the density $\rho=0.003\fm^{-3}$. Fundamental quantities which characterize the
superfluid state: the single particle energy gap $\Delta(T)$, and the critical
temperature $\Tc$ have been determined. The large value of
$\Delta(0)/\Tc\approx 3.2$ indicates that the system is not a BCS-type
superfluid at low temperatures.
