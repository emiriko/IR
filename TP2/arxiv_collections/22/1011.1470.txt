One of the main necessities for population geneticists is the availability of
statistical tools that enable to accept or reject the neutral Wright-Fisher
model with high power. A number of statistical tests have been developed to
detect specific deviations from the null frequency spectrum in different
directions (i.e., Tajima's D, Fu and Li's F and D test, Fay and Wu's H).
Recently, a general framework was proposed to generate all neutrality tests
that are linear functions of the frequency spectrum. In this framework, a
family of optimal tests was developed to have almost maximum power against a
specific alternative evolutionary scenario. Following these developments, in
this paper we provide a thorough discussion of linear and nonlinear neutrality
tests. First, we present the general framework for linear tests and emphasize
the importance of the property of scalability with the sample size (that is,
the results of the tests should not depend on the sample size), which, if
missing, can guide to errors in data interpretation. The motivation and
structure of linear optimal tests are discussed. In a further generalization,
we develop a general framework for nonlinear neutrality tests and we derive
nonlinear optimal tests for polynomials of any degree in the frequency
spectrum.
