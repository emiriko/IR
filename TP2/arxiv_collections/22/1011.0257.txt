We present some preliminary results of the project on finite temperature QCD
with overlap fermions at KEK. We performed a series of simulations to assess
the effects of fixing the topological sector at finite temperature and we will
show the first calculations of topological susceptibility and meson masses for
quenched and full QCD.
