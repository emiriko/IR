We show that a generalization of the BCFW recursion relations gives a new and
efficient method of computing correlation functions of the stress tensor or
conserved currents in conformal field theories with an AdS_p dual, for p > 4,
in the limit where the bulk theory is approximated by tree-level Yang-Mills or
gravity. In supersymmetric theories, additional correlators of operators that
live in the same multiplet as a conserved current or stress tensor can be
computed by these means.
