We study cosmological dynamics and late-time evolution of an extended induced
gravity braneworld scenario. In this scenario, curvature effects are taken into
account via the Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action and there is also a
Chaplygin gas component on the brane. We show that this model mimics an
effective phantom behavior in a relatively wider range of redshifts than
previously formulated models. It also provides a natural framework for smooth
crossing of the phantom-divide line due to presence of the Chaplygin gas
component on the brane. We confront the model with observational data from type
Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave Background and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to
constraint the model parameters space.
