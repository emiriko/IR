We show that the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky averaging in the canonical
formulation can be used as a method for constructing effective Hamiltonians in
the theory of strongly correlated electron systems. As an example, we consider
the transition from the Hamiltonians of the Hubbard and Anderson models to the
respective Hamiltonians of the t-J and Kondo models. This is a very general
method, has several advantages over other methods, and can be used to solve a
wide range of problems in the physics of correlated systems.
