Given a positive closed (1,1)-current $T$ defined on the regular locus of a
projective variety $X$ with bounded mass near the singular part of $X$ and $Y$
an irreducible algebraic subset of $X$, we present uniform estimates for the
locus inside $Y$ where the Lelong numbers of $T$ are larger than the generic
Lelong number of $T$ along $Y$.
