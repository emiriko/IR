The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is a fundamental result in probability with
several applications in the design and analysis of algorithms in high
dimensional geometry. Most known constructions of linear embeddings that
satisfy the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property involve randomness. We address the
question of explicitly constructing such embedding families and provide a
construction with an almost optimal use of randomness: we use
O(log(n/delta)log(log(n/delta)/epsilon)) random bits for embedding n dimensions
to O(log(1/delta)/epsilon^2) dimensions with error probability at most delta,
and distortion at most epsilon.
  In particular, for delta = 1/poly(n) and fixed epsilon, we use O(log n loglog
n) random bits. Previous constructions required at least O(log^2 n) random bits
to get polynomially small error.
