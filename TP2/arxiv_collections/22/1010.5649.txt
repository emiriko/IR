A gauge model with chiral color symmetry of quarks is considered and possible
effects of the color $G'$-boson octet predicted by this symmetry are
investigated. The contributions of the $G'$-boson to the cross section
$\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ and to the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{\rm FB}^{p \bar
p}$ of $t\bar{t}$ production at the Tevatron are calculated and analysed in
dependence on two free parameters of the model, the mixing angle $\theta_G$ and
$G'$ mass $m_{G'}$. The $G'$-boson contributions to $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ and
$A_{\rm FB}^{p \bar p}$ are shown to be consistent with the Tevatron data on
$\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ and $A_{\rm FB}^{p \bar p}$, the allowed region in the
$m_{G'} - \theta_G$ plane is discussed and around $m_{G'}=1.2 \, TeV, \;
\theta_G=14^\circ $ the region of $1 \sigma$ consistency is found.
