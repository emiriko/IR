In previous works, we constructed UV-finite and unitary scalar field theories
with an infinite spectrum of propagating modes for arbitrary polynomial
interactions. In this paper, we introduce infinitely many massive vector fields
into a U(1) gauge theory to construct a theory with UV-finiteness and
unitarity.
