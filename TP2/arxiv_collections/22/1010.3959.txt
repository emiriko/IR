We present a quantum electrodynamical model involving nitrogen-vacancy
centers coupled to a whispering-gallery mode cavity. Two schemes are considered
to create W state and Bell state, respectively. One of the schemes makes use of
the Raman transition with the cavity field virtually excited; The other enables
the Bell state preparation and quantum information transfer by virtue of dark
state evolution and adiabatic passage, which is tolerant to ambient noise and
experimental parameter fluctuations. We justify our schemes by considering the
experimental feasibility and challenge using currently available technology.
