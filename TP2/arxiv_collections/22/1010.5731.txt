In this paper, we study the non-trivial interactions between the ionic Steric
effects and Electric Double Layer (EDL) overlap phenomenon on the resultant
electro-chemical transport in narrow fluidic confinements. Through a
comprehensive mathematical model, we demonstrate that more prominent Steric
effects may result in greater magnitudes of the channel centerline potential.
However, since the magnitude of the zeta potential also gets perpetually
enhanced with Steric interactions, this phenomenon cannot by be considered by
itself as a trivial interpreter of an augmentation in the extent of the
effective EDL overlap. Further investigations in this regard, however, do
reveal an intricate coupling between EDL overlap phenomenon and finite ionic
size effects, so as to result in an effective enhancement in the extent of EDL
overlap, far beyond what is predicted by classical electrochemical
considerations. Insights are also provided on the possible implications of the
intricate interactions of the underlying physico-chemical mechanisms on the
design of future- generation nanofluidic devices.
