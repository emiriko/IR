We present results from a model of the chemical evolution of protoplanetary
disks. In our models we directly calculate the changing propagation and
penetration of a high energy radiation field with Lyman alpha radiation
included. We also explore the effect on our models of including dust grain
settling. We find that, in agreement with earlier studies, the evolution of
dust grains plays a large role in determining how deep the UV radiation
penetrates into the disk. Significant grain settling at the midplane leads to
much smaller freeze-out regions and a correspondingly larger molecular layer,
which leads to an increase in column density for molecular species such as CO,
CN and SO. The inclusion of Lyman alpha radiation impacts the disk chemistry
through specific species that have large photodissociation cross sections at
1216 A. These include HCN, NH3 and CH4, for which the column densities are
decreased by an order of magnitude or more due to the presence of Lyman alpha
radiation in the UV spectrum. A few species, such as CO2 and SO, are enhanced
by the presence of Lyman alpha radiation, but rarely by more than a factor of a
few.
