We live near a magnetic star whose cycles of activity are driven by dynamo
action beneath the surface. In the solar convection zone, rotation couples with
plasma motions to build highly organized magnetic fields that erupt at the
surface and undergo relatively regular cycles of polarity reversal. Despite our
proximity to the Sun, the nature of its dynamo remains elusive, but
observations of other solar-type stars show that surface magnetism is a nearly
ubiquitous feature. In recent time, numerical simulations of convection and
dynamo action have taken tremendous strides forward. Global-scale organization
and cyclic magnetism are being achieved by several groups in distinctly
different solar and stellar simulations. Here I will talk about advances on the
numerical front including wreath-building dynamos which may occupy stellar
convection zones. I will discuss the interplay between the new simulations,
various classes of mean-field models, and current and upcoming solar and
stellar observations.
