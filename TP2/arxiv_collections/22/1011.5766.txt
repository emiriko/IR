We report on the generation of entangled states of light between the
wavelengths 810 and 1550 nm in the continuous variable regime. The fields were
produced by type I optical parametric oscillation in a standing-wave cavity
build around a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal, operated
above threshold. Balanced homodyne detection was used to detect the
non-classical noise properties, while filter cavities provided the local
oscillators by separating carrier fields from the entangled sidebands. We were
able to obtain an inseparability of I=0.82, corresponding to about -0.86 dB of
non-classical quadrature correlation.
