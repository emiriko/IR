It is shown that the superconducting energy gap necessarily lead to the
disappearance of some quasi-electrons, thus we suggest a new boson-fermion
Hamiltonian to describe superconductivity. The new supercurrent equations are
derived with this Hamiltonian. Some new results can be found besides the zero
resistance effect, the Meissner effect and the magnetic flux quantum can be
explained.
