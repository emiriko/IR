We present results for X-ray point sources in the Sc galaxy NGC 2276,
obtained by analyzing Chandra data. The galaxy is known to be very active in
many wavelengths, possibly due to gravitational interaction with the central
elliptical of the group, NGC 2300. However, previous XMM-Newton observations
resulted in the detection of only one bright ULX and extended hot gas emission.
We present here the X-ray population in NGC 2276 which comprises 17 sources. We
found that 6 of them are new ULX sources in this spiral galaxy resolved for the
first time by Chandra. We constructed the Luminosity Function that can be
interpreted as mainly due of High Mass X-ray binaries, and estimate the Star
Formation rate (SFR) to be SFR ~ 5-10 M_sun/yr.
