The possibility to search for lepton number violating signals at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) in the colored seesaw scenario is investigated. In this
context the fields that generate neutrino masses at the one-loop level are
scalar and Majorana fermionic color-octets of SU(3). Due to the QCD strong
interaction these states may be produced at the LHC with a favorable rate. We
study the production mechanisms and decays relevant to search for lepton number
violation signals in the channels with same-sign dileptons. In the simplest
case when the two fermionic color-octets are degenerate in mass, one could use
their decays to distinguish between the neutrino spectra. We find that for
fermionic octets with mass up to about 1 TeV the number of same-sign dilepton
events is larger than the standard model background indicating a promising
signal for new physics.
