Optical cavity cooling of mechanical resonators has recently become a
research frontier. The cooling has been realized with a metal-coated silicon
microlever via photo-thermal force and subsequently with dielectric objects via
radiation pressure. Here we report cavity cooling with a crystalline
semiconductor membrane via a new mechanism, in which the cooling force arises
from the interaction between the photo-induced electron-hole pairs and the
mechanical modes through the deformation potential coupling. The optoelectronic
mechanism is so efficient as to cool a mode down to 4 K from room temperature
with just 50 uW of light and a cavity with a finesse of 10 consisting of a
standard mirror and the sub-wavelength-thick semiconductor membrane itself. The
laser-cooled narrow-band phonon bath realized with semiconductor mechanical
resonators may open up a new avenue for photonics and spintronics devices.
