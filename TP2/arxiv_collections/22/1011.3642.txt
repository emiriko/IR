Consider a probability distribution subordinate to a subexponential
distribution with finite mean. In this paper, we discuss the second order tail
behavior of the subordinated distribution within a rather general framework in
which we do not require the existence of density functions. For this aim, the
so-called second order subexponential distribution is proposed and some related
properties of its are established. Our results unified and improved some
classical results.
