A selfconsistent calculation of heavy-quark (HQ) and quarkonium properties in
the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is conducted to quantify flavor transport and
color screening in the medium. The main tool is a thermodynamic $T$-matrix
approach to compute HQ and quarkonium spectral functions in both scattering and
bound-state regimes. The $T$-matrix, in turn, is employed to calculate HQ
selfenergies which are implemented into spectral functions beyond the
quasiparticle approximation. Charmonium spectral functions are used to evaluate
eulcidean-time correlation functions which are compared to results from thermal
lattice QCD. The comparisons are performed in various hadronic channels
including zero-mode contributions consistently accounting for finite
charm-quark width effects. The zero modes are closely related to the
charm-quark number susceptibility which is also compared to existing lattice
"data". Both the susceptibility and the heavy-light quark $T$-matrix are
applied to calculate the thermal charm-quark relaxation rate, or, equivalently,
the charm diffusion constant in the QGP. Implications of our findings in the HQ
sector for the viscosity-to-entropy-density ratio of the QGP are briefly
discussed.
