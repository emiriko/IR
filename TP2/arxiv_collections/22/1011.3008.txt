The room-temperature longitudinal piezoresistance of n-type and p-type
crystalline silicon along selected crystal axes is investigated under uniaxial
compressive stresses up to 3 GPa. While the conductance ($G$) of n-type silicon
eventually saturates at $\approx 45%$ of its zero-stress value ($G_0$) in
accordance with the charge transfer model, in p-type material $G/G_0$ increases
above a predicted limit of $\approx 4.5$ without any significant saturation,
even at 3 GPa. Calculation of $G/G_0$ using \textit{ab-initio} density
functional theory reveals that neither $G$ nor the mobility, when properly
averaged over the hole distribution, saturate at stresses lower than 3 GPa. The
lack of saturation has important consequences for strained silicon
technologies.
