We study the shape of $\Lambda$ hypernuclei in the full ($\beta,\gamma$)
deformation plane, including both axially symmetric and triaxial quadrupole
deformations. To this end, we use the constrained Skyrme Hartree-Fock+BCS
method on the three-dimensional Cartesian mesh. The potential energy surface is
analyzed for carbon hypernuclei as well as for sd-shell hypernuclei such as
$^{27,29}_{\Lambda}$Si and $^{25,27}_{\Lambda}$Mg. We show that the potential
energy surface in the ($\beta,\gamma$) plane is similar to each other between
the hypernuclei and the corresponding core nuclei, although the addition of
$\Lambda$ hyperon makes the energy surface somewhat softer along the $\gamma$
direction. Our calculation implies that the energy of the $\gamma$ vibration
for $^{25,27}_{\Lambda}$Mg nuclei is lowered by about 0.15 MeV with respect to
that of $^{24,26}$Mg nuclei.
