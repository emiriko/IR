Renewed interest in deriving gravity (more precisely, the Einstein equations)
from thermodynamics considerations [1, 2] is stirred up by a recent proposal
that 'gravity is an entropic force' [3] (see also [4]). Even though I find the
arguments justifying such a claim in this latest proposal rather ad hoc and
simplistic compared to the original one I would unreservedly support the call
to explore deeper the relation between gravity and thermodynamics, this having
the same spirit as my long-held view that general relativity is the
hydrodynamic limit [5, 6] of some underlying theories for the microscopic
structure of spacetime - all these proposals, together with that of [7, 8],
attest to the emergent nature of gravity [9]. In this first paper of two we set
the modest goal of studying the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of classical
matter only, bringing afore some interesting prior results, without invoking
any quantum considerations such as Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, holography or
Unruh effect. This is for the sake of understanding the nonequilibrium nature
of classical gravity which is at the root of many salient features of black
hole physics. One important property of gravitational systems, from
self-gravitating gas to black holes, is their negative heat capacity, which is
the source of many out-of-the ordinary dynamical and thermodynamic features
such as the non-existence in isolated systems of thermodynamically stable
configurations, which actually provides the condition for gravitational
stability. A related property is that, being systems with long range
interaction, they are nonextensive and relax extremely slowly towards
equilibrium. Here we explore how much of the known features of black hole
thermodynamics can be derived from this classical nonequilibrium perspective. A
sequel paper will address gravity and nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum
fields [10].
