We describe x-ray resonant magnetic diffraction measurements at the Fe K-edge
of both the parent BaFe2As2 and superconducting Ba(Fe0.953Co0.047)2As2
compounds. From these high-resolution measurements we conclude that the
magnetic structure is commensurate for both compositions. The energy spectrum
of the resonant scattering is in reasonable agreement with theoretical
calculations using the full-potential linear augmented plane wave method with a
local density functional.
