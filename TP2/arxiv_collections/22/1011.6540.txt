We show that the Unruh effect can create net quantum entanglement between
inertial and accelerated observers depending on the choice of the inertial
state. This striking result banishes the extended belief that the Unruh effect
can only destroy entanglement and furthermore provides a new and unexpected
source for finding experimental evidence of the Unruh and Hawking effects.
