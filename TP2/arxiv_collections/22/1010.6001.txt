The maximum mass of a neutron star (NS) is poorly defined. Theoretical
attempts to define this mass have thus far been unsuccessful. Observational
results currently provide the only means of narrowing this mass range down.
Eclipsing X-ray binary (XRB) pulsar systems are the only interacting binaries
in which the mass of the NS may be measured directly. Only 10 such systems are
known to exist, 6 of which have yielded NS masses in the range 1.06 - 1.86
M$_{\odot}$.We present the first orbital solutions of two further eclipsing
systems, OAO 1657-415 and EXO 1722-363, whose donor stars have only recently
been identified. Using observations obtained using the VLT/ISAAC NIR
spectrograph, our initial work was concerned with providing an accurate
spectral classification of the two counterpart stars, leading to a consistent
explanation of the mechanism for spin period evolution of OAO 1657-415.
Calculating radial velocities allowed orbital solutions for both systems to be
computed. These are the first accurate determinations of the NS and counterpart
masses in XRB pulsar systems to be made employing NIR spectroscopy.
