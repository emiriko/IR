The QCDSF collaboration has investigated the distribution amplitudes and
wavefunction normalization constants of the nucleon and its parity partner, the
$N^* (1535)$. We report on recent progress in the calculation of these
quantities on configurations with two dynamical flavors of
$\mathcal{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions. New data at pion masses of
approximately 270 MeV helps in significantly reducing errors in the
extrapolation to the physical point.
