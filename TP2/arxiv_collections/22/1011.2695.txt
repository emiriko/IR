The FINUDA experiment collected data to study the production of hypernuclei
on different nuclear targets. The hypernucleus formation occurred through the
strangeness-exchange reaction $K^-_{stop} + \; ^AZ \rightarrow \; ^A_{\Lambda}Z
+ \pi^-$. From the analysis of the momentum of the emerging $\pi^-$, binding
energies and formation probabilities of $^7_{\Lambda}$Li, $^9_{\Lambda}$Be,
$^{13}_{\Lambda}$C and $^{16}_{\Lambda}$O have been measured and are here
presented. The behavior of the formation probability as a function of the
atomic mass number A is also discussed.
