The objective of this paper is to present a Mixed Reality System (MRS) for
rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. The system answers the following
challenges: (i) increase motivation of patients by making the training a
personalized experience; (ii) take into account patients' impairments by
offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities; (iii) make it
possible to therapists to track patient's activities and to evaluate/track
their progress; (iv) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele
rehabilitation; (v) and provide an economically acceptable system by reducing
both equipment and management costs. In order to test this system a pilot study
has been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand
the potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists
who 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional
rehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another
using a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown
the MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation.
