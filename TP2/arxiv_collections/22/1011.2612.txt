We investigate the phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the minimal $B-L$
extension of the Standard Model. We present results for both the foreseen
energy stages of the Large Hadron Collider ($\sqrt s=7$ and 14 TeV). We show
that in such a scenario several novel production and decay channels involving
the two physical Higgs states could be accessed at such a machine. Amongst
these, several Higgs signatures have very distinctive features with respect to
those of other models with enlarged Higgs sector, as they involve interactions
of Higgs bosons between themselves, with $Z'$ bosons as well as with heavy
neutrinos.
