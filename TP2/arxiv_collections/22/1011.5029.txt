Near-Earth asteroid 162173 (1999 JU3) is a potential flyby and rendezvous
target for interplanetary missions because of its easy to reach orbit. The
physical and thermal properties of the asteroid are relevant for establishing
the scientific mission goals and also important in the context of near-Earth
object studies in general. Our goal was to derive key physical parameters such
as shape, spin-vector, size, geometric albedo, and surface properties of 162173
(1999 JU3). With three sets of published thermal observations (ground-based
N-band, Akari IRC, Spitzer IRS), we applied a thermophysical model to derive
the radiometric properties of the asteroid. The calculations were performed for
the full range of possible shape and spin-vector solutions derived from the
available sample of visual lightcurve observations. The near-Earth asteroid
162173 (1999 JU3) has an effective diameter of 0.87 +/- 0.03 km and a geometric
albedo of 0.070 +/- 0.006. The chi2-test reveals a strong preference for a
retrograde sense of rotation with a spin-axis orientation of lambda_ecl = 73
deg, beta_ecl = -62 deg and P_sid = 7.63 +/- 0.01 h. The most likely thermal
inertia ranges between 200 and 600 Jm-2s-0.5K-1, about a factor of 2 lower than
the value for 25143 Itokawa. This indicates that the surface lies somewhere
between a thick-dust regolith and a rock/boulder/cm-sized, gravel-dominated
surface like that of 25143 Itokawa. Our analysis represents the first time that
shape and spin-vector information has been derived from a combined data set of
visual lightcurves (reflected light) and mid-infrared photometry and
spectroscopy (thermal emission).
