The blazar CTA 102 underwent a major radio flare in April 2006. We used
several 15 GHz VLBI observations from the MOJAVE program to investigate the
influence of this extreme event on jet kinematics. The result of modeling and
analysis lead to the suggestion of an interaction between traveling and
standing shocks 0.2 mas away from the VLBI core.
