Compressed sensing is a novel technique where one can recover sparse signals
from the undersampled measurements. In this paper, a $K \times N$ measurement
matrix for compressed sensing is deterministically constructed via
multiplicative character sequences. Precisely, a constant multiple of a cyclic
shift of an $M$-ary power residue or Sidelnikov sequence is arranged as a
column vector of the matrix, through modulating a primitive $M$-th root of
unity. The Weil bound is then used to show that the matrix has asymptotically
optimal coherence for large $K$ and $M$, and to present a sufficient condition
on the sparsity level for unique sparse solution. Also, the restricted isometry
property (RIP) is statistically studied for the deterministic matrix. Numerical
results show that the deterministic compressed sensing matrix guarantees
reliable matching pursuit recovery performance for both noiseless and noisy
measurements.
