This document derives the CPHD filter for extended targets. Only the update
step is derived here. Target generated measurements, false alarms and prior are
all assumed to be independent identically distributed cluster processes. We
also prove here that the derived CPHD filter for extended targets reduce to PHD
filter for extended targets and CPHD filter for standard targets under suitable
assumptions.
