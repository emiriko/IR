The search for neutrinoless double beta decay is a very active field in which
the number of proposals for next-generation experiments has proliferated. In
this paper we attempt to address both the sense and the sensitivity of such
proposals. Sensitivity comes first, by means of proposing a simple and
unambiguous statistical recipe to derive the sensitivity to a putative Majorana
neutrino mass, m_bb. In order to make sense of how the different experimental
approaches compare, we apply this recipe to a selection of proposals, comparing
the resulting sensitivities. We also propose a "physics-motivated range" (PMR)
of the nuclear matrix elements as a unifying criterium between the different
nuclear models. The expected performance of the proposals is parametrized in
terms of only four numbers: energy resolution, background rate (per unit time,
isotope mass and energy), detection efficiency, and bb isotope mass. For each
proposal, both a reference and an optimistic scenario for the experimental
performance are studied. In the reference scenario we find that all the
proposals will be able to partially explore the degenerate spectrum, without
fully covering it, although four of them (KamLAND-Zen, CUORE, NEXT and EXO)
will approach the 50 meV boundary. In the optimistic scenario, we find that
CUORE and the xenon-based proposals (KamLAND-Zen, EXO and NEXT) will explore a
significant fraction of the inverse hierarchy, with NEXT covering it almost
fully. For the long term future, we argue that Xe-based experiments may provide
the best case for a 1-ton scale experiment, given the potentially very low
backgrounds achievable and the expected scalability to large isotope masses.
