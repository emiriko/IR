The increasing interest of nanowhiskers for technological applications has
led to the observation of the zinc-blend/wurtzite polytypism. Polytypic
nanowhiskers could also play, by their characteristics, an important role on
the design of optical and electronic devices. In this work we propose a
theoretical model to calculate the electronic properties of polytypic
zinc-blend/wurtzite structure in the vicinity of the band edges. Our
formulation is based on the $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ method connecting the
irreducible representations in the interface of the two different crystalline
phases by group theory arguments. Analyzing the composition of the states in
the $\Gamma$ point and the overlap integrals of the envelope functions we
predict energy transitions that agree with experimental photoluminescence
spectra.
