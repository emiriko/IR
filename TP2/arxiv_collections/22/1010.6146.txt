We use Monte Carlo simulations to study properties of Anderson's
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) spin-liquid state on the square lattice (i.e.,
the equal superposition of all pairing of spins into nearest-neighbor singlet
pairs) and compare with the classical dimer model (CDM). The latter system also
corresponds to the ground state of the Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model at
its critical point. We find that although spin-spin correlations decay
exponentially in the RVB, four-spin valence-bond-solid (VBS) correlations are
critical, qualitatively like the well-known dimer-dimer correlations of the
CDM, but decaying more slowly (as $1/r^a$ with $a \approx 1.20$, compared with
$a=2$ for the CDM). We also compute the distribution of monomer (defect) pair
separations, which decay by a larger exponent in the RVB than in the CDM. We
further study both models in their different winding number sectors and
evaluate the relative weights of different sectors. Like the CDM, all the
observed RVB behaviors can be understood in the framework of a mapping to a
"height" model characterized by a gradient-squared stiffness constant $K$. Four
independent measurements consistently show a value $K_{RVB} \approx 1.6
K_{CDM}$, with the same kinds of numerical evaluations of $K_{CDM}$ give
results in agreement with the rigorously known value $K_{CDM}=\pi/16$. The
background of a nonzero winding number gradient $W/L$ introduces spatial
anisotropies and an increase in the effective K, both of which can be
understood as a consequence of anharmonic terms in the height-model free
energy, which are of relevance to the recently proposed scenario of "Cantor
deconfinement" in extended quantum dimer models. We also study ensembles in
which fourth-neighbor (bipartite) bonds are allowed, at a density controlled by
a tunable fugacity, resulting (as expected) in a smooth reduction of K.
