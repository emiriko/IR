Binaries are not always neatly aligned. Previous observations of the DI Her
system showed that the spin axes of both stars are highly inclined with respect
to one another and the orbital axis. Here we report on a measurement of the
spin-axis orientation of the primary star of the NY Cep system, which is
similar to DI Her in many respects: it features two young early-type stars (~6
Myr, B0.5V+B2V), in an eccentric and relatively long-period orbit (e=0.48,
P=15.d3). The sky projections of the rotation vector and the spin vector are
well-aligned (beta_p = 2 +- 4 degrees), in strong contrast to DI Her. Although
no convincing explanation has yet been given for the misalignment of DI Her,
our results show that the phenomenon is not universal, and that a successful
theory will need to account for the different outcome in the case of NY Cep.
