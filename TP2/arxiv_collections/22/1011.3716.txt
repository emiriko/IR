The Great Bend of the river Nile contains the Bayuda region with its volcanic
core. Along the river, a fertile strip of land has attracting human settlement
for thousands of years and is then rich of archaeological sites. The
distribution of the sites near the Nile can be detected using Google Maps
imagery. We can see many area covered by small mounds, probably burial sites.
Some of the archaeological places are currently under the water of the Merowe
Dam. With the satellite imagery, we have a portrait of the area close the dam
before the closing of its gates.
