Recently, the old notion of causal boundary for a spacetime V has been
redefined in a consistent way. The computation of this boundary $\partial V$
for a standard conformally stationary spacetime V = R x M, suggests a natural
compactification $M_B$ associated to any Riemannian metric on M or, more
generally, to any Finslerian one. The corresponding boundary $\partial_B M$ is
constructed in terms of Busemann-type functions. Roughly, $\partial_B M$
represents the set of all the directions in M including both, asymptotic and
"finite" (or "incomplete") directions. This Busemann boundary $\partial_B M$ is
related to two classical boundaries: the Cauchy boundary and the Gromov
boundary. Our aims are: (1) to study the subtleties of both, the Cauchy
boundary for any generalized (possibly non-symmetric) distance and the Gromov
compactification for any (possibly incomplete) Finsler manifold, (2) to
introduce the new Busemann compactification $M_B$, relating it with the
previous two completions, and (3) to give a full description of the causal
boundary $\partial V$ of any standard conformally stationary spacetime.
