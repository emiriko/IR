New sets of experimental wavenumber values for triplet-triplet rovibronic
transitions of $H_2$ and $D_2$ for visible part of spectrum ($400 \div 700$ nm)
have been obtained. The digital intensity registration providing a linear
response of the detector gave us the opportunity of digital deconvolution of
the recorded line profiles. For line centers that made it possible to reach an
accuracy ($< 0.0006$ nm) limited only by selfconsistency of various wavenumber
standards. New sets of wavenumber values were obtained with accuracy $0.006
\div 0.05$ cm$^{-1}$.
