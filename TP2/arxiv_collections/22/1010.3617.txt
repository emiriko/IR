We have investigated charge transport in ultrasmall superconducting single
and double Josephson junctions coupled to resonant modes of the electromagnetic
environment. We observe pronounced current peaks in the transport
characteristics of both types of devices and attribute them to the process
involving simultaneous tunneling of Cooper pairs and photon emission into the
resonant modes. The experimental data is well reproduced with the theoretical
models.
