We present a benchmark in the parameter space of the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) that provides for a dramatic multi-lepton
signal and no jets containing 5 or more leptons resulting from the cascade
decays of the third lightest neutralino, $\chi^{0}_{3}$, and the lightest
chargino, $\chi^{\pm}_{1}$, via light charged sleptons. This is a very clean
signal with almost no Standard Model (SM) background. In some cases, a total
signal of $\ge 3 $leptons + 0 jets can be detected at the $5 \sigma$ level at
the LHC running at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV with approximately 3 fb$^{-1}$ of data and
with less than 1 fb$^{-1}$ when running at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. In addition,
kinematic edges in the invariant mass distributions of 2, 3, and 4 leptons are
easily detectable with large integrated luminosities ($\sim 600$ fb$^{-1}$)
which can lead to simple measurements of the mass differences of heavy
particles in the decay chains, including all combinations of the three lightest
neutralinos.
