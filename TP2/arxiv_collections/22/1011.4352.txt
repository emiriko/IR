The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) provides quantitative
measures of terrestrial water storage (TWS) change. GRACE data show a
significant decrease in TWS in the lower (southern) La Plata river basin of
South America over the period 2002-2009, consistent with recognized drought
conditions in the region. GRACE data reveal a detailed picture of temporal and
spatial evolution of this severe drought event, which suggests that the drought
began in lower La Plata in around austral spring 2008 and then spread to the
entire La Plata basin and peaked in austral fall 2009. During the peak, GRACE
data show an average TWS deficit of ~12 cm (equivalent water layer thickness)
below the 7 year mean, in a broad region in lower La Plata. GRACE measurements
are consistent with accumulated precipitation data from satellite remote
sensing and with vegetation index changes derived from Terra satellite
observations. The Global Land Data Assimilation System model captures the
drought event but underestimates its intensity. Limited available
groundwater-level data in southern La Plata show significant groundwater
depletion, which is likely associated with the drought in this region.
GRAC-observed TWS change and precipitation anomalies in the studied region
appear to closely correlate with the ENSO climate index, with dry and wet
seasons corresponding to La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no events, respectively.
