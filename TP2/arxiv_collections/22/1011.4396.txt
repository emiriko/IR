The performances of a new data processing technique, namely the Empirical
Mode Decomposition, are evaluated on a fully developed turbulent velocity
signal perturbed by a numerical forcing which mimics a long-period flapping.
First, we introduce a "resemblance" criterion to discriminate between the
polluted and the unpolluted modes extracted from the perturbed velocity signal
by means of the Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm. A rejection procedure,
playing, somehow, the role of a high-pass filter, is then designed in order to
infer the original velocity signal from the perturbed one. The quality of this
recovering procedure is extensively evaluated in the case of a "mono-component"
perturbation (sine wave) by varying both the amplitude and the frequency of the
perturbation. An excellent agreement between the recovered and the reference
velocity signals is found, even though some discrepancies are observed when the
perturbation frequency overlaps the frequency range corresponding to the
energy-containing eddies as emphasized by both the energy spectrum and the
structure functions. Finally, our recovering procedure is successfully
performed on a time-dependent perturbation (linear chirp) covering a broad
range of frequencies.
