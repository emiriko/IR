We present BV(RI)_C photometric measurements of the dM4-type V374 Peg
covering ~430 days. The star has a mass of ~0.28M_Sun, so it is supposed to be
fully convective. Previous observations detected almost-rigid-body rotation and
stable, axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. Our photometric data agree well
with this picture, one persistent active nest is found on the stellar surface.
Nevertheless, the surface is not static: night-to-night variations and frequent
flaring are observed. The flares seem to be concentrated on the brighter part
of the surface. The short-time changes of the light curve could indicate
emerging flux ropes in the same region, resembling to the active nests on the
Sun. We have observed flaring and quiet states of V374 Peg changing on monthly
timescale.
