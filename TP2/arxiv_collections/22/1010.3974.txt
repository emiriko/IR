Within the framework of the QCD sum rules, we consider the three-point
correlation function, work at the limit q^2 -> 0 and m_\pi -> 0, and pick out
the singular term ~ {1\over q^2} to extract the pionic coupling constants of
the 1^{-+} hybrid meson. Then we calculate the decay widths of different modes.
The decay width of the S-wave modes b_1 \pi, f_1\pi increases quickly as the
hybrid meson mass and decay momentum increase. But for the low mass hybrid
meson around 1.6 GeV, the P-wave decay mode \rho \pi is very important and its
width is around 180 MeV, while the widths of \eta \pi and \eta^\prime \pi are
strongly suppressed. We suggest the experimental search of \pi_1(1600) through
the decay chains at BESIII: e^+e^- -> J/\psi(\psi') -> \pi_1 +\gamma or e^+e^-
-> J/\psi(\psi') -> \pi_1 +\rho where the \pi_1 state can be reconstructed
through the decay modes \pi_1 -> \rho\pi -> \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0 or \pi_1 ->
f_1(1285)\pi^0. It is also interesting to look for \pi_1 using the available
BELLE/BABAR data through the process e^+e^- -> \gamma^\ast -> \rho\pi_1,
b_1\pi_1, \gamma \pi_1 etc.
