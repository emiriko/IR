Bound states of the Hamiltonian describing a quantum particle living on three
dimensional straight strip of width $d$ are investigated. We impose the Neumann
boundary condition on the two concentric windows of the radii $a$ and $ b$
located on the opposite walls and the Dirichlet boundary condition on the
remaining part of the boundary of the strip. We prove that such a system
exhibits discrete eigenvalues below the essential spectrum for any $a,b>0$.
When $a$ and $b$ tend to the infinity, the asymptotic of the eigenvalue is
derived. A comparative analysis with the one-window case reveals that due to
the additional possibility of the regulating energy spectrum the anticrossing
structure builds up as a function of the inner radius with its sharpness
increasing for the larger outer radius. Mathematical and physical
interpretation of the obtained results is presented; namely, it is derived that
the anticrossings are accompanied by the drastic changes of the wave function
localization. Parallels are drawn to the other structures exhibiting similar
phenomena; in particular, it is proved that, contrary to the two-dimensional
geometry, at the critical Neumann radii true bound states exist.
