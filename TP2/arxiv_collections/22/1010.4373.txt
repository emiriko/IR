We construct the general pion-nucleon SU(2) Lagrangian including both virtual
photons and leptons for relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to
fourth order. We include the light leptons as explicit dynamical degrees of
freedom by introducing new building blocks which represent these leptons.
