Supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are very common. They are
known to rotate, accrete, spin down and eject highly relativistic jets; those
jets pointed at us all seem to show a spectrum with two strong bumps, one in
the TeV photon range, and one in X-rays - ordered by the emission frequency of
the first bump this constitutes the blazar sequence. Here we wish to explain
this sequence as the combined interaction of electrons and protons with the
magnetic field and radiation field at the first strong shockwave pattern in the
relativistic jet. With two key assumptions on particle scattering, this concept
predicts that the two basic maximum peak frequencies scale with the mass of the
central black hole as $M_{BH}^{-1/2}$, have a ratio of $(m_p/m_e)^{3}$, and the
luminosities with the mass itself $M_{BH}$. Due to strong losses of the
leptons, the peak luminosities are generally the same, but with large
variations around equality. This model predicts large fluxes in ultra high
energy cosmic rays, and also large neutrino luminosities.
