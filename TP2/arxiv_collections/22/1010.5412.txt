The lift-and-project closure is the relaxation obtained by computing all
lift-and-project cuts from the initial formulation of a mixed integer linear
program or equivalently by computing all mixed integer Gomory cuts read from
all tableau's corresponding to feasible and infeasible bases. In this paper, we
present an algorithm for approximating the value of the lift-and-project
closure. The originality of our method is that it is based on a very simple cut
generation linear programming problem which is obtained from the original
linear relaxation by simply modifying the bounds on the variables and
constraints. This separation LP can also be seen as the dual of the cut
generation LP used in disjunctive programming procedures with a particular
normalization. We study some properties of this separation LP in particular
relating it to the equivalence between lift-and-project cuts and Gomory cuts
shown by Balas and Perregaard. Finally, we present some computational
experiments and comparisons with recent related works.
