Observations at various wavelengths of late B-type stars exhibiting strong
overabundances of the chemical elements Hg and Mn in their atmospheres indicate
that these stars are frequently found in binary and multiple systems.
  We intend to study the multiplicity of this type of chemically peculiar
stars, looking for visual companions in the range of angular separation between
0.05" and 8".
  We carried out a survey of 56 stars using diffraction-limited near-infrared
imaging with NAOS-CONICA at the VLT.
  Thirty-three companion candidates in 24 binaries, three triples, and one
quadruple system were detected. Nine companion candidates were found for the
first time in this study. Five objects are likely chance projections. The
detected companion candidates have K magnitudes between 5.95m and 18.07m and
angular separations ranging from <0.05" to 7.8", corresponding to linear
projected separations of 13.5-1700 AU.
  Our study clearly confirms that HgMn stars are frequently members of binary
and multiple systems. Taking into account companions found by other techniques,
the multiplicity fraction in our sample may be as high as 91%. The membership
in binary and multiple systems seems to be a key point to understanding the
abundance patterns in these stars.
