In the article a turn-based game played on four computers connected via
network is investigated. There are three computers with natural intelligence
and one with artificial intelligence. Game table is seen by each player's own
view point in all players' monitors. Domino pieces are three dimensional. For
distributed systems TCP/IP protocol is used. In order to get 3D image,
Microsoft XNA technology is applied. Domino 101 game is nondeterministic game
that is result of the game depends on the initial random distribution of the
pieces. Number of the distributions is equal to the multiplication of following
combinations: . Moreover, in this game that is played by four people, players
are divided into 2 pairs. Accordingly, we cannot predict how the player uses
the dominoes that is according to the dominoes of his/her partner or according
to his/her own dominoes. The fact that the natural intelligence can be a player
in any level affects the outcome. These reasons make it difficult to develop an
AI. In the article four levels of AI are developed. The AI in the first level
is equivalent to the intelligence of a child who knows the rules of the game
and recognizes the numbers. The AI in this level plays if it has any domino,
suitable to play or says pass. In most of the games which can be played on the
internet, the AI does the same. But the AI in the last level is a master
player, and it can develop itself according to its competitors' levels.
