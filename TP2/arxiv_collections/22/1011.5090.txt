We perform a detailed examination of current constraints on annihilating and
decaying dark matter models from both prompt and inverse-Compton emission
photons, including both model-dependent and model-independent bounds. We also
show that the observed isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background (DGRB), which
provides one of the most conservative constraints on models of annihilating
weak-scale dark matter particles, may enhance its sensitivity by a factor of ~2
to 3 (95% C.L.) as the Fermi-LAT experiment resolves DGRB contributing blazar
sources with five years of observation. For our forecasts, we employ the
results of constraints to the luminosity-dependent density evolution plus
blazar spectral energy distribution sequence model, which is constrained by the
DGRB and blazar source count distribution function.
