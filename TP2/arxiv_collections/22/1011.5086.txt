We describe our optical and electron-microscopy observations of pearlite
structures in eutectoid steels which seem to imply that the mechanisms of
formation of pearlite colonies in these steels differ from those observed
earlier for non-eutectoid steels. A simple theoretical model to study kinetics
of pearlite transformations is suggested. Simulations of growth of pearlite
colonies based on this model reveal that for the volume carbon diffusion
mechanism usually-supposed such growth is always unstable, and the steady-state
growth can be realized only via the interfacial carbon diffusion mechanism. A
model of formation of pearlite colonies based on the assumption of a strong
enhancement of carbon diffusion near grain boundaries is also suggested. The
model can be applicable to the plastically deformed steels, and the results of
simulations based on this model qualitatively agree with some microstructural
features of formation of pearlite colonies observed in such steels.
