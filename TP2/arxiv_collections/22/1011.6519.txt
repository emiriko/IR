We report an enhancement of superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm
c}$) when Chromium (Cr) is substituted in excess at the Iron (Fe) site
(FeCr$_x$Se, $x=$0.01, 0.02 and 0.03). There is a corresponding increase in the
superconducting volume fraction with $T_{\rm c}$ attaining a value of 11.2 K on
2 $%$ Cr substitution when compared to a $T_{\rm c}$ of 8.5 K for the
conventional tetragonal Fe-excess sample Fe$_{1+x}$Se. The results point to the
role of chemical pressure (introduced via ionic size variation at the Fe site
upon Cr substitution in excess) on superconducting properties.
