W' gauge bosons are good candidates for early LHC discovery. We define two
reference models, one containing a W'_R and one containing a W'_L, which may
serve as ``simplified models'' for presenting experimental results of W'
searches at the LHC. We present the Tevatron bounds on each model and compute
the constraints from precision electroweak observables. We find that indirect
low-energy constraints on the W'_L are quite strong. However, for a W'_R
coupling to right-handed fermions there exists a sizeable region in parameter
space beyond the bounds from the Tevatron and low-energy precision measurements
where even 50 inverse picobarns of integrated LHC luminosity are sufficient to
discover the W'_R. The most promising final states are two leptons and two
jets, or one lepton recoiling against a ``neutrino jet''. A neutrino jet is a
collimated object consisting of a hard lepton and two jets arising from the
decay of a highly boosted massive neutrino.
