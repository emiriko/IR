Cloud computing is penetrating into various domains and environments, from
theoretical computer science to economy, from marketing hype to educational
curriculum and from R&D lab to enterprise IT infrastructure. Yet, the currently
developing state of cloud computing leaves several issues to address and also
affects cloud computing adoption by organizations. In this paper, we explain
how the transition into the cloud can occur in an organization and describe the
mechanism for transforming legacy infrastructure into a virtual
infrastructure-based cloud. We describe the state of the art of infrastructural
cloud, which is essential in the decision making on cloud adoption, and
highlight the challenges that can limit the scale and speed of the adoption. We
then suggest a strategic framework for designing a high performance cloud
system. This framework is applicable when transformation cloudbased deployment
model collides with some constraints. We give an example of the implementation
of the framework in a design of a budget-constrained high availability cloud
system.
