We investigate the integrability of generalized nonautonomous nonlinear
Schr\"odinger (NLS) equations governing the dynamics of the single- and
double-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The integrability conditions
obtained indicate that the existence of the nonautonomous soliton is due to the
balance between the different competition features: the kinetic energy
(dispersion) versus the harmonic external potential applied and the dispersion
versus the nonlinearity. In the double-component case, it includes all possible
different combinations between the dispersion and nonlinearity involving intra-
and inter-interactions. This result shows that the nonautonomous soliton has
the same physical origin as the canonical one, which clarifies the nature of
the nonautonomous soliton. Finally, we also discuss the dynamics of
two-component BEC by controlling the relevant experimental parameters.
