We study chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, using as ingredients in the quark
gap equation recent lattice results for the gluon and ghost propagators. The
Ansatz employed for the quark-gluon vertex is purely non-Abelian, introducing a
crucial dependence on the ghost dressing function and the quark-ghost
scattering amplitude. The numerical impact of these quantities is considerable:
the need to invoke confinement explicitly is avoided, and the dynamical quark
masses generated are of the order of 300 MeV. In addition, the pion decay
constant and the quark condensate are computed, and are found to be in good
agreement with phenomenology.
