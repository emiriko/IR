Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have
shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to
expectations from binary scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate
that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot-dense matter produced in
heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to
two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a
heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of
the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more
detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the
matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in
hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from
heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side jet suppression is
consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from
background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain
two-particle azimuthal correlations at sqrt(s_NN)=$200 GeV between electrons
from heavy-flavor decay with charged hadrons in p+p and also first results in
Au+Au collisions. We find the away-side-jet shape and yield to be modified in
Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions.
