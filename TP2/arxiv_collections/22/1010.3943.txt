We calculate the renormalized vacuum polarization and stress tensor for a
massless, arbitrarily coupled scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state
on the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole threaded by an infinte straight
cosmic string. This calculation relies on a generalized Heine identity for
non-integer Legendre functions which we derive without using specific
properties of the Legendre functions themselves.
