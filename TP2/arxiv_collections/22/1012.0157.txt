We study the thermophysical properties of dense helium plasmas by using
quantum molecular dynamics and orbital-free molecular dynamics simulations,
where densities are considered from 400 to 800 g/cm$^{3}$ and temperatures up
to 800 eV. Results are presented for the equation of state. From the
Kubo-Greenwood formula, we derive the electrical conductivity and electronic
thermal conductivity. In particular, with the increase in temperature, we
discuss the change in the Lorenz number, which indicates a transition from
strong coupling and degenerate state to moderate coupling and partial
degeneracy regime for dense helium.
