Phagocytosis is the fundamental cellular process by which eukaryotic cells
bind and engulf particles by their cell membrane. Particle engulfment involves
particle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like
fashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly
on biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for
actin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a
novel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and
study the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral
and rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not
taken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we
surprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment
proceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with
highly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions
using fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of
immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type
receptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.
Based on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed
show that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from
biological actin-driven processes. This suggests that biochemical pathways
render the evolutionary ancient process of phagocytic highly robust, allowing
cells to engulf even very large particles. The particle-shape dependence of
phagocytosis makes a systematic investigation of host-pathogen interactions and
an efficient design of a vehicle for drug delivery possible.
