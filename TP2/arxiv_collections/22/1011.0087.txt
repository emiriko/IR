When deformed, liquid foams tend to raise their liquid contents like immersed
granular materials, a phenomenon called dilatancy. We have aready described a
geometrical interpretation of elastic dilatancy in 3D foams and in very dry
foams squeezed between two solid plates (2D GG foams). Here, we complement this
work in the regime of less dry 2D GG foams. In particular, we highlight the
relatively strong dilatancy effects expected in the regime where we have
predicted rapid Plateau border variations.
