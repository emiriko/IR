Magnetic properties of a $\sigma-$Fe$_{16}$Cr$_{14}$ alloy calculated with
the charge and spin self- consistent Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) and combined
with coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) methods are reported.
Non-magnetic state as well as various magnetic orderings were considered, i.e.
ferromagnetic (FM) and more complex anti-parallel (called APM) arrangements for
selected sublattices, as follows from the symmetry analysis. It has been shown
that the Stoner criterion applied to non-magnetic density of states at the
Fermi energy, $E_F$ is satisfied for Fe atoms situated on all five lattice
sites, while it is not fulfilled for all Cr atoms. In FM and APM states, the
values of magnetic moments on Fe atoms occupying various sites are dispersed
between 0 and 2.5 $\mu_B$, and they are proportional to the number of Fe atoms
in the nearest-neighbor shell. Magnetic moments of Cr atoms havin much smaller
values were found to be coupled antiparallel to those of Fe atoms. The average
value of the magnetic moment per atom was found to be $<\mu>=0.55 \mu_B$ that
is by a factor of 4 larger than the experimental value found for a
$\sigma-$Fe$_{0.538}$Cr$_{0.462}$ sample. Conversely, admitting an anti-
parallel ordering (APM model) on atoms situated on C and D sites, according to
the group theory and symmetry analysis results, yielded a substantial reduction
of $<\mu>$ to 0.20 $\mu_B$. Further diminution of $<\mu>$ to 0.15 $\mu_B$,
which is very close to the experimental value of 0.14 $\mu_B$, has been
achieved with the KKR-CPA calculations by considering a chemical disorder on
sites B, C and D.
