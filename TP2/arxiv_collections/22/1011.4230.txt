We conclude our investigations on the QCD cross-over transition temperatures
with 2+1 staggered flavours and one-link stout improvement. We extend our
previous two studies [Phys. Lett. B643 (2006) 46, JHEP 0906:088 (2009)] by
choosing even finer lattices (N_t=16) and we work again with physical quark
masses. These new results [for details see JHEP 1009:073,2010] support our
earlier findings. We compare them with the published results of the hotQCD
collaboration. All these results are confronted with the predictions of the
Hadron Resonance Gas model and Chiral Perturbation Theory for temperatures
below the transition region. Our results can be reproduced by using the
physical spectrum. The findings of the hotQCD collaboration can be recovered
only by using a distorted spectrum. This analysis provides a simple explanation
for the observed discrepancy in the transition T between our and the hotQCD
collaborations.
