We give an update on our current project to determine the transition
temperature and the order of the deconfinement transition in the chiral limit
of two flavour QCD. We use nonperturbatively O(a) improved Wilson fermions of
the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert type, employing the efficient deflation accelerated
DDHMC algorithm. We start at lattices with N_t>=12 and pion masses below 600
MeV, aiming at chiral and continuum limits with light quarks.
