We consider a new kind of straight and shifted plane partitions/Young
tableaux --- ones whose diagrams are no longer of partition shape, but rather
Young diagrams with boxes erased from their upper right ends. We find formulas
for the number of standard tableaux in certain cases, namely a shifted
staircase without the box in its upper right corner, i.e. truncated by a box, a
rectangle truncated by a staircase and a rectangle truncated by a square minus
a box. The proofs involve finding the generating function of the corresponding
plane partitions using interpretations and formulas for sums of restricted
Schur functions and their specializations. The number of standard tableaux is
then found as a certain limit of this function.
