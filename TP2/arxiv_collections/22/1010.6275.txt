A wide class of physical distributions appears to follow the q-Gaussian form,
which plays the role of attractor according to a Central Limit Theorem
generalized in the presence of specific correlations between the relevant
random variables. In the realm of this theorem, a q-generalized Fourier
transform plays an important role. We introduce here a method which univocally
determines a distribution from the knowledge of its q-Fourier transform and
some supplementary information. This procedure involves a recently
q-generalized Dirac delta and the class of functions on which it acts. The
present method conveniently extends the inverse of the standard Fourier
transform, and is therefore expected to be very useful in the study of many
complex systems.
