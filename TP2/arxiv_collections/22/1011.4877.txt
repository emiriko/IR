The mass spectrum of the noncommutative QED in two-dimensional Euclidean
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$ space is derived first in a perturbative approach at one-loop
level and then in a nonperturbative approach using the equivalent bosonized
noncommutative effective action. It turns out that the mass spectrum of
noncommutative QED in two dimensions reduces to a single non-interacting meson
with mass $M_{\gamma}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{\pi}}$, as in commutative Schwinger model.
