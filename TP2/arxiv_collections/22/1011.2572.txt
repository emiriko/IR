We study non-linear contributions to the power spectrum of the curvature
perturbation on super-horizon scales, produced during slow-roll inflation
driven by a canonical single scalar field. We find that on large scales the
linear power spectrum completely dominates and leading non-linear corrections
remain totally negligible, indicating that we can safely rely on linear
perturbation theory to study inflationary power spectrum. We also briefly
comment on the infrared and ultraviolet behaviour of the non-linear
corrections.
