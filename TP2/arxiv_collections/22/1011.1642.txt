In the framework of differential Galois theory we treat the classical
spectral problem $\Psi"-u(x)\Psi=\lambda\Psi$ and its finite-gap potentials as
exactly solvable in quadratures by Picard--Vessiot without involving special
functions; the ideology goes back to the 1919 works by J. Drach. We show that
duality between spectral and quadrature approaches is realized through the
Weierstrass permutation theorem for a logarithmic Abelian integral. From this
standpoint we inspect known facts and obtain new ones: an important formula for
the $\Psi$-function and $\Theta$-function extensions of Picard--Vessiot fields.
In particular, extensions by Jacobi's $\theta$-functions lead to the
(quadrature) algebraically integrable equations for the $\theta$-functions
themselves.
