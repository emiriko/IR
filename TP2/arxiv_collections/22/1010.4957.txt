This paper contains a complete description of minimal non-gatherable triangle
triples in the lambda-sequences for the affine classical root systems and some
claims for arbitrary (reduced) affine root systems. It continues our previous
paper devoted to the non-affine case; interestingly, the affine theory
clarifies the classification in the non-affine case. The lambda-sequences are
associated with reduced decompositions (words) in affine Weyl groups. The
existence of the non-gatherable triples is a combinatorial obstacle for using
the technique of intertwiners in the theory of irreducible representations of
the (double) affine Hecke algebras, complementary to their algebraic-geometric
theory.
