We explore the role of mass loss and convective core overshoot in the
evolution of Classical Cepheids. Stellar evolution models are computed with a
recipe for pulsation-driven mass loss and it is found that mass loss alone is
unable to account for the long-standing Cepheid mass discrepancy. However, the
combination of mass loss and moderate convective core overshooting does provide
a solution, bringing the amount of convective core overshooting in Cepheids
closer to that found for other stars.
