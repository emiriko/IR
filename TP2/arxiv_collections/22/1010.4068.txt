On the basis of experience acquired at creation of the Pulkovo
Spectrophotometric Catalog the method of investigation of a terrestrial
atmospheric components (aerosols and water vapor) in night time are designed.
For these purposes the small-sized photometers were created. Carried out in
1995-1999{\Gamma}.{\Gamma}. series of night and daily monitoring of the
atmospheric condition in Pulkovo, in MGO by A.I.Voejkov., in Germany (complex
experiments LITFASS 98 and LACE 98) confirmed suitability of devices,
techniques of observations and their reduction designed in Pulkovo Observatory
for the solution of geophysical and ecological problems. A final aim of this
work - creation of small-sized automatic complexes (telescope + photometer),
which would be rightful component of meteorological observatories. Such
complexes will work without the help of the observer and would provide the
daily monitoring of a terrestrial atmosphere.
