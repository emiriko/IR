More than 450 stars hosting planets are known today but only approximately 30
planetary systems were discovered around stars beyond the Main Sequence. The
Penn State-Toru\'n Planet Search, putting an emphasis on extending studies of
planetary system formation and evolution to intermediate-mass stars, is
oriented towards the discoveries of substellar-mass companions to a large
sample of evolved stars using high-precision radial velocity technique. We
present the recent status of our survey and detailed characteristic for ~350
late type giant stars, i.e. the new results of radial velocity analysis and
stellar fundamental parameters obtained with extensive spectroscopic method.
Moreover, in the future we will make an attempt to perform the statistical
study of our sample and searching the correlations between the existence of
substellar objects and stellar atmospheric parameters according to previous
works which investigated the planetary companion impact on the evolution of the
host stars.
