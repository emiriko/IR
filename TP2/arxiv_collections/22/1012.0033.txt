The Liouville space spin relaxation theory equations are reformulated in such
a way as to avoid the computationally expensive Hamiltonian diagonalization
step, replacing it by numerical evaluation of the integrals in the generalized
cumulant expansion. The resulting algorithm is particularly useful in the cases
where the static part of the Ha-miltonian is dominated by interactions other
than Zeeman (e.g. in quadrupolar reson-ance, low-field EPR and Spin Chemistry).
When used together with state space re-striction tools, the algorithm reported
is capable of computing full relaxation supero-perators for NMR systems with
more than 15 spins.
