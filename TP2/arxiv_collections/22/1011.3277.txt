We discuss topological disentangler for S=1 quantum spin chains in the
Haldane phase. We first point out that Kennedy-Tasaki's(KT) nonlocal unitary
transformation is the perfect disentangler for Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki
model. We then demonstrate that the KT transformation can be reconstructed as
an assembly of pair disentanglers. Finally, we show that the KT transformation
can be regarded as a topological disentangler, which selectively disentangles
the double-fold degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum of the S=1 Heisenberg
chain.
