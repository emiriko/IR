Nearby late-type stars are excellent targets to look for young objects in
stellar associations and moving groups. The study of these groups goes back
more than one century ago however, their origin is still misunderstood.
Although their existence have been confirmed by statistical studies of large
sample of stars, the identification of a group of stars as member of moving
groups, is not an easy task, list of members often change with time and most
members have been identified by means of kinematics criteria which is not
sufficient since many old stars can share the same spatial motion of those
stars in moving groups. In this contribution we attempt to identify unambiguous
moving groups members, among a sample of nearby-late type stars. High
resolution echelle spectra is used to i) derive accurate radial velocities
which allow us to study the stars' kinematics and make a first selection of
moving groups members; and ii) analyze several age-related properties for young
late-type stars (i.e., lithium LiI 6707.8 Amstrongs, R'HK index). The different
age-estimators are compared and the moving group membership of the
kinematically selected candidates are discussed.
