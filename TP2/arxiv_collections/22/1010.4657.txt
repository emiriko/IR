It is shown that in Large-Nc QCD, two--point functions of local operators
become Harmonic Sums. We comment on the properties which follow from this fact.
This has led us to an aside observation concerning the zeros of the Riemann
zeta--function seen from the point of view of Dispersion Relations in Quantum
Theory.
