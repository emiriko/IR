We introduce a Monte Carlo scheme for fully nonlinear parabolic nonlocal
PDE's whose nonlinearity in of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI for short).
We avoid the difficulties of infinite L\'evy measure by truncation of the
L\'evy integral. The first result provides the convergence of the scheme for
general parabolic nonlinearities. The second result provides bounds on the rate
of convergence for concave (or equivalently convex) nonlinearities. For both
results, it is crucial to choose truncation of the infinite L\'evy measure
appropriately dependent on the time discretization. We also introduce a Monte
Carlo Quadrature method to approximate the nonlocal term in the HJBI
nonlinearity.
