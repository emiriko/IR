Different features of a potential in the form of a Gaussian well have been
discussed extensively. Although the details of the calculation are involved,
the general approach uses a variational method and WKB approximation,
techniques which should be familiar to advanced undergraduates. A numerical
solution of the Schr\"odinger equation through diagonalization has been
developed in a self-contained way, and physical applications of the potential
are mentioned.
