Strong interaction between the light field and an atom is often achieved with
cavities. Recent experiments have used a different configuration: a propagating
light field is strongly focused using a system of lenses, the atom being
supposed to sit at the focal position. In reality, this last condition holds
only up to some approximation; in particular, at any finite temperature, the
atom position fluctuates. We present a formalism that describes the focalized
field and the atom sitting at an arbitrary position. As a first application, we
show that thermal fluctuations do account for the extinction data reported in
M. K. Tey et al., Nature Physics 4, 924 (2008).
