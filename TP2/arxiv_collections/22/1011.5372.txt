The grand piano is one of the most important instruments in western music.
Its functioning and details are investigated and understood to a reasonable
level, however, differences between manufacturers exist which are hard to
explain. To add a new piece of understanding, we decided to investigate the
effect of ribs mounted on a soundboard. Apart from pianos, this is important to
a wider class of instruments which radiate from a structured surface. From
scattering theory, it is well-known that a regular array of scatterers yields a
band structure. By a systematic study of the latter, the effect of the ribs on
the radiated spectrum is demonstrated for a specially manufactured multichord
mimicking topologically a piano soundboard. To distinguish between radiated
sound and sound propagated inside the board we use piezopolymers, an
innovative, non-invasive technique. As a result we find a dramatic change in
the spectrum allowed to propagate in the soundboard which is consequently
radiated. An explanation by a simple model of coupled oscillators is given with
a very nice qualitative coincidence.
