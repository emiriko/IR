The quantum Boltzmann equation, or Fokker-Planck equation, has been used to
successfully explain a number of experiments in semiconductor optics in the
past two decades. This paper reviews some of the developments of this work,
including models of excitons in bulk materials, electron-hole plasmas, and
polariton gases.
