A strong toroidal field can exist in form of a magnetic layer in the
overshoot region below the solar convection zone. This motivates a more
detailed study of the magnetic buoyancy instability with rotation. We calculate
the alpha effect due to helical motions caused by a disintegrating magnetic
layer in a rotating density-stratified system with angular velocity Omega
making an angle theta with the vertical. We also study the dependence of the
alpha effect on theta and the strength of the initial magnetic field. We carry
out three-dimensional hydromagnetic simulations in Cartesian geometry. A
turbulent EMF due to the correlations of the small scale velocity and magnetic
field is generated. We use the test-field method to calculate the transport
coefficients of the inhomogeneous turbulence produced by the layer. We show
that the growth rate of the instability and the twist of the magnetic field
vary monotonically with the ratio of thermal conductivity to magnetic
diffusivity. The resulting alpha effect is inhomogeneous and increases with the
strength of the initial magnetic field. It is thus an example of an
"anti-quenched" alpha effect. The alpha effect is nonlocal, requiring around
8--16 Fourier modes to reconstruct the actual EMF based on the actual mean
field.
