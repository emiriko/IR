A brief up-to-date review of the long range forces generated by two neutrino
exchange is presented. The potential due to exchange of a massive
neutrino-antineutrino pair between particles carrying weak charge might be
larger than expected if the neutrinos have not only masses but also magnetic
moments close to the present experimental bounds. It still remains too small to
be observable.
