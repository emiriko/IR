Rabi oscillation of a two-level system driven by a pulse train is a basic
process involved in quantum computation. We present a full quantum treatment of
this process and show that the population inversion of this process collapses
exponentially, has no revival phenomenon, and has a dual-pulse structure in
every period. As an application, we investigate the properties of this process
in ion-trap quantum computation. We find that in the Cirac--Zoller computation
scheme, when the wavelength of the driving field is of the order $10^{-6}$ m,
the lower bound of failure probability is of the order $10^{-2}$ after about
$10^2$ controlled-NOT gates. This value is approximately equal to the
generally-accepted threshold in fault-tolerant quantum computation.
