Motivated by the difficulty arising in the numerical simulation of the
movement of charged particles in presence of a large external magnetic field,
which adds an additional time scale and thus imposes to use a much smaller time
step, we perform in this paper a homogenization of the Vlasov equation and of
the Vlasov-Poisson system which yield approximate equations describing the mean
behavior of the particles. The convergence proof is based on the two scale
convergence tools introduced by N'Guetseng and Allaire. We also consider the
case where, in addition to the magnetic field, a large external electric field
orthogonal to the magnetic field and of the same magnitude is applied.
