This paper deals with stability in the numerical solution of the prominent
Heston partial differential equation from mathematical finance. We study the
well-known central second-order finite difference discretization, which leads
to large semi-discrete systems with non-normal matrices A. By employing the
logarithmic spectral norm we prove practical, rigorous stability bounds. Our
theoretical stability results are illustrated by ample numerical experiments.
