We study self-consistently a microscopic interface between a quantum spin
Hall insulator (QSHI) and a superconductor (SC), focusing on properties related
to Majorana fermion creation. For an $s$-wave SC we show that odd-in-momentum,
or $p$-wave, order parameters exist for all doping levels of the QSHI and that
they can be related to different spinless Cooper pair amplitudes. Despite this,
the induced superconducting gap in the QSHI always retains its $s$-wave
character, validating the commonly used effective model for superconductivity
in a topological insulator. For a $d_{xy}$-wave SC, we show that a Majorana
mode is only created at finite doping and that there is no excitation gap
protecting this mode.
