We explore the homogenization limit and rigorously derive upscaled equations
for a microscopic reaction-diffusion system modeling sulfate corrosion in sewer
pipes made of concrete. The system, defined in a periodically-perforated
domain, is semi-linear, partially dissipative and weakly coupled via a
non-linear ordinary differential equation posed on the solid-water interface at
the pore level. Firstly, we show the well-posedness of the microscopic model.
We then apply homogenization techniques based on two-scale convergence for an
uniformly periodic domain and derive upscaled equations together with explicit
formulae for the effective diffusion coefficients and reaction constants. We
use a boundary unfolding method to pass to the homogenization limit in the
non-linear ordinary differential equation. Finally, besides giving its strong
formulation, we also prove that the upscaled two-scale model admits a unique
solution.
