The goal of this study is to investigate the scaling behaviour of our 2 HEX
action. For this purpose, we compute the $N_f=3$ spectrum and compare the
results to our 6 EXP action. We find a large scaling window up to $\sim
0.15\,\mathrm{fm}$ along with small scaling corrections at the 2%-level and
full compatibility with our previous study. As a second important observable to
be tested for scaling, we chose the non-perturbatively renormalized quenched
strange quark mass. Here we find a fairly flat scaling with a broad scaling
range up to $\simeq 0.15\,\mathrm{fm}$ and perfect agreement with the
literature.
