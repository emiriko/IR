The emerging field of silicon photonics seeks to unify the high bandwidth of
optical communications with CMOS microelectronic circuits. Many components have
been demonstrated for on-chip optical communications, including those that
utilize the nonlinear optical properties of silicon[1, 2], silicon dioxide[3,
4] and silicon nitride[5, 6]. Processes such as second harmonic generation,
which are enabled by the second-order susceptibility, have not been developed
since the bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ vanishes in these centrosymmetric CMOS materials.
Generating the lowest-order nonlinearity would open the window to a new array
of CMOS-compatible optical devices capable of nonlinear functionalities not
achievable with the?$\chi^{(3)}$ response such as electro-optic modulation, sum
frequency up-conversion, and difference frequency generation. Here we
demonstrate second harmonic (SH) generation in CMOS compatible integrated
silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides. The $\chi^{(2)}$ response is induced in the
centrosymmetric material by using the nanoscale structure to break the bulk
symmetry. We use a high quality factor Q ring resonator cavity to enhance the
efficiency of the nonlinear optical process and detect SH output with milliwatt
input powers.
