Microwave cavities with high quality factors enable coherent coupling of
distant quantum systems. Virtual photons lead to a transverse exchange
interaction between qubits, when they are non-resonant with the cavity but
resonant with each other. We experimentally probe the inverse scaling of the
inter-qubit coupling with the detuning from a cavity mode and its
proportionality to the qubit-cavity interaction strength. We demonstrate that
the enhanced coupling at higher frequencies is mediated by multiple
higher-harmonic cavity modes. Moreover, in the case of resonant qubits, the
symmetry properties of the system lead to an allowed two-photon transition to
the doubly excited qubit state and the formation of a dark state.
