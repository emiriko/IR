Permutation $p$-values have been widely used to assess the significance of
linkage or association in genetic studies. However, the application in
large-scale studies is hindered by a heavy computational burden. We propose a
geometric interpretation of permutation $p$-values, and based on this geometric
interpretation, we develop an efficient permutation $p$-value estimation method
in the context of regression with binary predictors. An application to a study
of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) shows that our method
provides reliable estimates of permutation $p$-values while requiring less than
5% of the computational time compared with direct permutations. In fact, our
method takes a constant time to estimate permutation $p$-values, no matter how
small the $p$-value. Our method enables a study of the relationship between
nominal $p$-values and permutation $p$-values in a wide range, and provides a
geometric perspective on the effective number of independent tests.
