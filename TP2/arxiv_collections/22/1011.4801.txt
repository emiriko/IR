We discuss another approach regarding the inflation from the R^2 theory of
gravity originally proposed by Starobinski. A non-singular early cosmology is
proposed, where, adding a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian to the
high-order action, a bouncing is present and a power-law inflation is obtained.
In the model the Ricci scalar works like an inflaton field.
