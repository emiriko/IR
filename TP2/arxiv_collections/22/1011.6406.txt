We introduce a model of SU(2) and U(1) vector fields with a local U(2)
symmetry. Its action can be obtained in the London limit of a gauge invariant
regularization involving two scalar fields. Evidence from lattice simulations
of the model supports a (zero temperature) SU(2) deconfining phase transition
through breaking of the SU(2) center symmetry, and a massive vector boson
triplet is found in the deconfined phase.
