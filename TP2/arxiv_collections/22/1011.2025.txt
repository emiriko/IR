We develop Bayesian inference methods for a recently-emerging type of
epigenetic data to study the transmission fidelity of DNA methylation patterns
over cell divisions. The data consist of parent-daughter double-stranded DNA
methylation patterns with each pattern coming from a single cell and
represented as an unordered pair of binary strings. The data are technically
difficult and time-consuming to collect, putting a premium on an efficient
inference method. Our aim is to estimate rates for the maintenance and de novo
methylation events that gave rise to the observed patterns, while accounting
for measurement error. We model data at multiple sites jointly, thus using
whole-strand information, and considerably reduce confounding between
parameters. We also adopt a hierarchical structure that allows for variation in
rates across sites without an explosion in the effective number of parameters.
Our context-specific priors capture the expected stationarity, or
near-stationarity, of the stochastic process that generated the data analyzed
here. This expected stationarity is shown to greatly increase the precision of
the estimation. Applying our model to a data set collected at the human FMR1
locus, we find that measurement errors, generally ignored in similar studies,
occur at a nontrivial rate (inappropriate bisulfite conversion error: 1.6$%$
with 80$%$ CI: 0.9--2.3$%$). Accounting for these errors has a substantial
impact on estimates of key biological parameters. The estimated average failure
of maintenance rate and daughter de novo rate decline from 0.04 to 0.024 and
from 0.14 to 0.07, respectively, when errors are accounted for. Our results
also provide evidence that de novo events may occur on both parent and daughter
strands: the median parent and daughter de novo rates are 0.08 (80$%$ CI:
0.04--0.13) and 0.07 (80$%$ CI: 0.04--0.11), respectively.
