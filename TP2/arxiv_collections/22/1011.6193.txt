We study quantum transport in Q1D wires made of a 2D conductor of width W and
length L>>W. Our aim is to compare an impurity-free wire with rough edges with
a smooth wire with impurity disorder. We calculate the electron transmission
through the wires by the scattering-matrix method, and we find the Landauer
conductance for a large ensemble of disordered wires. We study the
impurity-free wire whose edges have a roughness correlation length comparable
with the Fermi wave length. The mean resistance <\rho> and inverse mean
conductance 1/<g> are evaluated in dependence on L. For L -> 0 we observe the
quasi-ballistic dependence 1/<g> = <\rho> = 1/N_c + \rho_{qb} L/W, where 1/N_c
is the fundamental contact resistance and \rho_{qb} is the quasi-ballistic
resistivity. As L increases, we observe crossover to the diffusive dependence
1/<g> = <\rho> = 1/N^{eff}_c + \rho_{dif} L/W, where \rho_{dif} is the
resistivity and 1/N^{eff}_c is the effective contact resistance corresponding
to the N^{eff}_c open channels. We find the universal results
\rho_{qb}/\rho_{dif} = 0.6N_c and N^{eff}_c = 6 for N_c >> 1. As L exceeds the
localization length \xi, the resistance shows onset of localization while the
conductance shows the diffusive dependence 1/<g> = 1/N^{eff}_c + \rho_{dif} L/W
up to L = 2\xi and the localization for L > 2\xi only. On the contrary, for the
impurity disorder we find a standard diffusive behavior, namely 1/<g> = <\rho>
= 1/N_c + \rho_{dif} L/W for L < \xi. We also derive the wire conductivity from
the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, and we compare the semiclassical electron
mean-free path with the mean free path obtained from the quantum resistivity
\rho_{dif}. They coincide for the impurity disorder, however, for the edge
roughness they strongly differ, i.e., the diffusive transport is not
semiclassical. It becomes semiclassical for the edge roughness with large
correlation length.
