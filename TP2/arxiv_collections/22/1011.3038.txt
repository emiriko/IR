In this article we study the problem of a non-relativistic particle in the
presence of a singular potential in the noncommutative plane. The potential
contains a term proportional to $1/R^2$, where $R^2$ is the squared distance to
the origin in the noncommutative plane. We find that the spectrum of energies
is non analytic in the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$.
