We show that using epitaxial strain and chemical pressure in orthorhombic
YMnO3 and Co-substituted (YMn0.95Co0.05O3) thin films, a ferromagnetic response
can be gradually introduced and tuned. These results, together with the
measured anisotropy of the magnetic response, indicate that the unexpected
observation of ferromagnetism in orthorhombic o-RMnO3 (R= Y, Ho, Tb, etc) films
originates from strain-driven breaking of the fully compensated magnetic
ordering by pushing magnetic moments away from the antiferromagnetic [010]
axis. We show that the resulting canting angle and the subsequent ferromagnetic
response, gradually increase (up to ~ 1.2\degree) by compression of the unit
cell. We will discuss the relevance of these findings, in connection to the
magnetoelectric response of orthorhombic manganites.
