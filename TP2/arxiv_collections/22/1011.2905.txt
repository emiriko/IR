Government statistical agencies often apply statistical disclosure limitation
techniques to survey microdata to protect the confidentiality of respondents.
There is a need for valid and practical ways to assess the protection provided.
This paper develops some simple methods for disclosure limitation techniques
which perturb the values of categorical identifying variables. The methods are
applied in numerical experiments based upon census data from the United Kingdom
which are subject to two perturbation techniques: data swapping (random and
targeted) and the post randomization method. Some simplifying approximations to
the measure of risk are found to work well in capturing the impacts of these
techniques. These approximations provide simple extensions of existing risk
assessment methods based upon Poisson log-linear models. A numerical experiment
is also undertaken to assess the impact of multivariate misclassification with
an increasing number of identifying variables. It is found that the
misclassification dominates the usual monotone increasing relationship between
this number and risk so that the risk eventually declines, implying less
sensitivity of risk to choice of identifying variables. The methods developed
in this paper may also be used to obtain more realistic assessments of risk
which take account of the kinds of measurement and other nonsampling errors
commonly arising in surveys.
