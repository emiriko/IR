A Monte Carlo study of two jet observables that can be used to obtain jet
samples enhanced in quark or gluon content is presented. We compare the
performance of one of these methods on pure Monte Carlo events with that after
the transport of events through the full simulation of the ALICE experiment. It
is shown that the performance of the method is not deteriorated by experimental
effects like resolution and inefficiency.
