On the occasion of the laser's 50th anniversary, we performed a modern Fizeau
experiment, measuring the speed of light with a laser beam passing over the
city centre of Marseille. For a round trip distance of almost five kilometers,
the measurement has reached an uncertainty of about 10$^{-4}$, mainly due to
atmospheric fluctuations. We present the experimental and pedagogical
challenges of this brilliant outreach experiment.
