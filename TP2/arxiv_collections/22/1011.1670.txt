Recent nanotoxicity studies revealed that the physico-chemical
characteristics of engineered nanomaterials play an important role in the
interactions with living cells. Here, we report on the toxicity and uptake of
the cerium and iron oxide sub-10 nm nanoparticles by NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts.
Coating strategies include low-molecular weight ligands (citric acid) and
polymers (poly(acrylic acid), MW = 2000 g mol-1). Electrostatically adsorbed on
the surfaces, the organic moieties provide a negatively charged coating in
physiological conditions. We find that most particles were biocompatible, as
exposed cells remained 100% viable relative to controls. Only the bare and the
citrate-coated nanoceria exhibit a slight decrease of the mitochondrial
activity for cerium concentrations above 5 mM (equivalent to 0.8 g L-1). We
also observe that the citrate-coated particles are internalized by the cells in
large amounts, typically 250 pg per cell after a 24 h incubation for iron
oxide. In contrast, the polymer-coated particles are taken up at much lower
rates (< 30 pg per cell). The strong uptake shown by the citrate-coated
particles is related to the destabilization of the dispersions in the cell
culture medium and their sedimentation down to the cell membranes. In
conclusion, we show that the uptake of nanomaterials by living cells depends on
the coating of the particles and on its ability to preserve the colloidal
nature of the dispersions.
