We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and correctness,
without assuming any bound on the number of corrupt participants. All protocols
have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous
broadcast channel. Unlike previously proposed protocols in this model, the
protocols that we present deterministically output the exact tally. Our first
protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to
compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that
regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned
through the protocol that could not be learned in an ideal realisation.
Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in
which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the
tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the
communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and
authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is
also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single
authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt
authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final
protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification
technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting
the protocol. Finally, we discuss the implementation of a simultaneous
broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding
versions of our protocols that achieve everlasting security.
