Low-scale gauge-mediated supersymmetry(SUSY)-breaking (GMSB) models with
gravitino mass m_{3/2}<16 eV are attractive, since there are no flavor and
cosmological problems. In this paper, we thoroughly study the collider signal
in the case that the next-to-lightest SUSY particle is the bino or slepton and
investigate the discovery potential of the LHC. Our result is applicable to a
wider class of GMSB models other than the minimal GMSB models and we pay
particular attention to realistic experimental setups. We also apply our
analysis to the minimal GMSB models with a metastable SUSY-breaking vacuum and
we show, by requiring sufficient stability of the SUSY-breaking vacuum, these
models can be tested at an early stage of the LHC.
