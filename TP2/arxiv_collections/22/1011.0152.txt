Both CDF and D0 at Tevatron reported the measurements of forward-backward
asymmetry in top pair production, which showed possible deviation from the
standard model QCD prediction. In this paper, we show that a new color-octet
massive vector boson with mass just above twice that of top quark can
simultaneously account for the asymmetry and differential distribution
$d\sigma/dM_{t\bar t}$ in top pair production, without conflict with other
measurements for example di-jet production. The new particle can be discovered
and studied at the more powerful Large Hadron Collider.
