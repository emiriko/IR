We report on the numerical measures on different spin interfaces and FK
cluster boundaries in the Askhin-Teller (AT) model. For a general point on the
AT critical line, we find that the fractal dimension of a generic spin cluster
interface can take one of four different possible values. In particular we
found spin interfaces whose fractal dimension is d_f=3/2 all along the critical
line. Further, the fractal dimension of the boundaries of FK clusters were
found to satisfy all along the AT critical line a duality relation with the
fractal dimension of their outer boundaries. This result provides a clear
numerical evidence that such duality, which is well known in the case of the
O(n) model, exists in a extended CFT.
