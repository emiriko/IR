We report on our calculation of pion and kaon form factors in three-flavor
QCD using the overlap quark action. Gauge ensembles are generated on a 16^3
\times 48 lattice at a lattice spacing of 0.11 fm with pion masses down to 310
MeV. Connected and disconnected meson correaltors are calculated using the
all-to-all quark propagator. We present our preliminary analysis on the chiral
behavior of the electromagnetic and scalar form factors as well as a comparison
of the shape of the K to pi form factors with experiment.
