We propose a model for supernovae Ia explosions based on a phase transition
to a supersymmetric state which becomes the active trigger for the deflagration
starting the explosion in an isolated sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf star. With
two free parameters we fit the rate and several properties of type Ia
supernovae and address the gap in the supermassive black hole mass
distribution. One parameter is a critical density fit to about $3 \cdot 10^7$
g/cc while the other has the units of a space time volume and is found to be of
order $0.05\,$ Gyr $R_E^3$ where $R_E$ is the earth radius. The model involves
a phase transition to an exact supersymmetry in a small core of a dense star.
