Recently it has been argued that infrared singularities of the quark-gluon
vertex of Landau gauge QCD can confine static quarks via a linear potential. It
is demonstrated that the same mechanism also may confine fundamental scalar
fields. This opens the possibility that within functional approaches static
confinement is an universal property of the gauge sector even though it is
formally represented in the functional equations of the matter sector. The
colour structure of Dyson-Schwinger equations for fundamental and adjoint
scalar fields is determined for the gauge groups SU(N) and G(2) exhibiting
interesting cancelations purely due to colour algebra.
