We consider the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, posed on $\R^n\times
M$, where $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $n\geq 2$. We prove that
under a suitable smallness in Sobolev spaces condition on the data there exists
a unique global solution which scatters to a free solution for large times.
