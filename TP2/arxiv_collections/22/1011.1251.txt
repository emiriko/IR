Evidence for a parity-breaking nature of the magnetic buoyancy instability in
a stably stratified gas is reported. In the absence of rotation, no helicity is
produced, but the non-helical state is found to be unstable to small helical
perturbations during the development of the instability. The parity-breaking
nature of an instability in magnetohydrodynamics appears to be the first of its
kind and is similar to chiral symmetry breaking in biochemistry. Applications
to the production of mean fields in galaxy clusters are being discussed.
