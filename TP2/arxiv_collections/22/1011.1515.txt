We introduce the Characteristic Curvature as the curvature of the
trajectories of the hamiltonian vector field with respect to the normal
direction to the isoenergetic surfaces and by using the Second Fundamental Form
we relate it to the Classical and Levi Mean Curvature. Then we prove existence
and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for the related Dirichlet problem and we
show the Lipschitz regularity of the solutions under suitable hypotheses.
Moreover we prove a non existence result on the balls when the prescribed
curvature is a positive constant. At the end we show that neither Strong
Comparison Principle nor Hopf Lemma do hold for the Characteristic Curvature
Operator.
