We present an efficient entanglement purification protocol with
hyperentanglement in which additional spatial entanglement is utilized to
purify the two-particle polarization-entangled state. The bit-flip error and
phase-flip error can be corrected and eliminated in one step. Two remote
parties can obtainmaximally entangled polarization states deterministically and
only passive linear optics are employed. We also discuss the protocol with
practical quantum source and noisy channel.
