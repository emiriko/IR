Structural and optoelectronic properties of BaThO3 cubic perovskite are
calculated using all electrons full potential linearized augmented plane wave
(FP-LAPW) method. Wide and direct band gap, 5.7 eV, of the compound predicts
that it can be effectively used in UV based optoelectronic devices. Different
characteristic peaks in the wide UV range emerges mainly due to the transition
of electrons between valance band state O-p and conduction band states Ba-d,
Ba-f, Th-f and Th-d.
