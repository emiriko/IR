Given a Riemannian surface, we consider a naturally embedded graph which
captures part of the topology and geometry of the surface. By studying this
graph, we obtain results in three different directions.
  First, we find bounds on the lengths of homologically independent curves on
closed Riemannian surfaces. As a consequence, we show that for any $\lambda \in
(0,1)$ there exists a constant $C_\lambda$ such that every closed Riemannian
surface of genus $g$ whose area is normalized at $4\pi(g-1)$ has at least
$[\lambda g]$ homologically independent loops of length at most $C_\lambda
\log(g)$. This result extends Gromov's asymptotic $\log(g)$ bound on the
homological systole of genus $g$ surfaces. We construct hyperbolic surfaces
showing that our general result is sharp. We also extend the upper bound
obtained by P. Buser and P. Sarnak on the minimal norm of nonzero period
lattice vectors of Riemann surfaces %systole of Jacobians of Riemann surfaces
in their geometric approach of the Schottky problem to almost $g$ homologically
independent vectors.
  Then, we consider the lengths of pants decompositions on complete Riemannian
surfaces in connexion with Bers' constant and its generalizations. In
particular, we show that a complete noncompact Riemannian surface of genus $g$
with $n$ ends and area normalized to $4\pi (g+\frac{n}{2}-1)$ admits a pants
decomposition whose total length (sum of the lengths) does not exceed $C_g \, n
\log (n+1)$ for some constant $C_g$ depending only on the genus.
  Finally, we obtain a lower bound on the systolic area of finitely presentable
nontrivial groups with no free factor isomorphic to $\Z$ in terms of its first
Betti number. The asymptotic behavior of this lower bound is optimal.
