We compare rain event size distributions derived from measurements in
climatically different regions, which we find to be well approximated by power
laws of similar exponents over broad ranges. Differences can be seen in the
large-scale cutoffs of the distributions. Event duration distributions suggest
that the scale-free aspects are related to the absence of characteristic scales
in the meteorological mesoscale.
