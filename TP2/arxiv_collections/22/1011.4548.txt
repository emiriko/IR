The multigap superconductivity modulated by quantum confinement effects in a
superlattice of quantum wells is presented. Our theoretical BCS approach
captures the low-energy physics of a shape resonance in the superconducting
gaps when the chemical potential is tuned near a Lifshitz transition. We focus
on the case of weak Cooper-pairing coupling channels and strong pair exchange
interaction driven by repulsive Coulomb interaction that allows to use the BCS
theory in the weak-coupling regime neglecting retardation effects like in
quantum condensates of ultracold gases. The calculated matrix element effects
in the pairing interaction are shown to yield a complex physics near the
particular quantum critical points due to Lifshitz transitions in multigap
superconductivity. Strong deviations of the ratio $2\Delta/T_c$ from the
standard BCS value as a function of the position of the chemical potential
relative to the Lifshitz transition point measured by the Lifshitz parameter
are found. The response of the condensate phase to the tuning of the Lifshitz
parameter is compared with the response of ultracold gases in the BCS-BEC
crossover tuned by an external magnetic field. The results provide the
description of the condensates in this regime where matrix element effects play
a key role.
