Focusing on the discrete probabilistic setting we generalize the
combinatorial definition of cumulants to L-cumulants. This generalization keeps
all the desired properties of the classical cumulants like semi-invariance and
vanishing for independent blocks of random variables. These properties make
L-cumulants useful for the algebraic analysis of statistical models. We
illustrate this for general Markov models and hidden Markov processes in the
case when the hidden process is binary. The main motivation of this work is to
understand cumulant-like coordinates in algebraic statistics and to give a more
insightful explanation why tree cumulants give such an elegant description of
binary hidden tree models. Moreover, we argue that L-cumulants can be used in
the analysis of certain classical algebraic varieties.
