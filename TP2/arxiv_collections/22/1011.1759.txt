General-purpose Monte Carlo event generators have become important tools in
particle physics, allowing the simulation of exclusive hadronic final states.
In this article we examine the Pythia 8 generator, in particular focusing on
its parton-shower algorithms. Some relevant new additions to the code are
introduced, that should allow for a better description of data. We also
implement and compare with 2 to 3 real-emission QCD matrix elements, to check
how well the shower algorithm fills the phase space away from the soft and
collinear regions. A tuning of the generator to Tevatron data is performed for
two PDF sets and the impact of first new LHC data is examined.
