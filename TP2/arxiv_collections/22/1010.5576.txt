Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type late O to early A and
luminosity class V-III, wich exhibit Balmer emission lines and often a near
infrared excess originating in an equatorially concentrated circumstellar
envelope, both produced by sporadic mass ejection episodes. The causes of the
abnormal mass loss (the so-called Be phenomenon) are as yet unknown. For the
first time, we can now study in detail Be stars outside the Earth's atmosphere
with sufficient temporal resolution. We investigate the variability of the Be
Star CoRoT-ID 102761769 observed with the CoRoT satellite in the exoplanet
field during the initial run. One low-resolution spectrum of the star was
obtained with the INT telescope at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos.
A time series analysis was performed using both cleanest and singular spectrum
analysis algorithms to the CoRoT light curve. To identify the pulsation modes
of the observed frequencies, we computed a set of models representative of
CoRoT-ID 102761769 by varying its main physical parameters inside the
uncertainties discussed. We found two close frequencies related to the star.
They are 2.465 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$ (28.5 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$) and 2.441 $\rm
c\,d^{-1}$ (28.2 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$). The precision to which those frequencies
were found is 0.018 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$ (0.2 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$). The projected
stellar rotation was estimated to be 120 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$ from the Fourier
transform of spectral lines. If CoRoT-ID 102761769 is a typical Galactic Be
star it rotates near the critical velocity. The critical rotation frequency of
a typical B5-6 star is about 3.5 $\rm c\,d^{-1}$(40.5 $\mathrm{\mu Hz}$), which
implies that the above frequencies are really caused by stellar pulsations
rather than star's rotation.
