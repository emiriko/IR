3D MHD simulation of accretion onto neutron stars have shown in the last few
years that the footprint (hotspot) of the accretion flow changes with time. Two
different kinds of accretion, namely the funnel flow and the equatorial
accretion produced by instabilities at the inner disk, produce different kinds
of motion of the hotspot. The funnel flow produces hotspots that move around
the magnetic pole, while instabilities produce other hotspots that appear
randomly and move along the equator or slightly above. The angular velocities
of the two hotspots are different, the equatorial one being higher and both
close to the Keplerian velocity in the inner region. Modeling of the
lightcurves of these hotspots with Monte Carlo simulations show that the
signatures produced in power specra by them, if observed, are QPOs plus low
frequency components. Their frequencies, general behavior and features describe
correctly most of the properties of kHz QPOs, if we assume the funnel flow
hotspots as the origin of the lower kHz QPO and instabilities as the origin of
the upper kHz QPO.
