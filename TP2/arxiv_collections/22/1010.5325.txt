A model for the formation of supermassive primordial black holes in galactic
nuclei with the simultaneous suppression of the formation of intermediate-mass
black holes is presented. A bimodal mass function for black holes formed
through phase transitions in a model with a "Mexican hat" potential has been
found. The classical motion of the phase of a complex scalar field during
inflation has been taken into account. Possible observational manifestations of
primordial black holes in galaxies and constraints on their number are
discussed.
