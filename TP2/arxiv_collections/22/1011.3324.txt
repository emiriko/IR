In systems with a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, the perturbative
loop expansion is plagued with infrared divergences due to the coupling between
transverse and longitudinal fluctuations. As a result the longitudinal
susceptibility diverges and the self-energy becomes singular at low energy. We
study the crossover from the high-energy Gaussian regime, where perturbation
theory remains valid, to the low-energy Goldstone regime characterized by a
diverging longitudinal susceptibility. We consider both the classical linear
O($N$) model and interacting bosons at zero temperature, using a variety of
techniques: perturbation theory, hydrodynamic approach (i.e., for bosons,
Popov's theory), large-$N$ limit and non-perturbative renormalization group. We
emphasize the essential role of the Ginzburg momentum scale $p_G$ below which
the perturbative approach breaks down. Even though the action of
(non-relativistic) bosons includes a first-order time derivative term, we find
remarkable similarities in the weak-coupling limit between the classical O($N$)
model and interacting bosons at zero temperature.
