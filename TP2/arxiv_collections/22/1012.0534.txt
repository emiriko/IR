Using a stable equivalence due to Rouquier, we prove that Broue's abelian
defect group conjecture holds for 3-blocks of defect 2 whose Brauer
correspondent has a unique isomorphism class of simple modules. The proof makes
use of the fact, also due to Rouquier, that a stable equivalence of Morita type
between self-injective algebras induces an isomorphism between the connected
components of the outer automorphism groups of the algebras.
