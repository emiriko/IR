We generalize a result by Cunningham-Salmasian to a Mackey-type formula for
the compact restriction of a semisimple perverse sheaf produced by parabolic
induction from a character sheaf, under certain conditions on the parahoric
group used to define compact restriction. This provides new tools for matching
character sheaves with admissible representations.
