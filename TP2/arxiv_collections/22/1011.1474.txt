Based on the earlier work [S.-S. Lee, Nucl. Phys. B 832, 567 (2010)], we
derive a holographic dual for the D-dimensional U(N) lattice gauge theory from
a first principle construction. The resulting theory is a lattice field theory
of closed loops, dubbed as lattice loop field theory which is defined on a
(D+1)-dimensional space. The lattice loop field theory is well defined
non-perturbatively, and it becomes weakly coupled and local in the large N
limit with a large 't Hooft coupling.
