The low energy effective theory on a stack of D3-branes at a Calabi-Yau
singularity is an $\mathcal{N} = 1$ quiver gauge theory. The AdS/CFT
correspondence predicts that the strong coupling dynamics of the gauge theory
is described by weakly coupled type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5 \times L^5,$
where $L^5$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold. Recent results on Calabi-Yau
algebras efficiently determine the Hilbert series of any superconformal quiver
gauge theory. We use the Hilbert series to determine the volume of the horizon
manifold in terms of the fields of the quiver gauge theory. One corollary of
the AdS/CFT conjecture is that the volume of the horizon manifold $L^5$ is
inversely proportional to the a-central charge of the gauge theory. By direct
comparison of the volume determined from the Hilbert series and the a-central
charge, this prediction is proved independently of the AdS/CFT conjecture.
