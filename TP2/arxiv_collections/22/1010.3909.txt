Liouvillian systems were initially introduced within the framework of
differential algebra. They can be seen as a natural extension of differential
flat systems. Many physical non flat systems seem to be Liouvillian. We present
in this paper an alternative definition to this class of systems using the
language of diffieties and infinite prolongation theory.
