We present the interatomic force constants and phonon dispersions of graphite
and graphene from the LCBOPII empirical bond order potential. We find a good
agreement with experimental results, particularly in comparison to other bond
order potentials. From the flexural mode we determine the bending rigidity of
graphene to be 0.69 eV at zero temperature. We discuss the large increase of
this constant with temperature and argue that derivation of force constants
from experimental values should take this feature into account. We examine also
other graphitic systems, including multilayer graphene for which we show that
the splitting of the flexural mode can provide a tool for characterization.
