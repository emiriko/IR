Graphene is a unique two-dimensional material with rich new physics and great
promise for applications in electronic devices. Physical phenomena such as the
half-integer quantum Hall effect and high carrier mobility are critically
dependent on interactions with impurities/substrates and localization of Dirac
fermions in realistic devices. We microscopically study these interactions
using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of exfoliated graphene on a SiO2
substrate in an applied magnetic field. The magnetic field strongly affects the
electronic behavior of the graphene; the states condense into welldefined
Landau levels with a dramatic change in the character of localization. In zero
magnetic field, we detect weakly localized states created by the substrate
induced disorder potential. In strong magnetic field, the two-dimensional
electron gas breaks into a network of interacting quantum dots formed at the
potential hills and valleys of the disorder potential. Our results demonstrate
how graphene properties are perturbed by the disorder potential; a finding that
is essential for both the physics and applications of graphene.
