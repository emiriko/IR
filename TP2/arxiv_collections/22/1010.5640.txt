Texture six zero Fritzsch like as well as non Fritzsch like hermitian lepton
mass matrices (144 combinations in all) have been investigated for both
Majorana and Dirac neutrinos for their compatibility with the current neutrino
oscillation data, keeping in mind the hierarchy of neutrino masses. All the
combinations considered here for Majorana neutrino masses are ruled out by the
existing data in the case of inverted hierarchy and degenerate scenario. For
Majorana neutrinos with normal hierarchy, only 16 combinations can accommodate
the experimental data. Assuming neutrinos to be Dirac particles, normal
hierarchy, inverted hierarchy as well as degenerate neutrinos are ruled out for
all combinations of texture 6 zero hermitian mass matrices.
