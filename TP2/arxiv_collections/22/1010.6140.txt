A method for computing renormalization constants in the Rome Southampton
scheme with volume sources and arbitrary momenta is described. This new method
is found to enable controlled and precise continuum extrapolations and opens
the way to compute the running of operators nonperturbatively in the Rome
Southampton scheme. We describe this in detail and exhibit several examples of
lattice step scaling functions.
