A search for discontinuity in the sky twilight brightness at different
wavelengths and different solar depressions for altitudes 0, 5, 10, 30, 50 & 70
degrees is done. It is found that the logarithmic of difference in the
brightness log (I1-I2) of two similar patches lying at solar and anti-solar
verticals are not suffering of any discontinuity, when plotted versus sun's
depression. Whatever, the ratio I1/I2 shows that there is discontinuity in the
curves at altitudes less than or equal 30 degrees. While for altitudes 50 & 70
degrees slight patches of discontinuities have been detected. The phenomenon of
discontinuities may be referred to the changes in the sky twilight brightness
due to the effect of the Earth's shadow on diffusing and luminescent layers in
the upper atmosphere.
