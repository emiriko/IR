Recent measurements suggest that extensive air showers initiated by
ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) emit signals in the microwave band of the
electromagnetic spectrum caused by the collisions of the free-electrons with
the atmospheric neutral molecules in the plasma produced by the passage of the
shower. Such emission is isotropic and could allow the detection of air showers
with 100% duty cycle and a calorimetric-like energy measurement, a significant
improvement over current detection techniques. We have built MIDAS (MIcrowave
Detection of Air Showers), a prototype of microwave detector, which consists of
a 4.5 m diameter antenna with a cluster of 53 feed-horns in the 4 GHz range.
The details of the prototype and first results will be presented.
