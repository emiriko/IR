In this paper we consider a simplified two-dimensional scalar model for the
formation of mesoscopic domain patterns in martensitic shape-memory alloys at
the interface between a region occupied by the parent (austenite) phase and a
region occupied by the product (martensite) phase, which can occur in two
variants (twins). The model, first proposed by Kohn and Mueller, is defined by
the following functional: $${\cal E}(u)=\beta||u(0,\cdot)||^2_{H^{1/2}([0,h])}+
\int_{0}^{L} dx \int_0^h dy \big(|u_x|^2 + \epsilon |u_{yy}| \big)$$ where
$u:[0,L]\times[0,h]\to R$ is periodic in $y$ and $u_y=\pm 1$ almost everywhere.
Conti proved that if $\beta\gtrsim\epsilon L/h^2$ then the minimal specific
energy scales like $\sim \min\{(\epsilon\beta/L)^{1/2}, (\epsilon/L)^{2/3}\}$,
as $(\epsilon/L)\to 0$. In the regime $(\epsilon\beta/L)^{1/2}\ll
(\epsilon/L)^{2/3}$, we improve Conti's results, by computing exactly the
minimal energy and by proving that minimizers are periodic one-dimensional
sawtooth functions.
