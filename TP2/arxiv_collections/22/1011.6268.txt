Large-scale data resulting from users online interactions provide the
ultimate source of information to study emergent social phenomena on the Web.
From individual actions of users to observable collective behaviors, different
mechanisms involving emotions expressed in the posted text play a role. Here we
combine approaches of statistical physics with machine-learning methods of text
analysis to study emergence of the emotional behavior among Web users. Mapping
the high-resolution data from digg.com onto bipartite network of users and
their comments onto posted stories, we identify user communities centered
around certain popular posts and determine emotional contents of the related
comments by the emotion-classifier developed for this type of texts. Applied
over different time periods, this framework reveals strong correlations between
the excess of negative emotions and the evolution of communities. We observe
avalanches of emotional comments exhibiting significant self-organized critical
behavior and temporal correlations. To explore robustness of these critical
states, we design a network automaton model on realistic network connections
and several control parameters, which can be inferred from the dataset.
Dissemination of emotions by a small fraction of very active users appears to
critically tune the collective states.
