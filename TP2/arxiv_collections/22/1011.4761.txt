In this paper we study the possibility of modifying the dynamics of both
quantum correlations, such as entanglement and discord, and classical
correlations of an open bi-partite system by means of the quantum Zeno effect.
We consider two qubits coupled to a common boson reservoir at zero temperature.
This model describes, for example, two atoms interacting with a quantized mode
of a lossy cavity. We show that, when the frequencies of the two atoms are
symmetrically detuned from that of the cavity mode, oscillations between Zeno
and anti-Zeno regimes occur. We also calculate analytically the time evolution
of both classical correlations and quantum discord, and we compare the Zeno
dynamics of entanglement with the Zeno dynamics of classical correlations and
discord.
