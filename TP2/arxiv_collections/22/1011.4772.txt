In these lectures we consider some topics of Quantum Field Theory in Curved
Space. In the first one particle creation in curved space is studied from a
mathematical point of view, especially, particle production at a given time
using the so called "instantaneous diagonalization method". Particle production
by strong electromagnetic fields (Schwinger's effect) and particle production
by moving mirrors simulating black hole collapse are also studied. In the
second lecture we calculate the re-normalized two-point function using the
adiabatic regularization. The conformally and minimally coupled cases are
considered for a scalar massive and massless field. We reproduce previous
results in a rigorous mathematical form and clarify some empirical
approximations and bounds. The re-normalized stress tensor is also calculated
in several situations. Finally, in last lecture quantum correction due to a
massless fields conformally coupled with gravity are considered in order to
study the avoidance of singularities that appear in the flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model.
