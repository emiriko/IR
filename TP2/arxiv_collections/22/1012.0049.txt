We realize and study a strongly interacting two-component atomic Fermi gas
confined to two dimensions in an optical lattice. Using radio-frequency
spectroscopy we measure the interaction energy of the strongly interacting gas.
We observe the confinement-induced Feshbach resonance and find the existence of
confinement-induced molecules in very good agreement with theoretical
predictions.
