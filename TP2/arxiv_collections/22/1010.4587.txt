We derive two classes of multi-mode Bell inequalities under local realistic
assumptions, which are violated only by the entangled states negative under
partial transposition in accordance with the Peres conjecture. Remarkably, the
failure of local realism can be manifested by exploiting wave and particle
correlations of readily accessible continuous-variable states, with very large
violation of inequalities insensitive to detector-efficiency, which makes a
strong case for a loophole-free test.
