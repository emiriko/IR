We investigate the potential of the LHC for discovering the heavy vector and
fermion resonances present in the Three-Site Higgsless Model. To this end, the
model was implemented into the WHIZARD parton-level Monte Carlo eventgenerator.
The results of parton-level simulations for different potential discovery
channels are presented together with a discussion of the parameter space thus
accessible at the LHC.
