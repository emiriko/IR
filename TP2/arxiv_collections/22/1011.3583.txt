Many high performance-computing algorithms are bandwidth limited, hence the
need for optimal data rearrangement kernels as well as their easy integration
into the rest of the application. In this work, we have built a CUDA library of
fast kernels for a set of data rearrangement operations. In particular, we have
built generic kernels for rearranging m dimensional data into n dimensions,
including Permute, Reorder, Interlace/De-interlace, etc. We have also built
kernels for generic Stencil computations on a two-dimensional data using
templates and functors that allow application developers to rapidly build
customized high performance kernels. All the kernels built achieve or surpass
best-known performance in terms of bandwidth utilization.
