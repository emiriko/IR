Theories of planet formation predict the birth of giant planets in the inner,
dense, and gas-rich regions of the circumstellar disks around young stars.
These are the regions from which strong CO emission is expected. Observations
have so far been unable to confirm the presence of planets caught in formation.
We have developed a novel method to detect a giant planet still embedded in a
circumstellar disk by the distortions of the CO molecular line profiles
emerging from the protoplanetary disk's surface. The method is based on the
fact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow in
addition to distorting the disk surface density. We have calculated the
emerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models with
semianalytic radiative transfer calculations. Our results have shown that a
giant Jupiter-like planet can be detected using contemporary or future
high-resolution near-IR spectrographs such as VLT/CRIRES or ELT/METIS. We have
also studied the effects of binarity on disk perturbations. The most
interesting results have been found for eccentric circumprimary disks in
mid-separation binaries, for which the disk eccentricity - detectable from the
asymmetric line profiles - arises from the gravitational effects of the
companion star. Our detailed simulations shed new light on how to constrain the
disk kinematical state as well as its eccentricity profile. Recent findings by
independent groups have shown that core-accretion is severely affected by disk
eccentricity, hence detection of an eccentric protoplanetary disk in a young
binary system would further constrain planet formation theories.
