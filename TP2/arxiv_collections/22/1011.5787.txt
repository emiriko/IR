This paper is a continuation of our earlier work \cite{NRxx} in which a
numerical moment method with arbitrary order of moments was presented. However,
the computation may break down during the calculation of the structure of a
shock wave with Mach number $M_0 \geqslant 3$. In this paper, we concentrate on
the regularization of the moment systems. First, we apply the Maxwell iteration
to the infinite moment system and determine the magnitude of each moment with
respect to the Knudsen number. After that, we obtain the approximation of high
order moments and close the moment systems by dropping some high-order terms.
Linearization is then performed to obtain a very simple regularization term,
thus it is very convenient for numerical implementation. To validate the new
regularization, the shock structure of low order systems is computed with
different number of moments and different shock Mach numbers.
