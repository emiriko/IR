We consider a finite or countable collection of one-dimensional Brownian
particles whose dynamics at any point in time is determined by their rank in
the entire particle system. Using Transportation Cost Inequalities for
stochastic processes we provide uniform fluctuation bounds for the ordered
particles, their local time of collisions, and various associated statistics
over intervals of time. For example, such processes, when exponentiated and
rescaled, exhibit power law decay under stationarity; we derive concentration
bounds for the empirical estimates of the index of the power law over large
intervals of time. A key ingredient in our proofs is a novel upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant of the Skorokhod map that transforms a multidimensional
Brownian path to a path which is constrained not to leave the positive orthant.
