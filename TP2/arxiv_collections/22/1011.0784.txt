This is a report on joint work with T. Hausel and L. Migliorini, where we
prove, for each of the groups GL(2,C), PGL(2,C), SL(2,C), that the non-Abelian
Hodge theorem identifies the weight filtration on the cohomology of the
character variety with the perverse Leray filtration on the cohomology of the
domain of the Hitchin map. We review the decomposition theorem, N\^go's support
theorem, the geometric description of the perverse filtration and the
sub-additivity of the Leray filtration with respect to the cup product.
