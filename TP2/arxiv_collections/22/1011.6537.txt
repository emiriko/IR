The electroweak $\mc O(\alpha)$ radiative corrections to the decay of the
lightest MSSM Higgs boson to four leptons are presented, improved by the
two-loop corrections provided by the program package FeynHiggs. We also analyze
the results in the decoupling limit and investigate the numeric impact of
contributions from the genuine supersymmetric particle spectrum.
