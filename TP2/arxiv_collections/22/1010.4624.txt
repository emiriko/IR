We study the behavior of the AsqTad quark propagator in Landau gauge on SU(3)
Yang-Mills gauge configurations under the removal of center vortices. In SU(2)
gauge theory, center vortices have been observed to generate chiral symmetry
breaking and dominate the infrared behavior of the quark propagator. In
contrast, we report a weak dependence on the vortex content of the gauge
configurations, including the survival of dynamical mass generation on
configurations with vanishing string tension.
