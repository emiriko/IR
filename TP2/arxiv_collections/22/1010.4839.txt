We first establish a simple procedure to obtain with 11-figure accuracy the
values of Chandrasekhar's H-function for isotropic scattering using a
closed-form integral representation and the Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Based on
the numerical values of the function produced by this method for various values
of the single scattering albedo and the cosine of the azimuth angle of the
direction of radiation emergent from or incident upon a semi-infinite
scattering-absorbing medium, we propose a rational approximation formula, which
allows us to reproduce the correct values of the H-function within a relative
error of 2.1/100000 without recourse to any iterative procedure or root-finding
process.
