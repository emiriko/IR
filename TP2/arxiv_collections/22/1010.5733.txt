December Monocerotids and November Orionids are weak but established annual
meteor showers active throughout November and December. Analysis of a high
quality orbits subset of the SonotaCo video meteor database shows that the
distribution of orbital elements, geocentric velocity and also the orbital
evolution of the meteors and potential parent body may imply a common origin
for these meteors coming from the parent comet C/1917 F1 Mellish. This is also
confirmed by the physical properties and activity of these shower meteors. An
assumed release of meteoroids at the perihelion of the comet in the past and
the sky-plane radiant distribution reveal that the December Monocerotid stream
might be younger than the November Orionids. A meteoroid transversal component
of ejection velocity at the perihelion must be larger than 100 m/s. A few
authors have also associated December Canis Minorids with the comet C/1917 F1
Mellish. However, we did not find any connection.
