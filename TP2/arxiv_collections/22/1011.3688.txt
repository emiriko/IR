We show that edge states similar to those known for topological insulators
exist in two-dimensional electron system with one-band spectrum in the presence
of heterogeneous spin-orbit interaction (SOI). These states appear at
boundaries between regions with the SOIs of different kind or between the
regions with the SOI and without it. Depending on the system parameters they
can appear in an energy range lying both in the forbidden and conduction bands
of bulk states. The edge states have chiral spin texture and carry a spin
current under the equilibrium. We study also the size quantization of the edge
states in a strip structure with two boundaries to find an unusual dependence
of the quantization energy on the strip width.
