We analyze a large, complex equatorial coronal hole (ECH) and its immediate
surroundings with a focus on the roots of the fast solar wind. We start by
demonstrating that our ECH is indeed a source of the fast solar wind at 1AU by
examining in situ plasma measurements in conjunction with recently developed
measures of magnetic conditions of the photosphere, inner heliosphere and the
mapping of the solar wind source region. We focus the bulk of our analysis on
interpreting the thermal and spatial dependence of the non-thermal line widths
in the ECH as measured by SOHO/SUMER by placing the measurements in context
with recent studies of ubiquitous Alfven waves in the solar atmosphere and line
profile asymmetries (indicative of episodic heating and mass loading of the
coronal plasma) that originate in the strong, unipolar magnetic flux
concentrations that comprise the supergranular network. The results presented
in this paper are consistent with a picture where a significant portion of the
energy responsible for the transport of heated mass into the fast solar wind is
provided by episodically occurring small-scale events (likely driven by
magnetic reconnection) in the upper chromosphere and transition region of the
strong magnetic flux regions that comprise the supergranular network.
