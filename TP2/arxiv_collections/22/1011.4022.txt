Type Ia supernovae are bright stellar explosions thought to occur when a
thermonuclear runaway consumes roughly a solar mass of degenerate stellar
material. These events produce and disseminate iron-peak elements, and
properties of their light curves allow for standardization and subsequent use
as cosmological distance indicators. The explosion mechanism of these events
remains, however, only partially understood. Many models posit the explosion
beginning with a deflagration born near the center of a white dwarf that has
gained mass from a stellar companion. In order to match observations, models of
this single-degenerate scenario typically invoke a subsequent transition of the
(subsonic) deflagration to a (supersonic) detonation that rapidly consumes the
star. We present an investigation into the systematics of thermonuclear
supernovae assuming this paradigm. We utilize a statistical framework for a
controlled study of two-dimensional simulations of these events from randomized
initial conditions. We investigate the effect of the composition and thermal
history of the progenitor on the radioactive yield, and thus brightness, of an
event. Our results offer an explanation for some observed trends of mean
brightness with properties of the host galaxy.
