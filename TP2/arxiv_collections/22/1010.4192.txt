Pion-nucleon scattering, pion photoproduction, and nucleon Compton scattering
are analyzed within a scheme based on the chiral Lagrangian. Partial-wave
amplitudes are obtained by an analytic extrapolation of subthreshold reaction
amplitudes computed in chiral perturbation theory, where the constraints set by
electromagnetic-gauge invariance, causality and unitarity are used to stabilize
the extrapolation. Experimental data are reproduced up to energies
$\sqrt{s}\simeq 1300$ MeV in terms of the parameters relevant at order $Q^3$. A
striking puzzle caused by an old photon asymmetry measurement close to the pion
production threshold is discussed.
