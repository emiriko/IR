Electron spin qubits in molecular systems offer high reproducibility and the
ability to self assemble into larger architectures. However, interactions
between neighbouring qubits are 'always-on' and although the electron spin
coherence times can be several hundred microseconds, these are still much
shorter than typical times for nuclear spins. Here we implement an
electron-nuclear hybrid scheme which uses coherent transfer between electron
and nuclear spin degrees of freedom in order to both controllably turn on/off
dipolar interactions between neighbouring spins and benefit from the long
nuclear spin decoherence times (T2n). We transfer qubit states between the
electron and 15N nuclear spin in 15N@C60 with a two-way process fidelity of
88%, using a series of tuned microwave and radiofrequency pulses and measure a
nuclear spin coherence lifetime of over 100 ms.
