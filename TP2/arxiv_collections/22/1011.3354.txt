We show that the fluctuations in the wounded-nucleon model of the initial
stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, together with the natural
assumption that the forward (backward) moving wounded nucleons emit particles
preferably in the forward (backward) direction, lead to an event-by-event
torqued fireball. The principal axes associated with the transverse shape are
rotated in the forward region in the opposite direction than in the backward
region. On the average, the standard deviation of the relative torque angle
between the forward and backward rapidity regions is about 20deg for the
central and 10deg for the mid-peripheral collisions. The hydrodynamic expansion
of a torqued fireball leads to a torqued collective flow, yielding, in turn,
torqued principal axes of the transverse-momentum distributions at different
rapidities. We propose experimental measures, based on cumulants involving
particles in different rapidity regions, which should allow for a quantitative
determination of the effect from the data. To estimate the non-flow
contributions from resonance decays we run Monte Carlo simulations with
THERMINATOR. If the event-by-event torque effect is found in the data, it will
support the assumptions concerning the fluctuations in the early stage of the
fireball formation, as well as the hypothesis of the asymmetric rapidity shape
of the emission functions of the moving sources in the nucleus-nucleus
collisions.
