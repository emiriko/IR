We study single-crystal CeCoIn5 with uniaxial pressure up to 3.97 kbar
applied along the c-axis. We find a non-linear dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature Tc on pressure, with a maximum close to
2 kbar. The transition also broadens significantly as pressure increases. We
discuss the temperature dependence in terms of the general trend that Tc
decreases in anisotropic heavy-fermion compounds as they move towards
three-dimensional behavior.
