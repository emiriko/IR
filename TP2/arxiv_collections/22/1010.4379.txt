We propose two viable scenarios explaining the recent observations on cosmic
positron excess. In both scenarios, the present relic density in the Universe
is assumed to be still supported by thermally produced WIMP or LSP (\chi). One
of the scenarios is based on two dark matter (DM) components (\chi,X) scenario,
and the other is on SO(10) SUSY GUT. In the two DM components scenario,
extremely small amount of non-thermally produced meta-stable DM component
[O(10^{-10}) < n_X /n_\chi] explains the cosmic positron excess. In the SO(10)
model, extremely small R-parity violation for LSP decay to e^\pm is naturally
achieved with a non-zero VEV of the superpartner of one right-handed neutrino
(\tilde{\nu}^c) and a global symmetry.
