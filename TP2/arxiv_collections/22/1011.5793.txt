After discussing the relevance of a first principles theory-prediction of the
hadronic vacuum polarisation for Standard Model tests, the theoretical
challenges for its computation in lattice QCD are reviewed. New ideas that will
potentially improve the quality of lattice simulations will be introduced and
the status of ongoing simulations will be presented briefly.
