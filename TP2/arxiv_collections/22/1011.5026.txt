Techniques from effective field theory are applied to nuclear rotation. This
approach exploits the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry and the
separation of scale between low-energy Nambu-Goldstone rotational modes and
high-energy vibrational and nucleonic degrees of freedom. A power counting is
established and the Hamiltonian is constructed at next-to-leading order.
