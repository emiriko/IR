We study spin tunneling in a magnetic nanoparticle with biaxial anisotropy
that is free to rotate about its anisotropy axis. Exact instanton of the
coupled equations of motion is found that connects degenerate classical energy
minima. We show that mechanical freedom of the particle renormalizes magnetic
anisotropy and increases the tunnel splitting.
