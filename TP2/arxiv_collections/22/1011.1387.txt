We report a $^{23}$Na and $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
investigation of Na$_{x}$FeAs series ($x=1$, 0.9, 0.8) exhibiting a
spin-density wave (SDW) order below $T_{\rm SDW}=45$, 50 and 43 K for $x=1$,
0.9, 0.8, respectively, and a bulk superconductivity below $T_c\approx 12$ K
for x=0.9. Below $T_{\rm SDW}$, a spin-lattice relaxation reveals the presence
of gapless particle-hole excitations in the whole $x$ range, meaning that a
portion of the Fermi surface remains gapless. The superconducting fraction as
deduced from the bulk susceptibility scales with this portion, while the SDW
order parameter as deduced from the NMR linewidth scales inversely with it. The
NMR lineshape can only be reproduced assuming an incommensurate (IC) SDW. These
findings qualitatively correspond to the mean-field models of competing
interband magnetism and intraband superconductivity, which lead to an IC SDW
order coexisting with superconductivity in part of the phase diagram.
