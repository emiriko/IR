Global fits to neutrino oscillation data are compatible with tri-bimaximal
mixing pattern, which predicts $\theta_{23} = \frac{\pi}{4}, \theta_{12} =
\sin^{-1} (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$ and $\theta_{13} = 0$. We propose here to
parametrize the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix $V_{TBM}$ by its hermitian
generator $H_{TBM}$ using the exponential map. Then we use the exponential map
to express the deviations from tri-bimaximal pattern by deriving the hermitian
matrices $H_{z=0}$ and $H_1$. These deviations might come from the symmetry
breaking of the neutrino and charged lepton sectors.
