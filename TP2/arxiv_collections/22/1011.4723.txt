The modern theory of the potential does not give a solution of Poisson's
equation. In the present work its solution has been found via generalized
functions and a nonpotential solution of the continuity equation has been
obtained. The method is demonstrated by the solution of elasticity equations
using the example of a crack in the infinite specimen and a surface crack.
Their elastic energies have been calculated. In has been shown that there is no
critical condition for a crack in the infinite specimen and the crack always
closes. Only the surface crack possesses the critical condition.
