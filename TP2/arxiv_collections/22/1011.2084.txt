We construct Pfaffian L-ensembles related to the z-measures on partitions and
to the Plancherel measures on partitions with the Jack parameters 1/2 or 2. The
results imply that these measures on partitions lead to Pfaffian point
processes, and the correlation kernels of these processes can be expressed in
terms of the corresponding L-matrices. We give explit formulae for these
L-matrices.
