The recent detection of the transit of very massive substellar companions
(CoRoT-3b, Deleuil et al. 2008; CoRoT-15b, Bouchy et al. 2010; WASP-30b,
Anderson et al. 2010; Hat-P-20b, Bakos et al. 2010) provides a strong
constraint to planet and brown dwarf formation and migration mechanisms.
Whether these objects are brown dwarfs originating from the gravitational
collapse of a dense molecular cloud that, at the same time, gave birth to the
more massive stellar companion, or whether they are planets that formed through
core accretion of solids in the protoplanetary disk can not always been
determined unambiguously and the mechanisms responsible for their short orbital
distances are not yet fully understood.
  In this contribution, we examine the possibility to constrain the nature of a
massive substellar object from the various observables provided by the
combination of Radial Velocity and Photometry measurements (e.g. M_p, R_p, M_s,
Age, a, e...).
  In a second part, developments in the modeling of tidal evolution at high
eccentricity and inclination - as measured for HD 80 606 with e=0.9337 (Naef et
al. 2001), XO-3 with a stellar obliquity >37.3+-3.7 deg (H\'ebrard et al. 2008;
Winn et al. 2009) and several other exoplanets - are discussed along with their
implication in the understanding of the radius anomaly problem of extrasolar
giant planets.
