In this paper, we quantize universal gauge groups such as SU(\infty), in the
sigma-C*-algebra setting. More precisely, we propose a concise definition of
sigma-C*-quantum groups and explain the concept here. At the same time, we put
this definition in the mathematical context of countably compactly generated
groups as well as C*-compact quantum groups.
