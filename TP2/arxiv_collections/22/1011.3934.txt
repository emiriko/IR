We show that electron-phonon coupling strongly affects transport properties
of the Luttinger liquid hybridized with a resonant level. Namely, this coupling
significantly modifies the effective energy-dependent width of the resonant
level in two different geometries, corresponding to the resonant or
antiresonant transmission in the Fermi gas. This leads to a rich phase diagram
for a metal-insulator transition induced by the hybridization with the resonant
level.
