We study the neutron-rich calcium isotopes performing shell-model
calculations with a realistic effective interaction. This is derived from the
CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential renormalized by way of the V-low-k approach,
considering 48Ca as an inert core and including the neutron 0g9/2 orbital. We
compare our results with experiment and with the results of a previous study
where 40Ca was assumed as a closed core and the standard 1p0f model space was
employed. The calculated spectroscopic properties are in both cases in very
good agreement with the available experimental data and enable a discussion on
the role of the g9/2 single-particle state in the heavy-mass Ca isotopes.
