From 2001 to 2007, COSMOS provided a teaching and outreach venue for the
Center for Adaptive Optics Professional Development Program (CfAO PDP). COSMOS
is a four-week residential mathematics and science summer program for
high-school students organized by the University of California on four of its
campuses. Two topical science courses comprised each COSMOS cluster. An
astronomy course has always formed a basis for the CfAO PDP-affiliated cluster.
The course included a variety of pedagogical techniques to address a diversity
of learners and goals. We outline the astronomy course---lectures, activities,
etc.---and provide the rationale for what was taught, how it was aught, and
when it was taught.
