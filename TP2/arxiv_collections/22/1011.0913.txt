We consider the existence of invariant manifolds in phase space governing
reaction dynamics in situations where there are no saddle points on the
potential energy surface in the relevant regions of configuration space. We
point out that such situations occur in a number of important classes of
chemical reactions, and we illustrate this concretely by considering a model
for transition state switching in an ion-molecule association reaction due to
Chesnavich (J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 84}, 2615 (1986)). For this model we show that,
in the region of configuration space relevant to the reaction, there are no
saddle points on the potential energy surface, but that in phase space there is
a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) bounding a dividing surface
having the property that the reactive flux through this dividing surface is a
minimum. We then describe two methods for finding NHIMs and their associated
phase space structures in systems with more than two degrees-of-freedom. These
methods do not rely on the existence of saddle points, or any other particular
feature, of the potential energy surface.
