We show that the recently measured 3.2 $\sigma$ deviations of the charge
asymmetry of like-sign dimuon events from the standard model prediction by the
D0 collaboration at Tevatron can be explained by introducing the anomalous
right-handed top quark couplings. Combined analysis with the $\bs$ and $\bd$
mixings and $B \to X_s \gamma$ decays has been performed. We discuss how to
discriminate the effects on the dimuon charge asymmetry of the anomalous $\tsW$
and $\tbW$ couplings.
