We study the optimal usage-based pricing problem in a resource-constrained
network with one profit-maximizing service provider and multiple groups of
surplus-maximizing users. With the assumption that the service provider knows
the utility function of each user (thus complete information), we find that the
complete price differentiation scheme can achieve a large revenue gain (e.g.,
50%) compared to no price differentiation, when the total network resource is
comparably limited and the high willingness to pay users are minorities.
However, the complete price differentiation scheme may lead to a high
implementational complexity. To trade off the revenue against the
implementational complexity, we further study the partial price differentiation
scheme, and design a polynomial-time algorithm that can compute the optimal
partial differentiation prices. We also consider the incomplete information
case where the service provider does not know which group each user belongs to.
We show that it is still possible to realize price differentiation under this
scenario, and provide the sufficient and necessary condition under which an
incentive compatible differentiation scheme can achieve the same revenue as
under complete information.
