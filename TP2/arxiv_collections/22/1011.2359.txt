It is shown that charge ordering in layered crystalline metals causes an
increase in the normal state energy of the conducting layers. If this increase
in the energy exceeds the difference between the superconducting state energy
and the normal state energy of the metal, then the superconducting transition
occurs. A relation between the charge gap in the superconducting phase and the
bandgap width in the undoped insulating phase of high-temperature
superconductors is obtained.
