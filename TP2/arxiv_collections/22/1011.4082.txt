Recently a metallic state was discovered at the interface between insulating
oxides, most notably LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. Properties of this two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) have attracted significant interest due to its potential
applications in nanoelectronics. Control over this carrier density and mobility
of the 2DEG is essential for applications of these novel systems, and may be
achieved by epitaxial strain. However, despite the rich nature of strain
effects on oxide materials properties, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, and
superconductivity, the relationship between the strain and electrical
properties of the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface remains largely
unexplored. Here, we use different lattice constant single crystal substrates
to produce LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces with controlled levels of biaxial epitaxial
strain. We have found that tensile strained SrTiO3 destroys the conducting
2DEG, while compressively strained SrTiO3 retains the 2DEG, but with a carrier
concentration reduced in comparison to the unstrained LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.
We have also found that the critical LaAlO3 overlayer thickness for 2DEG
formation increases with SrTiO3 compressive strain. Our first-principles
calculations suggest that a strain-induced electric polarization in the SrTiO3
layer is responsible for this behavior. It is directed away from the interface
and hence creates a negative polarization charge opposing that of the polar
LaAlO3 layer. This both increases the critical thickness of the LaAlO3 layer,
and reduces carrier concentration above the critical thickness, in agreement
with our experimental results. Our findings suggest that epitaxial strain can
be used to tailor 2DEGs properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface.
