We describe derived moduli functors for a range of problems involving schemes
and quasi-coherent sheaves, and give cohomological conditions for them to be
representable by derived geometric n-stacks. Examples of problems represented
by derived geometric 1-stacks are derived moduli of polarised projective
varieties, derived moduli of vector bundles, and derived moduli of abelian
varieties.
