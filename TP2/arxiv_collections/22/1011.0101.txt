Astronomically, there are viable mechanisms for distributing organic material
throughout the Milky Way. Biologically, the destructive effects of ultraviolet
light and cosmic rays means that the majority of organisms arrive broken and
dead on a new world. The likelihood of conventional forms of panspermia must
therefore be considered low. However, the information content of dam-aged
biological molecules might serve to seed new life (necropanspermia).
