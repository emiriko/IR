Unification-type idea of a basic connection between particle mass and charge
quantities is in the spirit of string theory. On the level of phenomenology,
this idea means raison d'etre for particle flavor since it requires more than
one mass copy i.e. transition from individual particle mass to the concept of
mass-matrix. In this paper that idea is exemplified by a generic system of
accurate empirical relations for dimensionless flavor-electroweak quantities
(fine structure constant, muon-electron and tauon-electron mass ratios and
quark CKM and neutrino PMNS mixing angles) build in terms of one small
universal e-parameter as mediator of mass-matrix and charge quantities. The
used in this study empirically suggested math paradigm consists of repeated
exponentiation of e-powers. Accuracy boost of flavor relations from replacement
of e-power terms by exponential f-terms is observed. The two widely discussed
in the literature empirical flavor regularities, quark-lepton complementarity
(QLC) and Koide charged lepton mass formula, are essential parts of the generic
system. Solar neutrino mixing angle is predicted {\theta}sol= 34.05o by
extension of QLC. Charged lepton mass ratios satisfy Koide relation with high
accuracy ~10-9. The Appendix contains comments on dual objective-anthropic
nature of physical reality.
