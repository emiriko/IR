We present robust radio frequency (rf) pulses that tolerate a factor of six
inhomogeneity in the B1 field, significantly enhancing the potential of toroid
cavity resonators for NMR spectroscopic applications. Both point-to-point (PP)
and unitary rotation (UR) pulses were optimized for excitation, inversion, and
refocusing using the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm based
on optimal control theory. In addition, the optimized parameterization (OP)
algorithm applied to the adiabatic BIR-4 UR pulse scheme enabled ultra-short
(50 microsec) pulses with acceptable performance compared to standard
implementations. OP also discovered a new class of non-adiabatic pulse shapes
with improved performance within the BIR-4 framework. However, none of the
OP-BIR4 pulses are competitive with the more generally optimized UR pulses. The
advantages of the new pulses are demonstrated in simulations and experiments.
In particular, the DQF COSY result presented here represents the first
implementation of 2D NMR spectroscopy using a toroid probe.
