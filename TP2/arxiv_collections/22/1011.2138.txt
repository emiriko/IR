The electromagnetic properties of the deuteron are investigated within a
Light-Front Hamiltonian Dynamics framework, with a current operator that
contains both one-body and two-body contributions. In this work, we are
considering new two-body contributions, with a dynamical nature generated
within a Yukawa model and a structure inspired by a recent analysis of the
current operator, that acts on the three-dimensional valence component and
fulfills the Ward-Takahashi identity. Preliminary results for the magnetic
moment are shown.
