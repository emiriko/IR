In last years a great interest was brought to molecular transport problems at
nanoscales, such as surface diffusion or molecular flows in nano or
sub-nano-channels. In a series of papers V. D. Borman, S. Y. Krylov, A. V.
Prosyanov and J. J. M. Beenakker proposed to use kinetic theory in order to
analyze the mechanisms that determine mobility of molecules in nanoscale
channels. This approach proved to be remarkably useful to give new insight on
these issues, such as density dependence of the diffusion coefficient. In this
paper we revisit these works to derive the kinetic and diffusion models
introduced by V. D. Borman, S. Y. Krylov, A. V. Prosyanov and J. J. M.
Beenakker by using classical tools of kinetic theory such as scaling and
systematic asymptotic analysis. Some results are extended to less restrictive
hypothesis.
