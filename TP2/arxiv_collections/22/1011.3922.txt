Starting with the usual definitions of octonions and split octonions in terms
of Zorn vector matrix realization, we have made an attempt to write the
consistent form of generalized Maxwell's equations in presence of electric and
magnetic charges (dyons). We have thus written the generalized potential,
generalized field, and generalized current of dyons in terms of split octonions
and accordingly the split octonion forms of generalized Dirac Maxwell's
equations are obtained in compact and consistent manner. This theory reproduces
the dynamic of electric (magnetic) in the absence of magnetic (electric)
charges.
