In general frequent itemsets are generated from large data sets by applying
association rule mining algorithms like Apriori, Partition, Pincer-Search,
Incremental, Border algorithm etc., which take too much computer time to
compute all the frequent itemsets. By using Genetic Algorithm (GA) we can
improve the scenario. The major advantage of using GA in the discovery of
frequent itemsets is that they perform global search and its time complexity is
less compared to other algorithms as the genetic algorithm is based on the
greedy approach. The main aim of this paper is to find all the frequent
itemsets from given data sets using genetic algorithm.
