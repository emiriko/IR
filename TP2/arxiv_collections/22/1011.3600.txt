In this paper we have constructed a new class of thin-shell wormholes from
black holes in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. Particular emphasis is placed on
those aspects that allow a comparison of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz to Einstein
gravity. The former enjoys a number of advantages for small values of the
throat radius.
