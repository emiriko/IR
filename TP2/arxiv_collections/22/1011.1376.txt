The nature of magnetization reversal in an isolated cylindrical nanomagnet
has been studied employing time-resolved magnetoresistance measurement. We find
that the reversal mode is highly stochastic, occurring either by multimode or
single-step switching. Intriguingly, the stochasticity was found to depend on
the alignment of the driving magnetic field to the long axis of the nanowires,
where predominantly multimode switching gives way to single-step switching
behavior as the field direction is rotated from parallel to transverse with
respect to the nanowire axis.
