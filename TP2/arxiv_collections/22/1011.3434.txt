For given non-zero integers a,b,q we investigate the density of integer
solutions (x,y) to the binary cubic congruence ax^2+by^3=0 (mod q). We use this
to establish the Manin conjecture for a singular del Pezzo surface of degree 2
defined over the rationals and to examine the distribution of elliptic curves
with square-free discriminant.
