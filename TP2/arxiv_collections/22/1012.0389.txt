We present a class of non-asymptotically flat (NAF) charged black p-branes
(BpB) with p-compact dimensions in higher dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills
theory. Asymptotically the NAF structure manifests itself as an anti-de-sitter
spacetime. We determine the total mass / energy enclosed in a thin-shell
located outside the event horizon. By comparing the entropies of BpB with those
of black holes in same dimensions we derive transition criteria between the two
types of black objects. Given certain conditions satisfied our analysis shows
that BpB can be considered excited states of black holes. An event horizon
$r_{+}$ versus charge square $Q^{2}$ plot \ for the BpB reveals such a
transition where $r_{+}$ is related to the horizon radius $r_{h}$ of the black
hole (BH) both with the common charge $% Q. $
