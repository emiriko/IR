This paper considers the clustering problem for large data sets. We propose
an approach based on distributed optimization. The clustering problem is
formulated as an optimization problem of maximizing the classification gain. We
show that the optimization problem can be reformulated and decomposed into
small-scale sub optimization problems by using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition
method. Generally speaking, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can only be used for
convex optimization problems, where the duality gaps are zero. Even though, the
considered optimization problem in this paper is non-convex, we prove that the
duality gap goes to zero, as the problem size goes to infinity. Therefore, the
Dantzig-Wolfe method can be applied here. In the proposed approach, the
clustering problem is iteratively solved by a group of computers coordinated by
one center processor, where each computer solves one independent small-scale
sub optimization problem during each iteration, and only a small amount of data
communication is needed between the computers and center processor. Numerical
results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient.
