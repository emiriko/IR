We classify homotopes of classical symmetric spaces (studied in Part I of
this work). Our classification uses the fibered structure of homotopes: they
are fibered as symmetric spaces, with flat fibers, over a non-degenerate base;
the base spaces correspond to inner ideals in Jordan pairs. Using that inner
ideals in classical Jordan pairs are always complemented (in the sense defined
by O. Loos and E. Neher), the classification of homotopes is obtained by
combining the classification of inner ideals with the one of isotopes of a
given inner ideal.
