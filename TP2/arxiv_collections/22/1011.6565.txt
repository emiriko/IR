We report on room temperature laser action of an all monolithic ZnO-based
vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) under optical pumping. The VCSEL
structure consists of a 2{\lambda} microcavity containing 8
ZnO/Zn(0.92)Mg(0.08)O quantum wells embedded in epitaxially grown
Zn(0.92)Mg(0.08)O/Zn(0.65)Mg(0.35)O distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs). As a
prerequisite, design and growth of high reflectivity DBRs based on ZnO and
(Zn,Mg)O for optical devices operating in the ultraviolet and blue-green
spectral range are discussed.
