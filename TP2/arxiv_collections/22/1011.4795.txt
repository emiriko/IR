It is well known that any sufficiently regular one-dimensional payoff
function has an explicit static hedge by bonds, forward contracts and lots of
vanilla options. We show that the natural extension of the corresponding
representation leads to a static hedge based on the same instruments along with
traffic light options, which have recently been introduced in the market. One
big advantage of these replication strategies is the easy structure of the
hedge. Hence, traffic light options are particularly powerful building blocks
for more complicated bivariate options. While it is well known that the second
strike derivative of non-discounted prices of vanilla options are related to
the risk-neutral density of the underlying asset price in the corresponding
absolutely continuous settings, similar statements hold for traffic light
options in sufficiently regular bivariate settings.
