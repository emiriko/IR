We propose a measure of shape which is appropriate for the study of a
complicated geometric structure, defined using the topology of neighborhoods of
the structure. One aspect of this measure gives a new notion of fractal
dimension. We demonstrate the utility and computability of this measure by
applying it to branched polymers, Brownian trees, and self-avoiding random
walks.
