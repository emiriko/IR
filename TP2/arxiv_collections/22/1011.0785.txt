In 1997 and 2008 we used the WFPC2 camera on board of the Hubble Space
Telescope to obtain two sets of narrow-band H$\alpha$ images of the runaway
Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR 124 surrounded by its nebula M1-67. This two-epoch
imaging provides an expansion parallax and thus a practically assumption-free
geometric distance to the nebula, d=3.35 +/- 0.67 kpc. Combined with the global
velocity distribution in the ejected nebula, this confirms the extreme runaway
status of WR 124. WR stars embedded within such ejection nebulae, at the point
of core-collapse would produce different supernova characteristics from those
expected for stars surrounded by wind-filled cavities. In galaxies with
extremely low ambient metallicity, Z <= 10^{-3} Z_Sun, gamma-ray bursts
originating from fast-moving runaway WR stars may produce afterglows which
appear to be coming from regions with a relatively homogeneous circumburst
medium.
