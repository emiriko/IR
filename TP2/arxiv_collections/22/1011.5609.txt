A measurement technique is described which has the potential to map the
atomic site occupancies of ultracold atoms in a short-period three-dimensional
optical lattice. The method uses accordion and pinning lattices, together with
polarization gradient cooling and fluorescence detection, to measure the
positions of individual atoms within the sample in three dimensions at a
resolution of around half the atomic resonant wavelength. The method measures
the site occupancy, rather than the parity of the site occupancy, of atoms in
the lattice. It is expected that such measurements hold significant potential
for the study of ultracold quantum dynamics.
