We study how attractive boron correlations in boron-doped diamond affect the
superconducting critical temperature. The critical temperature is obtained from
the McMillan formula for strong coupling superconductors with the density of
states evaluated in the dynamical cluster approximation. Numerical results for
the cluster of $2\times 2\times 2$ atoms show that attractive correlations
lower the density of states at the Fermi level. We argue that this might
explain experimentally observed differences in critical temperatures of 100 and
111 oriented films.
