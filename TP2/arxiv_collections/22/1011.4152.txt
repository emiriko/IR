Fourier-Legendre decomposition (FLD) of solar Doppler imaging data is a
promising method to estimate the sub-surface solar meridional flow. FLD is
sensible to low-degree oscillation modes and thus has the potential to probe
the deep meridional flow. We present a newly developed code to be used for
large scale FLD analysis of helioseismic data as provided by the Global
Oscillation Network Group (GONG), the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI)
instrument, and the upcoming Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument.
First results obtained with the new code are qualitatively comparable to those
obtained from ring-diagram analyis of the same time series.
