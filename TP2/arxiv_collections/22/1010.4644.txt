Ultrafine-grained Al alloys produced by high pressure torsion are found to
exhibit a very high strength, considerably exceeding the Hall-Petch predictions
for the ultrafine grains. The phenomena can be attributed to the unique
combination of ultrafine structure and deformation-induced segregations of
solute elements along grain boundaries, which may affect the emission and
mobility of intragranular dislocations.
