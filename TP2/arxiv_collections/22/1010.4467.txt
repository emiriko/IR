I explore the rich phase diagram of two-flavor QCD as a function of the quark
masses. The theory involves three parameters, including one that is CP
violating. As the masses vary, regions of both first and second order
transitions are expected. For non-degenerate quarks, non-perturbative effects
cease to be universal, leaving individual quark mass ratios with a
renormalization scheme dependence. This raises complications in matching
lattice results with perturbative schemes and demonstrates the tautology of
attacking the strong CP problem via a vanishing up quark mass.
