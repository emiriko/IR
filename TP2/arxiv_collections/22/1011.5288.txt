We perform a non-perturbative lattice calculation of the P-wave pion-pion
scattering phase in the rho-meson decay channel using two flavors of maximally
twisted mass fermions at pion masses ranging from 480 MeV to 290 MeV. Making
use of finite-size methods, we evaluate the pion-pion scattering phase in the
center-of-mass frame and two moving frames. Applying an effective range
formula, we find a good description of our results for the scattering phase as
a function of the energy covering the resonance region. This allows us to
extract the rho-meson mass and decay width and to study their quark mass
dependence.
