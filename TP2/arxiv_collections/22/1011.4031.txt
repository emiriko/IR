In this paper we show how all the quantum properties of Schroedinger and
Pauli particles can be described entirely from within a Clifford algebra taken
over the reals. There is no need to appeal to any `wave function'. To describe
a quantum system, we define the Clifford density element [CDE] as a product of
an element of a minimal left ideal and its Clifford conjugate. The properties
of the system are then completely specified in terms of bilinear invariants of
the first and second kind calculated using the CDE. Thus the quantum properties
of a system can be completely described from within the algebra without the
need to appeal to any Hilbert space representation.
  Furthermore we show that the essential bilinear invariants of the second kind
are simply the Bohm energy and the Bohm momentum, entities that make their
appearance in the Bohm interpretation. We also show how these parameters emerge
from standard quantum field theory in the low energy, single particle
approximation. There is no need to appeal to classical mechanics at any stage.
This clearly shows that the Bohm approach is entirely within the standard
quantum formalism. The method has enabled us to lay the foundations of an
approach that can be extended to provide a complete relativistic version of
Bohm model. In this paper we confine our attention to the details of the
non-relativistic case and will present its relativistic extension in a
subsequent paper.
