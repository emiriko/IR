We construct solutions of a model which includes the Gauss-Bonnet and
Born-Infeld terms for various horizon topologies $(k=0, \pm 1)$, and then the
mass, temperature, entropy and heat capacity of black holes are computed. For
the sake of simplicity, we perform the stability analysis of five dimensional
topological black holes in AdS space.
