In this paper, we discuss a new iterative method for computing $\sin_{p}$.
This function was introduced by Lindqvist in connection with the unidimensional
nonlinear Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for the $p$-Laplacian. The iterative
technique was inspired by the inverse power method in finite dimensional linear
algebra and is competitive with other methods available in the literature.
