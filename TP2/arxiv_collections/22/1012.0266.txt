The increasing number of extra-solar planets opens a new opportunity for
studies of the formation of planetary systems. Resonant systems are of
particular interest because their dynamical configuration provides constraints
on the unobservable formation and migration phase. In this thesis, formation
scenarios for the planetary systems HD128311 and HD45364 are presented. N-body
simulations of two planets and two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of
proto-planetary discs are used to model the migration phase and the capture
into resonance. The results indicate that the proto-planetary disc has a larger
surface density than previously thought. Proto-planets are exposed to
stochastic forces, generated by density fluctuations in the disc. A generic
model of both a single planet, and two planets in resonance, being
stochastically forced is presented. The system GJ876, for example, is stable
for reasonable strengths of the stochastic forces, but systems with lighter
planets can get disrupted. Even if they are not disrupted completely,
stochastic forces create characteristic, observable libration patterns.
Turbulence plays also an important role during the early phases of the planet
formation process. Due to the large separation of scales, the gravitational
collapse in the core accretion model is very hard to model numerically. A
scaled method is presented, that allows for the correct treatment of
self-gravity in a marginally collisional system by taking into account the
relevant small scale processes. Interestingly, this system is dynamically very
similar to Saturn's rings. The stochastic migration of small bodies in Saturn's
rings is also studied. Analytic predictions of the interactions of a
moonlet/propeller with ring particles are compared to collisional N-body
simulations with up to a million particles. The random walk is fast enough to
be directly observable by the Cassini spacecraft.
