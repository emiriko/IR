In the previous paper we have argued that the LHC data on multiplicity,
average transverse momentum, and charged particle transverse momentum
distributions are well described with minimal modeling in terms of a saturation
scale Q_sat(s). As a consequence, the p_T spectra should exhibit geometric
scaling. In this short note we show that recently released CMS data at
sqrt{s}=0.9, 2.36 and 7 TeV fall on a universal curve when plotted in terms of
suitably defined scaling variable \tau.
