In the paper, we present a new kind of function photonic crystals, which
refractive index is a function of space position. Unlike conventional PCs,
which structure grow from two materials, A and B, with different dielectric
constants $\epsilon_{A}$ and $\epsilon_{B}$. By Fermat principle, we give the
motion equations of light in one-dimensional, two-dimensional and
three-dimensional function photonic crystals. For one-dimensional function
photonic crystals, we study the dispersion relation, band gap structure and
transmissivity, and compare them with conventional photonic crystals. By
choosing various refractive index distribution function $n(z)$, we can obtain
more width or more narrow band gap structure than conventional photonic
crystals.
