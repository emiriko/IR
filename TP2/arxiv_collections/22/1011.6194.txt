A method of images is applied to study the spontaneous emission of an atom
inside a metallic wedge with an opening angle of $\pi/N$, where N is an
arbitrary positive integer. We show the method of images gives a rate formula
consistent with that from Quantum Electrodynamics. Using the method of images,
we show the correspondence between the oscillations in the spontaneous emission
rate and the closed-orbits of emitted photon going away and returning to the
atom inside the wedge. The closed-orbits can be readily constructed using the
method of images and they are also extracted from the spontaneous emission
rate.
