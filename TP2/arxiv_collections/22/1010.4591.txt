The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b--which has been labelled as a 'hot
Neptune'--reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of and
behind its parent star as seen from Earth. Respectively known as the primary
transit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the planet's radius and
mass, and the latter constrains the planet's temperature and, with measurements
at multiple wavelengths, its atmospheric composition. Previous work using
transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-\mu m water vapour band,
leaving the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report
the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at
multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. The best-fit
compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane
(CH4) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for the
predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Moreover, we report the presence of
some H2O and traces of CO2. Because CH4 is expected to be the dominant
carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and
polymerization of methane into substances such as ethylene may be required to
explain the hot Neptune's small CH4-to-CO ratio, which is at least 10^5 times
smaller than predicted.
