In this paper, we examine the possibility to implement some form of emergent
Newtonian gravity in a generic multi-component Bose--Einstein condensate.
Parallely to what happens for the emergence of low energy Lorentz invariance,
strong requirements have to be imposed on the underlying condensed matter
model. We will show, within a simplified model, that the presence of a global
symmetry alleviates the problems associated to Lorentz violation, allows the
presence of a long range potential, to which the analogue matter fields (the
quasi-particles) are coupled following a weaker form of equivalence principle.
