We report on structural, susceptibility, conductivity, and heat-capacity
studies of FeSe0.5Te0.5 single crystals with 2% substitution of Mn for Fe.
Mn-doped samples show a higher onset temperature, a narrower width of the
superconducting transition, and a higher magnitude of the jump in the specific
heat at Tc in compared to undoped samples. From the resistivity data in
magnetic fields parallel to the c axis we derived an upper critical field Hc2
of ~580 kOe for doped samples compared to 490 kOe for pure samples. Using a
single-band BCS model we can describe the electronic specific heat in the
superconducting state with a gap Delta(T=0) = 31 K for the Mn doped sample in
comparison to 26 K for pure FeSe0.5Te0.5.
