Among the various kinds of effective forces in soft matter, the spatial range
and the direction of the so-called critical Casimir force - which is generated
by the enhanced thermal fluctuations close to a continuous phase transition -
can be controlled and reversibly modified to an uncommonly large extent. In
particular, minute temperature changes of the fluid solvent, which provides the
near-critical thermal fluctuations, lead to a significant change of the range
and strength of the effective interaction among the solute particles. This
feature allows one to control, e.g., the aggregation of colloidal dispersions
or the spatial distribution of colloids in the presence of chemically or
topographically patterned substrates. The spatial direction of the effective
force acting on a solute particle depends only on the surface properties of the
immersed particles and can be spatially modulated by suitably patterned
surfaces. These critical Casimir forces are largely independent of the specific
materials properties of both the solvent and the confining surfaces. This
characteristic universality of critical phenomena allows systematic and
quantitative theoretical studies of the critical Casimir forces in terms of
suitable representative and simplified models. Here we highlight recent
theoretical and experimental advances concerning critical Casimir forces with a
particular emphasis on the numerous possibilities of controlling these forces
by substrate patterns.
