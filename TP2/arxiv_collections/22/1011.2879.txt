Interference matrix (IM) has been widely used in frequency
planning/optimization of cellular systems because it describes the interaction
between any two cells. IM is generated from the source data gathered from the
cellular system, either mobile measurement reports (MMRs) or drive test (DT)
records. IM accuracy is not satisfactory since neither MMRs nor DT records
contain complete information on interference and traffic distribution. In this
paper, two IM generation algorithms based on source data fusion are proposed.
Data fusion in one algorithm is to reinforce MMRs data, using the
frequency-domain information of DT data from the same region. Data fusion in
another algorithm is to reshape DT data, using the traffic distribution
information extracted from MMRs from the same region. The fused data contains
more complete information so that more accurate IM can be obtained. Simulation
results have validated this conclusion.
