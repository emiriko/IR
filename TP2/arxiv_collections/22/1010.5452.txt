Modal quantum theory (MQT) is a simplified cousin of ordinary Hilbert space
quantum theory. We show that two important theorems of actual quantum theory,
the Kochen-Specker theorem excluding non-contextual hidden variables and the
Conway-Kochen "free will theorem" about entangled systems, have direct
analogues in MQT. The proofs of these analogue theorems are similar to, but
much simpler than, the originals. We also show that the structure of possible
measurement results for an entangled system in MQT cannot be represented by
probability assignments satisfying the no-signaling principle, such as those
given by ordinary quantum theory.
