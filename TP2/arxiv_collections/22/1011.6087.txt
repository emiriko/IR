We propose a model of quantum-like (QL) processing of mental information.
This model is based on quantum information theory. However, in contrast to
models of "quantum physical brain" reducing mental activity (at least at the
highest level) to quantum physical phenomena in the brain, our model matches
well with the basic neuronal paradigm of the cognitive science. QL information
processing is based (surprisingly) on classical electromagnetic signals induced
by joint activity of neurons. This novel approach to quantum information is
based on representation of quantum mechanics as a version of classical signal
theory which was recently elaborated by the author. The brain uses the QL
representation (QLR) for working with abstract concepts; concrete images are
described by classical information theory. Two processes, classical and QL, are
performed parallely. Moreover, information is actively transmitted from one
representation to another. A QL concept given in our model by a density
operator can generate a variety of concrete images given by temporal
realizations of the corresponding (Gaussian) random signal. This signal has the
covariance operator coinciding with the density operator encoding the abstract
concept under consideration. The presence of various temporal scales in the
brain plays the crucial role in creation of QLR in the brain.
