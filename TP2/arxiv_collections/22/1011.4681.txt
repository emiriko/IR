Let M be a six dimensional manifold, endowed with a cohomogeneity one action
of G= SU_2 x SU_2, and M_reg its subset of regular points. We show that M_reg
admits a smooth, 2-parameter family of G-invariant, non-isometric strict nearly
Kaehler structures and that a 1-parameter subfamily of such structures smoothly
extend over a singular orbit of type S^3. This determines a new class of
examples of nearly Kaehler structures on TS^3
