There has been an intense search in recent years for long-lived
spin-polarized carriers for spintronic and quantum-computing devices. Here we
report that spin polarized quasi-particles in superconducting aluminum layers
have surprisingly long spin-lifetimes, nearly a million times longer than in
their normal state. The lifetime is determined from the suppression of the
aluminum's superconductivity resulting from the accumulation of spin polarized
carriers in the aluminum layer using tunnel spin injectors. A Hanle effect,
observed in the presence of small in-plane orthogonal fields, is shown to be
quantitatively consistent with the presence of long-lived spin polarized
quasi-particles. Our experiments show that the superconducting state can be
significantly modified by small electric currents, much smaller than the
critical current, which is potentially useful for devices involving
superconducting qubits.
