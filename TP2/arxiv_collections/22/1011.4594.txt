Relaxation rates in the $13mLiNO_3-6,5mCa(NO_3)_2-H_2O$ ternary system have
been measured for nuclei of water ($^1H$ and $^{17}O$), anion ($^{14}N$), and
both cations ($^7Li$, $^{43}Ca$). The data analysis reveals the system
structure as consisting of two main charged units: [Li(H$_2$O)$_4$]$^+$ and
[Ca(NO$_3$)$_4$]$^{2-}$. Thus the system presents inorganic ionic liquid like
structure.
