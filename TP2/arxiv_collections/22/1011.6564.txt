We study graded rings associated to big divisors on LC pairs whose difference
with the log-canonical divisor is nef. For divisors that are positive enough at
the LC centers of the pair, we prove the finite generation of such rings if the
pair is DLT or the dimension is low, given that a Zariski decomposition exists.
