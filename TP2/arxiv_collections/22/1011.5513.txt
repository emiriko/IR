We investigate a formulation of continuum 4d gravity in terms of a
constrained topological (BF) theory, in the spirit of the Plebanski
formulation, but involving only linear constraints, of the type used recently
in the spin foam approach to quantum gravity. We identify both the continuum
version of the linear simplicity constraints used in the quantum discrete
context and a linear version of the quadratic volume constraints that are
necessary to complete the reduction from the topological theory to gravity. We
illustrate and discuss also the discrete counterpart of the same continuum
linear constraints. Moreover, we show under which additional conditions the
discrete volume constraints follow from the simplicity constraints, thus
playing the role of secondary constraints. Our analysis clarifies how the
discrete constructions of spin foam models are related to a continuum theory
with an action principle that is equivalent to general relativity.
