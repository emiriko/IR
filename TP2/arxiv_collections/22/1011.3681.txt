Here we demonstrate that water-infiltrated nanoporous glass electrically
switches an oxide semiconductor from an insulator to metal. We fabricated the
field effect transistor structure on an oxide semiconductor, SrTiO3, using
100%-water-infiltrated nanoporous glass - amorphous 12CaO*7Al2O3 - as the gate
insulator. For positive gate voltage, electron accumulation, water electrolysis
and electrochemical reduction occur successively on the SrTiO3 surface at room
temperature, leading to the formation of a thin (~3 nm) metal layer with an
extremely high electron concentration of 10^15-10^16 cm^-2, which exhibits
exotic thermoelectric behaviour.
