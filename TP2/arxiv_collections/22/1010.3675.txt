The B-physics program at the ATLAS experiment, which covers the mid-rapidity
region, complements that at the dedicated LHCb experiment, which covers the
forward rapidity region. At the early stage of the LHC operation, the program
concentrated on understanding of detector performance and measurements of
quarkonia and D mesons. This article presents recent results of the B-physics
program at ATLAS.
