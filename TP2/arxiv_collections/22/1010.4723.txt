We report on the observation of Coulomb oscillations from localized quantum
dots superimposed on the normal hopping current in ZnO nanowire transistors.
The Coulomb oscillations can be resolved up to 20 K. Positive anisotropic
magnetoresistance has been observed due to the Lorentz force on the carrier
motion. Magnetic field-induced tunneling barrier transparency results in an
increase of oscillation amplitude with increasing magnetic field. The energy
shift as a function of magnetic field indicates electron wavefunction
modification in the quantum dots.
