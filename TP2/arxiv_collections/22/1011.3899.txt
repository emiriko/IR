We present temporal and spectral properties of a unique X-ray dip in GX 301-2
as seen with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in May 2010. The X-ray pulsation from
the source gradually declined prior to the dip, disappears for one spin cycle
during the dip and is abruptly restored in the spin cycle immediately after the
dip. Moreover, the phase-integrated spectrum of the source becomes softer
before and during the dip and it quickly hardens again following the dip. Our
findings indicate the fact that the mechanism for pulsations gradually turned
off briefly and underlying dim and softer emission likely from the accretion
column became observable in the brief absence of high level emission due to
wind accretion.
