M33 X-7 is among the most massive X-Ray binary stellar systems known, hosting
a rapidly spinning 15.65 Msun black hole orbiting an underluminous 70 Msun Main
Sequence companion in a slightly eccentric 3.45 day orbit. Although
post-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit, it leaves
unexplained the observed X-Ray luminosity, star's underluminosity, black hole's
spin, and eccentricity. A common envelope phase, or rotational mixing, could
explain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to an
overluminous companion. A merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the black
hole were invoked for its spin-up. Here we report that, if M33 X-7 started as a
primary of 85-99 Msun and a secondary of 28-32 Msun, in a 2.8-3.1 day orbit,
its observed properties can be consistently explained. In this model, the Main
Sequence primary transferred part of its envelope to the secondary and lost the
rest in a wind; it ended its life as a ~16 Msun He star with a Fe-Ni core which
collapsed to a black hole (with or without an accompanying supernova). The
release of binding energy and, possibly, collapse asymmetries "kicked" the
nascent black hole into an eccentric orbit. Wind accretion explains the X-Ray
luminosity, while the black hole spin can be natal.
