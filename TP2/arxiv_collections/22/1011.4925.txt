In this short communication, we examine the relevance of the signature of the
space-time metric in the construction of the product of a pseudo-Riemannian
spectral triple with a finite triple describing the internal geometry. We
obtain arguments favouring the appearance of SU(2) and U(1) as gauge groups in
the standard model.
