We present a study of phase transition to macroscopic superfluidity for an
ultracold bosonic gas confined in a combined trap formed by a one-dimensional
optical lattice and a harmonic potential, focusing on the critical temperature
of this system and the interference patterns of the Bose gas released from the
combined trap. Based on a semiclassical energy spectrum, we develop an analytic
approximation for the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and compare the analytic
results with that obtained by numerical computations. For finite temperatures
below $T_{c}$, we calculate the interference patterns for both the normal gas
and the superfluid gas. The total interference pattern shows a feature of
``peak-on-a-peak". As a comparison, we also present the experimentally observed
interference patterns of $^{87}$Rb atoms released from a one-dimensional
optical lattice system in accord with our theoretical model. Our observations
are consistent with the theoretical results.
