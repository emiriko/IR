This paper proposes uni-orthogonal and bi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix
factorization algorithms with robust convergence proofs. We design the
algorithms based on the work of Lee and Seung [1], and derive the converged
versions by utilizing ideas from the work of Lin [2]. The experimental results
confirm the theoretical guarantees of the convergences.
