We present a comprehensive study of the vacancy in bulk silicon in all its
charge states from 2+ to 2-, using a supercell approach within plane-wave
density-functional theory, and systematically quantify the various
contributions to the well-known finite size errors associated with calculating
formation energies and stable charge state transition levels of isolated
defects with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that transition
levels converge faster with respect to supercell size when only the Gamma-point
is sampled in the Brillouin zone, as opposed to a dense k-point sampling. This
arises from the fact that defect level at the Gamma-point quickly converges to
a fixed value which correctly describes the bonding at the defect centre. Our
calculated transition levels with 1000-atom supercells and Gamma-point only
sampling are in good agreement with available experimental results. We also
demonstrate two simple and accurate approaches for calculating the valence band
offsets that are required for computing formation energies of charged defects,
one based on a potential averaging scheme and the other using
maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). Finally, we show that MLWFs
provide a clear description of the nature of the electronic bonding at the
defect centre that verifies the canonical Watkins model.
