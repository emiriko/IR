We consider the two matrix model with an even quartic potential
W(y)=y^4/4+alpha y^2/2 and an even polynomial potential V(x). The main result
of the paper is the formulation of a vector equilibrium problem for the
limiting mean density for the eigenvalues of one of the matrices M_1. The
vector equilibrium problem is defined for three measures, with external fields
on the first and third measures and an upper constraint on the second measure.
The proof is based on a steepest descent analysis of a 4 x 4 matrix valued
Riemann-Hilbert problem that characterizes the correlation kernel for the
eigenvalues of M_1. Our results generalize earlier results for the case
alpha=0, where the external field on the third measure was not present.
