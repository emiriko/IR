We analyzed the longest phase-connected photometric dataset available for NGC
1313 X-2, looking for the ~6 day modulation reported by Liu et al. (2009). The
folded B band light curve shows a 6 days periodicity with a significance
slightly larger than 3 sigma. The low statistical significance of this
modulation, along with the lack of detection in the V band, make its
identification uncertain.
