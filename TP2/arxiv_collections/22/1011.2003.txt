A hybrid Optical-Device (Phase-Conjugating Mirror Michelson Interferometer),
made up of Phase-conjugate mirror along with ordinary mirror and Polarization
Beam-splitter, is formally designed and investigated for the generation of an
unusual Optical-Polarization States. This weird yet 'essentially single-mode'
optical-polarization state has non-random 'ratio of amplitudes' and non-random
'sum of phases' in orthogonal bases-modes contrary to usual 'truly single-mode'
optical-polarization states of which non-random 'ratio of amplitudes' and
non-random 'difference of phases' serves as optical-polarization characteristic
parameters. Since it is seen not to be characterized by Stokes parameters, one
may, therefore, assign the name 'Hidden Optical-Polarization States (HOPS)'.
HOPS are characterized by a set of parameters, namely, Hidden
Optical-Polarization parameters. Formal experimental schemes are presented to
experimentally measure these parameters and, thus, offering characterization of
HOPS.
