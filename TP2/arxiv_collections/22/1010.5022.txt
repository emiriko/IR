We develop a layered quantum computer architecture, which is a systematic
framework for tackling the individual challenges of developing a quantum
computer while constructing a cohesive device design. We discuss many of the
prominent techniques for implementing circuit-model quantum computing and
introduce several new methods, with an emphasis on employing surface code
quantum error correction. In doing so, we propose a new quantum computer
architecture based on optical control of quantum dots. The timescales of
physical hardware operations and logical, error-corrected quantum gates differ
by several orders of magnitude. By dividing functionality into layers, we can
design and analyze subsystems independently, demonstrating the value of our
layered architectural approach. Using this concrete hardware platform, we
provide resource analysis for executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for
integer factoring and quantum simulation, finding that the quantum dot
architecture we study could solve such problems on the timescale of days.
