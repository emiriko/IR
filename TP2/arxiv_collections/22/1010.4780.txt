We study three sources of error in our calculation of $B_K$ using HYP-smeared
staggered fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices. These are (1) dependence on the
light sea quark mass; (2) finite volume effects; and (3) the impact of an order
of magnitude increase in the number of measurements. Our main results are (1)
the dependence on the light sea-quark mass is weaker than expected by naive
dimensional analysis, (2) including finite volume effects in SU(2) staggered
chiral perturbation theory fits leads to a very small change in $B_K$, of size
$\approx 0.1%$, and (3) increasing the statistics on one of the coarse MILC
lattices resolves a potential discrepancy with other coarse results.
