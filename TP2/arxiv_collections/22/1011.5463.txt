We compute the energy density at arbitrary temperature of the half plane
Ising lattice with a boundary magnetic field $H_b$ at a distance $M$ rows from
the boundary and compare limiting cases of the exact expression with recent
calculations at $T=T_c$ done by means of discrete complex analysis methods.
