Recent data from CREAM seem to confirm early suggestions that primary cosmic
ray (CR) spectra at few TeV/nucleon are harder than in the 10-100 GeV range.
Also, helium and heavier nuclei spectra appear systematically harder than the
proton fluxes at corresponding energies. We note here that if the measurements
reflect intrinsic features in the interstellar fluxes (as opposed to local
effects) appreciable modifications are expected in the sub-TeV range for the
secondary yields, such as antiprotons and diffuse gamma-rays. Presently, the
ignorance on the origin of the features represents a systematic error in the
extraction of astrophysical parameters as well as for background estimates for
indirect dark matter searches. We find that the spectral modifications are
appreciable above 100 GeV, and can be responsible for ~30% effects for
antiprotons at energies close to 1 TeV or for gamma's at energies close to 300
GeV, compared to currently considered predictions based on simple extrapolation
of input fluxes from low energy data. Alternatively, if the feature originates
from local sources, uncorrelated spectral changes might show up in antiproton
and high-energy gamma-rays, with the latter ones likely dependent from the
line-of-sight.
