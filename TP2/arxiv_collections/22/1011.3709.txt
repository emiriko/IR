The concept of proper time cannot be just taken over from classical theory
and applied to quantum theory. There are a number of serious ambiguities
related to it. Similarly, the concept of mass has some inconsistencies attached
to it. We argue that both of these concepts only make sense if they are
included in the theory as dynamical variables, and subsequently as conjugate
operators. We discuss the necessary uncertainty principle between them.
