The transient X-ray source XMMU J004215.8+411924 within M31 was found to be
in outburst again in the 2010 May 27 Chandra observation. We present results
from our four Chandra and seven Swift observations that covered this outburst.
X-ray transient behaviour is generally caused by one of two things: mass
accretion from a high mass companion during some restricted phase range in the
orbital cycle, or disc instability in a low mass system. We aim to exploit
Einstein, HST, Chandra and Swift observations to determine the nature of XMMU
J004215.8+411924. We model the 2010 May spectrum, and use the results to
convert from intensity to counts in the fainter Chandra observations, as well
as the Swift observations; these data are used to create a lightcurve. We also
estimate the flux in the 1979 January 13 Einstein observation. Additionally, we
search for an optical counterpart in HST data. Our best X-ray positions from
the 2006 and 2010 outbursts are 0.3" apart, and 1.6" from the Einstein source;
these outbursts are likely to come from the same star system. We see no
evidence for an optical counterpart with m_B < ~25.5; this new limit is 3.5
magnitudes fainter than the existing one. Furthermore, we see no V band
counterpart with m_V < ~26. The local absorption is ~7 times higher than the
Galactic line-of-sight, and provides ~2 magnitudes of extinction in the V band.
Hence M_V > ~ -0.5. Fits to the X-ray emission spectrum suggest a black hole
primary. We find that XMMU J004215.8+411924 is most likely to be a transient
LMXB, rather than a HMXB as originaly proposed. The nature of the primary is
unclear, although we argue that a black hole is likely.
