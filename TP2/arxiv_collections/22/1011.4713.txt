We present a Ramsey-type atom interferometer operating with an optically
trapped sample of 10^6 Bose-condensed Rb-87 atoms. The optical trap allows us
to couple the |F =1, mF =0>\rightarrow |F =2, mF =0> clock states using a
single photon 6.8GHz microwave transition, while state selective readout is
achieved with absorption imaging. Interference fringes with contrast
approaching 100% are observed for short evolution times. We analyse the process
of absorption imaging and show that it is possible to observe atom number
variance directly, with a signal-to-noise ratio ten times better than the
atomic projection noise limit on 10^6 condensate atoms. We discuss the
technical and fundamental noise sources that limit our current system, and
outline the improvements that can be made. Our results indicate that, with
further experimental refinements, it will be possible to produce and measure
the output of a sub-shot-noise limited, large atom number BEC-based
interferometer.
  In an addendum to the original paper, we attribute our inability to observe
quantum projection noise to the stability of our microwave oscillator and
background magnetic field. Numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equations for our system show that dephasing due to spatial dynamics driven by
interparticle interactions account for much of the observed decay in fringe
visibility at long interrogation times. The simulations show good agreement
with the experimental data when additional technical decoherence is accounted
for, and suggest that the clock states are indeed immiscible. With smaller
samples of 5 \times 10^4 atoms, we observe a coherence time of {\tau} =
(1.0+0.5-0.3) s.
