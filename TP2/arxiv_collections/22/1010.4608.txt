Quantum walks have emerged as an interesting candidate for the implementation
of quantum information processing protocols. Optical implementations of quantum
walks have been demonstrated by various groups and some have received
high-profile coverage. It is often claimed that quantum walks provide an avenue
towards universal quantum computation. In this comment I wish to dispel some
misconceptions surrounding the prospects of quantum walks as a route towards
universal optical quantum computation.
