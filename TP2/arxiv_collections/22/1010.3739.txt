We describe an experimental setup and the cooling procedure for producing 39K
Bose-Einstein condensates of over 4x10^5 atoms. Condensation is achieved via a
combination of sympathetic cooling with 87Rb in a
quadrupole-Ioffe-configuration (QUIC) magnetic trap, and direct evaporation in
a large volume crossed optical dipole trap, where we exploit the broad Feshbach
resonance at 402 G to tune the 39K interactions from weak and attractive to
strong and repulsive. In the same apparatus we create quasi-pure 87Rb
condensates of over 8x10^5 atoms.
