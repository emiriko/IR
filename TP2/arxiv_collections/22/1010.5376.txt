Context. There are more than 3000 true and probable known Galactic Planetary
Nebulae (PNe), but only for 13% of them there is central star spectroscopic
information available. Aims. To contribute to the knowledge of central stars of
planetary nebulae and star evolution. Methods. We undertook a spectroscopic
survey of central stars of PNe in low resolution and compiled a large list of
central stars for which information was dispersed in the literature. Results.
We complete a catalogue of 492 true and probable CSPN and we provide a
preliminary spectral classification for 45 central star of PNe, This made it
possible to update the proportion of CSPN with atmosphere poor in hydrogen with
regard to the whole in at least 30% and contribute with statistical information
that allow to infer the origin of H-poor stars.
