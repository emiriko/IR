Spectral clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for extracting
the underlying global structure of a data set. Compressed sensing and matrix
completion have emerged as prevailing methods for efficiently recovering sparse
and partially observed signals respectively. We combine the distance preserving
measurements of compressed sensing and matrix completion with the power of
robust spectral clustering. Our analysis provides rigorous bounds on how small
errors in the affinity matrix can affect the spectral coordinates and
clusterability. This work generalizes the current perturbation results of
two-class spectral clustering to incorporate multi-class clustering with k
eigenvectors. We thoroughly track how small perturbation from using compressed
sensing and matrix completion affect the affinity matrix and in succession the
spectral coordinates. These perturbation results for multi-class clustering
require an eigengap between the kth and (k+1)th eigenvalues of the affinity
matrix, which naturally occurs in data with k well-defined clusters. Our
theoretical guarantees are complemented with numerical results along with a
number of examples of the unsupervised organization and clustering of image
data.
