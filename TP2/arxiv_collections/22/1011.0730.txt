In a supersymmetric model with hierarchical squark masses we analyze a
pattern of flavour symmetry breaking centered on the special role of the top
Yukawa coupling and, by extension, of the full Yukawa couplings for the up-type
quarks. For sufficiently heavy squarks of the first and second generation this
leads to effective Minimal Flavour Violation of the Flavour Changing Neutral
Current amplitudes. For this to happen we determine the bounds on the masses of
the heavy squarks with QCD corrections taken into account, properly including
previously neglected effects. We believe that the view presented in this paper
altogether strengthens the case for hierarchical sfermions.
