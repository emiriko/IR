The purpose of this article is to introduce a new iterative algorithm with
properties resembling real life bipartite graphs. The algorithm enables us to
generate wide range of random bigraphs, which features are determined by a set
of parameters.We adapt the advances of last decade in unipartite complex
networks modeling to the bigraph setting. This data structure can be observed
in several situations. However, only a few datasets are freely available to
test the algorithms (e.g. community detection, influential nodes
identification, information retrieval) which operate on such data. Therefore,
artificial datasets are needed to enhance development and testing of the
algorithms. We are particularly interested in applying the generator to the
analysis of recommender systems. Therefore, we focus on two characteristics
that, besides simple statistics, are in our opinion responsible for the
performance of neighborhood based collaborative filtering algorithms. The
features are node degree distribution and local clustering coeficient.
