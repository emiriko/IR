We propose an engineered reservoir inducing the relaxation of a cavity field
towards non-classical states. It is made up of two-level atoms crossing the
cavity one at a time. Each atom-cavity interaction is first dispersive, then
resonant, then dispersive again. The reservoir pointer states are those
produced by an effective Kerr Hamiltonian acting on a coherent field. We
thereby stabilize squeezed states and quantum superpositions of multiple
coherent components in a cavity having a finite damping time. This robust
method could be implemented in state-of-the-art experiments and lead to
interesting insights into mesoscopic quantum state superpositions and into
their protection against decoherence.
