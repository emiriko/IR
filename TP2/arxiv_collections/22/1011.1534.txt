The possibility of Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) has attracted considerable
attention in recent years for a variety of reasons, including the attractive
prospect of the graviton as a Goldstone boson. Though a number of effective
field theory analyses of such phenomena have recently been given it remains an
open question whether they can take place in an underlying UV complete theory.
Here we consider the question of LSB in large N lattice gauge theories in the
strong coupling limit. We apply techniques that have previously been used to
correctly predict the formation of chiral symmetry breaking condensates in this
limit. Generalizing such methods to other composite operators we find that
certain LSB condensates can indeed form. In addition, the interesting
possibility arises of condensates that 'lock' internal with external
symmetries.
