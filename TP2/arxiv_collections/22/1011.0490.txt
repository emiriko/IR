In this paper, we survey five different computational modeling methods. For
comparison, we use the activation cycle of G-proteins that regulate cellular
signaling events downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a driving
example. Starting from an existing Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
model, we implement the G-protein cycle in the stochastic Pi-calculus using
SPiM, as Petri-nets using Cell Illustrator, in the Kappa Language using
Cellucidate, and in Bio-PEPA using the Bio-PEPA eclipse plug in. We also
provide a high-level notation to abstract away from communication primitives
that may be unfamiliar to the average biologist, and we show how to translate
high-level programs into stochastic Pi-calculus processes and chemical
reactions.
