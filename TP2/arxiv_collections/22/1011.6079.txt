We prove explicit congruences modulo powers of arbitrary primes for three
smallest parts functions: one for partitions, one for overpartitions, and one
for partitions without repeated odd parts. The proofs depend on $\ell$-adic
properties of certain modular forms and mock modular forms of weight $3/2$ with
respect to the Hecke operators $T(\ell^{2m})$.
