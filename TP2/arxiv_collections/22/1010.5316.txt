The Hilbert scheme of point modules was introduced by Artin-Tate-Van den
Bergh to study non-commutative graded algebras. The key tool is the
construction of a map from the algebra to a twisted ring on this Hilbert
scheme. In this paper, we study moduli stacks of more general "fat" point
modules, and show that there is a similar map to a twisted ring associated to
the stack. This is used to provide a sufficient criterion for a non-commutative
projective surface to be birationally PI. It is hoped that such a criterion
will be useful in understanding Mike Artin's conjecture on the birational
classification of non-commutative surfaces.
