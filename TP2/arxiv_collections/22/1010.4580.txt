To investigate the possible X(5) character of 122Ba, suggested by the ground
state band energy pattern, the lifetimes of the lowest yrast states of 122Ba
have been measured, via the Recoil Distance Doppler-Shift method. The relevant
levels have been populated by using the 108Cd(16O,2n)122Ba and the
112Sn(13C,3n)122Ba reactions. The B(E2) values deduced in the present work are
compared to the predictions of the X(5) model and to calculations performed in
the framework of the IBA-1 and IBA-2 models.
