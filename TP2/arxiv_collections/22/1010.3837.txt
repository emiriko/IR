Although developing countries are called to participate in CO2 emission
reduction efforts to avoid dangerous climate change, the implications of
proposed reduction schemes in human development standards of developing
countries remain a matter of debate. We show the existence of a positive and
time-dependent correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and per
capita CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Employing this empirical
relation, extrapolating the HDI, and using three population scenarios, the
cumulative CO2 emissions necessary for developing countries to achieve
particular HDI thresholds are assessed following a Development As Usual
approach (DAU). If current demographic and development trends are maintained,
we estimate that by 2050 around 85% of the world's population will live in
countries with high HDI (above 0.8). In particular, 300Gt of cumulative CO2
emissions between 2000 and 2050 are estimated to be necessary for the
development of 104 developing countries in the year 2000. This value represents
between 20% to 30% of previously calculated CO2 budgets limiting global warming
to 2{\deg}C. These constraints and results are incorporated into a CO2
reduction framework involving four domains of climate action for individual
countries. The framework reserves a fair emission path for developing countries
to proceed with their development by indexing country-dependent reduction rates
proportional to the HDI in order to preserve the 2{\deg}C target after a
particular development threshold is reached. Under this approach, global
cumulative emissions by 2050 are estimated to range from 850 up to 1100Gt of
CO2. These values are within the uncertainty range of emissions to limit global
temperatures to 2{\deg}C.
