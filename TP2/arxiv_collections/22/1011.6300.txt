A group of line drawings in recent reports made by physics students during
experimenting is investigated in order to describe the attitudes that can be
related to the act of drawing. These attitudes represent time behavior and are
related to how the experimenter basically perceives time. Also two concepts,
one of desire, by Levinas, and the concept of constitution, by Husserl, are
applied to describe two different notions of science. These notions are related
to the question where the focus of the experiment is on: in the case of field
work with responsibility for the infinite, and in the case of testing with
responsibility for the un-distracted given. At least for this investigated
group of drawings a meaningful correspondence can be shown to exist between the
attitudes of the act of drawing and these notions of science.
