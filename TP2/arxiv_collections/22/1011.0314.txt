A brief review of relativistic effects in few-body systems, of theoretical
approaches, recent developments and applications is given. Manifestations of
relativistic effects in the binding energies, in the electromagnetic form
factors and in three-body observables are demonstrated. The three-body forces
of relativistic origin are also discussed.
