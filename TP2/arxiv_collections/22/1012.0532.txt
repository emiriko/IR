Recently, it has been demonstrated that neutrinos in a supernova oscillate
collectively. This process occurs much deeper than the conventional
matter-induced MSW effect and hence may have an impact on nucleosynthesis. In
this paper we explore the effects of collective neutrino oscillations on the
r-process, using representative late-time neutrino spectra and outflow models.
We find that accurate modeling of the collective oscillations is essential for
this analysis. As an illustration, the often-used "single-angle" approximation
makes grossly inaccurate predictions for the yields in our setup. With the
proper multiangle treatment, the effect of the oscillations is found to be less
dramatic, but still significant. Since the oscillation patterns are sensitive
to the details of the emitted fluxes and the sign of the neutrino mass
hierarchy, so are the r-process yields. The magnitude of the effect also
depends sensitively on the astrophysical conditions - in particular on the
interplay between the time when nuclei begin to exist in significant numbers
and the time when the collective oscillation begins. A more definitive
understanding of the astrophysical conditions, and accurate modeling of the
collective oscillations for those conditions, is necessary.
