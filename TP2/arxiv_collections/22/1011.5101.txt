Resonant soft x-ray scattering experiments with photon energies near the O K
and the Cu L3 edge on the system La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 for 0.1 <= x <= 0.15 are
presented. A phase diagram for stripe-like charge ordering is obtained together
with information on the structural transition into the low-temperature
tetragonal phase. A clear dome for the charge ordering around x = 1/8 is
detected well below the structural transition. This result is quite different
from other systems in which static stripes are detected. There the charge order
is determined by the structural transition appearing at the same temperature.
Furthermore we present results for the coherence length and the
incommensurability of the stripe order as a function of Sr concentration.
