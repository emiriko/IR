The broadcast phase (downlink transmission) of the two-way relay network is
studied in the source coding and joint source-channel coding settings. The
rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for a number of
special cases including: small distortions, deterministic distortion measures,
and jointly Gaussian sources with quadratic distortion measures. The broadcast
problem is also studied with common-reconstruction decoding constraints, and
the rates needed for reliable communication are characterised for all discrete
memoryless sources and per-letter distortion measures.
