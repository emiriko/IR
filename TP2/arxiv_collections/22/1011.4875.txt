Various superconductors, including cuprate superconductors, exhibit peculiar
features above the transition temperature T_c. In particular the observation of
a large diamagnetism and Nernst signal in a wide temperature window above T_c
attracted considerable attention. Noting that this temperature window exceeds
the fluctuation dominated regime drastically and that in these materials the
spatial extent of homogeneity is limited, we explore the relevance of the zero
dimensional (0D)-model, neglecting thermal fluctuations. It is shown that both,
the full 0D-model as well as its Gaussian approximation, mimic the essential
features of the isothermal magnetization curves in Pb nanoparticles and various
cuprates remarkably well. This analysis also provides estimates for the spatial
extent of the homogeneous domains giving rise to a smeared transition in zero
magnetic field. The resulting estimates for the amplitude of the in-plane
correlation length exhibit a doping dependence reflecting the flow to the
quantum phase transition in the underdoped limit. Furthermore it is shown that
the isothermal Nernst signal of a superconducting Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) film is
fully consistent with this scenario. Accordingly, the observed diamagnetism
above T_c in Pb nanoparticles, in the cuprates La_(1.91)Sr_(0.09)CuO_4 and
BiSr_2Ca_2CuO_(8-d), as well as the Nernst signal in Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) films,
are all in excellent agreement with the scaling properties emerging from the
0D-model, giving a universal perspective on the interplay between diamagnetism,
Nernst signal, correlation length, and the limited spatial extent of
homogeneity. Our analysis also provides evidence that singlet Cooper pairs
subjected to orbital pair breaking in a 0D system are the main source of the
observed diamagnetism and Nernst signal in an extended temperature window above
T_c.
