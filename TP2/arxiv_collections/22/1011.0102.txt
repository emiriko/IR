We present the discovery of a cold massive dust disk around the T Tauri star
V1094 Sco in the Lupus molecular cloud from the 1.1 millimeter continuum
observations with AzTEC on ASTE. A compact ($r\lesssim$320 AU) continuum
emission coincides with the stellar position having a flux density of 272 mJy
which is largest among T Tauri stars in Lupus. We also present the detection of
molecular gas associated with the star in the five-point observations in
$^{12}$CO J=3--2 and $^{13}$CO J=3--2. Since our $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO
observations did not show any signature of a large-scale outflow or a massive
envelope, the compact dust emission is likely to come from a disk around the
star. The observed SED of V1094 Sco shows no distinct turnover from near
infrared to millimeter wavelengths, which can be well described by a flattened
disk for the dust component, and no clear dip feature around 10 $\micron$
suggestive of absence of an inner hole in the disk. We fit a simple power-law
disk model to the observed SED. The estimated disk mass ranges from 0.03 to
$\gtrsim$0.12 $M_\sun$, which is one or two orders of magnitude larger than the
median disk mass of T Tauri stars in Taurus.
