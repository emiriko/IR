We present a Chandra X-ray observation and VLA radio observations of the
nearby (z=0.11) galaxy cluster Abell 562 and the wide angle tail (WAT) radio
source 0647+693. The cluster displays signatures of an ongoing merger leading
to the bending of the WAT source including an elongation of the X-ray surface
brightness distribution along the line that bisects the WAT, an excess of
displaced gas found between the radio lobes, and anisotropies within the ICM
projected temperature and abundance distributions. The most likely geometry of
the ongoing interaction is a head-on merger occurring along the WAT bending
axis. By combining observable properties of A562 and 0647+693 with common
values for the conditions within merging clusters at the time of core crossing,
we constrain the internal density (rho[ j ] = 0.001 rho[ICM]) of the jets and
plasma flow velocity within the lobes (v = 0.02c - 0.03c) of the WAT source.
