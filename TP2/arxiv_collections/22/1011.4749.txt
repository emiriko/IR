It has recently been shown that infinite matroids can be axiomatized in a way
that is very similar to finite matroids and permits duality. This was
previously thought impossible, since finitary infinite matroids must have
non-finitary duals. In this paper we illustrate the new theory by exhibiting
its implications for the cycle and bond matroids of infinite graphs. We also
describe their algebraic cycle matroids, those whose circuits are the finite
cycles and double rays, and determine their duals. Finally, we give a
sufficient condition for a matroid to be representable in a sense adapted to
infinite matroids. Which graphic matroids are representable in this sense
remains an open question.
