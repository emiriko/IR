The uncertainty principle, which bounds the uncertainties involved in
obtaining precise outcomes for two complementary variables defining a quantum
particle, is a crucial aspect in quantum mechanics. Recently, the uncertainty
principle in terms of entropy has been extended to the case involving quantum
entanglement. With previously obtained quantum information for the particle of
interest, the outcomes of both non-commuting observables can be predicted
precisely, which greatly generalises the uncertainty relation. Here, we
experimentally investigated the entanglement-assisted entropic uncertainty
principle for an entirely optical setup. The uncertainty is shown to be near
zero in the presence of quasi-maximal entanglement. The new uncertainty
relation is further used to witness entanglement. The verified entropic
uncertainty relation provides an intriguing perspective in that it implies the
uncertainty principle is not only observable-dependent but is also
observer-dependent.
