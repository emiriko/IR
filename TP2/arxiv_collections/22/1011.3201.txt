As an "input" state of a linear (Mach-Zehnder or Ramsey) interferometer, the
phase-squeezed state proposed by Berry and Wiseman exhibits the best
sensitivity approaching to the Heisenberg limit [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5098
(2000)]. In this paper, we find that it can be generated dynamically with
atomic Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a symmetric double well. Similar
with the Berry and Wiseman's state, the prepared states show the squeezing
along spin operator S_y and the anti-squeezing along S_z, leading to a
sub-shot-noise of the phase sensitivity.
