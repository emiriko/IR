We have investigated the angular correlation in the recent CMB data. In
addition to the known large-angle correlation anomaly, we find the lack of
correlation at small angles with high statistical significance. We have
investigated various non-cosmological contamination and additionally WMAP
team's simulated data. However, we have not found a definite cause. In the
angular power spectrum of WMAP data, there exist anomalous odd-parity
preference at low multipoles. Noting the equivalence between the power spectrum
and the correlation, we have investigated the association between the lack of
large-angle correlation and the odd-parity preference. From our investigation,
we find that the odd-parity preference at low multipoles is, in fact, a
phenomenological origin of the lack of large-angle correlation. Futher
investigation is required to find out whether the origin of the anomaly is
cosmological or due to unaccounted systematics. The data from Planck surveyor,
which has systematics distinct from the WMAP, will greatly help us to resolve
its origin.
