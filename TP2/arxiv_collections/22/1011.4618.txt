A gauge-invariant, linear cosmological perturbation theory of an almost
homogeneous and isotropic universe with dynamically evolving Newton constant G
and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is presented. The equations governing the
evolution of the comoving fractional spatial gradients of the matter density, G
and $\Lambda$ are thus obtained. Explicit solutions are discussed in
cosmologies, featuring an accelerated expansion, where both G and $\Lambda$
vary according to renormalization group equations in the vicinity of an
ultraviolet fixed point. Finally, a similar analysis is carried out in the late
universe regime described by the part of the renormalization group trajectory
close to the gaussian fixed point.
