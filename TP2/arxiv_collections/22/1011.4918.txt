High-contrast near-infrared imaging of the nearby star HR 8799 has shown
three giant planets. Such images were possible due to the wide orbits (> 25 AU)
and youth (< 100 Myr) of the imaged planets, which are still hot and bright as
they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. A major
area of contention in the extrasolar planet community is whether outer planets
(> 10 AU) more massive than Jupiter form via one-step gravitational
instabilities or, rather, via a two-step process involving accretion of a core
followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of
hydrogen and helium. Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior
to and about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional
planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of
them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young
giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts, the HR 8799 planetary system is
a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at
wide > 10 AU separations.
