In the QCD analysis, when quarks are expressed in quaternion basis, the quark
and its charge conjugate together are expressed by octonions and the octonion
posesses the triality symmetry. Gluos are expressed by Pl\"ucker coordinates of
spinors. Roles of triality in the proton charge form factor, three loop gluon
self energy, technicolor, fine tuning and unparticle physics are discussed.
