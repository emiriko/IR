The mean fixation time of a deleterious mutant allele is studied beyond the
diffusion approximation. As in Kimura's classical work [M. Kimura, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. Vol.77, 522 (1980)], that was motivated by the problem of
fixation in the presence of amorphic or hypermorphic mutations, we consider a
diallelic model at a single locus comprising a wild-type A and a mutant allele
A' produced irreversibly from A at small uniform rate v. The relative fitnesses
of the mutant homozygotes A'A', mutant heterozygotes A'A and wild-type
homozygotes AA are 1-s, 1-h and 1, respectively, where it is assumed that v<<
s. Here, we adopt an approach based on the direct treatment of the underlying
Markov chain (birth-death process) obeyed by the allele frequency (whose
dynamics is prescribed by the Moran model), which allows to accurately account
for the effects of large fluctuations. After a general description of the
theory, we focus on the case of a deleterious mutant allele (i.e. s>0) and
discuss three situations: when the mutant is (i) completely dominant (s=h);
(ii) completely recessive (h=0), and (iii) semi-dominant (h=s/2). Our
theoretical predictions for the mean fixation time and the quasi-stationary
distribution of the mutant population in the coexistence state, are shown to be
in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore, when s is
finite, we demonstrate that our results are superior to those of the diffusion
theory that is shown to be an accurate approximation only when N_e s^2 << 1,
where N_e is the effective population size.
