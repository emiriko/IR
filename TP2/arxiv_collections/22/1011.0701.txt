Using gamma radiation and volumetric analysis of desorbed gas, hydrogen gas
bonding sites have been created and detected in select materials. Desorption of
hydrogen was followed over a benign temperature-pressure range. The extent of
active site formation depends on radiation dosage; quenching of sites occurs
over prolonged heating at low pressures. An estimate of the hydrogen bonding
energy can be made on the basis of a partial temperature profile of the gas
released at one atmosphere pressure. It appears that the bonding energy can be
adjusted by mixing candidate materials. A guide for further investigation and
application of the method is outlined.
