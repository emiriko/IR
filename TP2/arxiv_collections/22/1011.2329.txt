Properties of local Polyakov loops for SU(2) and SU(3) lattice gauge theory
at finite temperature are analyzed. We show that spatial clusters can be
identified where the local Polyakov loops have values close to the same center
element. For a suitable definition of these clusters the deconfinement
transition can be characterized by the onset of percolation in one of the
center sectors. The analysis is repeated for different resolution scales of the
lattice and we argue that the center clusters have a continuum limit.
