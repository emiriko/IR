A complex study of magnetic properties including dc magnetization, 1H NMR and
magnetic torque measurements has been performed for the organic conductor
kappa-(BETS)2Mn[N(CN)2]3 which undergoes a metal-insulator transition at
T_MI~25K. NMR and the magnetization data indicate a transition in the manganese
subsystem from paramagnetic to a frozen state at T_MI, which is, however, not a
simple Neel type order. Further, a magnetic field induced transition resembling
a spin flop has been detected in the torque measurements at temperatures below
T_MI. This transition is most likely related to the spins of pi-electrons
localized on the organic molecules BETS and coupled with the manganese 3d spins
via exchange interaction.
