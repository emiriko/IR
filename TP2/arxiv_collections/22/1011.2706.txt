A spectral action of Euclidean supergravity is proposed. We calculate up to
$a_4$, the Seeley-Dewitt coefficients in the expansion of the spectral action
associated to the supergravity Dirac operator. This is possible because in
simple supergravity, as in pure gravity, a well defined and mathematically
consistent Dirac operator can be constructed.
