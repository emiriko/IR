In this paper, we present an approach for fault-tolerant synthesis by
combining predefined patterns for fault-tolerance with algorithmic game
solving. A non-fault-tolerant system, together with the relevant fault
hypothesis and fault-tolerant mechanism templates in a pool are translated into
a distributed game, and we perform an incomplete search of strategies to cope
with undecidability. The result of the game is translated back to executable
code concretizing fault-tolerant mechanisms using constraint solving. The
overall approach is implemented to a prototype tool chain and is illustrated
using examples.
