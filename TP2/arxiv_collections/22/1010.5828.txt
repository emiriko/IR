The remarkable properties of silicon have made it the central material for
the fabrication of current microelectronic devices. Silicon's fundamental
properties also make it an attractive option for the development of devices for
spintronics and quantum information processing. The ability to manipulate and
measure spins of single electrons is crucial for these applications. Here we
report the manipulation and measurement of a single spin in a quantum dot
fabricated in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure. We demonstrate that
the rate of loading of electrons into the device can be tuned over an order of
magnitude using a gate voltage, that the spin state of the loaded electron
depends systematically on the loading voltage level, and that this tunability
arises because electron spins can be loaded through excited orbital states of
the quantum dot. The longitudinal spin relaxation time T1 is measured using
single-shot pulsed techniques and found to be ~3 seconds at a field of 1.85
Tesla. The demonstration of single spin measurement as well as a long spin
relaxation time and tunability of the loading are all favorable properties for
spintronics and quantum information processing applications.
