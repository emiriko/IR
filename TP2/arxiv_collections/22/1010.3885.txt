The Poincare-Hopf theorem states that a globally smooth tangent vector does
not exist on a manifold whose Euler characteristic is non-zero. Nevertheless,
when one defines a differential equation on such a manifold, this theorem is
always ignored. For example, the differential formulation of Schrodinger
equation is defined as a form so that a tangent vector is a product of
Hamiltonian and state vector. In this case, if the Hamiltonian and the state
vector are both globally smooth functions on parameter space, then the tangent
vector will be compelled to become smooth so that the Euler characteristic of
the parameter space must be zero. As a result, some Berry phases related to
non-zero Euler characteristic will be ruled out.
