From the analytic oscillation probability for high energy atmospheric
neutrinos in the presence of new physics in propagation, it is argued that the
components $|\epsilon_{e\mu}|$ and $|\epsilon_{\mu\tau}|$ as well as the
quantity $|\epsilon_{\tau\tau}-|\epsilon_{e\tau}|^2/(1+\epsilon_{ee})|$ should
be small.
