Given a birth-death process on $\mathbb {N}$ with semigroup $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$
and a discrete gradient ${\partial}_u$ depending on a positive weight $u$, we
establish intertwining relations of the form
${\partial}_uP_t=Q_t\,{\partial}_u$, where $(Q_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the Feynman-Kac
semigroup with potential $V_u$ of another birth-death process. We provide
applications when $V_u$ is nonnegative and uniformly bounded from below,
including Lipschitz contraction and Wasserstein curvature, various functional
inequalities, and stochastic orderings. Our analysis is naturally connected to
the previous works of Caputo-Dai Pra-Posta and of Chen on birth-death
processes. The proofs are remarkably simple and rely on interpolation,
commutation, and convexity.
