The total embedding distributions of a graph is consisted of the orientable
embeddings and non- orientable embeddings and have been know for few classes of
graphs. The genus distribution of Ringel ladders is determined in [Discrete
Mathematics 216 (2000) 235-252] by E.H. Tesar. In this paper, the explicit
formula for non-orientable embeddings of Ringel ladders is obtained.
