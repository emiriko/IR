Results from first measurements of charged particle differential elliptic
flow, obtained in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV with the ALICE
detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are compared to those obtained
for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 0.2$ TeV with the PHENIX detector at
BNL's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The comparisons, made as a
function of centrality (cent) or the number of participant pairs
($N_{\text{part}}$) and particle transverse momentum $p_T$, indicate an
excellent agreement between the magnitude and trends for the flow coefficients
${v_2(p_T,\text{cent})}$. Analysis indicates that the averaged specific
viscosity of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in LHC collisions, is
similar to that for the strongly coupled QGP produced in RHIC collisions.
