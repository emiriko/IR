We propose a new type of attack on Ekert protocol in which, rather
surprisingly, Eve drives a violation of Bell inequalities in Alice's and Bob's
detectors with a mixture of separable states. She does so by sending correlated
pulses containing several photons at frequencies where only multiple-photon
absorptions are possible in their detectors. Whenever the photons stemming from
a same pulse are dispatched in such a way that the number of photons is
insufficient to trigger a multiple-photon absorption in either channel, the
pulse remains undetected. We show that this simple feature leads to violations
of Bell inequalities that can match closely those predicted for entangled
states, even in the simplest cases of two-photon and three-photon absorptions.
