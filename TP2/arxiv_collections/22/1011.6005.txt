Analytical and numerical solutions are obtained for the equation of radiative
transfer in ultra-relativistic opaque jets. The solution describes the initial
trapping of radiation, its adiabatic cooling, and the transition to
transparency. Two opposite regimes are examined: (1) Matter-dominated outflow.
Surprisingly, radiation develops enormous anisotropy in the fluid frame before
decoupling from the fluid. The radiation is strongly polarized. (2)
Radiation-dominated outflow. The transfer occurs as if radiation propagated in
vacuum, preserving the angular distribution and the blackbody shape of the
spectrum. The escaping radiation has a blackbody spectrum if (and only if) the
outflow energy is dominated by radiation up to the photospheric radius.
