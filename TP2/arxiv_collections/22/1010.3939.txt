The aim of the paper is to propose another tool for phenomenological analyses
of experimental data from superallowed nuclear and neutron $\beta$ decays, and
from leptonic and semileptonic decays, that allows the finding of the most
probable numerical form of the CKM matrix, as well as the determination of
decay constants, $f_{P}$, and of various form factors $f_+(q^2)$, by using
another implementation of unitarity constraints. In particular this approach
allows the determination of semileptonic form factors that is illustrated on
the existing data from $D\rightarrow \pi l \nu$ and $D\rightarrow K l\nu$
decays.
