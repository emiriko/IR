We look at the new two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation (BEC) function
accompanied by the color-electric flux model which can explain the "ridge"
behavior in enhanced angular correlation between two identical pions at very
broad rapidity with high multiplicity. We argue that such an investigation
could probe both the size and the temperature of the source of two pions
emitted into a narrow range of azimuthal angles. We can confirm the ev- idence
for quark-gluon phase due to interaction of outgoing pions (having high
transverse momenta) with the medium in thermal bath in proton-proton
collisions.
