Zonotopal algebra deals with ideals and vector spaces of polynomials that are
related to several combinatorial and geometric structures defined by a finite
sequence of vectors. Given such a sequence X, an integer k>=-1 and an upper set
in the lattice of flats of the matroid defined by X, we define and study the
associated hierarchical zonotopal power ideal. This ideal is generated by
powers of linear forms. Its Hilbert series depends only on the matroid
structure of X. Via the Tutte polynomial, it is related to various other
matroid invariants, e.g. the shelling polynomial and the characteristic
polynomial.
  This work unifies and generalizes results by Ardila-Postnikov on power ideals
and by Holtz-Ron and Holtz-Ron-Xu on (hierarchical) zonotopal algebra. We also
generalize a result on zonotopal Cox modules that were introduced by
Sturmfels-Xu.
