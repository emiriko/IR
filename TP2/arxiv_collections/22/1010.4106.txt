Three transiting exoplanet candidate stars were discovered in a ground-based
photometric survey prior to the launch of NASA's {\it Kepler} mission. {\it
Kepler} observations of them were obtained during Quarter 1 of the {\it Kepler}
mission. All three stars are faint by radial velocity follow-up standards, so
we have examined these candidates with regard to eliminating false positives
and providing high confidence exoplanet selection. We present a first attempt
to exclude false positives for this set of faint stars without high resolution
radial velocity analysis. This method of exoplanet confirmation will form a
large part of the {\it Kepler} mission follow-up for Jupiter-sized exoplanet
candidates orbiting faint stars. Using the {\it Kepler} light curves and pixel
data, as well as medium resolution reconnaissance spectroscopy and speckle
imaging, we find that two of our candidates are binary stars. One consists of a
late-F star with an early M companion while the other is a K0 star plus a late
M-dwarf/brown dwarf in a 19-day elliptical orbit. The third candidate (BOKS-1)
is a $r$=15 G8V star hosting a newly discovered exoplanet with a radius of 1.12
R$_{Jupiter}$ in a 3.9 day orbit.
