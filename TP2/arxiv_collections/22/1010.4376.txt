(Abridged) High redshift galaxies are undergoing intensive evolution of
dynamical structure and morphologies. We incorporate the feedback into the
dynamical equations through mass dropout and angular momentum transportation
driven by the SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity. We numerically solve the
equations and show that there can be intensive evolution of structure of the
gaseous disk. Secular evolution of the disk shows interesting characteristics
that are 1) high viscosity excited by SNexp can efficiently transport the gas
from 10kpc to $\sim 1$kpc forming a stellar disk whereas a stellar ring forms
for the case with low viscosity; 2) starbursts trigger SMBH activity with a lag
$\sim 10^8$yr depending on star formation rates, prompting the joint evolution
of SMBHs and bulges; 3) the velocity dispersion is as high as $\sim 100~\kms$
in the gaseous disk. In order to compare the present models with the observed
dynamical structure and images, we use the incident continuum from the simple
stellar synthesis (GALAXEV) and CLOUDY to calculate emission line ratios of
H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, $\OIII$ and $\NII$, and H$\alpha$ brightness of gas
photoionized by young massive stars formed on the disks. The models can produce
the main features of emission from star forming galaxies and the observed
relation between turbulent velocity and the H$\alpha$ brightness. We
successfully apply the present model to BX 389 and BX 482 observed in SINS
high$-z$ sample, which are bulge and disk-dominated, respectively. High
viscosity excited by SNexp is able to efficiently transport the gas into a
bulge to maintain high star formation rates, or, to form a stellar ring close
enough to the bulge so that it immigrates into the bulge of its host galaxy.
This leads to a fast growing bulge. Implications and future work of the present
models have been extensively discussed for galaxy formation.
