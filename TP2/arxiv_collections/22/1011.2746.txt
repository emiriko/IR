The Sloan Digital Sky Survey III/Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (SDSS-III/APOGEE) is a large-scale spectroscopic survey of Galactic
stars and star clusters. The SDSS-III/APOGEE survey is designed to produce
high-S/N, R = 27,500-31,000 spectra that cover a wavelength range of 1.51 to
1.68 microns. By utilizing APOGEE's excellent kinematics (error <= 0.5 km/s)
and abundances (errors ~ 0.1 dex), we will be able to study star cluster
kinematics and chemical properties in detail. Over the course of the 3-year
survey beginning in 2011, APOGEE will target 25-30 key open and globular
clusters. In addition, the large area coverage of the SDSS focal plane will
also allow us to target stars in 100-200 additional star clusters during the
main survey observations. We present the strength of APOGEE for both open and
globular star cluster studies and the methods of identifying probable clusters
members utilizing 2MASS and IRAC/WISE data.
