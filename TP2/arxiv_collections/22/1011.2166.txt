We present an update of our calculation of the form factor for B -> D* l nu
at zero recoil, with higher statistics and finer lattices. As before, we use
the Fermilab action for b and c quarks, the asqtad staggered action for light
valence quarks, and the MILC ensembles for gluons and light quarks
(L\"uscher-Weisz married to 2+1 rooted staggered sea quarks). In this update,
we have reduced the total uncertainty on F(1) from 2.6% to 1.7%.
  At Lattice2010 we presented a still-blinded result, but this writeup includes
the unblinded result from the September 2010 CKM workshop.
