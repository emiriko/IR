We study the nonperturbative gluon and ghost propagators in d=3 Yang-Mills,
using the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the pinch technique. The use of the
Schwinger mechanism leads to the dynamical generation of a gluon mass, which,
in turn, gives rise to an infrared finite gluon propagator and ghost dressing
function. The propagators obtained are in very good agreement with the results
of SU(2) lattice simulations.
