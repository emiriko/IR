This paper describes a mobile health monitoring system called iCare for the
elderly. We use wireless body sensors and smart phones to monitor the wellbeing
of the elderly. It can offer remote monitoring for the elderly anytime anywhere
and provide tailored services for each person based on their personal health
condition. When detecting an emergency, the smart phone will automatically
alert pre-assigned people who could be the old people's family and friends, and
call the ambulance of the emergency centre. It also acts as the personal health
information system and the medical guidance which offers one communication
platform and the medical knowledge database so that the family and friends of
the served people can cooperate with doctors to take care of him/her. The
system also features some unique functions that cater to the living demands of
the elderly, including regular reminder, quick alarm, medical guidance, etc.
iCare is not only a real-time health monitoring system for the elderly, but
also a living assistant which can make their lives more convenient and
comfortable.
