We suppose and develop a simple quantitative model of polymer film
conductivity. This model can be seen as a further development of the ideas of
Vlasov, Apresyan et al. The main point of the model is that conducting islands
exist, and the charge transfer between the islands is carried out by mobile
segments of polymer molecules. This model quantitatively describes the presence
of two states of conductivity, and the current stabilization phenomena, and it
predicts the temperature dependence of conductivity, and the dependence of
conductivity on the thickness of the polymer film. The pressure-driven
transition to high-conductivity is described only qualitatively in this model.
