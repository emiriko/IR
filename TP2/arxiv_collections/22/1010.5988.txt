This paper shows as the relativistic Doppler effect can be extended also to
time and space associated to moving bodies. This extension derives from the
analysis of the wave-fronts of the light emitted by a moving source in inertial
motion in the empty space, as viewed from the stationary reference. Indeed,
time and space can be represented by the same vector quantities, which appear
asymmetrical in forward and back direction along the path of the moving body.
Consequently, the whole size of the moving bodies dilates along the direction
of their motion, as their path. Thought experiments and real facts demonstrate
this issue.
