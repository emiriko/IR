We studied the magnetization reversal rates of thermally assisted spin
transfer torque switching in a ferromagnetically coupled synthetic free layer
theoretically. By solving the Fokker-Planck equation, we obtained the
analytical expression of the switching probability for both the weak and the
strong coupling limit. We found that the thermal stability is proportional to
Delta_{0}(1-I/I_{c})^{2}, not Delta_{0}(1-I/I_{c}) argued by Koch et al. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 92, 088302 (2004)], where I and I_{c} are the electric current and
the critical current of spin transfer torque switching at absolute zero
temperature. The difference in the exponent of (1-I/I_{c}) leads to a
significant underestimation of the thermal stability Delta_{0}. We also found
that fast switching is achieved by choosing the appropriate direction of the
applied field.
