A systematic replica field theory calculations are analysed using the
examples of two particular one-dimensional "toy" random models with Gaussian
disorder. Due to apparent simplicity of the model the replica trick
calculations can be followed here step by step from the very beginning till the
very end. In this way it can be easily demonstrated that formally at certain
stage of the calculations the implementation of the standard replica program is
just impossible. On the other hand, following the usual "doublethink"
traditions of the replica calculations (i.e. closing eyes on the fact that
certain suggestions used in the calculations contradict to each other) one can
easily fulfil the programme till the very end to obtain physically sensible
result for the entire free energy distribution function.
