We report on the study of the linear and circular magneto-gyrotropic
photogalvanic effect (MPGE) in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well structures. Using the
fact that in such structures the Land\'e-factor g* depends on the quantum well
(QW) width and has different signs for narrow and wide QWs, we succeeded to
separate spin and orbital contributions to both MPGEs. Our experiments show
that, for most quantum well widths, the PGEs are mainly driven by spin-related
mechanisms, which results in a photocurrent proportional to the g* factor. In
structures with a vanishingly small g* factor, however, linear and circular
MPGE are also detected, proving the existence of orbital mechanisms.
