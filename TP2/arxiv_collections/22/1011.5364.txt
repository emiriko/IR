We want to find the optimal strategy for displaying advertisements e.g.
banners, videos, in given locations at given times under some realistic dynamic
constraints. Our primary goal is to maximize the expected revenue in a given
period of time, i.e. the total profit produced by the impressions, which
depends on profit-generating events such as the impressions themselves, the
ensuing clicks and registrations. Moreover we must take into consideration the
possibility that the constraints could change in time in a way that cannot
always be foreseen.
