We report in this paper the proofs that the pulse shape analysis can be used
in some bolometers to identify the nature of the interacting particle. Indeed,
while detailed analyses of the signal time development in purely thermal
detectors have not produced so far interesting results, similar analyses on
bolometers built with scintillating crystals seem to show that it is possible
to distinguish between an electron or gamma-ray and an alpha particle
interaction. This information can be used to eliminate background events from
the recorded data in many rare process studies, especially Neutrinoless Double
Beta decay search. Results of pulse shape analysis of signals from a number of
bolometers with absorbers of different composition (CaMoO4, ZnMoO4, MgMoO4 and
ZnSe) are presented and the pulse shape discrimination capability of such
detectors is discussed.
