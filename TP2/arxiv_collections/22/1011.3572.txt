Using a high-statistics, high-purity sample of $\nu_\mu$-induced charged
current, charged pion events in mineral oil (CH$_2$), MiniBooNE reports a
collection of interaction cross sections for this process. This includes
measurements of the CC$\pi^+$ cross section as a function of neutrino energy,
as well as flux-averaged single- and double-differential cross sections of the
energy and direction of both the final-state muon and pion. In addition, each
of the single-differential cross sections are extracted as a function of
neutrino energy to decouple the shape of the MiniBooNE energy spectrum from the
results. In many cases, these cross sections are the first time such quantities
have been measured on a nuclear target and in the 1 GeV energy range.
