We present magnetoresistance measurements on large scale monolayer graphene
grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper. The graphene layer was
transferred onto SiO2/Si via PMMA and thermal release tape for transport
measurements. The resulting centimeter-sized graphene samples were measured at
temperatures down to 30mK in a magnetic field. We observe a very sharp peak in
resistance at zero field, which is well fitted by weak localization theory. The
samples exhibit conductance fluctuations symmetric in field, which are
attributed to ensemble averaged conductance fluctuations due to large scale
inhomogeneities consistent with the grain boundaries of copper during the CVD
growth.
