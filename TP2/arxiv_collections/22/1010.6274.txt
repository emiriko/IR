The process of $e^+e^-$ production in the superposition of a Coulomb and a
strong laser field is considered. The pair production rate integrated over the
momentum and summed over the spin projections of one of the particles is
derived exactly in the parameters of the laser field and in the Born
approximation with respect to the Coulomb field. The case of a monochromatic
circularly polarized laser field is considered in detail. A very compact
analytical expression of the pair production rate and its dependence on the
polarization of one of the created particles is obtained in the quasiclassical
approximation for the experimentally relevant case of an undercritical laser
field. As a result, the polarization of the created electron (positron) is
derived.
