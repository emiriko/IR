We study the tuning mechanisms of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
exchange interaction between two lateral quantum dots in the Kondo regime. At
zero magnetic field we observe the expected splitting of the Kondo resonance
and measure the RKKY interaction strength J as a function of the asymmetry
between the two Kondo temperatures. At finite magnetic fields a chiral coupling
between the quantum dots is observed in the Kondo chessboard and we probe the
presence of the exchange interaction by analyzing the Kondo temperature with
magnetic field.
