Kinsler and Favaro point out correctly that Blaikie's numerical solution of
Maxwell's equations in Maxwell's fish eye is causal and hence valid, a solution
where no perfect image is formed. It is wrong to conclude from the existence of
a causal solution with perfect imaging that one without perfect resolution is
not causal; both are allowed by causality. However, Maxwell's fish eye can
still perfectly image, as the Reply shows.
