We investigate the nature of the pulse sequence so that unwanted transitions
in quantum systems can be inhibited optimally. For this purpose we show that
the sequence of pulses proposed by Uhrig [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 100504
(2007)] in the context of inhibition of environmental dephasing effects is
optimal. We derive exact results for inhibiting the transitions and confirm the
results numerically. We posit a very significant improvement by usage of the
Uhrig sequence over an equidistant sequence in decoupling a quantum system from
unwanted transitions. The physics of inhibition is the destructive interference
between transition amplitudes before and after each pulse.
