We consider complete asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds that are the
graphs of smooth functions over $\mathbb R^n$. By recognizing the scalar
curvature of such manifolds as a divergence, we express the ADM mass as an
integral of the product of the scalar curvature and a nonnegative potential
function, thus proving the Riemannian positive mass theorem in this case. If
the graph has convex horizons, we also prove the Riemannian Penrose inequality
by giving a lower bound to the boundary integrals using the Aleksandrov-Fenchel
inequality.
