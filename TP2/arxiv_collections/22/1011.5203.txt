A holy grail of photonics research is the realization of a laser that uses a
single quantum emitter as the gain medium. Such a device would exhibit a
plethora of new features, including lasing without a well-defined threshold and
output intensity fluctuations that remain below the shot-noise limit. While
single-atom lasers have been demonstrated, compact devices capable of
continuous-wave operation require monolithic structures involving a solid-state
quantum emitter. Here, we report the observation of steady-state laser
amplification in Raman transitions between the lowest-energy entangled spin
states of a quantum-dot molecule. Absorption and resonance fluorescence
experiments demonstrate that the singlet and triplet states have
electric-dipole coupling to a common optically excited state. Fast spin
relaxation ensures population inversion on the triplet transition when the
singlet transition is driven resonantly. By embedding the quantum-dot molecule
in a cavity of modest quality factor, a solid-state single-emitter laser could
be realized.
