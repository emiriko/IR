With growing datasets collected by the CDF II experiment, studies of the
spectroscopy of mesons containing heavy quarks become more exciting. The CDF
experiment has good capabilities in both charm and bottom sector. This
capability allowed also to contribute to the study of the zoo of states called
X,Y,Z. In this area we present a recent update of the mass measurement of
X(3872). The result m(X(3872)) = 3871.61 +- 0.16 +- 0.19 MeV is currently the
most precise measurement in the world. In addition, we report evidence for a
new narrow resonance, Y(4140), the first to be seen in the J/psi phi decay
mode, using 2.7 invfb of exclusive B+ to J/psi phi K+ decays.
