We demonstrate single electron addition to different strands of a carbon
nanotube rope. Anticrossings of anomalous conductance peaks occur in quantum
transport measurements through the parallel quantum dots forming on the
individual strands. We determine the magnitude and the sign of the
hybridization as well as the Coulomb interaction between the carbon nanotube
quantum dots, finding that the bonding states dominate the transport. In a
magnetic field the hybridization is shown to be selectively suppressed due to
spin effects.
