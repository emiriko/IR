We studied the principal parameters of some previously unstudied open star
clusters using the JHK Near-IR photometry (2MASS survey). These clusters have
been selected from the updated Catalogs of Dais and Webda. Based on the 2MASS
database and the DSS visual images, some homogeneous methods and algorithms
have been applied. The astrometry and photometric principal parameters are
determined for the first time.
