In this thesis, we give a unification of the quantum WRT invariants. Given a
rational homology 3-sphere M and a link L inside, we define the unified
invariants, such that the evaluation of these invariants at a root of unity
equals the corresponding quantum WRT invariant. In the SU(2) case, we assume
the order of the first homology group of the manifold to be odd. Therefore, for
rational homology 3-spheres, our invariants dominate the whole set of SO(3)
quantum WRT invariants and, for manifolds with the order of the first homology
group odd, the whole set of SU(2) quantum WRT invariants. We further show, that
the unified invariants have a strong integrality property.
