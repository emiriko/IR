We present an overview over the current status of laboratory experiments
searching for (very) weakly coupled slim particles (WISPs). These experiments
at the high precision frontier explore new physics beyond the standard model in
a complementary way to high energy accelerators. The multitude of active and
planned experiments shows a lively field and promises interesting new data in
the near future.
