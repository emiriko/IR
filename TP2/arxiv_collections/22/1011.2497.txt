For a quantum computer acting on d-dimensional systems, we analyze the
computational power of circuits wherein stabilizer operations are perfect and
we allow access to imperfect non-stabilizer states or operations. If the noise
rate affecting the non-stabilizer resource is sufficiently high, then these
states and operations can become simulable in the sense of the Gottesman-Knill
theorem, reducing the overall power of the circuit to no better than classical.
In this paper we find the depolarizing noise rate at which this happens, and
consequently the most robust non-stabilizer states and non-Clifford gates. In
doing so, we make use of the discrete Wigner function and derive facets of the
so-called qudit Clifford polytope i.e. the inequalities defining the convex
hull of all qudit Clifford gates. Our results for robust states are provably
optimal. For robust gates we find a critical noise rate that, as dimension
increases, rapidly approaches the the theoretical optimum of 100%. Some
connections with the question of qudit magic state distillation are discussed.
