We study Andreev bound state (ABS) and surface density of state (SDOS) of
non-centrosymmetric superconductor where spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing mixes
with spin-triplet $p$ (or $f)$-wave one by spin-orbit coupling. For $d_{xy} +
p$-wave pairing, ABS appears as a zero energy state. The present ABS is a
Majorana edge mode preserving the time reversal symmetry. We calculate
topological invariant number and discuss the relevance to a single Majorana
edge mode. In the presence of the Majorana edge mode, the SDOS depends strongly
on the direction of the Zeeman field.
