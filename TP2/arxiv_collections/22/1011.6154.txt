The Hyperspherical Harmonics basis, without a previous symmetrization step,
is used to calculate binding energies of the nuclear A=6 systems using a
version of the Volkov potential acting only on s-wave. The aim of this work is
to illustrate the use of the nonsymmetrized basis to deal with
permutational-symmetry-breaking term in the Hamiltonian, in the present case
the Coulomb interaction.
