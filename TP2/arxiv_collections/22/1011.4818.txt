CaBaFe4O7 is a mixed-valent transition metal oxide having both Fe2+ and Fe3+
ions in tetrahedral coordination. Here we characterize its magnetic properties
by magnetization measurements and investigate its local electronic structure
using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe L2,3 edges, in combination
with multiplet cluster and spin-resolved band structure calculations. We found
that the Fe2+ ion in the unusual tetrahedral coordination is Jahn-Teller active
with the high-spin e^2 (up) t2^3 (up) e^1 (down) configuration having a
x^2-y^2-like electron for the minority spin. We deduce that there is an
appreciable orbital moment of about L_z=0.36 caused by multiplet interactions,
thereby explaining the observed magnetic anisotropy. CaBaFe4O7, a member of the
'114' oxide family, offers new opportunities to explore charge, orbital and
spin physics in transition metal oxides.
