We use the General Boundary Formulation (GBF) of Quantum Field Theory to
compute the S-matrix for a general interacting scalar field in a wide class of
curved spacetimes. As a by-product we obtain the general expression of the
Feynman propagator for the scalar field, defined in the following three types
of spacetime regions. First, there are the familiar interval regions (e.g.~a
time interval times all of space). Second, we consider the rod hypercylinder
regions (all of time times a solid ball in space). Third, the tube
hypercylinders (all of time times a solid shell in space) are related to
interval regions, and result from removing a smaller rod from a concentric
larger one. Using the Schr\"odinger representation for the quantum states
combined with Feynman's path integral quantization, we obtain the S-matrix as
the asymptotic limit of the GBF amplitude associated with finite interval and
rod regions. For interval regions, whose boundary consists of two Cauchy
surfaces, the asymptotic GBF-amplitude becomes the standard S-matrix. Our work
generalizes previous results (obtained in Minkowski, Rindler, de Sitter, and
Anti de Sitter spacetimes) to a wide class of curved spacetimes.
