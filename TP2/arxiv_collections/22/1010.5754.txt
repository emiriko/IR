In this article we report on the properties of thin films of the full Heusler
compound Co2TiSn prepared by DC magnetron co-sputtering. Fully epitaxial,
stoichiometric films were obtained by deposition on MgO (001) substrates at
substrate temperatures above 600{\deg}C. The films are well ordered in the L21
structure, and the Curie temperature exceeds slightly the bulk value. They show
a significant, isotropic magnetoresistance and the resistivity becomes strongly
anomalous in the paramagnetic state. The films are weakly ferrimagnetic, with
nearly 1 \mu_B on the Co atoms, and a small antiparallel Ti moment, in
agreement with theoretical expectations. From comparison of x-ray absorption
spectra on the Co L3/L2 edges, including circular and linear magnetic
dichroism, with ab initio calculations of the x-ray absorption and circular
dichroism spectra we infer that the electronic structure of Co2TiSn has
essentially non-localized character. Spectral features that have not been
explained in detail before, are explained here in terms of the final state band
structure.
