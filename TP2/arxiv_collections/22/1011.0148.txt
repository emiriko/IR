Two very fast and simple O(lg n) algorithms for individual Fibonacci numbers
are given and compared to competing algorithms. A simple O(lg n) recursion is
derived that can also be applied to Lucas. A formula is given to estimate the
largest n, where F_n does not overflow the implementation's data type. The
danger of timing runs on input that is too large for the computer
representation leads to false research results.
