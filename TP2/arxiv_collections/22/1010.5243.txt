Based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, Q2122-444 has been
classified as a naked AGN or true type 2 AGN, that is, an AGN that genuinely
lacks a broad line region (BLR). Its optical spectrum seemed to possess only
narrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) AGNs, but
the long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign over
more than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out the
presence of heavy obscuration. Here, we present the results from a ~40 ks
XMM-Newton observation of Q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energetics
of this enigmatic AGN. The X-ray analysis was complemented with ATCA radio data
to assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new NTT/EFOSC2 optical
spectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a BLR. The higher-quality
optical data revealed the presence of strong and broad Balmer lines that are at
odds with the previous spectral classification of this AGN. The lack of
detection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. The X-ray data
combined with simultaneous UV observations carried out by the OM aboard
XMM-Newton confirm that Q2122-444 is a typical type-1 AGN without any
significant intrinsic absorption. New estimates of the black hole mass
independently obtained from the broad Balmer lines and from a new scaling
technique based on X-ray spectral data suggest that Q2122-444 is accreting at a
relatively high rate in Eddington units.
